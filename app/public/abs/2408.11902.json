We show that the\noptimal fidelity of deterministic port-based teleportation (dPBT) using $N=n+1$\nports to teleport a $d$-dimensional state is equivalent to the optimal fidelity\nof $d$-dimensional unitary estimation using $n$ calls of the input unitary\noperation. From any given dPBT, we can explicitly construct the corresponding\nunitary estimation protocol achieving the same optimal fidelity, and vice\nversa. Using the obtained one-to-one correspondence between dPBT and unitary\nestimation, we derive the asymptotic optimal fidelity of port-based\nteleportation given by $F = 1-\\Theta(d^4 N^{-2})$, which improves the\npreviously known result given by $1-O(d^5 N^{-2}) \\leq F \\leq 1-\\Omega(d^2\nN^{-2})$. We also show that the optimal fidelity of unitary estimation for the\ncase $n\\leq d-1$ is $F = {n+1 \\over d^2}$, and this fidelity is equal to the\noptimal fidelity of unitary inversion with $n\\leq d-1$ calls of the input\nunitary operation even if we allow indefinite causal order among the calls.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
