Our\nresults indicate that some $\\lambda-$mode $\\Xi_{cc/bb}(1P)$ and\n$\\Omega_{cc/bb}(1P)$ states are relatively narrow, which are very likely to be\ndiscovered by future experiments. The light meson emissions for the low-lying\n$\\rho-$mode states are highly suppressed due to the orthogonality of wave\nfunctions between initial and final states. Moreover, the strong decay\nbehaviors for doubly charmed and bottom baryons preserve the heavy superflavor\nsymmetry well, where the small violation originates from the finite heavy quark\nmasses and different phase spaces. We hope that present theoretical results for\nundiscovered doubly charmed and bottom baryons can provide helpful information\nfor future experiments and help us better understand the heavy quark symmetry.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
