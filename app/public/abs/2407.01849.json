The first is to extend the theory of linearly\ndistributive categories by considering the structures that emerge in a special\ncase: the normal duoidal category $(\\mathsf{Poly} ,\\mathcal{y}, \\otimes,\n\\triangleleft )$ of polynomial functors under Dirichlet and substitution\nproduct. This is an isomix LDC which is neither $*$-autonomous nor fully\nsymmetric. The additional structures of interest here are a closure for\n$\\otimes$ and a co-closure for $\\triangleleft$, making $\\mathsf{Poly}$ a\nbi-closed LDC, which is a notion we introduce in this paper.\n  The second purpose is to use $\\mathsf{Poly}$ as a source of examples and\nintuition about various structures that can occur in the setting of LDCs,\nincluding duals, cores, linear monoids, and others, as well as how these\ngeneralize to the non-symmetric setting. To that end, we characterize the\nlinearly dual objects in $\\mathsf{Poly}$: every linear polynomial has a right\ndual which is a representable. It turns out that the linear and representable\npolynomials also form the left and right cores of $\\mathsf{Poly}$. Finally, we\nprovide examples of linear monoids, linear comonoids, and linear bialgebras in\n$\\mathsf{Poly}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YBfa_rIH7u6PLt2NAXYxAn4U14n6RFMDsjyD-53VTzQ","pdfSize":"1408013"}
