The\nrandom potential is represented as a centered complex-valued generalized\nmicrolocally isotropic Gaussian random field, where its covariance and relation\noperators are characterized as conventional pseudo-differential operators.\nRegarding the direct scattering problem, the well-posedness is established in\nthe distribution sense for sufficiently large wavenumbers through analysis of\nthe corresponding Lippmann--Schwinger integral equation. Furthermore, in the\ncontext of the inverse scattering problem, the uniqueness is attained in\nrecovering the microlocal strengths of both the covariance and relation\noperators of the random potential. Notably, this is accomplished with only a\nsingle realization of the backscattering far-field patterns averaged over the\nhigh-frequency band.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
