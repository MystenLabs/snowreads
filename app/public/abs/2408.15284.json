Usually, every single numerical\nsimulation takes hours or even days. Although the progresses in numerical\nmethods and high performance computing, in such cases, it is not possible to\nexplore various model configurations, hence efficient surrogate models are\nrequired.\n  Generally the available meta-model techniques show several advantages and\ndisadvantages depending on the investigated problem. In this paper we present\nan automatic approach for the selection of the optimal suitable meta-model for\nthe actual problem. Together with an automatic reduction of the variable space\nusing advanced filter techniques an efficient approximation is enabled also for\nhigh dimensional problems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"I8qJ0ZdTDKWT_UORvQvEa8d8uGjs9KB59OJcT0jrONE","pdfSize":"4791727"}
