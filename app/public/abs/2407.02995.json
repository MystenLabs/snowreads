We derive this existence result combining a theorem of Ma\\~n\\'e\ntogether with the following new theorem of independent interest: the existence\nof minimal closed geodesics, in the sense of Aubry-Mather theory, implies the\nexistence of a transverse homoclinic, and thus of a horseshoe, for the geodesic\nflow of a suitable $C^\\infty$-close Riemannian metric.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
