While general audio similarity metrics are useful, they are not\noptimized for the specific statistical properties of reverberation in rooms.\nThis paper presents two novel metrics for assessing the similarity of late\nreverberation in room impulse responses. These metrics are differentiable and\ncan be utilized within a machine-learning framework. We compare the performance\nof these metrics to two popular audio metrics using a large dataset of room\nimpulse responses encompassing various room configurations and microphone\npositions. The results indicate that the proposed functions based on averaged\npower and frequency-band energy decay outperform the baselines with the former\nexhibiting the most suitable profile towards the minimum. The proposed work\nholds promise as an improvement to the design and evaluation of reverberation\nsimilarity metrics.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
