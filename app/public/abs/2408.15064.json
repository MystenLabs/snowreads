We analyze extreme mass-ratio inspiral systems (EMRIs), where a\nstellar-mass object spirals into a slowly rotating supermassive black hole\nincluding a distinct deviation parameter. This study examines the effects of\nthis deformation on gravitational wave fluxes, orbital evolution, and phase\ndynamics, incorporating leading-order post-Newtonian corrections. With one-year\nobservations of EMRIs, we employ the Fisher information matrix method to\nevaluate the potential for detecting deviations from general relativity through\nspace-based gravitational wave detectors that utilize time-delay interferometry\nto suppress laser noise. The constraint on modified black holes, $\\Delta\\alpha\n\\preceq 10^{-5}$, is almost the same with and without the time-delay\ninterferometry combination. This analysis enhances our understanding and\nunderscores the crucial role of observations in advancing gravitational\nphenomena within String Theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
