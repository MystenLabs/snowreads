This\nLax-pair representation can also be used to define a new Yang-Baxter map, so we\nobtain a Yang-Baxter map that admits a continuous limit. We present most of the\nresults for the general case where the dependent variables are matrix-valued.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
