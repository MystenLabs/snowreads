Measuring Child Exposure and User Engagement on\n  TikTok","authors":"Miriam Schirmer, Angelina Voggenreiter, J\\\"urgen Pfeffer","authorsParsed":[["Schirmer","Miriam",""],["Voggenreiter","Angelina",""],["Pfeffer","JÃ¼rgen",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Aug 2024 19:44:12 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-13","timestamp":1723319052000,"abstract":"  Sharenting, the practice of parents sharing content about their children on\nsocial media platforms, has become increasingly common, raising concerns about\nchildren's privacy and safety online. This study investigates children's\nexposure on TikTok, offering a detailed examination of the platform's content\nand associated comments. Analyzing 432,178 comments across 5,896 videos from\n115 user accounts featuring children, we categorize content into Family,\nFashion, and Sports. Our analysis highlights potential risks, such as\ninappropriate comments or contact offers, with a focus on appearance-based\ncomments. Notably, 21% of comments relate to visual appearance. Additionally,\n19.57% of videos depict children in revealing clothing, such as swimwear or\nbare midriffs, attracting significantly more appearance-based comments and\nlikes than videos featuring fully clothed children, although this trend does\nnot extend to downloads. These findings underscore the need for heightened\nawareness and protective measures to safeguard children's privacy and\nwell-being in the digital age.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GDIjYGE4crwpolTscp3K5jVAq14jLTYA5icJ5bFJXu4","pdfSize":"1767486"}
