Density\nfunctional theory calculations were employed to determine the oxidation and\nreduction potentials of these monomers near different ions (Li+, TFSI-, and\nLiTFSI) and their corresponding reorganization energies. The results reveal\nnotable sensitivity of the monomers to reduction in a Li+ rich regime and to\noxidation in a TFSI- rich regime. Additionally, the decomposition pathways of\nthe monomers were investigated, focusing on the cleavage of CO bonds. The\nfindings provide insights into the stability and reactivity of these monomers\nin various electrochemical environments.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Atomic and Molecular Clusters","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
