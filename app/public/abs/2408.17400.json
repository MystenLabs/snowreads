More precisely, we find a V-formation\nconsisting of 2-potent finite commutative integral chains that does not have an\namalgam, nor a one-amalgam, in residuated chains; as most relevant\nconsequences, this entails that the following varieties do not have the\namalgamation property: semilinear commutative (integral) residuated lattices,\nMTL-algebras, involutive and pseudocomplemented MTL-algebras, and all of their\nn-potent subvarieties for n strictly larger than 1. These results entail the\nfailure of the deductive interpolation property for the corresponding\nsubstructural logics.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QW3AkQwk4BVS1w7bceDVC8dbsLRDYQ6tQzdhh-1HQJc","pdfSize":"209306"}
