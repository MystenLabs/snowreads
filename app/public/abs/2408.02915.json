Funct. Anal., 259 (2010), pp. 2902-2922]. This allows us to prove\nwellposedness of lower semicontinuous solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman\nequations associated to the optimal control of evolution inclusions. Thereby,\nwe generalize results in Bayraktar and Keller [J. Funct. Anal., 275 (2018), pp.\n2096-2161] on Hamilton-Jacobi equations in infinite dimensions with monotone\noperators in several ways. First, we permit locally monotone operators. This\nextends the applicability of our theory to a wider class of equations such as\nBurgers' equations, reaction-diffusion equations, and 2D Navier-Stokes\nequations. Second, we allow state constraints. Third, we have uniqueness of\nviscosity solutions. Our results on viability and lower semicontinuous\nsolutions are new even in the case of monotone operators.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
