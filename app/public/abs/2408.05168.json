We verify\nthe splitting property and explicitly obtain the distribution of the number of\nvertices deleted by each cut. This allows us to obtain a recursive formula for\nKn, the number of cuts needed to destroy a random recursive tree of size n.\nFurthermore, we show that Kn is stochastically dominated by Jn, the number of\njumps made by a certain random walk with a barrier. We obtain a convergence in\ndistribution of Jn to a Cauchy random variable. We also explore the\nrelationship of this cutting procedure to a coalescing process and show that\nthe coalescing rate cannot correspond to a {\\Lambda}-coalescent since it fails\nconsistency conditions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HgjUuglD2-NwNw8GxJpyzPwt9eF8PmEo9D2XKwGMsJU","pdfSize":"209503"}
