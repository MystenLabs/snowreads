Our focus is on developing and evaluating a method for\nautomatically identifying maps that depict specific regions and feature\nlandmarks with designated names, a task that involves complex challenges due to\nthe diverse styles and methods used in map creation. We address three main\nsubtasks: differentiating maps from non-maps, verifying the accuracy of the\nregion depicted, and confirming the presence or absence of particular landmark\nnames through advanced text recognition techniques. Our approach utilizes a\nConvolutional Neural Network and transfer learning to differentiate maps from\nnon-maps, verify the accuracy of depicted regions, and confirm landmark names\nthrough advanced text recognition. We also introduce the VinMap dataset,\ncontaining annotated map images of Vietnam, to train and test our method.\nExperiments on this dataset demonstrate that our technique achieves F1-score of\n85.51% for identifying maps excluding specific territorial landmarks. This\nresult suggests practical utility and indicates areas for future improvement.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3U1WXgXj5KpIxpwzY-XQgEbJldJWYS1qEvf9Zy5EqD0","pdfSize":"7187516"}
