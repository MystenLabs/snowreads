The precise value of\nthis invariant, even for a finite abelian group of rank greater than $2$, is\nnot known yet. In 1977, Olson and White first worked with this invariant for\nfinite non-abelian groups. After that in 2004, Dimitrov dealt with it, where he\nproved that $D(G)\\leq L(G)$ for a finite $p$-group $G$, where $p$ is a prime\nand $L(G)$ is the Loewy length of $\\mathbb{F}_pG.$ He conjectured that equality\nholds for all finite $p$-groups. In this article, we compute $D(G)$ for a\ncertain subclass of $2$-generated finite $p$-groups of nilpotency class two and\nshow that the conjecture is true by determining the precise value of the Loewy\nlength of $\\mathbb{F}_pG.$ We also evaluate $D(G)$ for finite dicyclic,\nsemi-dihedral and some other groups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"2Vw5dzesB8ScKT8t-zcNdfDJ_hKnjWQhgZneU6umdt0","pdfSize":"198598"}
