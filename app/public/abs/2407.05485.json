The motivation comes from a collaboration with the SNCF, the main\nFrench railway company. An almost complete solution is provided under the form\nof a necessary and sufficient condition that can be checked in polynomial time.\nA complementary discussion about possible extensions is also proposed.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
