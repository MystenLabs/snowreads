With a minimal monopole in the center, we derive\nthe ground-state single-vortex wave function on the sphere and develop the\nvortex's kinematic equation in the presence of an external electromagnetic\nfield. The vortex's trajectory is generally depicted by the precession of the\nsystem. We further formulate the inter-vortex interaction and build up a theory\nof multi-vortex dynamics in high-charge monopole systems. We predict the\nvortices'trajectory in the bi-vortex system and figure out stable vortex (line)\npatterns in multi-vortex systems. Our study provides deep insights into\nproperties of magnetic monopoles and vortices and paves the way for\nexperimental verification.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
