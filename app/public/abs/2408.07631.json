We show that these\nvarieties can be naturally decomposed into a finite disjoint union of\nsubvarieties, where precise analytic properties of the corresponding height\nzeta functions can be given, allowing for a finer inspection of the asymptotic\nnumber of rational points of bounded height on each subvariety.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
