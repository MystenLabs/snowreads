The\nunderlying Calabi-Yau volume is controlled by two moduli which are stabilised\nby perturbative effects. The lighter of them drives Fibre Inflation at a large\nenergy scale. The two associated axions are ultra-light since they are lifted\nonly at the non-perturbative level. The lighter of them can drive quintessence\nif its decay constant is large enough to prevent quantum diffusion during\ninflation from ruining the initial conditions. The right dark energy scale can\nbe obtained via a large suppression from poly-instanton effects. The heavier\naxion gives a negligible contribution to dark matter since it starts\noscillating after matter-radiation equality. If instead none of the two axions\nhas a large decay constant, a mild alignment allows the lighter axion to drive\nquintessence, while the heavier can be at most a few percent of dark matter due\nto isocurvature and UV bounds. In both cases dark matter can also come from\neither primordial black holes or the QCD axion.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
