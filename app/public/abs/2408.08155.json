We provide a physical interpretation of this feature in the\ncontext of both single-particle and many-body properties of electrons on a\nlattice (\"Bloch electrons\"), namely, in terms of their density of states and\numklapp scattering rate. (In an umklapp event, the change in the momentum of\ntwo colliding electrons is equal to a reciprocal lattice vector, which gives\nrise to a finite resistivity due to electron-electron interaction.) In this\ncontext, the vanishing of an integral follows simply from the condition that\neither the density of states vanishes due to the electron energy lying outside\nthe band in which free propagation of electron waves is allowed, or that an\numklapp process is kinematically forbidden due to the Fermi surface being\nsmaller than a critical value.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
