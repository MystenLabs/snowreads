Resampling-based methods like the distilled\nconditional randomization test (dCRT) offer statistical precision but at a high\ncomputational cost. The spaCRT leverages a saddlepoint approximation to the\nresampling distribution of the dCRT test statistic, achieving very similar\nfinite-sample statistical performance with significantly reduced computational\ndemands. We prove that the spaCRT $p$-value approximates the dCRT $p$-value\nwith vanishing relative error, and that these two tests are asymptotically\nequivalent. Through extensive simulations and real data analysis, we\ndemonstrate that the spaCRT controls Type-I error and maintains high power,\noutperforming other asymptotic and resampling-based tests. Our method is\nparticularly well-suited for large-scale single-cell CRISPR screen analyses,\nfacilitating the efficient and accurate assessment of perturbation-gene\nassociations.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
