The challenge lies in\nfaithfully modelling user narratives from their online social media posts,\nwhich could potentially be useful in several different applications. We have\ndeveloped a novel and effective model called \\texttt{NarrationDep}, which\nfocuses on detecting narratives associated with depression. By analyzing a\nuser's tweets, \\texttt{NarrationDep} accurately identifies crucial narratives.\n\\texttt{NarrationDep} is a deep learning framework that jointly models\nindividual user tweet representations and clusters of users' tweets. As a\nresult, \\texttt{NarrationDep} is characterized by a novel two-layer deep\nlearning model: the first layer models using social media text posts, and the\nsecond layer learns semantic representations of tweets associated with a\ncluster. To faithfully model these cluster representations, the second layer\nincorporates a novel component that hierarchically learns from users' posts.\nThe results demonstrate that our framework outperforms other comparative models\nincluding recently developed models on a variety of datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
