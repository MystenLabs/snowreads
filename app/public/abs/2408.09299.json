In the GKM$_3$ setting the 2-faces of the GKM graph\ncan naturally be divided into quaternionic and complex 2-faces; it turns out\nthat for GKM$_3$ actions on positive quaternion-K\\\"ahler manifolds the\nquaternionic 2-faces are biangles or triangles, and the complex 2-faces\ntriangles or quadrangles. We show purely combinatorially that any abstract\nGKM$_3$ graph with quaternionic structure satisfying this restriction on the\n2-faces of the GKM graph is that of a torus action on quaternionic projective\nspace ${\\mathbb{H}} P^n$ or the Grassmannian ${\\mathrm{Gr}}_2({\\mathbb{C}}^n)$\nof complex 2-planes in ${\\mathbb{C}}^n$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
