In the incremental (resp. decremental) setting,\nthe goal is to maintain distances from a fixed source in a graph undergoing\nedge insertions (resp. deletions). A long line of research culminated in a\nnear-optimal deterministic $(1 + \\varepsilon)$-approximate data structure with\n$m^{1 + o(1)}$ total update time over all $m$ updates by Bernstein, Probst\nGutenberg and Saranurak [FOCS 2021]. However, there has been remarkably little\nprogress on the exact $\\textrm{SSSP}$ problem beyond Even and Shiloach's\nalgorithm [J. ACM 1981] for unweighted graphs. For weighted graphs, there are\nno exact algorithms beyond recomputing $\\textrm{SSSP}$ from scratch in\n$\\widetilde{O}(m^2)$ total update time, even for the simpler Single-Source\nSingle-Target Shortest Path problem ($\\textrm{stSP}$). Despite this lack of\nprogress, known (conditional) lower bounds only rule out algorithms with\namortized update time better than $m^{1/2 - o(1)}$ in dense graphs.\n  In this paper, we give a tight (conditional) lower bound: any partially\ndynamic exact $\\textrm{stSP}$ algorithm requires $m^{2 - o(1)}$ total update\ntime for any sparsity $m$. We thus resolve the complexity of partially dynamic\nshortest paths, and separate the hardness of exact and approximate shortest\npaths, giving evidence as to why no non-trivial exact algorithms have been\nobtained while fast approximation algorithms are known.\n  Moreover, we give tight bounds on the complexity of combinatorial algorithms\nfor several path problems that have been studied in the static setting since\nearly sixties: Node-weighted shortest paths (studied alongside edge-weighted\nshortest paths), bottleneck paths (early work dates back to 1960), and earliest\narrivals (early work dates back to 1958).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
