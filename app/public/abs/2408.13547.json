In particular, this paper presents a novel approach for using\nfrontal slices of a tensor $\\mathcal{A}$ to solve tensor linear systems\n$\\mathcal{A} * \\mathcal{X} = \\mathcal{B}$ where $*$ denotes the t-product. In\naddition, we consider variations of this method, including cyclic, block, and\nrandomized approaches, each designed to optimize performance in different\noperational contexts. Our primary contribution lies in the development and\nconvergence analysis of these methods. Experimental results on synthetically\ngenerated and real-world data, including applications such as image and video\ndeblurring, demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approaches and validate\nour theoretical findings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
