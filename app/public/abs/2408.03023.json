In dynamic networks,\nincorporating a controllability perspective is essential for identifying key\nnodes. This paper focuses on the Volumetric Controllability Score (VCS) and\nAverage Energy Controllability Score (AECS) as centrality measures for\nselecting control nodes in linear dynamical network systems. We prove the\nuniqueness of VCS and AECS for any linear time-invariant system, enhancing\ntheir applicability beyond previously recognized cases. This ensures their\ninterpretability, comparability, and reproducibility across different\nresearchers. Our analysis reveals substantial differences between VCS and AECS\nin linear systems with symmetric and skew-symmetric transition matrices.\nMoreover, numerical experiments using real-world data indicate that VCS and\nAECS assessments in brain networks, modeled as Laplacian dynamics, exhibit\ncontrasting trends.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
