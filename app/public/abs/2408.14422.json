Comparing\npredictions from a model including these effects to raw magnetospectroscopy\ndata, we apply maximum-likelihood estimation to infer the shape of a quantum\ndot with up to four holes. We expect that methods like this will be useful in\nassessing qubit-to-qubit variability critical to further scaling quantum\ncomputing technologies based on spins in semiconductors.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
