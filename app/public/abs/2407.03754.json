This approach extends that\ninitiated by the second author in the case of the class group. It allows\nexpressing the $S$-$T$ genus number of a cyclic extension $\\L/\\K$ of degree $p$\nin terms of the rank of a matrix constructed from the Frobenius elements of the\nprimes ramified in $\\L/\\K$, in the Galois group of the underlying governing\nextension. For quadratic extensions $\\L/\\Q$, the matrices in question are\nconstructed from the Legendre symbols between the primes ramified in $\\L/\\Q$\nand the primes in $S$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
