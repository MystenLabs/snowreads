Computational methods of predicting\nprotein structures have advanced, but assessing prediction accuracy remains a\nchallenge. The traditional method, RMSD, relies on experimentally determined\nstructures and lacks insight into improvement areas of predictions. We propose\nan alternative: analyzing dihedral angles, bypassing the need for the reference\nstructure of an evaluated protein. Our method segments proteins into amino acid\nsubsequences and searches for matches, comparing dihedral angles across\nnumerous proteins to compute a metric using Mahalanobis distance. Evaluated on\nmany predictions, our approach correlates with RMSD and identifies areas for\nprediction enhancement. This method offers a promising route for accurate\nprotein structure prediction assessment and improvement.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VUT8pXZKyNOrERfL-BfwVZV0Kt7wSLe6YXr5KKAhQk0","pdfSize":"1350299"}
