While plasmons in graphene\nnanostructures can further enhance nonlinear optical phenomena, boosting\nresonances to the technologically relevant mid- and near-infrared (IR) spectral\nregime necessitates patterning on $\\sim10$ nm length scales, for which quantum\nfinite-size effects play a crucial role. Here we show that thermoplasmons in\nnarrow graphene nanoribbons can be activated at mid- and near-IR frequencies\nwith moderate absorbed energy density, and furthermore can drive substantial\nthird-harmonic generation and optical Kerr nonlinearities. Our findings suggest\nthat photothermal excitation by ultrashort optical pulses offers a promising\napproach to enable nonlinear plasmonic phenomena in nanostructured graphene\nthat avoids potentially invasive electrical gating schemes and excessive charge\ncarrier doping levels.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
