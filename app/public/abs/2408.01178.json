Previous work indicates that SI deep neural networks (DNNs)\nare vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Backdoor attacks involve embedding hidden\ntriggers in DNNs' training data, causing the DNN to produce incorrect output\nwhen these triggers are present during inference. This is the first work that\nexplores SI DNNs' vulnerability to backdoor attacks using speakers' emotional\nprosody, resulting in dynamic, inconspicuous triggers. We conducted a parameter\nstudy using three different datasets and DNN architectures to determine the\nimpact of emotions as backdoor triggers on the accuracy of SI systems.\nAdditionally, we have explored the robustness of our attacks by applying\ndefenses like pruning, STRIP-ViTA, and three popular preprocessing techniques:\nquantization, median filtering, and squeezing. Our findings show that the\naforementioned models are prone to our attack, indicating that emotional\ntriggers (sad and neutral prosody) can be effectively used to compromise the\nintegrity of SI systems. However, the results of our pruning experiments\nsuggest potential solutions for reinforcing the models against our attacks,\ndecreasing the attack success rate up to 40%.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
