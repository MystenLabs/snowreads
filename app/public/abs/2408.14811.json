This comprehensive review explores the diverse\ndesign inspirations that have shaped modern AI models, i.e., brain-inspired\nartificial intelligence (BIAI). We present a classification framework that\ncategorizes BIAI approaches into physical structure-inspired and human\nbehavior-inspired models. We also examine the real-world applications where\ndifferent BIAI models excel, highlighting their practical benefits and\ndeployment challenges. By delving into these areas, we provide new insights and\npropose future research directions to drive innovation and address current gaps\nin the field. This review offers researchers and practitioners a comprehensive\noverview of the BIAI landscape, helping them harness its potential and expedite\nadvancements in AI development.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
