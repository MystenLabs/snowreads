For simulation-based process\ndesign, the question arises as to which fiber quantities and hence model\nequations must be resolved in radial direction to capture all practically\nrelevant effects and at the same time imply a model that can be computed with\nreasonable effort. In this paper, we present a hierarchy of viscoelastic\ntwo-phase fiber models ranging from a complex, fully resolved and highly\nexpensive three-dimensional description to a cross-sectionally averaged,\ncheap-to-evaluate one-dimensional model. In particular, we propose a novel\nstress-averaged one-two-dimensional fiber model, which circumvents additional\nassumptions on the inlet profiles needed in the established stress-resolved\nfiber model by Doufas et al.\\ (2001). Simulation results demonstrate the\nperformance and application regime of the dimensionally reduced models. The\nnovel stress-averaged variant provides fast and reliable results, especially in\nthe regime of low flow-enhanced crystallization.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"hBeTFCjih--_ZtiYspGODBxxgFymJPaKPHJn2_FBMAY","pdfSize":"823548"}
