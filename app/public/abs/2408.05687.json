Considering the uncertainties of the QCD phase\ndiagram and the location of the critical endpoint, we aim to explore the\ncompetition between the chiral phase transition and the deconfinement phase\ntransition systematically, regulated by the vacuum pressure $-B$ in the NJL\nmodel. Employing a Maxwell construction, a sharp first-order deconfinement\nphase transition is implemented combining the parity doublet model for the\nhadronic phase and the NJL model for the high-energy quark phase. The position\nof the chiral phase transition is obtained from the NJL model\nself-consistently. We find stable neutron stars with a quark core within a\nspecific parameter space that satisfies current astronomical observations. The\nobservations suggest a relatively large chiral invariant mass $m_0=600$ MeV in\nthe parity doublet model and a larger split between the chiral and\ndeconfinement phase transitions while assuming the first-order deconfinement\nphase transition. The maximum mass of the hybrid star that we obtain is $\\sim\n2.2 M_{\\odot}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
