Although such wave\nfunctions can be readily specified formally, it is challenging to compute their\nassociated physical observables. Tensor network approaches offer a modern\nnumerical method for this task. In this work, we develop and demonstrate a\nconstructive tensor-network approach for obtaining physical quantities, like\nfermion two-point functions and density-density correlation functions, for\none-dimensional projected Fermi sea states. We benchmark our method against\nexact analytical results for spin-1/2 electrons subjected to the Gutzwiller\nprojection, and then present results on spinless fermions with nearest-neighbor\nrepulsion. For a state with two pairs of Fermi points, we reveal a\ncorrelation-tuning of the characteristic wave vector of the charge density\nmodulation in the system.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
