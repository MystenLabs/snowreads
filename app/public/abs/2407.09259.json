In this paper, we replace the constraint with the analytic form of\nthe minimum variance distortionless beamformer (MVDR), by which a semi-blind\nvariant of FastICA/FastIVA is obtained. The side information here is provided\nby a weighted covariance matrix replacing the noise covariance matrix, the\nestimation of which is a frequent goal of neural beamformers. The algorithm\nthus provides an intuitive connection between model-based blind extraction and\nlearning-based extraction. The algorithm is tested in simulations and speaker\nID-guided speaker extraction, showing fast convergence and promising\nperformance.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
