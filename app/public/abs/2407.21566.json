However, current systems\nrequire individuals to be within a line-of-sight (LOS) environment and struggle\nwith low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when signals traverse concrete and thick\nwalls. To address these challenges, we present TRGR, a novel transmissive\nreconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided gait recognition system. TRGR\ncan recognize human identities through walls using only the magnitude\nmeasurements of channel state information (CSI) from a pair of transceivers.\nSpecifically, by leveraging transmissive RIS alongside a configuration\nalternating optimization algorithm, TRGR enhances wall penetration and signal\nquality, enabling accurate gait recognition. Furthermore, a residual\nconvolution network (RCNN) is proposed as the backbone network to learn robust\nhuman information. Experimental results confirm the efficacy of transmissive\nRIS, highlighting the significant potential of transmissive RIS in enhancing\nRF-based gait recognition systems. Extensive experiment results show that TRGR\nachieves an average accuracy of 97.88\\% in identifying persons when signals\ntraverse concrete walls, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of\nTRGR.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
