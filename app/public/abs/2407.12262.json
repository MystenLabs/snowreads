Such system is theoretically predicted to be a promising platform for\nrealizing excitonic Bose-Einstein condensation and superfluid due to its high\nphase transition temperatures of ~257 K and ~64.25 K for the BEC and excitonic\nsuperfluid, respectively. The importance of spin-orbit coupling is revealed,\nand the angular momentum selection rules for photon absorption are discussed.\nThis finding suggests the potential of QL Bi2Se2Te monolayer with exotic\nbosonic bound states provides as a tantalizing high-temperature platform to\nprobe excitonic physics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
