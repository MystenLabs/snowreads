However, the communication channel within this context\nexhibits time-varying characteristics, and potential targets may move rapidly,\nresulting in double dynamics. These presents significant challenges for\nreal-time ISAC precoding design that have not been thoroughly explored. While\noptimization-based precoding methods have been extensively studied, they are\ncomputationally complex and heavily rely on perfect prior information that is\nrarely available in situations with double dynamics. In this paper, we propose\na synesthesia of machine (SoM)-enhanced precoding paradigm, where the base\nstation leverages various modalities such as positioning and channel\ninformation to adapt to double dynamics, and effectively utilizes environmental\ninformation to stretch ISAC performance boundaries through a deep reinforcement\nlearning framework. Additionally, a parameter-shared actor-critic architecture\nis tailored to expedite training in complex state and action spaces. Extensive\nexperimental validation has demonstrated the multifaceted superiority of our\nmethod over existing approaches.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
