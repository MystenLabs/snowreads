We give conditions when these\nalgebras are division algebras. Our constructions generalize algebras studied\nby Menichetti over finite fields. The algebras are examples of non-trivial\nsemiassociative algebras and thus relevant for the semiassociative Brauer\nmonoid recently defined by Blachar, Haile, Matzri, Rein, and Vishne. When ${\\rm\nGal}(K/F)=G$ the algebras of the first type can be viewed as nonassociative\n$G$-crossed product algebras.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nNb9X3NBqYmIqMGm7Ww5KpfIfz_p_xgBat4D__exlQY","pdfSize":"184259"}
