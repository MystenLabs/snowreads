Utilizing\nscanning transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray\nspectroscopy, and low temperature electrical measurements we investigate the\nrelationship between contact performance and the mechanical and chemical\nproperties of the annealed metal stack. Contact geometry and crystallographic\norientation significantly impact performance. Our results indicate that the\nspatial distribution of germanium in the annealed contact plays a central role\nin the creation of high transmission contacts. We characterize the transmission\nof our contacts at high magnetic fields in the quantum Hall regime. Our work\nestablishes that contacts with area 0.5 square microns and resistance less than\n400 Ohms can be fabricated with high yield.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IkKWifoBzKpBcj0U0bWo6y5IM-zd4K1s0NR6NrphmkA","pdfSize":"14297430","txDigest":"4SerSr6wKUGfP2jCsvGgnye2752SKF8HRPsiRg9FedLH","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
