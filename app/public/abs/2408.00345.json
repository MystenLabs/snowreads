This\nset of models include as special cases the usual exchange-driven growth system\nand the coagulation-fragmentation system with binary fragmentation. Under\nreasonable general condition on the rate coefficients we establish the\nexistence of admissible solutions, meaning solutions that are obtained as\nappropriate limit of solutions to a finite-dimensional truncation of the\ninfinite-dimensional ODE. For these solutions we prove that, in the class of\nmodels we call isolated both the total number of particles and the total mass\nare conserved, whereas in those models we can non-isolated only the mass is\nconserved. Additionally, under more restrictive growth conditions for the rate\nequations we obtain uniqueness of solutions to the initial value problems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
