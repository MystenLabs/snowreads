These devices have gained user\ninterest as they are easy to use. However, medical devices introduce extra\ncomplexity to the network by being numerous, heterogeneous, and more vulnerable\nto cyber-attacks. For better network management and overall network security,\nit is important to understand the network traffic characteristics of the\ndevices. Thus, in this paper, we analyze in detail the traffic characteristics\nof 8 medical devices both at the device level and at the level of individual\nfunctionality of each device. We collect and share both network and Bluetooth\ntraffic from a total of 51 functionalities of the devices. Our analysis\nincludes different metrics such as protocols, amount of incoming/outgoing\ntraffic, DNS queries, and analysis of traffic destinations. We observed that\ndevices have unique network and Bluetooth traffic characteristics, that might\nbe useful in developing networking tools for medical devices.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
