One of the most common 4D-Var algorithms uses\nan incremental update procedure, which has been shown to be an approximation of\nthe Gauss-Newton method. Here we demonstrate that when using a forecast model\nthat supports automatic differentiation, an efficient and in some cases more\naccurate alternative approximation of the Gauss-Newton method can be applied by\ncombining backpropagation of errors with Hessian approximation. This approach\ncan be used with either a conventional numerical model implemented within a\nsoftware framework that supports automatic differentiation, or a machine\nlearning (ML) based surrogate model. We test the new approach on a variety of\nLorenz-96 and quasi-geostrophic models. The results indicate potential for a\ndeeper integration of modeling, data assimilation, and new technologies in a\nnext-generation of operational forecast systems that leverage weather models\ndesigned to support automatic differentiation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
