Chip placement is a critical step in the EDA workflow, which\npositions chip modules on the canvas with the goal of optimizing performance,\npower, and area (PPA) metrics of final chip designs. Recent advances have\ndemonstrated the great potential of AI-based algorithms in enhancing chip\nplacement. However, due to the lengthy workflow of chip design, the evaluations\nof these algorithms often focus on intermediate surrogate metrics, which are\neasy to compute but frequently reveal a substantial misalignment with the\nend-to-end performance (i.e., the final design PPA). To address this challenge,\nwe introduce ChiPBench, which can effectively facilitate research in chip\nplacement within the AI community. ChiPBench is a comprehensive benchmark\nspecifically designed to evaluate the effectiveness of existing AI-based chip\nplacement algorithms in improving final design PPA metrics. Specifically, we\nhave gathered 20 circuits from various domains (e.g., CPU, GPU, and\nmicrocontrollers). These designs are compiled by executing the workflow from\nthe verilog source code, which preserves necessary physical implementation\nkits, enabling evaluations for the placement algorithms on their impacts on the\nfinal design PPA. We executed six state-of-the-art AI-based chip placement\nalgorithms on these designs and plugged the results of each single-point\nalgorithm into the physical implementation workflow to obtain the final PPA\nresults. Experimental results show that even if intermediate metric of a\nsingle-point algorithm is dominant, while the final PPA results are\nunsatisfactory. We believe that our benchmark will serve as an effective\nevaluation framework to bridge the gap between academia and industry.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
