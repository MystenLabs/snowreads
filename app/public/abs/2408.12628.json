It is shown that both functions are connected respectively to the\nspatial and temporal parts of the vacuum gluon energy $\\epsilon_s$ and\n$\\epsilon_E$ which define their equal values at $T=0$. However at $T>0$ the\nspatial part is growing with $T$ while the temporal part is destroyed by the\nhadronic pressure at $T=T_c$ (the deconfinement). Both properties are derived\nwithin the same method and are in a good agreement with the corresponding\nlattice data.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
