Their primary objective\nis to circumvent statistical assumptions on channel variation. Traditional\nstudies on AVCs optimize rate subject to the worst-case state sequence. While\nthis approach is resilient to channel variations, it may result in low rates\nfor state sequences that are associated with relatively good channels. This\npaper addresses the analysis of AVCs through the lens of competitive analysis,\nwhere solution quality is measured with respect to the optimal solution had the\nstate sequence been known in advance. Our main result demonstrates that codes\nconstructed by a single input distribution do not achieve optimal competitive\nperformance over AVCs. This stands in contrast to the single-letter capacity\nformulae for AVCs, and it indicates, in our setting, that even though the\nencoder cannot predict the subsequent channel states, it benefits from varying\nits input distribution as time proceeds.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
