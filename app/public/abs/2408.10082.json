However, while these\nlanguage features significantly improve the process of writing code, debugging\nChisel designs with open source tools loses many of the advantages of the\nsource language, as type information and data structure hierarchies are lost in\nthe translation, simulator output, and waveform viewer. This work, Tywaves,\npresents a new type-centered debugging format that brings the same level of\nabstraction found in contemporary hardware languages to waveform viewers.\nContributions to the Chisel library and CIRCT MLIR compiler as well as the\nSurfer waveform viewer result in a waveform viewer that better supports the\nChisel HDL.\n  Project url: https://github.com/rameloni/tywaves-chisel-demo\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mgTUF5IrFb7_OM8-8j_aHUJXyQ0rd0PfOYB8jW3aSv4","pdfSize":"1275953"}
