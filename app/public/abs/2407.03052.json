We show that, under certain\nrestrictions on the cohomological torsion, the integral cohomology is encoded\nin the one-skeleton even in the presence of arbitrary disconnected isotropy\ngroups. We provide applications to Hamiltonian actions as well as to the GKM\ncase. In the latter, our results lead to a modification of the GKM formula for\ngraph cohomology.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
