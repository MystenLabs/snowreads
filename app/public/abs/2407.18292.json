In this work, we\nemphasize the consequences of this tension beyond the value of the Hubble\nconstant $H_0$, and the implications for physics beyond $\\Lambda$CDM. Of utmost\nimportance, it implies a larger physical matter density $\\omega_m\\equiv\n\\Omega_m h^2$, as both the fractional matter density $\\Omega_m$ and $h\\equiv\nH_0/100$ km/s/Mpc are well constrained from late-time data. New physics in the\npre-recombination era must thus be able to decrease $r_s$ while either reducing\nthe value of $\\Omega_m$, or increasing the value of $\\omega_m$. Assuming a\n$\\Lambda$CDM-like primordial power spectrum, this necessarily results in an\nincrease in the clustering amplitude $\\sigma_8$. Deviations from $\\Lambda$CDM\nin the late-time expansion history cannot resolve the calibrator tension but\ncan help relax the required shifts to the matter density and $\\sigma_8$: it is\nin that sense that a combination of early and late-time new physics may help\nalleviate the tension. More precisely, models that modify the pre-recombination\nexpansion history can accommodate the increase in $\\omega_m$ without the need\nfor additional modifications. It is those models which only affect\nrecombination that require additional deviations at late-times to be\nsuccessful. Hence, the `cosmic calibration tension' points either to a targeted\nmodification of the pre-recombination expansion history, or to a broader change\naffecting multiple cosmic epochs.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
