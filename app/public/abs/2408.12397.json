Shadrin. This second Poisson operator has a simple and explicit\nexpression in terms of the generating function of intersection numbers of the\nCohFT with the DR cycle and the top Hodge class $\\lambda_g$. Our proof is based\non two recently proved results: the equivalence of the double ramification\nhierarchy and the Dubrovin-Zhang hierarchy of a semisimple CohFT under Miura\ntransformation and the polynomiality of the second Poisson bracket of the DZ\nhierarchy of a homogeneous semisimple CohFT. In particular our second Poisson\nbracket coincides through DR/DZ equivalence with the second Poisson bracket of\nthe DZ hierarchy, hence providing a remarkably explicit approach to their\nbihamiltonian structure.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
