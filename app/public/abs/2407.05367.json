The shock-induced drop size and distributions can be predicted within\nreasonable accuracy as a function of the drop velocity ratio and fluid\nproperties. The result also illustrates the dynamical process of kinetic energy\ndeficit transferred to the surface tension energy, and the skewing of the drop\nsize distribution due to the non-linear dependence on velocity ratio.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"e-TeWw9CZZ9R9LzNSBtm-7EUsKX96d6gdagm73wzmeU","pdfSize":"240230"}
