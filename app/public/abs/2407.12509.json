As our main result we propose a new online\nexperiment design method, meaning that the selection of the inputs is iterative\nand guided by data samples collected in the past. We show that this approach\nleads to the shortest possible experiments for linear system identification. In\nterms of sample complexity, the proposed method outperforms offline methods\nbased on persistency of excitation as well as existing online experiment design\nmethods.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
