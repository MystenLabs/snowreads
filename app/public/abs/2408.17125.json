For the first family, the Whitehead graphs have not previously\nbeen observed in this context, and the corresponding manifolds are lens spaces.\nThe second family provides new examples where the reduced Whitehead graphs are\nthose of the Fractional Fibonacci presentations; here the corresponding\nmanifolds are often (but not always) hyperbolic.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
