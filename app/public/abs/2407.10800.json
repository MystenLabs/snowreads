We model this system to determine the binary parameters, combining\noptical observations from NTT in 2017 and NOT in 2022 with the binary modeling\ncode ICARUS. We find a best-fit neutron star mass of $2.3 \\pm\n0.4\\,\\text{M}_\\odot $, and a companion mass of $0.15 \\pm 0.02\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$.\nWe detect for the first time low-level irradiation from asymmetry in the minima\nas well as a change in the asymmetry of the maxima of its light curves over\nfive years. Using star spot models, we find better fits than those from\nsymmetric direct heating models, with consistent orbital parameters. We discuss\nan alternative scenario where the changing asymmetry is produced by a variable\nintrabinary shock. In summary, we find that PSR J1622-0315 combines low\nirradiation with variable light curve asymmetry, and a relatively high neutron\nstar mass.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
