Traditionally it was thought such scattering could lead to\nfractional particle numbers (\"semitons\"). By direct calculations we show those\nsemitonic processes are in fact free propagation, facilitated by composite\nfermion-rotor operators interpolating the \"forbidden\" states, effectively\n\"recovering\" both ingoing and outgoing states in every lowest partial wave.\nNon-semitonic Callan-Rubakov processes are unchanged.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
