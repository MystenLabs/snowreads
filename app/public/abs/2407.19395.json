The results are compared to the\npredictions of scaling laws obtained from a generalized free energy function\nexpected near an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point (AFQCP). The scaling\nbehavior depends on the dimensionality $d$ of the fluctuations, the coherence\nlength exponent $\\nu$, and the dynamic exponent $z$. The free energy treats the\nmagnetic field as a relevant renormalization group variable, which leads to a\nnew exponent $\\phi=\\nu z_h$, where $z_h$ is a dynamic exponent expected in the\npresence of a magnetic field. When $z_h=z$, $T/H$ scaling is expected, as\nobserved in several compounds close to a QCP; whereas in YbFe$_5$P$_3$, a\n$T/H^{3/4}$ dependence of the scaling is observed. This dependence reflects the\nrelationship $z_h=(4z/3)$ and a field exponent $\\phi =4/3$. A feature of the\nscaling law is that it restricts the possible values of the exponents to two\ncases for YbFe$_5$P$_3$: $d$=1, $\\nu$=1, $z$=1, and $d$=2, $\\nu$=1/2, $z$=2.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1OVk-ZZQzsdXmtyUxFruUe6PpRDmiWyGIv4V_ghE64U","pdfSize":"5835116"}
