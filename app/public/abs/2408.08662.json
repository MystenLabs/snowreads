The\ncommutative ring of polynomials $f(C_g)$ in the companion matrix $C_g$ of\n$g(t)$, where $f(t)\\in R[t]$, is called the Companion Ring of $g(t)$. Special\ninstances include the rings of circulant matrices, skew-circulant matrices,\npseudo-circulant matrices, or lower triangular Toeplitz matrices. When $R$ is\nan Elementary Divisor Domain, we develop new tools for computing the Smith\nforms of matrices in Companion Rings. In particular, we obtain a formula for\nthe second last non-zero determinantal divisor, we provide an $f(C_g)\n\\leftrightarrow g(C_f)$ swap theorem, and a composition theorem. When $R$ is a\nprincipal ideal domain we also obtain a formula for the number of non-unit\ninvariant factors. By applying these to families of circulant matrices that\narise as relation matrices of cyclically presented groups, in many cases we\ncompute the groups' abelianizations. When the group is the fundamental group of\na three dimensional manifold, this provides the homology of the manifold. In\nother cases we obtain lower bounds for the rank of the abelianisation and\nrecord consequences for finiteness or solvability of the group, or for the\nHeegaard genus of a corresponding manifold.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
