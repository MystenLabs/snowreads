The dependence of temperaure, Gibbs free\nenergy, specific heat on the horizon radius have been studied for various\nvalues of critical density (\\r{ho}c ) of the cold dark matter. The studies\nshows that only small values of critical density of cold the dark matter, black\nhole are stable.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"tfInNLq4jVzPen3b5BW9GPDwwQ2Gywld3C5NhhTRlF8","pdfSize":"497634"}
