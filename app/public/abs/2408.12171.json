We begin by\nintroducing fundamental concepts, traditional methods, and benchmark datasets,\nthen examine the various roles ML plays in improving CFD. The literature\nsystematically reviews papers in recent five years and introduces a novel\nclassification for forward modeling: Data-driven Surrogates, Physics-Informed\nSurrogates, and ML-assisted Numerical Solutions. Furthermore, we also review\nthe latest ML methods in inverse design and control, offering a novel\nclassification and providing an in-depth discussion. Then we highlight\nreal-world applications of ML for CFD in critical scientific and engineering\ndisciplines, including aerodynamics, combustion, atmosphere & ocean science,\nbiology fluid, plasma, symbolic regression, and reduced order modeling.\nBesides, we identify key challenges and advocate for future research directions\nto address these challenges, such as multi-scale representation, physical\nknowledge encoding, scientific foundation model and automatic scientific\ndiscovery. This review serves as a guide for the rapidly expanding ML for CFD\ncommunity, aiming to inspire insights for future advancements. We draw the\nconclusion that ML is poised to significantly transform CFD research by\nenhancing simulation accuracy, reducing computational time, and enabling more\ncomplex analyses of fluid dynamics.
