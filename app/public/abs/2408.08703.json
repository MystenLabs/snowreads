Despite considerable progress, effectively calibrating\nthe bias between semantically similar multimodal representations, as well as\ngeneralizing pre-trained knowledge to novel compositional contexts, remains an\nenduring challenge. In this paper, our interest is to revisit the conditional\ntransport (CT) theory and its homology to the visual-semantics interaction in\nCZSL and further, propose a novel Trisets Consistency Alignment framework\n(dubbed TsCA) that well-addresses these issues. Concretely, we utilize three\ndistinct yet semantically homologous sets, i.e., patches, primitives, and\ncompositions, to construct pairwise CT costs to minimize their semantic\ndiscrepancies. To further ensure the consistency transfer within these sets, we\nimplement a cycle-consistency constraint that refines the learning by\nguaranteeing the feature consistency of the self-mapping during transport flow,\nregardless of modality. Moreover, we extend the CT plans to an open-world\nsetting, which enables the model to effectively filter out unfeasible pairs,\nthereby speeding up the inference as well as increasing the accuracy. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
