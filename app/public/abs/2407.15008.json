In this work, we\nconsider the possibility of controlling such instabilities by adding an\nexternal electric field to the Vlasov--Poisson equations. Our approach to\ndetermining the external electric field is based on conducting a linear\nanalysis of the resulting equations. We show that it is possible to select\nexternal electric fields that completely suppress the plasma instabilities\npresent in the system when the equilibrium distribution and the perturbation\nare known. In fact, the proposed strategy returns the plasma to its equilibrium\nwith a rate that is faster than exponential in time. We further perform\nnumerical simulations of the nonlinear two-stream and bump-on-tail\ninstabilities to verify our theory and to compare the different strategies that\nwe propose in this work.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"H1MLc-OvrrPPGDdKKzqtJVcayMxuNMn5VzxInWF2XEQ","pdfSize":"3873987","objectId":"0xb94fd0e58a2609cd8febf1e6070a84cc940aa78ea25cfc5ff36fee8e9384f014","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
