However, most\nmethods focus on online learning, which presents substantial risks when\ndeployed in real-world settings. Addressing this challenge, we introduce an\ninnovative framework integrating diffusion models within the MARL paradigm.\nThis approach notably enhances the safety of actions taken by multiple agents\nthrough risk mitigation while modeling coordinated action. Our framework is\ngrounded in the Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE)\narchitecture, augmented by a Diffusion Model for prediction trajectory\ngeneration. Additionally, we incorporate a specialized algorithm to further\nensure operational safety. We evaluate our model against baselines on the DSRL\nbenchmark. Experiment results demonstrate that our model not only adheres to\nstringent safety constraints but also achieves superior performance compared to\nexisting methodologies. This underscores the potential of our approach in\nadvancing the safety and efficacy of MARL in real-world applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
