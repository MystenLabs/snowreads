We consider the breaking of Diff\nsymmetry down to the subgroup of transverse diffeomorphisms (TDiff) and analyse\nits impact on the generation and evolution of cosmic magnetic fields. We show\nthat Diff breaking induces a breaking of conformal invariance that modifies the\nway in which magnetic fields evolve on super-Hubble scales. The effects of the\nhighly conductive plasma in the evolution are also analysed. We obtain the\nmagnetic power spectrum today and discuss the parameter regions that yield\nintergalactic magnetic fields compatible with current observations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
