It was\nfirst proposed in 1990 that ball lightning might result from the catalysis of\nnuclear fission by a magnetic monopole. The observed frequency of ball\nlightning does not conflict with current upper theoretical or observational\nbounds for magnetic monopole flux. Some possible mechanisms to account for the\nassociation of magnetic-monopole-caused ball lightning with thunderstorms are\ndescribed, and proposals for further observational and theoretical research are\nmade.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"MruNB-7AT7qL7eSXboAItwYJpit_UdF54-VJ9GLRj9c","pdfSize":"255386"}
