In the service robotics domain, lots of uncertainties result from\nexogenous actions and inaccurate localisation of objects and the robot itself.\nThis makes the robot task scheduling problem incredibly challenging. In this\narticle, we propose a benchmarking system for systematically assessing the\nperformance of algorithms scheduling robot tasks. The robot environment\nincorporates a room map, furniture, transportable objects, and moving humans;\nthe system defines interfaces for the algorithms, tasks to be executed, and\nevaluation methods. The system consists of several tools, easing testing\nscenario generation for training AI-based scheduling algorithms and statistical\ntesting. For benchmarking purposes, a set of scenarios is chosen, and the\nperformance of several scheduling algorithms is assessed. The system source is\npublished to serve the community for tuning and comparable assessment of robot\ntask scheduling algorithms for service robots.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
