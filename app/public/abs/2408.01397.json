By coupling the dynamics of a particle moving in a one-dimensional\npotential to an imaginary-valued gauge field, it is possible to obtain certain\npseudo-Hermitian extensions of the original (Hermitian) problem. In particular,\nit is pointed out that the Swanson oscillator arises as such an extension of\nthe quantum harmonic oscillator. For the pseudo-Hermitian extensions of the\nharmonic and isotonic oscillators, we explicitly solve for the wavefunctions in\nthe position representation and also explore their intertwining relations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
