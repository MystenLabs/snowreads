This paper\npresents a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) and\nprompt engineering to improve the accuracy and relevance of these\nrecommendations. We designed a multi-round prompt framework to iteratively\nrefine recommendations using updated data and feedback, implemented on ChatGPT,\nClaude2, and GPT-4. Our method was evaluated against baseline models and a\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) approach using manually collected datasets. The results\ndemonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and contextual relevance, with\nour approach achieving up to 90\\% accuracy and high GPT-4 scores. Additional\nvalidation through real-world pilot studies further confirmed the practical\nbenefits of our method, highlighting its potential to transform agricultural\npractices and decision-making.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
