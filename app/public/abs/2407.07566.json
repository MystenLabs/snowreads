HebDB offers roughly 2500 hours of natural and\nspontaneous speech recordings in the Hebrew language, consisting of a large\nvariety of speakers and topics. We provide raw recordings together with a\npre-processed, weakly supervised, and filtered version. The goal of HebDB is to\nfurther enhance research and development of spoken language processing tools\nfor the Hebrew language. Hence, we additionally provide two baseline systems\nfor Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR): (i) a self-supervised model; and (ii) a\nfully supervised model. We present the performance of these two methods\noptimized on HebDB and compare them to current multi-lingual ASR alternatives.\nResults suggest the proposed method reaches better results than the evaluated\nbaselines considering similar model sizes.
