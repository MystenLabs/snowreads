However, students\noften face difficulties navigating the vast selection of courses, especially\nwhen exploring new fields of study. Driven by this challenge, researchers have\nbeen exploring course recommender systems to offer tailored guidance that\naligns with individual learning preferences and career aspirations. These\nsystems face particular challenges in effectively addressing the ``cold start''\nproblem for new users. Recent advancements in recommender systems suggest\nintegrating large language models (LLMs) into the recommendation process to\nenhance personalized recommendations and address the ``cold start'' problem.\nMotivated by these advancements, our study introduces RAMO (Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration for MOOCs), a system specifically designed to overcome the ``cold\nstart'' challenges of traditional course recommender systems. The RAMO system\nleverages the capabilities of LLMs, along with Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG)-facilitated contextual understanding, to provide course recommendations\nthrough a conversational interface, aiming to enhance the e-learning\nexperience.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"MevkxkSbjVzZLFaBkfviREa3GyTroNtv5hXpDw9PDI4","pdfSize":"1513438"}
