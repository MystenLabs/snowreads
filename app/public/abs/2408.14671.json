Our principal contributions are threefold.\n(1) We construct a Neyman-orthogonal score function that remains valid under\nmeasurement error, incorporating a bias correction term to account for\nerror-induced correlations. (2) We propose a method of moments estimator for\nthe measurement error variance, enabling implementation without prior knowledge\nof the error covariance structure. (3) We establish the $\\sqrt{N}$-consistency\nand asymptotic normality of our estimator under general conditions, allowing\nfor both the number of covariates and the magnitude of measurement error to\nincrease with the sample size. Our theoretical results demonstrate the\nestimator's efficiency within the class of regularized high-dimensional\nestimators accounting for measurement error. Monte Carlo simulations\ncorroborate our asymptotic theory and illustrate the estimator's robust\nperformance across various levels of measurement error. Notably, our\ncovariance-oblivious approach nearly matches the efficiency of methods that\nassume known error variance.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jBHllpBfxrXFx7dZmSk737B0BEe1z48oxXSSN08Ibco","pdfSize":"443584"}
