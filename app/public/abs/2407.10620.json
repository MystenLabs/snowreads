Many of them are close to the thresholds of a few pairs of\nheavy hadrons. They are candidates of exotic hadrons and have attracted immense\nattentions. Based on a coupled-channel nonrelativistic effective field theory,\nwe classify the near-threshold structures of a symmetry-related two-channel\nsystem according to the scattering length and channel coupling strength. We\nshow that the evolution of the scattering amplitude line shapes can be\nunderstood from the pole trajectories in the complex energy plane, and the pole\nevolution can be traced back to the renormalization group fixed points. We\nprovide a dictionary of correspondence between the evolution of line shapes and\npole trajectories, which can be used to understand the experimental\nobservations of the near-threshold structures.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
