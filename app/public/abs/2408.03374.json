By modeling the [CII] line\nemission in the visibility data directly, we derive the effective radius of\n[CII] line emission assuming exponential distribution. These measurements\ncomprise not only isolated galaxies but also interacting systems, identified\nthanks to the high spatial resolution of the data. The [CII] line radius ranges\nfrom 0.5 to 3.5 kpc with an average value of 1.9 kpc. We compare the [CII]\nsizes with the sizes of UV and FIR continua, which were measured from the HST\nF160W and ALMA Band-7 continuum images, respectively. We confirm that the [CII]\nline emission is more spatially extended than the continuum emission, with\naverage size ratios of $R_{e,[CII]}/R_{e,UV}=2.90$ and\n$R_{e,[CII]}/R_{e,FIR}=1.54$, although about half of the FIR-detected sample\nshow comparable spatial extent between [CII] line and FIR continuum emission\n($R_{e,[CII]}\\approx R_{e, FIR}$). The residual visibility data of the best-fit\nmodel do not show evidence of flux excesses either individually or in stacking\nanalysis. This indicates that the [CII] line emission in star-forming galaxies\ncan be characterized by an extended exponential disk profile. Overall, our\nresults suggest that the spatial extent of [CII] line emission can primarily be\nexplained by photodissociation regions associated with star formation activity,\nwhile the contribution from diffuse neutral medium (atomic gas) and the effects\nof mergers may further expand the [CII] line distributions, causing their\nvariations among our sample. We report the correlations between the [CII] line,\ndust, and Lya line properties, which may be in line with our scenario. Future\n3D-analysis of Lya and Ha lines will shed light on the association of the\nextended [CII] line emission with atomic gas and outflows.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
