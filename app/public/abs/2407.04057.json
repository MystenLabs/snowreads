Considering that deep tabular methods have\ndiverse design philosophies, including the ways they handle features, design\nlearning objectives, and construct model architectures, we introduce a\nversatile deep-learning toolbox called TALENT (Tabular Analytics and LEarNing\nToolbox) to utilize, analyze, and compare tabular methods. TALENT encompasses\nan extensive collection of more than 20 deep tabular prediction methods,\nassociated with various encoding and normalization modules, and provides a\nunified interface that is easily integrable with new methods as they emerge. In\nthis paper, we present the design and functionality of the toolbox, illustrate\nits practical application through several case studies, and investigate the\nperformance of various methods fairly based on our toolbox.
