However, these models struggle to detect\ngeneral obstacles not included in the fixed category set due to their\nvariability and numerous edge cases. To address this issue, we propose a\ncombination of multimodal foundational model-based obstacle segmentation with\ntraditional unsupervised computational geometry-based outlier detection. Our\napproach operates offline, allowing us to leverage non-causality, and utilizes\ntraining-free methods. This enables the detection of general obstacles in 3D\nwithout the need for expensive retraining. To overcome the limitations of\npublicly available obstacle detection datasets, we collected and annotated our\ndataset, which includes various obstacles even in distant regions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"vQ9hWb40CTEELZV3kOTCXgMeTcliONqAjhLNDi72HJU","pdfSize":"5042183"}
