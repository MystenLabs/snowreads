This task has applications in\nvarious real-world scenarios, such as anomaly detection, social network\nanalysis, and community discovery. Current graph clustering methods commonly\nrely on module pre-training to obtain a reliable prior distribution for the\nmodel, which is then used as the optimization objective. However, these methods\noften overlook deeper supervised signals, leading to sub-optimal reliability of\nthe prior distribution. To address this issue, we propose a novel deep graph\nclustering method called CGCN. Our approach introduces contrastive signals and\ndeep structural information into the pre-training process. Specifically, CGCN\nutilizes a contrastive learning mechanism to foster information\ninteroperability among multiple modules and allows the model to adaptively\nadjust the degree of information aggregation for different order structures.\nOur CGCN method has been experimentally validated on multiple real-world graph\ndatasets, showcasing its ability to boost the dependability of prior clustering\ndistributions acquired through pre-training. As a result, we observed notable\nenhancements in the performance of the model.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
