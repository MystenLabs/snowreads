However, many\nof these features are difficult to detect using standard criteria due to\noptical losses and detector inefficiency. As the statistics of light are\nunknown, the loss correction on the data is unreliable, despite the fact that\nthe losses can be precisely measured. To address this issue, we employ a\nloss-mitigated verification technique utilising quantum non-Gaussian witnesses,\nwhich incorporate the known optical losses and detector inefficiency into their\nderivation. This approach allows us to address the considerable challenge of\nexperimentally demonstrating unheralded quantum non-Gaussian states of single\nphotons and photon pairs.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
