The nebular continuum, which can appear during extreme starbursts, is\nof particular importance as it tends to redden UV slopes and has a significant\ncontribution to the UV luminosities of galaxies. Furthermore, its shape can be\nused to infer the gas density and temperature of the ISM. First, we provide a\ntheoretical background, showing how different stellar populations (SPS models,\nIMFs, and stellar temperatures) and nebular conditions impact observed galaxy\nspectra. We demonstrate that, for systems with strong nebular continuum\nemission, 1) UV fluxes can increase by up to 0.7~magnitudes (or more in the\ncase of hot/massive stars) above the stellar continuum, which may help\nreconcile the surprising abundance of bright high-redshift galaxies and the\nelevated UV luminosity density at $z>10$, 2) at high gas densities, UV slopes\ncan redden from $\\beta\\lesssim-2.5$ to $\\beta\\sim-1$, 3) observational\nmeasurements of $\\xi_{ion}$ are grossly underestimated, and 4) UV downturns\nfrom two-photon emission can masquerade as DLAs. Second, we present a dataset\nof 58 galaxies observed with NIRSpec on JWST at $2.5<z<9.0$ that are selected\nto have strong nebular continuum emission via the detection of the Balmer jump.\nFive of the 58 spectra are consistent with being dominated by nebular emission,\nexhibiting both a Balmer jump and a UV downturn consistent with two-photon\nemission. For some galaxies, this may imply the presence of hot massive stars\nand a top-heavy IMF. We conclude by exploring the properties of\nspectroscopically confirmed $z>10$ galaxies, finding that UV slopes and UV\ndownturns are in some cases redder or steeper than expected from SPS models,\nwhich may hint at more exotic (e.g. hotter/more massive stars or AGN) ionizing\nsources.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
