Determining the RTP (return\nto player) can be involved, especially when a player has an influence on the\ncourse of the game. In this paper we model the behaviour of slot machines using\nprobabilistic process specifications where the intervention of players is\nmodelled using non-determinism. The RTP is formulated as a quantitative modal\nformula which can be evaluated fully automatically on the behavioural\nspecifications of these slot machines. We apply the method on an actual slot\nmachine provided by the company Err\\`el Industries B.V. The most useful\ncontribution of this paper is that we show how to describe the behaviour of\nslot machines both concisely and unequivocally. Using quantitative modal logics\nthere is an extra bonus, as we can quite easily provide valuable insights by\na.o. computing the exact RTP and obtaining the optimal player strategies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
