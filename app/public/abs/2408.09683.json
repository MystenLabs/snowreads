In particular, individuals\nwith TBI report barriers that limit access to participation on social media\nplatforms. To improve access to and use of social media for users with TBI, we\nintroduce the Social Media Accessibility and Rehabilitation Toolkit\n(\\textbf{SMART-TBI}). The toolkit includes five aids (Writing Aid,\nInterpretation Aid, Filter Mode, Focus Mode, and Facebook Customization)\ndesigned to address the cognitive and communicative needs of individuals with\nTBI. We asked eight users with moderate-severe TBI and five TBI rehabilitation\nexperts to evaluate each aid. Our findings revealed potential benefits of aids\nand areas for improvement, including the need for psychological safety, privacy\ncontrol, and balancing business and accessibility needs; and overall mixed\nreactions among the participants to AI-based aids.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
