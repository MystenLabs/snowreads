Instead, we can replace some or all of the vectors with continuous\nfunctions (infinite-dimensional vectors) from a reproducing kernel Hilbert\nspace (RKHS). We refer to tensors with some infinite-dimensional modes as\nquasitensors, and the approach of decomposing a tensor with some continuous\nRKHS modes is referred to as CP-HiFi (hybrid infinite and finite dimensional)\ntensor decomposition. An advantage of CP-HiFi is that it can enforce smoothness\nin the infinite dimensional modes. Further, CP-HiFi does not require the\nobserved data to lie on a regular and finite rectangular grid and naturally\nincorporates misaligned data. We detail the methodology and illustrate it on a\nsynthetic example.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
