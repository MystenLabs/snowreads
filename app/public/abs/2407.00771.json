In quantum Monte Carlo methods, this is\nembodied by sign problems. A dynamical sign problem makes it exponentially\ndifficult to simulate long times. A multi-orbital sign problem generally\nresults in a prohibitive computational cost for systems with multiple impurity\ndegrees of freedom even in static equilibrium calculations. Here, we present a\nnumerically exact inchworm method that simultaneously alleviates both sign\nproblems, enabling simulation of multi-orbital systems directly in the\nequilibrium or nonequilibrium steady-state. The method combines ideas from the\nrecently developed steady-state inchworm Monte Carlo framework [Phys. Rev.\nLett. 130, 186301 (2023)] with other ideas from the equilibrium multi-orbital\ninchworm algorithm [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 206405 (2020)]. We verify our method\nby comparison with analytical limits and numerical results from previous\nmethods.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
