To this end, we propose an energy-informed diffusion model for unpaired\nphoto-realistic image deraining (UPID-EDM). Initially, we delve into the\nintricate visual-language priors embedded within the contrastive language-image\npre-training model (CLIP), and demonstrate that the CLIP priors aid in the\ndiscrimination of rainy and clean images. Furthermore, we introduce a\ndual-consistent energy function (DEF) that retains the rain-irrelevant\ncharacteristics while eliminating the rain-relevant features. This energy\nfunction is trained by the non-corresponding rainy and clean images. In\naddition, we employ the rain-relevance discarding energy function (RDEF) and\nthe rain-irrelevance preserving energy function (RPEF) to direct the reverse\nsampling procedure of a pre-trained diffusion model, effectively removing the\nrain streaks while preserving the image contents. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our energy-informed model surpasses the existing unpaired\nlearning approaches in terms of both supervised and no-reference metrics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
