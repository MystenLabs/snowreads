In addition\nto the modeling, theoretical properties of the stochastic nonlocal model are\nprovided, also addressing the question of well-posedness. A detailed numerical\nanalysis offers insights how the stochasticity affects the evolution of\ndensities. Finally, numerical examples illustrate the mean behavior of\nsolutions and the influence of parameters for a large number of realizations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
