The models were\nevaluated using nested cross-validation to ensure robust performance assessment\nand hyperparameter tuning. The XGBoost and SVM models achieved overall correct\nclassification rates of 94.00% and 94.39%, respectively. The results underscore\nthe efficacy of these machine learning approaches in agricultural applications,\nparticularly in enhancing the uniformity and efficiency of seed classification.\nThis study contributes to the growing body of work on precision agriculture,\ndemonstrating that automated systems can significantly support seed quality\ncontrol and crop yield optimization. Future work will explore incorporating\nmore diverse datasets and advanced algorithms to further improve classification\naccuracy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
