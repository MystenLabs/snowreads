This task challenges participants to develop models\nthat generate the findings and impression sections of radiology reports from\nCXRs from a patient's study, using five different datasets. This paper outlines\nthe e-Health CSIRO team's approach, which achieved multiple first-place\nfinishes in RRG24. The core novelty of our approach lies in the addition of\nentropy regularisation to self-critical sequence training, to maintain a higher\nentropy in the token distribution. This prevents overfitting to common phrases\nand ensures a broader exploration of the vocabulary during training, essential\nfor handling the diversity of the radiology reports in the RRG24 datasets.
