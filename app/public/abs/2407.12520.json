Particularly, photonic lattices allow\nengineering band dispersions and tailor transport features through their\ngeometry. However, complete controllability requires external manipulation of\nthe propagating light. Here, we present a resonant excitation scheme to observe\nquasi-1D and uni-directional propagation of light through the bulk of\ntwo-dimensional lattices. To this end, we use the highly anisotropic light\npropagation exhibited at the energy of saddle points in photonic bands. When\nmultiple drives with judicious amplitudes and phases are tuned to such energy,\ninterference effects between these drives and photonic modes result in\ncontrollable directional propagation through the bulk. Similarly, one can\nformed localized states with controllable localization degrees. We illustrate\nthese effects with driven-dissipative photonic lattices. Our work highlights\nthe importance of external drives for dynamically controlling directional light\ntransport in lattices, a relevant feature for all-optical routing and\nprocessing in photonics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"7MBdQpMgfSgGAYt57G9ENck7blCNOL8BWLa4Tt-wjYA","pdfSize":"17414469","objectId":"0xafcd79c14057b25462c92029aaa6fcbff4dc723ff639b7750b071ac4b4b38906","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
