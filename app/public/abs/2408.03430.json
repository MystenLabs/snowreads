Equivalently, any closed analytic Riemannian\nmanifold with negative sectional curvature has only finitely many totally\ngeodesic hypersurfaces, unless it has constant curvature.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
