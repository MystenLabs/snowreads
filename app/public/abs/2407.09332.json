A $k$-coalition refers to a pair of\ndisjoint vertex sets that jointly constitute a $k$-dominating set of the graph,\nmeaning that every vertex not in the set has at least $k$ neighbors in the set.\nWe define a $k$-coalition partition of a graph as a vertex partition in which\neach set is either a $k$-dominating set with exactly $k$ members or forms a\n$k$-coalition with another set in the partition. The maximum number of sets in\na $k$-coalition partition is called the $k$-coalition number of the graph\nrepresented by $C_k(G)$. We present fundamental findings regarding the\nproperties of $k$-coalitions and their connections with other graph parameters.\nWe obtain the exact values of $2$-coalition number of some specific graphs and\nalso study graphs with large $2$-coalition number.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
