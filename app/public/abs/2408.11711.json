It is an artistic process that requires interactivity with\nhumans for the best results. Many existing automatic video colorization systems\nprovide little opportunity for the user to guide the colorization process. In\nthis work, we introduce a novel automatic speaker video colorization system\nwhich provides controllability to the user while also maintaining high\ncolorization quality relative to state-of-the-art techniques. We name this\nsystem ControlCol. ControlCol performs 3.5% better than the previous\nstate-of-the-art DeOldify on the Grid and Lombard Grid datasets when PSNR,\nSSIM, FID and FVD are used as metrics. This result is also supported by our\nhuman evaluation, where in a head-to-head comparison, ControlCol is preferred\n90% of the time to DeOldify. Example videos can be seen in the supplementary\nmaterial.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eWr-oxE9anbXGQWLtwQ-ldFmzAoZof1K9BSUS7eli0w","pdfSize":"7325411"}
