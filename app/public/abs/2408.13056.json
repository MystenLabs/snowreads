Particularly vulnerable\nare Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), which face a spectrum of\ninterference and jamming threats that can significantly undermine their\nperformance. While traditional deep learning approaches are adept at mitigating\nthese issues, they often fall short for UAV applications due to significant\ncomputational demands and the complexities of managing large, centralized\ndatasets. In response, this paper introduces Federated Reservoir Computing\n(FedRC) as a potent and efficient solution tailored to enhance interference\nclassification in GNSS systems used by UAVs. Our experimental results\ndemonstrate that FedRC not only achieves faster convergence but also sustains\nlower loss levels than traditional models, highlighting its exceptional\nadaptability and operational efficiency.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
