Here we develop the concept of bosonic holes, which exhibit negative\nparticle excitations, in quadratic bosonic systems. Unlike electron holes, the\nFock states of bosonic holes are biorthogonal, and their excitation can be\ninterpreted as removing particles from a mean-particle number with a mean field\nbackground. Furthermore, we find that quadratic bosonic Hamiltonians related by\nnon unitary and local particle hole transformation possess the same locality\nstructure and spectral properties in different spaces, reflecting the PH\nduality. Based on this, we study the generation of PH entanglement in two mode\ncases and the PH Aharonov Bohm effect in the three mode case, which results in\na PH chiral flow with time reversal symmetry breaking. Our findings provide a\nnew way to understand and explore unusual physical phenomena in particle non\nconserving and non Hermitian systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
