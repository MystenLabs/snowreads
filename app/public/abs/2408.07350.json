We demonstrate that when light sources and observers are on the same\nside of the wormholes, the images of the wormholes mimic those of black holes.\nHowever, when the light sources are positioned on the opposite side from\nobservers, photons traversing the wormhole throat generate distinct\nobservational signatures. Specifically, unlike black hole images, the wormhole\nimages are confined within the critical curve, resulting in smaller centroid\nvariations. Furthermore, the light curve of hot spots can exhibit additional\npeaks.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
