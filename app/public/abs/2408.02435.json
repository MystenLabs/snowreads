Sometimes, however, it is beneficial to also\ndefine attributes of attributes, viz., meta-attributes. In this paper, we use\nTriadic Formal Concept Analysis, a triadic approach to Formal Concept Analysis,\nto develop a framework for this kind of meta-modelling in Formal Concept\nAnalysis, including formal definitions and appropriate visualizations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
