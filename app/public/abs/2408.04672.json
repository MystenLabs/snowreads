We discuss the\nphysical equivalence of these two representations of the theory, which are\nmathematically equivalent and whose metrics are connected by a conformal\ntransformation. We find that it is possible for this quantity to be singular in\nthe JF but finite in the EF, if the conformal transformation that connects the\nframes is singular at the same point as the JF Ricci scalar. The absence of\nthis physical singularity in the EF could be used as an argument against the\nphysical equivalence of the frames. A plot of the EF potential as a function of\nthe associated conformal field shows that the absence of the singularity allows\nthe field to assume values associated to arbitrarily large values of the Ricci\ncurvature. A conjecture is then proposed: the dynamics of the conformal field\ncan be interpreted as a mechanism that can prevent the creation of\nsingularities in the JF.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
