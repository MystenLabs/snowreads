In this paper, we study the spectral aspects of the matrix\nproduct of graphs, including regularity, bipartiteness, and connectivity. We\nshow that if a graph $G$ is factored into a connected graph $H$ and a graph $K$\nwith no isolated vertices, then certain properties hold. If $H$ is\nnon-bipartite, then $G$ is connected. If $H$ is bipartite and $G$ is not\nconnected, then $K$ is a regular bipartite graph, and consequently, $n$ is\neven. Furthermore, we show that trees are not factorizable, which answers a\nquestion posed by Maghsoudi et al.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
