Let $f$ be a bounded measurable functions, and consider\nthe integrals of the corresponding `double' ergodic averages:\n\\[\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\int f(S^ix)f(T^ix)\\ d\\mu(x) \\qquad (n\\ge 1).\\]\nWe construct examples for which these integrals do not converge as\n$n\\to\\infty$. These include examples in which $S$ and $T$ are rigid, and hence\nhave entropy zero, answering a question of Frantzikinakis and Host.\n  Our proof begins with a corresponding construction for orthogonal operators\non a Hilbert space, and then obtains transformations of a Gaussian measure\nspace from them.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"K_GK4ebP-hAx45PZ5zGgVaen0Am99jGsjiR37x51YZE","pdfSize":"118001"}
