Difficulties\nin its measurement arise from suppressed decay probabilities, experimentally\nchallenging decay signatures and low natural abundances of suitable candidate\nnuclei. In this article, we propose a new detector concept to overcome these\nchallenges. It is based on the first-time combination of hybrid and opaque\nscintillation detector technology paired with novel light read-out techniques.\nThis approach is particularly suitable detecting positrons (beta plus)\nsignatures. We expect to discover two-neutrino double beta plus decay modes\nwithin 1 tonne-week exposure and are able to probe neutrinoless double beta\nplus decays at several orders of magnitude improved significance compared to\ncurrent experimental limits.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
