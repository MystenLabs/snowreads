Our predictions for April 2023 are compared with\nthe real COVID-19 data for April 2023 to assess the accuracy of the model. The\ndata analysis is conducted using Python programming language, which allows for\nefficient data processing and prediction generation.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
