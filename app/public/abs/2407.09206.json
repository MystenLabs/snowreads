This paper presents a novel method for exploring\nunknown indoor spaces with a team of UAVs of different sizes and sensory\nequipment. We propose a frontier-based exploration with two task allocation\nstrategies: a greedy strategy that assigns Points of Interest (POIs) based on\nEuclidean distance and UAV priority and an optimization strategy that solves a\nminimum-cost flow problem. The proposed method utilizes the SphereMap algorithm\nto assess the accessibility of the POIs and generate paths that account for\nobstacle distances, including collision avoidance maneuvers among UAVs. The\nproposed approach was validated through simulation testing and real-world\nexperiments that evaluated the method's performance on board the UAVs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
