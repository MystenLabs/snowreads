We show that under the RFM\ntransform, complex Lagrangian graphs in $R^{2n} \\times T^{2n}$ correspond to\nSp($n$)-instantons over $R^{2n} \\times (T^{2n})^*$. In other words, the\ndeformed Sp($n$)-instanton equation coincides with the usual Sp($n$)-instanton\nequation.\n  Motivated by this observation, we study Sp($n$)-instantons on hyperkahler\nmanifolds $X^{4n}$, with an emphasis on conical singularities. First, when $X =\nC(M)$ is a hyperkahler cone, we relate Sp($n$)-instantons on $X$ to tri-contact\ninstantons on the 3-Sasakian link $M$ and consider various dimensional\nreductions. Second, when $X$ is an asymptotically conical (AC) hyperkahler\nmanifold of rate $\\nu \\leq -\\frac{2}{3}(2n+1)$, we prove a Lewis-type theorem\nto the following effect: If the set of AC Sp($n$)-instantons is non-empty, then\nevery AC Hermitian Yang-Mills connection over $X$ with sufficiently fast decay\nat infinity is an Sp($n$)-instanton.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0VxS4m7AAI4z9BchOxQ0jIszCaPfZbkL_6Y7qkbKA50","pdfSize":"489243"}
