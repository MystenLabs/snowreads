A\nkey step in the proof is to analyse the fixed point locus of a Fricke-like\ninvolution on the Hilbert modular surface of discriminant $N^2$ which was\nstudied by Hermann and by Kani and Schanz. To this end, we construct certain\n\"diagonal\" Hirzebruch--Zagier divisors which are fixed by this involution. In\nour analysis we obtain a genus formula for these divisors, which includes the\ncase of modular curves associated to (any) extended Cartan subgroup of\n$\\mathrm{GL}_2(\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z})$ and which may be of independent\ninterest.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
