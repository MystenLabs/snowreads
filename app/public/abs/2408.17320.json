Instead of countless developers creating redundant and\ninconsistent data pipelines, BioBricks.ai offers a centralized data repository\nand a suite of developer-friendly tools to simplify access to scientific data.\nCurrently, BioBricks.ai delivers over ninety biological and chemical datasets.\nIt provides a package manager-like system for installing and managing\ndependencies on data sources. Each 'brick' is a Data Version Control git\nrepository that supports an updateable pipeline for extraction, transformation,\nand loading data into the BioBricks.ai backend at https://biobricks.ai. Use\ncases include accelerating data science workflows and facilitating the creation\nof novel data assets by integrating multiple datasets into unified, harmonized\nresources. In conclusion, BioBricks.ai offers an opportunity to accelerate\naccess and use of public data through a single open platform.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
