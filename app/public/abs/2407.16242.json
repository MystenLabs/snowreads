Specifically, leveraging\nBayesian statistical tools, we analyze the asymptotic regime with a large\nnumber of receive antennas. In the coherent case, where the channel state\ninformation (CSI) is known at the receiver's side, we completely characterize\nthe asymptotic capacity and provide the exact scaling in the extreme regimes of\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the number of transmit antennas. In the\nnon-coherent case, where the CSI is unknown but remains constant during T\nsymbol periods, we first obtain the exact asymptotic capacity for T<=3. Then,\nwe propose a scheme involving uniform signaling in the covariance space and\nderive a non-asymptotic lower bound on the capacity for an arbitrary block size\nT. Furthermore, we propose a genie-aided upper bound where the channel is\nrevealed to the receiver. We show that the upper and lower bounds coincide when\nT is large. In the low SNR regime, we derive the asymptotic capacity up to a\nvanishing term, which, remarkably, matches our capacity lower bound.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2ywsbNqZHUkr8FbH2CIiGevQwM61DZOn_QLqkpuDzac","pdfSize":"413216"}
