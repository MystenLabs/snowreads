In this paper we aim to use the\ntheoretical framework of a twin coronal mass ejection event which is known to\ninclude interchange reconnection processes and compare this model with\nexperimental observations using Parker Solar Probe FIELDS and $\\isis$\ninstrumentationof an actual event containing two CMEs identified via the\nassociated solar proton event in order to further test and refine the\nhypothesis of interchange reconnection as a possible physical origin for the\nmagnetic switchback phenomenon. We also intend to introduce a plasma model for\nthe formation of the switchbacks noted within the CME event.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
