Let $k[E]$ the affine\ncoordinate ring and $k(E)$ the field of fractions. We fix a place $\\infty$ of\n$k(E)$ and let $k_{\\infty}$ be the completion. The group ${\\rm{GL}}_2(k[E])$\nacts on the symmetric space $\\mathcal{T}$, the Bruhat-Tits building of\n${\\rm{PGL}}_2(k_{\\infty})$. In this paper, we use the quotient space to\nconstruct the space of modular symbols over $K(E)$. We prove that this space is\ngiven by an explicit set of generators and their relations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
