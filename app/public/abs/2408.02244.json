This study evaluates the efficacy of an\nadvanced vision-language foundation model, OWLv2, in detecting and classifying\nvarious helmet-wearing statuses of motorcycle occupants using video data. We\nextend the dataset provided by the CVPR AI City Challenge and employ a cascaded\nmodel approach for detection and classification tasks, integrating OWLv2 and\nCNN models. The results highlight the potential of zero-shot learning to\naddress challenges arising from incomplete and biased training datasets,\ndemonstrating the usage of such models in detecting motorcycles, helmet usage,\nand occupant positions under varied conditions. We have achieved an average\nprecision of 0.5324 for helmet detection and provided precision-recall curves\ndetailing the detection and classification performance. Despite limitations\nsuch as low-resolution data and poor visibility, our research shows promising\nadvancements in automated vehicle safety and traffic safety enforcement\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
