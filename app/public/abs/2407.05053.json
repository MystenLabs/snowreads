In contrast to rigid\nrobots, bio-inspired robots exhibit an inherent compliance, facilitating\nversatile movements and operations in constrained spaces. The robot\nimplementation in fabrication, however, has posed technical challenges and\nmechanical complexity, thereby underscoring a noticeable gap between research\nand practice. To address the limitation, the research draws inspiration from\nthe unique musculoskeletal feature of vertebrate physiology, which displays\nsignificant capabilities for sophisticated locomotion. The research converts\nthe biological paradigm into a tensegrity-based robotic system, which is formed\nby the design of rigid-flex coupling and a compliant mechanism. This integrated\ntechnique enables the robot to achieve a wide range of motions with variable\nstiffness and adaptability, holding great potential for advanced performance in\nill-defined environments. In summation, the research aims to provide a robust\nfoundation for tensegrity-based biomimetic robots in practice, enhancing the\nfeasibility of undertaking intricate robotic constructions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
