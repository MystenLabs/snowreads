That is, the smaller model is bounded inside the larger model and there\nexists a standard part map. This covers for instance the differential fields of\nhyperseries or surreal numbers or maximal Hardy fields equipped with suitable\nenlargements of the differential field of transseries. The theory of such pairs\nis complete and model complete in a natural language and it has quantifier\nelimination in the same language expanded by two predicates and a standard part\nmap. Additionally, the smaller model is purely stably embedded in the pair, and\nhence so is the constant field.\n  More generally, we study differential-Hensel-Liouville closed pre-$H$-fields,\ni.e., pre-$H$-fields that are differential-henselian, real closed, and closed\nunder exponential integration, equipped with lifts of their differential\nresidue fields, and establish similar results in that setting relative to the\ndifferential residue field.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aYyUf3vJhHIn4EKLyPzy0rKU1j02_iAx54fPlKrmhJM","pdfSize":"695160"}
