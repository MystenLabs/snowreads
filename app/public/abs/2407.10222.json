We show that when\n$\\mathcal{N}$ consists of finite index subgroups of $G$, there is a natural\nclosure operation $\\mathcal{H} \\mapsto \\mathrm{cl}_\\mathcal{N}(\\mathcal{H})$\nthat associates to a URS $\\mathcal{H}$ another URS\n$\\mathrm{cl}_\\mathcal{N}(\\mathcal{H})$, called the $\\tau_\\mathcal{N}$-closure\nof $\\mathcal{H}$. We give a characterization of the URSs $\\mathcal{H}$ that are\n$\\tau_\\mathcal{N}$-closed in terms of stabilizer URSs. This has consequences on\narbitrary URSs when $G$ belongs to the class of groups for which every faithful\nminimal profinite action is topologically free. We also consider the largest\namenable URS $\\mathcal{A}_G$, and prove that for certain coset topologies on\n$G$, almost all subgroups $H \\in \\mathcal{A}_G$ have the same closure. For\ngroups in which amenability is detected by a set of laws (a property that is\nvariant of the Tits alternative), we deduce a criterion for $\\mathcal{A}_G$ to\nbe a singleton based on residual properties of $G$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
