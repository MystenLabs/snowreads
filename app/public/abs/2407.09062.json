However, linear mixed models struggle to properly capture time\ndependencies when the number of lags is large. Given the lack of published\nstudies addressing robust prediction in small areas using time-dependent data,\nthis research seeks to extend M-quantile models to this field. Indeed, our\nmethodology successfully addresses this challenge and offers flexibility to the\nwidely imposed assumption of unit-level independence. Under the new model,\nrobust bias-corrected predictors for small area linear indicators are derived.\nAdditionally, the optimal selection of the robustness parameter for bias\ncorrection is explored, contributing theoretically to the field and enhancing\noutlier detection. For the estimation of the mean squared error (MSE), a\nfirst-order approximation and analytical estimators are obtained under general\nconditions. Several simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the\nperformance of the fitting algorithm, the new predictors, and the resulting MSE\nestimators, as well as the optimal selection of the robustness parameter.\nFinally, an application to the Spanish Living Conditions Survey data\nillustrates the usefulness of the proposed predictors.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
