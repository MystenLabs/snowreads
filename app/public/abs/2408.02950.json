In KA-PointNet, we implement shared\nKolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) in the segmentation branch of the PointNet\narchitecture. We utilize Jacobi polynomials to construct shared KANs. As a\nbenchmark test case, we consider incompressible laminar steady-state flow over\na cylinder, where the geometry of its cross-section varies over the data set.\nWe investigate the performance of Jacobi polynomials with different degrees as\nwell as special cases of Jacobi polynomials such as Legendre polynomials,\nChebyshev polynomials of the first and second kinds, and Gegenbauer\npolynomials, in terms of the computational cost of training and accuracy of\nprediction of the test set. Additionally, we compare the performance of\nPointNet with shared KANs (i.e., KA-PointNet) and PointNet with shared\nMultilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). It is observed that when the number of trainable\nparameters is approximately equal, PointNet with shared KANs (i.e.,\nKA-PointNet) outperforms PointNet with shared MLPs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VoppfYSe_DE6juTdq4CCklKkGEnb5H9AFico3AHbUNQ","pdfSize":"8629712"}
