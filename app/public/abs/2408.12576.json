They were previously studied in a special case by\nBeauville in his work on surfaces of maximal Picard number, and are related to\nthe work of Totaro on Hodge structures with no middle pieces. Higher-weight\nJacobians are complex tori, and it is generally quite difficult to tell if they\nare algebraic. After discussing some general theory, we compute numerous\nexamples of Jacobians of various weights for special classes of varieties:\nabelian varieties of maximal Picard number, Kummer varieties, and singular K3\nsurfaces. It turns out that all of these Jacobians are algebraic. We compute\ntheir fields of definition.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
