The sensor network is modeled as a graph, with\neach vertex representing a sensor and a signal over time associated with each\nvertex. We assume a hypothesis test and an associated p-value for every sample\npoint in the joint spatial-time domain. Our goal is to determine which points\nhave true alternative hypotheses. By parameterizing the unknown alternative\ndistribution of $p$-values and the prior probabilities of hypotheses being null\nwith a bandlimited generalized graph signal, we can obtain consistent estimates\nfor them. Consequently, we also obtain an estimate of the local false discovery\nrates (lfdr). We prove that by using a step-up procedure on the estimated lfdr,\nwe can achieve asymptotic false discovery rate control at a pre-determined\nlevel. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach\ncompared to existing methods.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
