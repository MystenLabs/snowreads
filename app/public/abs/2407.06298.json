Our method leverages both base and\nfine-tuned DINOv2 models to extract generalized feature embeddings. We train\nclassifiers to predict multiple plant species within a single image using these\nrich embeddings. To address the computational challenges of the large-scale\ndataset, we employ Spark for distributed data processing, ensuring efficient\nmemory management and processing across a cluster of workers. Our data\nprocessing pipeline transforms images into grids of tiles, classifying each\ntile, and aggregating these predictions into a consolidated set of\nprobabilities. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of combining transfer\nlearning with advanced data processing techniques for multi-label image\nclassification tasks.
