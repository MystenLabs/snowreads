High magnetic\nfield studies on LaCoO$_{3}$ are performed because the magnetic field-induced\nspin crossover is induced, where the magnetic excited states become more stable\nin high magnetic fields than the non-magnetic ground states. This review\nfocuses on the findings in LaCoO$_{3}$ at high magnetic fields over the last\ndecade. A complex phase diagram has been revealed at high magnetic fields\ninstead of solving the conventional problem of LaCoO$_{3}$. It suggests that\nappreciable spin state correlations are in play in LaCoO$_{3}$. The possibility\nof exciton condensation is also discussed.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WpXqR46D8uYqdsR9VWb0BhRKnMRDXvVba8iXTGUxwF8","pdfSize":"8358063","objectId":"0x415d445e52a9eb39584813bad4c3439bb55c3649ed9480dbe07c8e3eadb6e472","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
