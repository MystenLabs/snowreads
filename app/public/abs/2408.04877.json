We introduce discrete Laplacians on spherical and\nhyperbolic triangulated surfaces. On the one hand, our definitions are close to\nthe Euclidean one in that the edge weights contain the cotangents of certain\ncombinations of angles and are non-negative if and only if the triangulation is\nDelaunay. On the other hand, these discretizations are structure-preserving in\nseveral respects. We prove that the area of a convex polyhedron can be written\nin terms of the discrete spherical Laplacian of the support function, whose\nexpression is the same as the area of a smooth convex body in terms of the\nusual spherical Laplacian. We show that the conformal factors of discrete\nconformal vector fields on a triangulated surface of curvature $k \\in \\{-1,1\\}$\nare $-2k$-eigenfunctions of our discrete Laplacians, exactly as in the smooth\nsetting. The discrete conformality can be understood here both in the sense of\nthe vertex scaling and in the sense of circle patterns. Finally, we connect the\n$-2k$-eigenfunctions to infinitesimal isometric deformations of a polyhedron\ninscribed into corresponding quadrics.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/General Topology","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
