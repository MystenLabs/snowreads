In this paper, we present a new\nquantum-based approach named the Hierarchical Quantum Control Gates (HQCG)\nmethod for efficient understanding of Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n(fMRI) data. This approach includes two novel modules: the Local Quantum\nControl Gate (LQCG) and the Global Quantum Control Gate (GQCG), which are\ndesigned to extract local and global features of fMRI signals, respectively.\nOur method operates end-to-end on a quantum machine, leveraging quantum\nmechanics to learn patterns within extremely high-dimensional fMRI signals,\nsuch as 30,000 samples which is a challenge for classical computers. Empirical\nresults demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms classical\nmethods. Additionally, we found that the proposed quantum model is more stable\nand less prone to overfitting than the classical methods.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
