While\ncyclazine in its characteristic $D_{\\rm 3h}$ structure defies Hund's rule,\nCCSD(T)-level modeling suggests its structure corresponds to two equivalent\nminima of $C_{\\rm 3h}$ symmetry undergoing rapid automerization. The combined\neffect of symmetry reduction and high-level corrections indicates a negligible\nsinglet-triplet gap in cyclazine. Notably, pentazine and heptazine prefer\nsymmetric structures exhibiting negative gaps in accord with experiments.\nAzaphenalenes containing nitrogen atoms at electron-deficient sites exhibit\nstronger in-plane structural distortion; in their low-symmetry energy minima,\nthey adhere to Hund's rule.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
