To bridge\nthis gap, we have developed a visualization that employs narrative patterns and\ninteractive elements, enabling the broader public to gradually grasp the\ndiverse risks and benefits associated with AI. Using a dataset of 54 real-world\nincidents involving AI in mobile computing, we examined design choices that\nenhance public understanding and provoke reflection on how certain AI\napplications - even those deemed low-risk by law - can still lead to\nsignificant incidents.
