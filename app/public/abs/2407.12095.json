The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Sagittarius Dwarf\ngalaxy (Sgr) are the dominant influences at the present day. This paper\npresents a suite of four 10^9 particle N-body simulations, illustrating the\nresponse of the MW's stellar disc to the close approach of the LMC and the\nmerger of Sgr into the MW. The suite is intended to provide a resource for\nothers to study the complex interactions between the MW and its satellites\nindependently and combined, in comparison to an isolated disc control\nsimulation. Such high resolution simulations are vital to understand the\nkinematics and morphology of the MW taking into account the effects of each\nsatellite. In our preliminary analysis, we find that the influences from the\nLMC and Sgr on the MW's disc appear distinct, additive and separable within our\ntailored simulations. Notably, the corrugations induced by Sgr reproduce the\nlarge radial velocity wave seen in the data Eilers+20. Overall, our findings\nemphasise the need to include both satellites when modelling the present-day\nstate of the MW structure and kinematics.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"g2T3lCMNfM561ljNVck6BeAwWktJFBtpFnIUg9UZjaI","pdfSize":"30962585"}
