The\nprobability mass function is generalised using the $q$-deformed algebra\ndeveloped within the framework of nonextensive statistics, leading to the\nemergence of a family of divergence measures in the asymptotic limit as the\nsystem size increases. The coefficients in the asymptotic expansion yield\nTsallis relative entropy as the leading-order term when $q$ is interpreted as\nan entropic parameter. Furthermore, higher-order expansion coefficients\nnaturally introduce new divergence measures, extending Tsallis relative entropy\nthrough a one-parameter generalisation. Some fundamental properties of these\nextended divergences are also explored.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
