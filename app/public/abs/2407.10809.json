While relativity makes these effects inaccessible using objects\nin motion, synthetic motion - enabled via space-time modulated internal degrees\nof freedom - is free from these constraints. Here we observe synthetic velocity\nof a reflectivity modulation travelling on an Indium-Tin-Oxide (ITO) interface,\ngenerated by ultrafast laser illumination at multiple positions and times. The\ninteraction of the moving reflectivity modulation with a probe light beam acts\nas a non-separable spatio-temporal transformation that diffracts the light,\nchanging its frequency and momentum content. The recorded frequency-momentum\ndiffraction pattern is defined by the velocity of the diffracted probe wave\nrelative to the modulation. Our experiments open a path towards mimicking\nrelativistic mechanics and developing programmable spatio-temporal\ntransformations of light.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
