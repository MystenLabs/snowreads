We assume that the residue field $k$ of $\\nu$ is contained in\n$R$. An algorithm for constructing a generating sequences for $\\nu$ in $R$ is\nprovided. This is a generalization of our previous algorithm where only\nvaluations of rational rank 1 were considered. We then give a comparison\nexample of a rational rank 3 valuation centered in a ring of polynomials in\nthree variables for which we explicitly compute a set of key polynomials and a\ngenerating sequence.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
