For this, a\nKoopman eigenstructure assignment problem is solved, which amounts to determine\na feedback of the Koopman open-loop eigenfunctionals assigning a desired finite\nset of closed-loop Koopman eigenvalues and eigenfunctionals to the closed-loop\nsystem. It is shown that the designed controller only needs a finite number of\nopen-loop Koopman eigenvalues and modes of the state. They are determined by\nextending the classical Krylov-DMD to parabolic systems. For this, only a\nfinite number of pointlike outputs and their temporal samples as well as\ntemporal samples of the inputs are required resulting in a data-driven solution\nof the eigenstructure assignment problem. Exponential stability of the\nclosed-loop system in the presence of small Krylov-DMD errors is verified. An\nunstable diffusion-reaction system demonstrates the new data-driven controller\ndesign technique for distributed-parameter systems.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
