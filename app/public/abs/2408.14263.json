Using this, he proved a generalized Arrow's Impossibility Theorem\nusing combinatorial arguments. This paper provides another proof of this\ngeneralized Arrow's Impossibility Theorem, using the idea of algebraic\ntopology.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Economics/Theoretical Economics","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
