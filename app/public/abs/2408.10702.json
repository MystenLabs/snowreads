The Rowland torus\ngeometry describes how gratings and detectors need to be positioned to optimize\nthe spectral resolving power. We describe how an on-axis Rowland geometry can\nbe tilted to accommodate blazed gratings. In this geometry, two channels with\nseparate optical axes can share the same detectors (double tilted Rowland\nspectrograph, DTRS). Small offsets between the channels can mitigate the effect\nof chip gaps and reduce the alignment requirements during the construction of\nthe instrument. The DTRS concept is especially useful for sub-apertured\nmirrors, because it allows an effective use of space in the entrance aperture\nof a spacecraft. One mission that applies this concept is the Arcus Probe.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
