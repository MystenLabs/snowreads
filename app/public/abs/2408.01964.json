However, their robustness,\nespecially on heterogeneous graphs, remains underexplored, particularly against\nadversarial attacks. This paper proposes HeteroKRLAttack, a targeted evasion\nblack-box attack method for heterogeneous graphs. By integrating reinforcement\nlearning with a Top-K algorithm to reduce the action space, our method\nefficiently identifies effective attack strategies to disrupt node\nclassification tasks. We validate the effectiveness of HeteroKRLAttack through\nexperiments on multiple heterogeneous graph datasets, showing significant\nreductions in classification accuracy compared to baseline methods. An ablation\nstudy underscores the critical role of the Top-K algorithm in enhancing attack\nperformance. Our findings highlight potential vulnerabilities in current models\nand provide guidance for future defense strategies against adversarial attacks\non heterogeneous graphs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
