The mainstay of these simulations is represented by eddy\nviscosity based turbulence models. Eddy viscosity models are computationally\ncheap due to their underlying simplifications, but their predictions are also\nsubject to structural errors. At the moment, the only method available to\nforecast these uncertainties is the Eigenspace Perturbation Method. This\nmethod's strictly physics-based approach frequently results in unreasonably\nhigh uncertainty bounds, which drive the creation of extremely cautious\ndesigns. To tackle this problem, we employ a strategy based on deep learning.\nIn order to control the perturbations, our trained deep learning models\nforecast the appropriate amount of disturbance to apply to the anticipated\nReynolds stresses. A Convolutional Neural Network is used to carry out this,\nand it is trained to distinguish between high fidelity data, which is a mapping\nof flow characteristics, and model projections based on eddy viscosity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
