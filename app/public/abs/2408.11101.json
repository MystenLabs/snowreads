By allowing coherent evolution of quantum systems and entanglement\nacross multiple probes, the precision of estimating a fully connected $k$-body\ninteraction can scale up to $(n^kt)^{-1}$, where $n$ is the number of probes\nand $t$ is the probing time. However, the optimal scaling may no longer be\nachievable under quantum noise, and it is important to apply quantum error\ncorrection in order to recover this limit. In this work, we study the\nperformance of stabilizer quantum error correcting codes in estimating\nmany-body Hamiltonians under noise. When estimating a fully connected $ZZZ$\ninteraction under single-qubit noise, we showcase three families of stabilizer\ncodes -- thin surface codes, quantum Reed--Muller codes and Shor codes -- that\nachieve the scalings of $(nt)^{-1}$, $(n^2t)^{-1}$ and $(n^3t)^{-1}$,\nrespectively, all of which are optimal with $t$. We further discuss the\nrelation between stabilizer structure and the scaling with $n$, and identify\nseveral no-go theorems. For instance, we find codes with constant-weight\nstabilizer generators can at most achieve the $n^{-1}$ scaling, while the\noptimal $n^{-3}$ scaling is achievable if and only if the code bears a\nrepetition code substructure, like in Shor code.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
