It combines the\nspectral algorithm to accelerate convergence. The method is applicable not only\nto single-agent dynamic optimization problems, but also to multi-agent dynamic\ngames, which previously proposed methods cannot deal with. Moreover, the\nproposed algorithm is not limited to models with specific functional forms, and\napplies to models with multiple continuous actions. This study shows the\nresults of numerical experiments, showing the effective performance of the\nproposed algorithm.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
