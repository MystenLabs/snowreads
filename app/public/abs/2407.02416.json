In this paper, I construct\na general mesoscopic description of finite-sized populations of stochastic\ncoupled oscillators and apply it to study the stochastic Kuramoto model. From\nsuch a mesoscopic description it is possible to obtain the natural,\nmultiplicative fluctuations of the oscillator ensemble. The analysis allows one\nto derive highly accurate, closed expressions for the stochastic Kuramoto\nmodel's order parameter for the first time. Moreover, it is possible to get\nnovel insights into the system's fluctuations and the synchronization\ntransition's critical exponents which were inaccessible before.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
