We focus on the dynamics of tripartite entanglement\nthrough the lens of the Markov gap -- a computable quantity that signals\nirreducible tripartite entanglement when positive. In the XX spin chain, we\nshow that the Markov gap is positive at intermediate times, implying the\npresence of tripartite entanglement. After a time delay, the Markov gap\nincreases and then decays at longer times, thus exhibiting an entanglement\nbarrier. We argue that those qualitative features are consistent with an\ninterpretation of the spreading of tripartite entanglement by triplets of\ntripartite-entangled quasiparticles.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
