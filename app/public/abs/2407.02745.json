The problem seeks to find a low-cost dynamically\nfeasible trajectory for the robot. The problem is challenging as it requires\nsolving a non-linear optimization problem that often has many local minima due\nto the complex terrain. To address the challenge, we propose a method called\nPareto-optimal Warm-started Trajectory Optimization (PWTO) that attempts to\ncombine the benefits of graph search and trajectory optimization, two very\ndifferent approaches to planning. PWTO first creates a state lattice using\nsimplified dynamics of the robot and leverages a multi-objective graph search\nmethod to obtain a set of paths. Each of the paths is then used to warm-start a\nlocal trajectory optimization process, so that different local minima are\nexplored to find a globally low-cost solution. In our tests, the solution cost\ncomputed by PWTO is often less than half of the costs computed by the\nbaselines. In addition, we verify the trajectories generated by PWTO in Gazebo\nsimulation in complex terrains with both wheeled and quadruped robots.
