Yet,\ndata-driven DLO dynamics models require large training data sets while their\npredictions often do not generalize, whereas physics-based models rely on good\napproximations of physical phenomena and often lack accuracy. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a physics-informed neural ODE capable of predicting\nagile movements with significantly less data and hyper-parameter tuning. In\nparticular, we model DLOs as serial chains of rigid bodies interconnected by\npassive elastic joints in which interaction forces are predicted by neural\nnetworks. The proposed model accurately predicts the motion of an\nrobotically-actuated aluminium rod and an elastic foam cylinder after being\ntrained on only thirty seconds of data.\n  The project code and data are available at:\n\\url{https://tinyurl.com/neuralprba}\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
