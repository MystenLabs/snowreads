The last few years have seen an extensive growth in\nCRA protocol proposals, showing a variety of designs guided by different\nnetwork topologies, hardware assumptions and other functional requirements.\nHowever, they differ in their trust assumptions, adversary models and role\ndescriptions making it difficult to uniformly assess their security guarantees.\nIn this paper we present Catt, a unifying framework for CRA protocols that\nenables them to be compared systematically, based on a comprehensive study of\n40 CRA protocols and their adversary models. Catt characterises the roles that\ndevices can take and based on these we develop a novel set of security\nproperties for CRA protocols. We then classify the security aims of all the\nstudied protocols. We illustrate the applicability of our security properties\nby encoding them in the tamarin prover and verifying the SIMPLE+ protocol\nagainst them.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
