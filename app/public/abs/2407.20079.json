In particular, we\nshow that, under natural structural assumptions, the minimizers are bounded and\ncontinuous in the interior of the ambient domain (and, in fact, also continuous\nup to the boundary under some mild additional hypothesis).\n  We show that these results are also essentially optimal, since in general the\nminimizer is not necessarily continuous across the boundary.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
