However, their iterative denoising process, initiated from\nGaussian noise, often results in slow inference speeds. The Image-to-Image\nSchr\\\"odinger Bridge (I$^2$SB), which begins with the corrupted image, presents\na promising alternative as a prior for addressing inverse problems. In this\nwork, we introduce the Measurement Embedded Schr\\\"odinger Bridge (MESB). MESB\nestablishes Schr\\\"odinger Bridges between the distribution of corrupted images\nand the distribution of clean images given observed measurements. Based on\noptimal transport theory, we derive the forward and backward processes of MESB.\nThrough validation on diverse inverse problems, our proposed approach exhibits\nsuperior performance compared to existing Schr\\\"odinger Bridge-based inverse\nproblems solvers in both visual quality and quantitative metrics.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
