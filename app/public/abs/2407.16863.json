Representative methods\nmanage to align different views motivated by advances in contrastive learning.\nOur empirical study finds the pervasive presence of imbalance in real-world\ngraphs, which is in principle contradictory to the motivation of alignment. In\nthis paper, we first propose a novel metric, the Aggregation Class Distance, to\nempirically quantify structural disparities among different graphs. To address\nthe challenge of view imbalance, we propose Balanced Multi-Relational Graph\nClustering (BMGC), comprising unsupervised dominant view mining and dual\nsignals guided representation learning. It dynamically mines the dominant view\nthroughout the training process, synergistically improving clustering\nperformance with representation learning. Theoretical analysis ensures the\neffectiveness of dominant view mining. Extensive experiments and in-depth\nanalysis on real-world and synthetic datasets showcase that BMGC achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, underscoring its superiority in addressing the\nview imbalance inherent in multi-relational graphs.
