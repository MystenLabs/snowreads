We consider multiple graph models as representations of this\nproblem, and use techniques from graph rigidity theory to determine\nidentifiability. Biologically, our models come from Hi-C data, microscopy data,\nand combinations thereof. Mathematically, we use unit ball and sphere packing\nmodels, as well as models consisting of distance and inequality constraints. In\neach setting, we describe and/or derive new results on realisability and\nuniqueness. We then propose a 3D reconstruction method based on semidefinite\nprogramming and apply it to synthetic and real data sets using our models.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Genomics","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
