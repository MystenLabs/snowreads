In particular, the skein algebra is a\ncommutative polynomial algebra in $n-1$ generators, where each generator is\nrepresented by an explicit $\\mathrm{SL}(n)$ web, without crossings, on the\nsurface. This includes the case $q=1$, where the skein algebra is identified\nwith the coordinate ring of the $\\mathrm{SL}(n)$ character variety of the twice\npunctured sphere. The proof of both the spanning and linear independence\nproperties of the basis depends on the so-called $\\mathrm{SL}(n)$ quantum trace\nmap, due originally to Bonahon-Wong in the case $n=2$. A consequence of the\nproof is that the polynomial algebra sits as a distinguished subalgebra of the\nL\\^{e}-Sikora $\\mathrm{SL}(n)$ stated skein algebra of the annulus. We end by\ndiscussing the relationship with Fock-Goncharov duality.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
