We\nobtain similar rapid mixing results for the simple random walks on the\n$1$-skeleta of the type-$B$ and type-$D$ associahedra. We adapt Eppstein and\nFrishberg's technique to obtain the same bound of $O(n^3\\log^3 n)$ in type $B$\nand a bound of $O(n^{13} \\log^2 n)$ in type $D$; in the process, we establish\nan expansion bound that is tight up to logarithmic factors in type $B$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"D4puxeGIYq-h2NRRg-2l0FGrGMJgObjENlmNFc-QccI","pdfSize":"482408"}
