This dimensionless continuation criterion is analogous to the\ncelebrated result of Beale--Kato--Majda for the incompressible Euler and\nNavier--Stokes equations. A similar continuation criterion, formulated in terms\nof the time integral of the supremum of the vorticity, velocity gradient and\ncurrent gradient, is established for the Hall-MHD with resistivity as well.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
