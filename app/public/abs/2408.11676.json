Consequently, we have a generic\ninterpretation of the principal components estimator as the normalised\nprincipal components of the statically common space. We illustrate why this can\nbe useful for the interpretation of the PC-estimated factors, performing an\nasymptotic theory without rotation matrices and avoiding singularity issues in\nfactor augmented regressions.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
