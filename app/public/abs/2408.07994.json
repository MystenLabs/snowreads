The goal of\nthe notes is to explain the merits of algebraic quantum field theory to a broad\naudience, and to explore (i) how to know when a particular question calls for\nan algebraic answer, (ii) how to apply the tools of algebraic QFT to such a\nproblem, and (iii) why quantum field theorists of all stripes stand to benefit\nfrom a basic knowledge of algebraic quantum fields. The first lecture focuses\non the big-picture motivation behind the algebraic approach to quantum field\ntheory, and an elaboration of its basic tools. Subsequent lectures explain some\nof the modern achievements of the algebraic toolkit, including an argument for\nthe averaged null energy condition and an enhanced understanding of entropy for\nsemiclassical black holes.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
