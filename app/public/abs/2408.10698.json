Relativistic hydrodynamics plays a crucial role in\nunderstanding the behavior of fluids in high-energy astrophysical phenomena and\nheavy-ion collisions. The canonical approach is explored in detail,\nhighlighting its foundational principles, mathematical formulations, and\npractical implications in modeling relativistic fluid dynamics. Following this,\nwe delve into the linear response theory, elucidating its relevance in the\ncontext of hydrodynamics. We analyze the response of relativistic fluids to\nexternal perturbations, discussing the theoretical framework and key results.\nThis dual focus aims to bridge the gap between theoretical foundations and\npractical applications, offering a robust perspective on the dynamic interplay\nbetween relativistic hydrodynamics and linear response theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"f6y4MJ2j2BTJTtC2NqpSI10QhXLT_YeXl7gD-0OTf08","pdfSize":"732373"}
