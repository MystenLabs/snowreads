We extend the\nmechanism, known as the axion-magnetic resonance (AMR), from laser experiments\nto axion helioscopes and demonstrate its potential in covering QCD axion\nparameter space. Specifically, we apply AMR to the CAST experiment legacy, make\nprojections for the upcoming IAXO experiment, and assess its implications for\nboth axion-like particles and QCD axions. We observe considerable improvement\nin the experiment's sensitivity reach in all cases.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
