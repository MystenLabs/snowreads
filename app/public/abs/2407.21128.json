Due to inherent topological constraints,\nthese maps manifest a diverse structure that includes singularities similar to\nharmonic maps, branch points reminiscent of minimal surfaces, and the intricate\nfree-boundary behavior of the obstacle problem. The complexity of these maps\nposes significant challenges to their analysis.\n  In this paper, we first focus on constraint maps with uniformly convex\nobstacles and establish continuity (and therefore higher-order regularity)\nwithin a uniform neighborhood of the free boundary. More precisely, thanks to a\nnew quantitative unique continuation principle near singularities (which is new\neven in the setting of classical harmonic maps), we prove that, in the\nuniformly convex setting, topological singularities can only lie in the\ninterior of the contact set. We then establish the optimality of this result.\n  Second, while exploring the structure of the free boundary, we investigate\nthe presence of branch points and show how they lead to completely new types of\nsingularities not present in the scalar case.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"SbHJIoCLpUvBtmcEY8lkxlJnlqpTpQ7qbC2Xu7PnUNc","pdfSize":"5326806"}
