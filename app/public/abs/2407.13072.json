Due to potential flaws in training data and\nhallucination in outputs, inaccuracy can significantly impact individuals\ninterests by distorting perceptions and leading to decisions based on flawed\ninformation. Therefore, ensuring these models accuracy is not only a technical\nnecessity but also a regulatory imperative. ICO call for evidence on the\naccuracy of Generative AI marks a timely effort in ensuring responsible\nGenerative AI development and use.\n  CREATe, as the Centre for Regulation of the Creative Economy based at the\nUniversity of Glasgow, has conducted relevant research involving intellectual\nproperty, competition, information and technology law. We welcome the ICO call\nfor evidence on the accuracy of Generative AI, and we are happy to highlight\naspects of data protection law and AI regulation that we believe should receive\nattention.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"vCstmuCY05adL2Hy_o4ZO2EiBDX_i6fxqrljFWILGMM","pdfSize":"204141"}
