Observations across different\nenvironments indicate that [Mn/Mg] increases on average with metallicity while\n[Ni/Mg] remains nearly constant. Chemical evolution models assuming SN Ia\nprogenitors with Chandrasekhar mass (M$_{\\text{Ch}}$) produce similar to\nidentical [Mn/Mg]-[Fe/H] and [Ni/Mg]-[Fe/H] patterns to those observed in the\nexamined UFD and dSph galaxies, without needing to invoke a substantial\nfraction of sub-M$_{\\text{Ch}}$ progenitors that changes across the different\nenvironments, as claimed by some previous chemical evolution studies. We note\nthough that the observed UFD sample is still statistically poor to draw firm\nconclusions. Sub-M$_{\\text{Ch}}$ progenitors in our dSph models systematically\nunder produce both [Mn/Mg] and [Ni/Mg], with the 1M$_{\\odot}$ model explaining\na number of outliers in [Ni/Fe], while the outliers in [Mn/Mg] require higher\nsub-M$_{\\text{Ch}}$ progenitor masses. The average dispersion of [X/Mg] from\nour UFD model ranges between $0.20$ and $0.25$ for iron-peak elements, with the\nexception of [Sc/Mg] that has $\\sigma \\approx 0.39$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
