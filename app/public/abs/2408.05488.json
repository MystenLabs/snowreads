As such, engineers and users interacting with the\nresulting policy of behavior might benefit from obtaining automated\nexplanations about these planners' decisions offline or online. This paper\nfocuses on the information within the Monte Carlo Tree Search data structure.\nGiven its construction, this information contains much of the reasoning of the\nsequential decision-making algorithm and is essential for its explainability.\nWe show novel methods using information theoretic tools for the simplification\nand reduction of the Monte Carlo Tree Search and the extraction of information.\nSuch information can be directly used for the construction of human\nunderstandable explanations. We show that basic explainability quantities can\nbe calculated with limited additional computational cost, as an integrated part\nof the Monte Carlo Tree Search construction process. We focus on the\ntheoretical and algorithmic aspects and provide examples of how the methods\npresented here can be used in the construction of human understandable\nexplanations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
