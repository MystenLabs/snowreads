This study presents a real-time system\ndesigned to detect drowsiness using the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) and facial\nlandmark detection techniques. The system leverages Dlibs pre-trained shape\npredictor model to accurately detect and monitor 68 facial landmarks, which are\nused to compute the EAR. By establishing a threshold for the EAR, the system\nidentifies when eyes are closed, indicating potential drowsiness. The process\ninvolves capturing a live video stream, detecting faces in each frame,\nextracting eye landmarks, and calculating the EAR to assess alertness. Our\nexperiments show that the system reliably detects drowsiness with high accuracy\nwhile maintaining low computational demands. This study offers a strong\nsolution for real-time drowsiness detection, with promising applications in\ndriver monitoring and workplace safety. Future research will investigate\nincorporating additional physiological and contextual data to further enhance\ndetection accuracy and reliability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Y4x87vbfpBbPBWp7AdOCCBVUyxVNMguUCk9dDVclSLs","pdfSize":"306056"}
