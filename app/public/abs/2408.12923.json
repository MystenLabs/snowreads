We prove that the leading order long-distance behavior of the\ncorrelation functions for spins on the boundary is the same as for the\nnearest-neighbor model, up to an analytic multiplicative renormalization\nconstant. In particular, the scaling limit is the Pfaffian of an explicit\nmatrix. The proof is based on an exact representation of the generating\nfunction of correlations in terms of a Grassmann integral and on a multiscale\nanalysis thereof, generalizing previous results to include observables located\non the boundary.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4-3_fwRuIryaKZnYOd7fLpM0cJHeMzHZPads9Yvj0I4","pdfSize":"1665189"}
