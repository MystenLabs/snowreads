Let $i:Y\\to X$ be a closed subscheme of pure codimension $r$. Let $n$\nbe a natural number prime to $p$. Let $\\Lambda$ be a finite\n$\\mathbb{Z}/n$-module over $X$. In this case, the absolute purity conjectured\nby Grothendieck and proved by Gabber states that \\[\n  Ri^! \\Lambda\\cong \\Lambda_Y(-r)[-2r]\\in D_{\\textrm{\\'et}}(Y,\\Lambda) \\] For\nthe $n=p^m$-case, a dualizing sheaf was proposed by Milne\n\\cite{MilneValuesOfZeta}, namely the logarithmic de Rham-Witt sheaves\n$\\nu_m(r)$. But this doesn't work for all degrees for the \\'etale cohomology.\nIt is however conjectured that this works for the tame cohomology. In this\npaper we make this work following the proof of Milne in loc. cit. by replacing\n\\'etale by tame cohomology and assuming resolution of singularities in positive\ncharacteristic. We obtain the following isomorphism \\[ Ri^! \\nu_m(n)\\cong\n\\nu_m(n-r)[-r]. \\]\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
