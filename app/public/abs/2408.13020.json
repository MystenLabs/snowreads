The approach is motivated by the integrable system on Coulomb\nbranch. We give explicit computations of these Hamiltonian functions, using\nChevalley basis and a so-called Heisenberg algebra basis. For classical Lie\nalgebras we rediscover the lower order terms of the celebrated Gelfand-Zeitlin\nsystem. For exceptional types we computed the number of Hamiltonian functions\nassociated to each vertex of Dynkin diagram. They should be regarded as analogs\nof Gelfand-Zeitlin functions on exceptional type Lie algebras.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tcRNUOjG_gbTB7AdjB6SR-YfkG9tpd7t-2-619VzM_w","pdfSize":"286571"}
