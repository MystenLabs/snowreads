Among them, the conversion of CO2 with green H2 to sustainable\naviation fuel (SAF) with high energy density has gained much attention. It\noffers a promising way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, address the fossil\nfuel crises, and transform a climate killer into valuable products. However,\nthis low-carbon technology is intrinsically complicated. It involves the\ndevelopment of a catalyst, the design of a reaction system, and its operation\nand product refining. Hence, it is important to understand the chemical process\nof CO2 hydrogenation in the reactor. In this study, numerical simulations of a\nfixed bed catalytic reactor for CO2-to-SAF conversion are conducted by coupling\nCFD with heterogeneous catalytic reactions at the catalytic surface. The heat\nand mass transfer between the catalyst surface and surrounding fluid flow are\nresolved in the simulation. A detailed understanding of the reacting flow and\ncatalytic processes is obtained from this study. The impact of operating\nparameters, i.e., temperature, pressure, mass flow rate, and the ratio between\nCO2 and H2, is also explored, which provides important insights into the\ncatalytic reactor design and operation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"puc-ES8-9vB-SZ6rgUZ3kSNXvY50QjevpSpn2OZrKpY","pdfSize":"972582"}
