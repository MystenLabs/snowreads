These simulations are of\nthick discs, with aspect ratios of order unity $h/r \\sim 1$, and with a\nmagnetic field geometry given by the standard low-magnetization \"SANE\"\nconfiguration. This work represents the first step in a wider analysis of this\nhighly relativistic region. We show that analytical expressions derived in the\n\"thin disc\" limit describe the numerical results remarkably well, despite the\nlarge aspect ratio of the flow. We further demonstrate that accretion within\nthis region is typically mediated via spiral arms, and that the geometric\nproperties of these spiral structures can be understood with a simple\nanalytical model. These results highlight how accretion within the plunging\nregion is fundamentally two dimensional in character, which may have a number\nof observational implications. We derive a modified theoretical description of\nthe pressure within the plunging region which accounts for turbulent heating\nand may be of use to black hole image modelling.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
