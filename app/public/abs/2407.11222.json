On $\\mathbb{S}^4$, localization maps this observable into an\ninteracting matrix model. Although conformal symmetry is broken at the quantum\nlevel, we show that within a specific regime of validity the matrix model\npredictions are consistent with perturbation theory in flat space up to order\n$g^6$. In particular, at this order, localization predicts two classes of\ncorrections proportional to $\\zeta(3)$ whose diagrammatic origins in field\ntheory are remarkably different. One class of $\\zeta(3)$-like corrections\nemerges via interference effects between evanescent terms and the ultraviolet\n(UV) poles associated with the bare coupling constant, while the second one\nstems from a Feynman integral which retains the same form in flat space and on\nthe sphere.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
