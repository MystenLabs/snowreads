Traditional edge detection models typically rely on complex\nConvolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformer architectures. Due to\ntheir numerous parameters and high computational demands, these models are\nlimited in their application on resource-constrained devices. This paper\npresents an ultra-lightweight edge detection model (UHNet), characterized by\nits minimal parameter count, rapid computation speed, negligible of\npre-training costs, and commendable performance. UHNet boasts impressive\nperformance metrics with 42.3k parameters, 166 FPS, and 0.79G FLOPs. By\nemploying an innovative feature extraction module and optimized residual\nconnection method, UHNet significantly reduces model complexity and\ncomputational requirements. Additionally, a lightweight feature fusion strategy\nis explored, enhancing detection accuracy. Experimental results on the BSDS500,\nNYUD, and BIPED datasets validate that UHNet achieves remarkable edge detection\nperformance while maintaining high efficiency. This work not only provides new\ninsights into the design of lightweight edge detection models but also\ndemonstrates the potential and application prospects of the UHNet model in\nengineering applications such as medical image processing.
