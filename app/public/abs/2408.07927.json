In this paper, we delve into the microscopic\nintricacies of cooperative player interactions by focusing on triadic motifs\nwithin passing networks. Employing a dataset compiled from 3,199 matches across\n18 premier football competitions, we identify successful passing activities and\nconstruct passing networks for both home and away teams. Our findings highlight\na pronounced disparity in passing efficiency, with home teams demonstrating\nsuperior performance relative to away teams. Through the identification and\nanalysis of 3-motifs, we find that the motifs with more bidirectional links are\nmore significant. It reveals that footballers exhibit a strong tendency towards\nbackward passes rather than direct forward attacks. Comparing the results of\ngames, we find that some motifs are related to the goal difference. It\nindicates that direct and effective forward passing significantly amplifies a\nteam's offensive capabilities, whereas an abundance of passbacks portends an\nelevated risk of offensive futility. These revelations affirm the efficacy of\nnetwork motif analysis as a potent analytical tool for unveiling the\nfoundational components of passing dynamics among footballers and for decoding\nthe complex tactical behaviors and interaction modalities that underpin team\nperformance.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
