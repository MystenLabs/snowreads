The spatial coherence is established\nas a result of the collective (cooperative) coupling of the atoms to the light,\nand is qualitatively different from the coherence of a laser. Specifically, the\ncoherence in collective spontaneous emission does not rely on population\ninversion and stimulated emission, is governed by anti-phasing of the dipoles\n(subradiance), and the key figure-of-merit for the observed coherence is N\n/(L/{\\lambda}) . Here, N is the number of atoms in the ensemble, L is the size\nof the sample, and {\\lambda} is the wavelength of the emitted light.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
