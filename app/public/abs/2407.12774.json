As a result,\nanalysts routinely entertain multiple market definitions to ensure the\nresilience of their conclusions. I propose a simple framework for conducting\norganized sensitivity analysis with respect to market definition. I model\ncandidate market definitions as partially ordered and use a Hasse diagram, a\ndirected acyclic graph representing a finite partial order, to summarize the\nsensitivity analysis. I use the Shapley value and the Shapley-Shubik power\nindex to quantify the average marginal contribution of each firm in driving the\nconclusion. I illustrate the method's usefulness with an application to the\nAlbertsons/Safeway (2015) merger.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
