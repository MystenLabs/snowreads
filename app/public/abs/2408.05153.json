Solving it would open up many\nnew opportunities for fundamental studies, with potential impact on future data\nstorage technologies. Ideally, step-like magnetic field transients with\ninfinitely fast rise time would serve this purpose. Here, we develop a new\napproach to generate ultrafast magnetic field steps, based on an ultrafast\nquench of supercurrents in a superconductor. Magnetic field steps with\nmillitesla amplitude, picosecond risetimes and slew rates approaching 1 GT/s\nare achieved. We test the potential of this technique by coherently rotating\nthe magnetization in a ferrimagnet. With suitable improvements in the geometry\nof the device, these magnetic steps can be made both larger and faster, leading\nto new applications that range from quenches across phase transitions to\ncomplete switching of magnetic order parameters.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
