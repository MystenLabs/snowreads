This allows us to\ndefine the stochastic six-vertex speed process, whose law we show to be ergodic\nand stationary for the dynamics of the multi-class stochastic six-vertex\nprocess. The proof follows the scheme developed in [ACG23] for ASEP and\nrequires the development of precise bounds on the fluctuations of the height\nfunction of the stochastic six-vertex model around its limit shape using\nmethods from integrable probability. As part of the proof, we also obtain a\nnovel geometric stochastic domination result that states that a second-class\nparticle to the right of any number of third-class particles will at any fixed\ntime be overtaken by at most a geometric number of third-class particles.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
