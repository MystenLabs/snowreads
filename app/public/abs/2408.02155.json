The newly developed\nSPINEX-Optimization algorithm incorporates a nuanced approach to optimization\nin low and high dimensions by accounting for similarity across various\nsolutions. We conducted extensive benchmarking tests comparing\nSPINEX-Optimization against ten single and eight multi/many optimization\nalgorithms over 55 mathematical benchmarking functions and realistic scenarios.\nThen, we evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of\nscalability and computational efficiency across low and high dimensions, number\nof objectives, and population sizes. The results indicate that\nSPINEX-Optimization consistently outperforms most algorithms and excels in\nmanaging complex scenarios, especially in high dimensions. The algorithm's\ncapabilities in explainability, Pareto efficiency, and moderate complexity are\nhighlighted through in-depth experiments and visualization methods.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pVfAkj6_-a_QEzqLOTmgYupsEhqClguHv7xFVVsgifo","pdfSize":"3437908"}
