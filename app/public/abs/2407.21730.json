Whilst there\nare several experimental protocols for witnessing entanglement, detecting\nquantum discord remains far more elusive. A recently proposed quantum discord\nwitness offers an experimentally accessible set-up which allows the quantum\ndiscord to be witnessed through a non-linear combination of correlation\nfunctions. Interestingly, the experimental set-up can be mapped to Bayesian\ngame theory allowing for an extended generalisation of the proposed witness.\nSubsequently, it is shown that there is a direct link between the expected\npayoff in Bayesian game theory and the previously proposed quantum discord\nwitness by uniting these two concepts through the established CHSH game.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
