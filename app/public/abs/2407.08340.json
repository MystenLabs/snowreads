The aim of MVC is to exploit the inherent consistency and\ncomplementarity among different views, thereby integrating information from\nmultiple perspectives to improve clustering outcomes.\n  Despite extensive research in MVC, most existing methods focus predominantly\non harnessing complementary information across views to enhance clustering\neffectiveness, often neglecting the structural information among samples, which\nis crucial for exploring sample correlations. To address this gap, we introduce\na novel framework, termed Structured Latent Representation Learning based\nMulti-View Clustering method (SLRL). SLRL leverages both the complementary and\nstructural information. Initially, it learns a common latent representation for\nall views. Subsequently, to exploit the structural information among samples, a\nk-nearest neighbor graph is constructed from this common latent representation.\nThis graph facilitates enhanced sample interaction through graph learning\ntechniques, leading to a structured latent representation optimized for\nclustering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLRL not only competes well\nwith existing methods but also sets new benchmarks in various multi-view\ndatasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4IUYf4ZawZGAWGirOae3JY6ARnAaPwx8COmEtO427sw","pdfSize":"1133765"}
