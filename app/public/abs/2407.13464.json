We use the Jacquet-Langlands correspondence to\ndescribe their partial $L$-functions via cuspidal automorphic representations\nof the group $\\mathrm{GL}_2'(\\mathbb{A})$ over a quaternion algebra. Using\nideas inspired by results of Grobner and Raghuram we are then able to compute\nthe critical values as a Shalika period up to a rational multiple.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
