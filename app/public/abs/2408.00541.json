Conventional\ncomponents of a confocal laser-scanning microscope, such as microscope\nobjectives and the piezo translation stages, are replaced by two affordable\nBlu-ray optical pickup units. A Hanbury Brown and Twiss setup is used to\nidentify single photon emission. The proposed approach is inexpensive and\nsimple and lowers the entry-level to single photon research for quantum\ntechnologies. This enables student lab experiments or demonstration experiments\nat schools and shows that efficient sources of quantum light can be made from\nstandard components compatible with established industry processes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
