Our data consists in a\nsequence of partial observations of a fractional random walk on $G$. The\nobservations are partial in the sense that they are limited to a fixed,\nobservable subset $B \\subseteq X$, while the random walk is fractional in the\nsense that it allows long jumps with a probability $P$ decreasing as a\nfractional power of the distance along the graph. The transition probability\n$P$ also depends on $\\gamma$. We show that this kind of random walk data allows\nfor the reconstruction of the amount of vertices $\\|X\\|$, the edge set $E$ and\nthe conductivity $\\gamma$ up to natural constraints, which we discuss. We also\nshow a characterization of the random walk data in terms of the corresponding\ntransition matrices $P$ , which highlights a new surprising nonlocal property.\nThis work is motivated by the recent strong interest in the study of the\nfractional Calder\\'on problem in the Riemannian setting.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pdcKT_6ngU5EAif0nKkokFjDiJ7j9lWog9I_QkFsCPI","pdfSize":"484828"}
