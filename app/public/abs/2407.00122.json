In this contribution,\nwe show two new physics interpretations: heavy vector-like quark models and a\nMeV scale sterile neutrino models. The super tau-charm facility will directly\nprobe the other CKM unitarity conditions related to $V_{cd}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
