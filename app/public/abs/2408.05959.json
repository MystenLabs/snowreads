However, its reliance on manually\ncrafted and tuned probabilistic rule sets, also called grammars, presents a\nsignificant bottleneck, diverging from approaches that allow rule learning from\nexamples. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to this challenge by\nintroducing a genetic programming-based optimization framework for learning\nhierarchical rule sets automatically. Our proposed method ``Markov Senior''\nfocuses on extracting positional and distance relations from single input\nsamples to construct probabilistic rules to be used by Markov Junior. Using a\nKullback-Leibler divergence-based fitness measure, we search for grammars to\ngenerate content that is coherent with the given sample. To enhance\nscalability, we introduce a divide-and-conquer strategy that enables the\nefficient generation of large-scale content. We validate our approach through\nexperiments in generating image-based content and Super Mario levels,\ndemonstrating its flexibility and effectiveness. In this way, ``Markov Senior''\nallows for the wider application of Markov Junior for tasks in which an example\nmay be available, but the design of a generative rule set is infeasible.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
