We show convergence of the\nresulting iteration using Hilbert space norms, which allows us to obtain\nalgorithms that are robust with respect to finite dimensional realizations via\nGalerkin projections. We investigate in particular the behavior of the\niterative scheme for discontinuous Galerkin discretizations in the angular\nvariable in combination with subspaces that are derived from related diffusion\nproblems. The performance of the resulting schemes is investigated in numerical\nexamples for highly anisotropic scattering problems with heterogeneous\nparameters.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
