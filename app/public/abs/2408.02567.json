These limits are taken along geodesics of $g$, yield\nsimpler metrics of Lorentzian signature, and are isometric invariants. They can\nalso be seen to arise locally from a suitable expansion of $g$ in Fermi\ncoordinates, and they directly encode much of $g$'s geometry. For example,\nnormal Jacobi fields of $g$ are encoded as geodesics of its plane wave limits.\nFurthermore, $g$ will have constant sectional curvature if and only if each of\nits plane wave limits is locally conformally flat. In fact $g$ will be flat, or\nRicci-flat, or geodesically complete, if and only if all of its plane wave\nlimits are, respectively, the same. Many other curvature properties are\npreserved in the limit, including certain inequalities, such as signed Ricci\ncurvature.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IEXZKez2URyfU1kFC6JY9iU6Qpxc11bOc0FydYjdDao","pdfSize":"231610","txDigest":"Ad4UGAxw738t3AFM9LoefYd3bUWiuZbe8uz3VjvBP8QW","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
