In this work, we propose\nand simulate the occurrence of Rabi and Ramsey oscillations to feasibly\nconstruct a minimal Majorana qubit in the quantum dot setup. Our real-time\nresults incorporate realistic effects, e.g., charge noise and leakage,\nreflecting the latest experimental progress. We demonstrate that Majorana\nqubits with larger energy gaps exhibit significantly enhanced performance --\nlonger dephasing times, higher quality factors, reduced leakage probabilities,\nand improved visibilities -- compared to those with smaller gaps and with\nconventional quantum dot-based charge qubits. We introduce a method for reading\nout Majorana qubits via quantum capacitance measurements. Our work paves the\nway for future experiments on realizing Majorana qubits in quantum\ndot-superconductor arrays.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
