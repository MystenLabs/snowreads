Semantic\ncommunication, a novel paradigm, holds the promise of significantly curtailing\ncommunication overhead and latency by transmitting only task-relevant\ninformation. Despite numerous efforts in both theoretical frameworks and\npractical implementations of semantic communications, a substantial\ntheory-practice gap complicates the theoretical analysis and interpretation,\nparticularly when employing black-box machine learning techniques. This article\ninitially delves into information-theoretic metrics such as semantic entropy,\nsemantic distortions, and semantic communication rate to characterize the\ninformation flow in semantic communications. Subsequently, it provides a\nguideline for implementing semantic communications to ensure both theoretical\ninterpretability and communication effectiveness.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
