Recent research in option pricing shows that modeling the\nunderlying log price with an additive process has advantages in easier\nconstruction of the risk-neural measure, an explicit option pricing formula and\ncharacteristic function, and more flexibility to fit the implied volatility\nsurface. Still, the challenge of calibrating an additive model arises from its\ntime-dependent parameterization, for which one has to prescribe parametric\nfunctions for the term structure. For this, we propose the neural term\nstructure model to utilize feedforward neural networks to represent the term\nstructure, which alleviates the difficulty of designing parametric functions\nand thus attenuates the misspecification risk. Numerical studies with S\\&P 500\noption data are conducted to evaluate the performance of the neural term\nstructure.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance","Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance","Quantitative Finance/Pricing of Securities","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ioo-xUSDbsXlE2zE2DkOfVPXAQ6ZaRl77zonEBRXBWM","pdfSize":"850728","txDigest":"AeKJpaeRdyasqANhUBymF3sNKBjZrunKMQERZ8AYhhJw","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
