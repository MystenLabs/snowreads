Tracking the introduction of\nnumerical regression is often delayed until it provokes unexpected bug for the\nend-user. In this paper, we introduce Verificarlo CI, a continuous integration\nworkflow for the numerical optimization and debugging of a code over the course\nof its development. We demonstrate applicability of Verificarlo CI on two\ntest-case applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
