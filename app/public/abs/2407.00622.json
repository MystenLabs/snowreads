We introduce a\n$\\mathbb{Z}$-grading on the Lie algebra $\\mathrm{sym}_{\\mathcal{L}}^{\\tau^W}\n(\\mathcal E)$ of all nonlocal Laurent polynomial symmetries of the rYME and\nprove that both the operators $\\mathcal{R}^q$ and $\\mathcal{R}^m$ are\n$\\mathbb{Z}$-graded automorphisms of the underlying vector space on the set\n$\\mathrm{sym}_{\\mathcal{L}}^{\\tau^W} (\\mathcal E)$. This inter alia implies\nthat all its vector subspaces formed by all homogeneous elements of a given\nfixed degree (i.e. a weight in the context below) are mutually isomorphic, and\nthus each of them can be uniquely reconstructed from the vector space of all\nhomogeneous symmetries of the zero degree. To the best of our knowledge, such a\nresult is unparalleled in the current body of literature. The obtained results\nare used for the construction of a Lie subalgebra $V$ of\n$\\mathrm{sym}_{\\mathcal{L}}^{\\tau^W} (\\mathcal E)$ which contains all known to\nus nonlocal Laurent polynomial symmetries of the rYME. The Lie algebra $V$ is\nsubsequently described as the linear span of the orbits of a set of selected\nzero-weight symmetries - we refer to them as to the seed generators of $V$.\nFurther, we study the hierarchies of symmetries related to the seed generators\nunder the action of the group of recursion operators generated by\n$\\mathcal{R}^q$ and $\\mathcal{R}^m$. Finally, the linear\ndependence/independence of the (sub)set of generators of $V$ is discussed.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
