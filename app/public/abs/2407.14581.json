We demonstrate that\ndecoherence due to the spin-magnetic field coupling can be categorized into two\ndistinct factors: local decoherence, originating from the two-point correlation\nfunctions along each branch of the superposed trajectories, and nonlocal\ndecoherence, which arises from the correlation functions between the two\nsuperposed trajectories. These effects are linked to phase damping and\namplitude damping. We also show that if the quantum field is prepared in a\nthermal state, decoherence monotonically increases with the field temperature.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
