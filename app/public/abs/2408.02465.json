The key idea is to exploit the dissipative features of the\nsystem to derive a control on the tails of the infinite sums involved in the\nreaction terms. Classical solutions are also constructed for a suitable class\nof kinetic coefficients and initial conditions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
