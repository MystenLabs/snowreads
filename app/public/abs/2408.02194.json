In brief, an alternative description of a Lie algebroid\n$(A, [\\cdot, \\cdot], \\sharp)$ is a vector bundle comorphism $\\kappa$ defined as\nthe dual of the Poisson map $\\varepsilon: \\mathrm{T}^\\ast A \\rightarrow\n\\mathrm{T} A^\\ast$ associated with the Lie algebroid $A$. The framework of\ncomorphisms has proven to be a suitable language for describing higher-order\nanalogues of Lie algebroids from the perspective of the role played by (Lie)\nalgebroids in geometric mechanics. In this work, we uncover the classical\nalgebraic structures underlying the mysterious description of higher-order\nalgebroids through comorphisms. For the case where $k=2$, we establish\none-to-one correspondence between higher-order Lie algebroids and pairs\nconsisting of a two-term representation (up to homotopy) of a Lie algebroid and\na morphism to the adjoint representation of this algebroid.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9a3OCuQtGEjd5uocPhNf91r1-9ININPPHEEk33kSpSc","pdfSize":"817768"}
