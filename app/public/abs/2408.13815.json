We prove that the flow\npreserves the convexity, exists for all time, and converges smoothly to a\nspherical cap. This can be viewed as the fully nonlinear counterpart of the\nresult in \\cite{MWW}. As a byproduct, a high-order capillary isoperimetric\nratio (1.6) evolves monotonically along this flow, which yields a class of the\nAlexandrov-Fenchel inequalities.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
