It was proven in\n\\cite{CK2021-ANA} that there exist two critical curves that separate the global\nexistence and blow-up of weak solutions to the above problem. We improve this\nresult by providing sharp criteria for the dicothomy: global existence of weak\nsolution versus blow-up below and at these curves. Besides, there exist sharp\ncritical masses of initial data at the intersection of the two critical lines,\nwhich extend the well-known critical mass phenomenon in one-species\nKeller-Segel system in \\cite{BCL09-CVPDE} to two-species case.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
