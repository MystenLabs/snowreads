{"id":"2408.09171","title":"The Chemputer and Chemputation: A Universal Chemical Compound Synthesis\n  Machine","authors":"Leroy Cronin","authorsParsed":[["Cronin","Leroy",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Aug 2024 11:31:18 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-20","timestamp":1723894278000,"abstract":"  This work establishes a rigorous proof for the universality of the chemputer\nas a chemical synthesis machine, capable of constructing any stable and\nisolable molecule through a finite, expressible process. This process is\ngoverned by three key parameters: reagents, process conditions, and catalysts.\nAdditionally, the study introduces dynamic error correction mechanisms\nintegrated into each step of the synthesis pathway, ensuring real-time accuracy\nand reliability. The role of universally configurable hardware is also\nhighlighted, with the introduction of a 'chempiling' function that translates\nsynthesis pathways into executable hardware configurations. These advancements\ncollectively demonstrate the chemputer's capability to perform any feasible\nchemical synthesis, thereby establishing it as a universal tool in chemical\nmanufacturing and synthesis. I show that every finitely realizable chemical\nsynthesis process that can exist within the bounds of physical laws can be\nperfectly instantiated and executed by a universal chemputer, provided that the\nprocess can be completed within the finite number of reagent input vessels,\nreaction vessels, and product output vessels available, and that the error\ncorrection mechanisms are sufficiently robust to maintain the accuracy of the\nsynthesis within these constraints. Finally, I show that chemical reactions are\nnot implicit functions, but are an emergent property coming from the\ncombination of the reagents, process conditions, and catalysts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
