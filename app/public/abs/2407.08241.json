This phenomenon also reveals the unique property\nof the quantum black hole. The stochastic thermal motion of various\nthermodynamic states within the black hole system induces phase transitions,\nunder the influence of generalized free energy which obtained by extending\nMaxwell's construction. Through the analysis of Kramer escape rate, it is\ndiscovered that the qBTZ black hole thermodynamic system exhibits a bounce\neffect. Furthermore, the overall thermodynamic picture of the qBTZ black hole\nhas been obtained under different quantum backreactions.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
