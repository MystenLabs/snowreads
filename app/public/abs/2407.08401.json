Existing MPC control methods based on vehicle\nkinematics or dynamics have challenges such as difficult modeling, numerous\nparameters, strong nonlinearity, and high computational cost. To address these\nissues, this paper adapts an existing Data-driven MPC control method and\napplies it to autonomous vehicle steering control. This method avoids the need\nfor complex vehicle system modeling and achieves trajectory tracking with\nrelatively low computational time and small errors. We validate the control\neffectiveness of the algorithm in specific scenario through CarSim-Simulink\nsimulation and perform comparative analysis with PID and vehicle kinematics\nMPC, confirming the feasibility and superiority of it for vehicle steering\ncontrol.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
