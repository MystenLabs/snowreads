In [Jordan, PRL, 95(5):050501, 2005], Jordan proposed\nthe first quantum algorithm for estimating gradients of functions close to\nlinear, with exponential speedup in the black-box model. This quantum algorithm\nwas greatly enhanced and developed by [Gily\\'en, Arunachalam, and Wiebe, SODA,\npp. 1425-1444, 2019], providing a quantum algorithm with optimal query\ncomplexity $\\widetilde{\\Theta}(\\sqrt{d}/\\varepsilon)$ for a class of smooth\nfunctions of $d$ variables, where $\\varepsilon$ is the accuracy. This is\nquadratically faster than classical algorithms for the same problem.\n  In this work, we continue this research by proposing a new quantum algorithm\nfor another class of functions, namely, analytic functions $f(\\boldsymbol{x})$\nwhich are well-defined over the complex field. Given phase oracles to query the\nreal and imaginary parts of $f(\\boldsymbol{x})$ respectively, we propose a\nquantum algorithm that returns an $\\varepsilon$-approximation of its gradient\nwith query complexity $\\widetilde{O}(1/\\varepsilon)$. This achieves exponential\nspeedup over classical algorithms in terms of the dimension $d$. As an\nextension, we also propose two quantum algorithms for Hessian estimation,\naiming to improve quantum analogs of Newton's method. The two algorithms have\nquery complexity $\\widetilde{O}(d/\\varepsilon)$ and\n$\\widetilde{O}(d^{1.5}/\\varepsilon)$, respectively, under different\nassumptions. Moreover, if the Hessian is promised to be $s$-sparse, we then\nhave two new quantum algorithms with query complexity\n$\\widetilde{O}(s/\\varepsilon)$ and $\\widetilde{O}(sd/\\varepsilon)$,\nrespectively. The former achieves exponential speedup over classical\nalgorithms. We also prove a lower bound of $\\widetilde{\\Omega}(d)$ for Hessian\nestimation in the general case.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
