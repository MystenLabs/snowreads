Our algorithm allows massive\nparallelization of the computations on many core processors such as graphics\nprocessing units (GPUs). Our approach consists of a novel method of\nstratification which appears to be crucial for large scale parallelization. In\nthis way, we minimize the exposure to the memory requirements due to the\nstorage of simulations. Indeed, we note the lower memory overhead of the method\ncompared with previous works.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
