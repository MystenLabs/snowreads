We introduce a metric for\nmeasuring SSR performance and we propose a model which does SSR by combining a\nRNN-Transducer-based ASR system with an audio-prefixed language model (LM). The\nASR system transcribes ongoing audio and feeds the resulting transcripts, along\nwith an audio-dependent prefix, to the LM, which speculates likely completions\nfor the transcriptions. We experiment with a variety of ASR datasets on which\nshow the efficacy our method and the feasibility of SSR as a method of reducing\nASR latency.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
