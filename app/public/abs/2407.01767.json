This paper presents a transparent and\nreproducible user study aimed at evaluating the photorealism of real-world\nimages composed with virtual rendered objects, that have been generated using\nclassical environment capturing and rendering techniques. We adopted a\ntwo-alternative forced choice methodology to compare pairs of images created by\nintegrating virtual objects into real photographs, following a classic\npipeline. A control group with defined directional light parameters was\nincluded to validate the study's correctness. The findings revealed some\ninsights, suggesting that observers experienced difficulties in differentiating\nbetween rendered and real objects. This work establishes the groundwork for\nfuture studies, aimed at enhancing the visual fidelity and realism of virtual\nobjects in real-world environments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Q17cSTFRJiIJ2Siluzlxou33N7SN8tTjtY-hu01XYeI","pdfSize":"36920574"}
