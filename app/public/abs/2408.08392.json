Feasibility issues emerge from the\nassumption that each family requires certain services (such as accommodation,\nschool seats, or medical assistance), while there is an upper and, possibly, a\nlower quota on the number of service units provided at a given place. Besides\nstudying the problem of finding a feasible assignment, we also investigate two\nnatural optimization variants. In the first one, we allow families to express\npreferences over $P$, and we aim for a Pareto-optimal assignment. In a more\ngeneral setting, families can attribute utilities to each place in $P$, and the\ntask is to find a feasible assignment with maximum total utilities. We study\nthe computational complexity of all three variants in a multivariate fashion\nusing the framework of parameterized complexity. We provide fixed-parameter\ntractable algorithms for a handful of natural parameterizations, and complement\nthese tractable cases with tight intractability results.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
