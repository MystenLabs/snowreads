By using microwave frequency- and time-domain measurements, we directly\nobserve the strong confinement of electromagnetic energy at the mirror surface\ndue to the extended time delay required for the valley index flipping.\nMoreover, we experimentally demonstrate that both the degree of energy\nlocalization and quality factors of the topology-controlled photonic cavities\nare determined by the valley-flipping time which is controlled by the topology\nof the mirror. These results extend and complement the current design paradigm\nof topological photonic cavities.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
