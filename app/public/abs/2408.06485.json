In the present\npaper we investigate further this platform of quantum-like states. Firstly, we\ndiscuss a general protocol on how to construct synchronizing networks that\nallow for emergent states. We then study how gates can be implemented on those\nstates. This suggests the possibility of quantum-like computing on\nspecially-constructed classical networks. Finally, we define a notion of\nmeasurement that allows for non-Kolmogorov interference, a feature that\nseparates our model from a classical probabilistic system. This paper aims to\nexplore the mathematical structure of quantum-like resources, and shows how\narbitrary gates can be implemented by manipulating emergent states in those\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UhQI-ly-kpQ1scW0Gca5sFSalGskcF7DQmPT9AriKUQ","pdfSize":"2509773"}
