The framework allows for the presence of\nheavy tails and multivariate GARCH-type effects of unknown form among the stock\nreturns. The approach involves simultaneous testing of all pairwise\ncorrelations, followed by setting non-statistically significant elements to\nzero. This adaptive thresholding is achieved through sign-based Monte Carlo\nresampling within multiple testing procedures, controlling either the\ntraditional familywise error rate, a generalized familywise error rate, or the\nfalse discovery proportion. Subsequent shrinkage ensures that the final\ncovariance matrix estimate is positive definite and well-conditioned while\npreserving the achieved sparsity. Compared to alternative estimators, this new\nregularization method demonstrates strong performance in simulation experiments\nand real portfolio optimization.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
