In this work, we\nshow that approximating cell cycle time distributions in microbial colonies of\nC. glutamicum is possible without performing tracking, even at low temporal\nresolution. To this end, we infer the parameters of a stochastic multi-stage\nbirth process model using the Bayesian Synthetic Likelihood method at varying\ntemporal resolutions by subsampling microscopy sequences, for which ground\ntruth tracking is available. Our results indicate, that the proposed approach\nyields high quality approximations even at very low temporal resolution, where\ntracking fails to yield reasonable results.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
