However,\ncommon 4DCT methods reconstruct multiple breath cycles into a single, arbitrary\nbreath cycle which can lead to various artefacts, impacting the downstream\nclinical applications. Surrogate driven motion models can estimate continuous\nvariable motion across multiple cycles based on CT segments `unsorted' from\n4DCT, but it requires respiration surrogate signals with strong correlation to\nthe internal motion, which are not always available. The method proposed in\nthis study eliminates such dependency by adapting the hyper-gradient method to\nthe optimization of surrogate signals as hyper-parameters, while achieving\nbetter or comparable performance, as demonstrated on digital phantom\nsimulations and real patient data. Our method produces a high-quality\nmotion-compensated image together with estimates of the motion, including\nbreath-to-breath variability, throughout the image acquisition. Our method has\nthe potential to improve downstream clinical applications, and also enables\nretrospective analysis of open access 4DCT dataset where no respiration signals\nare stored.
