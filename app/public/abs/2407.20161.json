Previously, it is only known for a few cases and\nall the proofs rely on the Bogomolov-Gieseker conjecture of Bayer-Macr\\`i-Toda.\n  In this paper, we prove the Castelnuovo bound conjecture for any Calabi-Yau\n3-folds of Picard number one, up to a linear term and finitely many degree,\nwithout assuming the conjecture of Bayer-Macr\\`i-Toda. Furthermore, we prove an\neffective vanishing theorem for surface-counting invariants of Calabi-Yau\n4-folds of Picard number one. We also apply our techniques to study low-degree\ncurves on some explicit Calabi-Yau 3-folds.\n  Our approach is based on a general iterative method to obtain upper bounds\nfor the genus of one-dimensional closed subschemes in a fixed 3-fold, which is\na combination of classical techniques and the wall-crossing of weak stability\nconditions on derived categories, and works for any projective 3-fold with at\nworst isolated singularities over any algebraically closed field.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
