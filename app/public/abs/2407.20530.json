Despite significant progress, existing methods still have limitations\nin preserving and reconstructing fine details for optimal reconstruction,\nespecially at low bitrates. In this study, we introduce SuperCodec, a neural\nspeech codec that achieves state-of-the-art performance at low bitrates. It\nemploys a novel back projection method with selective feature fusion for\naugmented representation. Specifically, we propose to use Selective Up-sampling\nBack Projection (SUBP) and Selective Down-sampling Back Projection (SDBP)\nmodules to replace the standard up- and down-sampling layers at the encoder and\ndecoder, respectively. Experimental results show that our method outperforms\nthe existing neural speech codecs operating at various bitrates. Specifically,\nour proposed method can achieve higher quality reconstructed speech at 1 kbps\nthan Lyra V2 at 3.2 kbps and Encodec at 6 kbps.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
