RRLs were observed with NASA DSS-43\n70m antenna and the Green Bank Telescope in 108 lines-of-sight spanning -135\ndegrees < l < 60 degrees, at b=0 degrees. These positions were also observed in\n[N II] 122 um and 205 um lines with the Herschel Space Observatory. Combining\nRRL and [N II] 122 um and 205 um observations in 41 of 108 samples with high\nsignal-to-noise ratio, we studied ionized Nitrogen abundance distribution\nacross Galactocentric distances of 0-8 kpc. Combined with existing Solar\nneighborhood and Outer galaxy N/H abundance determinations, we studied this\nquantity's distribution within the Milky Way's inner 17 kpc for the first time.\nWe found a Nitrogen abundance gradient extending from Galactocentric radii of\n4-17 kpc in the Galactic plane, while within 0-4 kpc, the N/H distribution\nremained flat. The gradient observed at large Galactocentric distances supports\ninside-out galaxy growth with the additional steepening resulting from variable\nstar formation efficiency and/or radial flows in the Galactic disk, while the\ninner 4 kpc flattening, coinciding with the Galactic bar's onset, may be linked\nto radial flows induced by the bar potential. Using SOFIA/FIFI-LS and\nHerschel/PACS, we observed the [N III] 57 um line to trace doubly ionized gas\ncontribution in a sub-sample of sightlines. We found negligible N++\ncontributions along these sightlines, suggesting mostly singly ionized Nitrogen\noriginating from low ionization H II region outskirts.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
