We initiate a systematic study of pattern avoidance on Cayley\npermutations adopting a combinatorial species approach. Our methods lead to\nspecies equations, generating series, and counting formulas for Cayley\npermutations avoiding any pattern of length at most three. We also introduce\nthe species of primitive structures as a generalization of Cayley permutations\nwith no \"flat steps\". Finally, we explore various notions of Wilf equivalence\narising in this context.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
