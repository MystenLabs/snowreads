This task is\nchallenging due to the size and class imbalance of the dataset, subtle\ninter-class variations, and significant intra-class variability amongst\nsamples. In this paper, we document our approach in tackling this challenge\nthrough the use of ensemble classifier heads on pre-computed image embeddings.\nOur team (DS@GT) demonstrate that state-of-the-art self-supervised vision\nmodels can be utilized as robust feature extractors for downstream application\nof computer vision tasks without the need for task-specific fine-tuning on the\nvision backbone. Our approach achieved the best Track 3 score (0.345), accuracy\n(78.4%) and macro-F1 (0.577) on the private test set in post competition\nevaluation.
