However,\nthe presence of network interference, which arises from user interactions,\noften complicates this estimation process. Experimenters typically face\nchallenges in fully capturing the intricate structure of this interference,\nleading to less reliable estimates. To address this issue, we propose a novel\napproach that leverages surrogate networks and the pseudo inverse estimator.\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) We introduce the surrogate\nnetwork framework, which simulates the practical situation where experimenters\nbuild an approximation of the true interference network using observable data.\n(2) We investigate the performance of the pseudo inverse estimator within this\nframework, revealing a bias-variance trade-off introduced by the surrogate\nnetwork. We demonstrate a tighter asymptotic variance bound compared to\nprevious studies and propose an enhanced variance estimator outperforming the\noriginal estimator. (3) We apply the pseudo inverse estimator to a real\nexperiment involving over 50 million users, demonstrating its effectiveness in\ndetecting network interference when combined with the difference-in-means\nestimator. Our research aims to bridge the gap between theoretical literature\nand practical implementation, providing a solution for estimating TTE in the\npresence of network interference and unknown interference structures.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
