We collect a total 145,832 Reddit\ncomments on the abortion debate and explore the languages of subreddit\ncommunities r/prolife and r/prochoice. With consideration of the Moral\nFoundations Theory, we examine lexical patterns in three ways. First, we\ncompute proportional frequencies of lexical items from the Moral Foundations\nDictionary in order to make inferences about each group's moral considerations\nwhen forming arguments for and against abortion. We then create n-gram models\nto reveal frequent collocations from each stance group and better understand\nhow commonly used words are patterned in their linguistic context and in\nrelation to morality values. Finally, we use Latent Dirichlet Allocation to\nidentify underlying topical structures in the corpus data. Results show that\nthe use of morality words is mapped with the stances on abortion.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DGR44rEHY3y5F4eYFTJfYSs9I1NBFNJ-i8I0HeDS7PI","pdfSize":"429729","objectId":"0x7b660416ddb566cfde6bbaf4bf445cd810e75892349ee3fdaec333ba81fa07f4","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
