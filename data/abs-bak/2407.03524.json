In this article, the authors\nfocus on jet category separability by particle and jet feature extraction,\nresulting in more efficient training of a simple deep neural network, resulting\nin a computational efficient interpretable model for jet classification. The\nmethodology is tested with three to five categories of jets from the JetNet\nbenchmark jet tagging dataset, resulting in comparable performance to particle\nflow network. This work demonstrates that high dimensional datasets represented\nin separable latent spaces lead to simpler architectures for jet\nclassification.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7A7KHmvHKmkPPud4SdhWzkXqdixh-7g3xlS4YFi3zTY","pdfSize":"630980"}
