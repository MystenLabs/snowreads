However, there has been little to no image\nquality evaluation of automotive simulation and the impact of optical\ndegradations on simulation is little explored. In this work, we investigate\nVirtual KITTI and the impact of applying variations of Gaussian blur on image\nsharpness. Furthermore, we consider object detection, a common computer vision\napplication on three different state-of-the-art models, thus allowing us to\ncharacterize the relationship between object detection and sharpness. It was\nfound that while image sharpness (MTF50) degrades from an average of 0.245cy/px\nto approximately 0.119cy/px; object detection performance stays largely robust\nwithin 0.58\\%(Faster RCNN), 1.45\\%(YOLOF) and 1.93\\%(DETR) across all\nrespective held-out test sets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dD1gMTPVirJF8DmbsTyXikaICfOiHdiTzVodjVBbeco","pdfSize":"3729625","objectId":"0x7831fc57d2a90adfe06b66b85988cd75e0b24a90f6645033808005887199065e","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
