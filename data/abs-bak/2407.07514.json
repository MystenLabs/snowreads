However, these methods face a notable challenge in capturing\ndiverse local and global long-range sequential feature representations,\nparticularly evident in whole-body CT (WBCT) scans. To overcome this\nlimitation, we introduce Swin Soft Mixture Transformer (Swin SMT), a novel\narchitecture based on Swin UNETR. This model incorporates a Soft\nMixture-of-Experts (Soft MoE) to effectively handle complex and diverse\nlong-range dependencies. The use of Soft MoE allows for scaling up model\nparameters maintaining a balance between computational complexity and\nsegmentation performance in both training and inference modes. We evaluate Swin\nSMT on the publicly available TotalSegmentator-V2 dataset, which includes 117\nmajor anatomical structures in WBCT images. Comprehensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that Swin SMT outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in 3D\nanatomical structure segmentation, achieving an average Dice Similarity\nCoefficient of 85.09%.
