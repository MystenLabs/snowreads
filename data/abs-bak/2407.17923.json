This\napproach is different from the previous published literature on the long time\nbehavior of heat equations with memory which is carried out by the Dafermos\ntransformation. As a consequence, the obtained results provide complete\ninformation about the attracting sets for the original problem, instead of the\ntransformed one. In particular, the proved results also generalize and complete\nprevious literature in the local case.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"sljxvf8wg4tVxLoT_TATpkHbasq64c7tfg4H1yfRR0E","pdfSize":"305079","objectId":"0xb389de5dea80354029957ddd22eb74a137b6124d9e3c3efd2fb89365dc26d6a0","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
