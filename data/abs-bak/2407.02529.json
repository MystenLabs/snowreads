This approach is inclusive of\ntraditional pixel-oriented imaging, where the sought parameters are the pixel\nvalues. The resulting optimization process to find the parameters is then seen\nto depend on the Sensitivity Field: this is the gradient of the scattered field\nwith respect to the parameters, and it turns out to obey a scattering\nrelationship that is analogous to that of the original scattered field.\nExamples are given from several regimes of scattering strength.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AerBcfzrEwgVKmEel-SKLVGyz2LAjWlJnMuN3hd_4VQ","pdfSize":"595549","objectId":"0x5b28efe09f963b321025fed875ca823c1ac96d262c90be28e5ebbab30852a42d","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
