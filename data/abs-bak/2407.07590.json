Here, we describe aspects of quantitative planetary\ntaxonomy and examine the results of unsupervised clustering of Solar System\nbodies to guide the development of possible classification frameworks. Two\nunsurprising conclusions emerged from the clustering analysis: (1) satellites\nare distinct from planets and (2) dynamical dominance is a natural organizing\nprinciple for planetary taxonomy. To generalize an existing dynamical dominance\ncriterion, we adopt a universal clearing timescale applicable to all central\nbodies (brown dwarfs, stars, and stellar remnants). Then, we propose two\nquantitative, unified frameworks to define both planets and exoplanets. The\nfirst framework is aligned with both the IAU definition of planet in the Solar\nSystem and the IAU working definition of an exoplanet. The second framework is\na simpler mass-based framework that avoids some of the difficulties ingrained\nin current IAU recommendations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"S8kcCiUxEkoAe1HdKOAg_JgLmXk63LYPvwvv9G8wqsI","pdfSize":"692071","objectId":"0x5f2b67dbdfdbe3c5fbd478af8d7528b794182ab5050eb1c2d8242d307b20fa8e","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
