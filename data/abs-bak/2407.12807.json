The design goal was to create an accessible substitution with a\nuser-friendly interface requiring little to no training. Our mechanical hand\nuses a camera and embedded processors to perform most of these tasks. The\ninterfaced pressure sensor is used to get pressure feedback and ensure a safe\ngrasp of the object; an accelerometer is used to detect gestures and release\nthe object. Unlike current EMG-based designs, the prototyped hand does not\nrequire personalized training. The details of the design, trade-offs, results,\nand informing the next iteration are presented in this paper.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"G1auZwyQKyFbfa-qnVlfwkj5Voiah76BnUVyWW2MF1w","pdfSize":"3733847","objectId":"0xed170632e207e6128f7ed759d893e53210c1534f643c99f1ae70c5e5af064c18","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
