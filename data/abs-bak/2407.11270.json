Subsequently, for each possible\nsub-case, we analyze the presence of singularities and study some physical\nproperties. Finally, we examine their supersymmetry in the context of $N=2$,\n$d=4$ Supergravity.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZjoRG-4uP1h4m_uQ2Ki6_b1QjK3H_sNZZspOI_f5B1c","pdfSize":"9741216","objectId":"0xc5587f3ab55b9d00970b2e6fe21cdec580465abee504b365c06487519674a6a3","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
