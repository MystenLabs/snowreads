This\ngeneralises a theorem of Gromov and Wang by using a different, more\ntopological, approach. As a result, the manifold $M$ carries a complete\nRiemannian metric of uniformly positive scalar curvature, which partially\nanswers a conjecture of Gromov. More generally, the topological decomposition\nholds without any scalar curvature assumption under a weaker condition on the\nfilling discs of closed curves in the universal cover based on the notion of\nfill radius. Moreover, the decay rate of the scalar curvature is optimal in\nthis decomposition theorem. Indeed, the manifold $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\times\n\\mathbb{S}^1$ supports a complete metric of positive scalar curvature with\nexactly quadratic decay, but does not admit a decomposition as a connected sum.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cHPtVynXLgmGZAlNKpMXBq78B3I4AMJrjOZnvMe7M5o","pdfSize":"496245"}
