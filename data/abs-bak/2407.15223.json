However, such experiments may suffer from the locality\nloophole. We argue for criteria that take into account the space-like\nseparation between measurements for the case of spin correlations in top quark\npairs produced at the LHC. We derive bounds considering three different\ndefinitions of what constitutes the quantum measurement - the decay of top\nquarks, the decay of W bosons, and the stable decay products contacting a\nmacroscopic device.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"sTqMfZmWZAvwTvSQg7XF3CVi9wDRogVoKuWQskkjuno","pdfSize":"807836","objectId":"0x882d8304efe1e0b9805629487d0960209979ca161f4a16950157e9bbf874ee36","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
