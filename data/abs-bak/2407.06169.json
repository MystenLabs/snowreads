One class of traditional motion planning algorithms\ncorresponds to potential-based motion planning. An advantage of potential based\nmotion planning is composability -- different motion constraints can be easily\ncombined by adding corresponding potentials. However, constructing motion paths\nfrom potentials requires solving a global optimization across configuration\nspace potential landscape, which is often prone to local minima. We propose a\nnew approach towards learning potential based motion planning, where we train a\nneural network to capture and learn an easily optimizable potentials over\nmotion planning trajectories. We illustrate the effectiveness of such approach,\nsignificantly outperforming both classical and recent learned motion planning\napproaches and avoiding issues with local minima. We further illustrate its\ninherent composability, enabling us to generalize to a multitude of different\nmotion constraints.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oUtNSBJRYfw6-rFAAnvsZ5PcU_PkBJLan59BheZw1Ww","pdfSize":"9949545"}
