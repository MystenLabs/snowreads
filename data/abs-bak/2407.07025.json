The unique\ncombination of micron-scale spatial resolution of scalar or vector fields at\nroom temperature and parallel camera readout make this an appealing technique\nfor applications in biology, geology, condensed-matter physics, and\nelectronics. However, while NV magnetic microscopy has achieved great success\nin these areas, historically the accessible frequency range has been limited.\nIn this paper, we overcome this limitation by implementing the recently\ndeveloped technique of quantum frequency mixing. With this approach, we\ngenerate wide-field magnetic images of test structures driven by alternating\ncurrents up to 70 MHz, well outside the reach of DC and Rabi magnetometry\nmethods. With further improvements, this approach could find utility in\nhyperspectral imaging for electronics power spectrum analysis, electronics\ndiagnostics and troubleshooting, and quantum computing hardware validation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ctcH9uCDkBEDlSOnzjIHfGsiaHCgtzt4vw8RpS6QAUI","pdfSize":"2274609"}
