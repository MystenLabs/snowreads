Interestingly, in the retractive spaces context,\nthe comparison results are stronger in terms of convergence outside of functor\ncalculus' notion of \"radius of (strong) convergence\" for analytic functors. In\nparticular, we give a new proof (and generalization to retractive spaces) of\nthe Arone-Kankaanrinta result for convergence of the Taylor tower of the\nidentity functor to various Bousfield-Kan completions; it's notable that no use\nis made of Snaith splittings -- rather, we make extensive use of the kinds of\nhomotopical estimates that appear in earlier work of Dundas and\nDundas-Goodwillie-McCarthy.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dgMqE_CRw2hFQyEDCduZiU2RDEr5Co9GfQXAtnMjDnk","pdfSize":"202522"}
