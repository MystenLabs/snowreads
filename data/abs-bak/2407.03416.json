This\nhypothesis is rigorously examined by initially developing a systematic\nframework for analyzing $3$-form gauge theory coupled to an axion, specifically\nfocusing on its global properties. The theory consists of a BF term deformed by\nmarginal and irrelevant operators and describes a network of vacua separated by\ndomain walls converging at the junction of an axion string. It encompasses\n$(-1)$-, $0$-, and $3$-form spontaneously broken global symmetries. Utilizing\nthis framework, in conjunction with effective field theory techniques and 't\nHooft anomaly-matching conditions, we argue that the $3$-form gauge theory\nfaithfully captures the infrared physics of the axion-Yang-Mills system. The\nultraviolet theory is an $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory endowed with a massless\nDirac fermion coupled to a complex scalar and is characterized by chiral and\ngenuine $\\mathbb{Z}_m^{(1)}$ 1-form center symmetries, with a mixed anomaly\nbetween them. It features two scales: the vev of the complex scalar, $v$, and\nthe strong-coupling scale, $\\Lambda$, with $\\Lambda \\ll v$. Below $v$, the\nfermion decouples and two symmetries emerge: $U(1)^{(2)}$ $2$-form winding and\n$\\mathbb Z_N^{(1)}$ $1$-form center symmetries. As we flow below $\\Lambda$,\nmatching the mixed anomaly necessitates introducing a dynamical $3$-form gauge\nfield of $U(1)^{(2)}$, which appears as the incarnation of a long-range tail of\nthe color field. The infrared theory possesses spontaneously broken chiral,\nemergent $3$-form, and emergent $(-1)$-form global symmetries. It passes\nseveral checks, among which: it displays the expected restructuring in the\nhadronic sector upon transition between the vacua, and it is consistent under\nthe gauging of the genuine $\\mathbb Z_m^{(1)}\\subset \\mathbb Z_N^{(1)}$\nsymmetry.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fz9fVUCRKsfV0QxKmvJmft0oA-qEyJJCHfnF-m7VJBk","pdfSize":"697855"}
