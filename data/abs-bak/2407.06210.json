The effect of a rigid crust on viscous\ndamping and dissipation rate in the boundary layer between fluid core and crust\nhas been studied. The time evolution and intensity of the emitted GWs in terms\nof the strain tensor amplitude have been estimated with the approximation of\nslow rotation using equation of state derived from the APR and Skyrme effective\ninteractions with Brussels-Montreal parameter sets. The core of the neutron\nstar has been considered to be $\\beta$-equilibrated nuclear matter containing\nneutrons, protons, electrons and muons, surrounded by a solid crust.\nCalculations have been made for critical frequencies, their time evolution and\nrate of change of frequencies across a broad spectrum of pulsar masses.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"s3a_kpaK2m6R9KAikPUrWH0m8qiWE4UuiD9rjmp7oQ4","pdfSize":"692991"}
