In this work, we further\nleverage the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) knowledge base to\naccurately identify medical concepts and improve clinical entity and relation\nextraction at the document level. Our framework selects UMLS concepts relevant\nto the text and combines them with prompts to guide language models in\nextracting entities. Our experiments demonstrate that this initial concept\nmapping and the inclusion of these mapped concepts in the prompts improves\nextraction results compared to few-shot extraction tasks on generic language\nmodels that do not leverage UMLS. Further, our results show that this approach\nis more effective than the standard Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\ntechnique, where retrieved data is compared with prompt embeddings to generate\nresults. Overall, we find that integrating UMLS concepts with GPT models\nsignificantly improves entity and relation identification, outperforming the\nbaseline and RAG models. By combining the precise concept mapping capability of\nknowledge-based approaches like UMLS with the contextual understanding\ncapability of GPT, our method highlights the potential of these approaches in\nspecialized domains like healthcare.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MMCXAHliTHuHwuQ6gzgjcr3eqHMmOWIwksrqRQ9HN9E","pdfSize":"748513","objectId":"0x39aaf91cd63dd347523c3183e411fb35e3ca4fd651598d1441a67cc99cfad43f","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
