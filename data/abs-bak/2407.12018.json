One of\nthe most significant risks faced by users on these platforms is targeted hate\nspeech. Social media platforms are widely utilised for generating datasets\nemployed in training and evaluating machine learning algorithms for hate speech\ndetection. However, existing public datasets exhibit numerous limitations,\nhindering the effective training of these algorithms and leading to inaccurate\nhate speech classification. This study provides a comprehensive empirical\nevaluation of several public datasets commonly used in automated hate speech\nclassification. Through rigorous analysis, we present compelling evidence\nhighlighting the limitations of current hate speech datasets. Additionally, we\nconduct a range of statistical analyses to elucidate the strengths and\nweaknesses inherent in these datasets. This work aims to advance the\ndevelopment of more accurate and reliable machine learning models for hate\nspeech detection by addressing the dataset limitations identified.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1q-qlSUW2atBOsH3_AWEsDFHDyN_-eu3yl3gFLRYlAo","pdfSize":"674214","objectId":"0x47b3e2e996c31ff63bb0a0341a0ebaa95fe04fb225f5844b080513fa5cddc6ab","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
