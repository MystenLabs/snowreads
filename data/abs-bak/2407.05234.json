We study the production of\n$B_c$ mesons via $c$ and bottom ($b$) quark recombination in a statistical\nfashion by placing $B_c$ in the position of a member of the family of open $b$\nhadrons, which allows us to make quantitative predictions for the modifications\nof the production fraction ($f_c$) of $B_c$ mesons and its relative production\nto $B$ mesons in $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV Pb-Pb collisions with respect to\nproton-proton ($pp$) collisions at the same energy. The statistical production\nyield of $B_c$ mesons is converted into the transverse momentum ($p_T$)\ndistribution with the shape computed from resonance recombination using the\n$c$- and $b$-quark phase space distributions that have been simulated via\nLangevin diffusion and constrained by open $c$- and $b$-hadron observables.\nSupplemented with the component fragmented from $b$-quark spectrum that\ndominates at high $p_T$, the total $p_T$ spectrum of $B_c$ mesons is obtained\nand converted into the $p_T$ dependent nuclear modification factor ($R_{\\rm\nAA}$). Both $f_c$ and the integrated $R_{\\rm AA}$ exhibit a $\\sim5$-fold\nenhancement in central Pb-Pb collisions relative to the $pp$ reference.\nComparison with data measured by the CMS experiment shows decent agreement\nwithin theoretical and experimental uncertainties.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kyCjvexLNSf5UG6yEHV9M8v4wOu-_r5SwVQBHmbz97I","pdfSize":"305778"}
