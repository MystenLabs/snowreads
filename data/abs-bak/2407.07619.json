Properties that such a function should obey are already\nestablished, but the difficulty in its calculation is still an issue to be\novercome. In this work, I proposed a new method to determine such a function\nfor thermally isolated systems, based on a Hamilton's equations approach.\nObserving that the microscopic relaxation function can be turned into a\ncanonical variable, one can choose the initial conditions of the solutions of\nHamilton's equations to avoid the calculation of the average in the initial\ncanonical ensemble. The unbearable example of the quartic oscillator is solved\nto corroborate the method. Extensions to the quantum realm and stochastic\nthermodynamics are mandatory.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TxBGskGeVF3QwmfkighQQZaoTtd9qCr2FFKNwpSjDhQ","pdfSize":"131084","objectId":"0x4d2f659c23c97849c4c981de636f1911fb265be77a753209015ca9d0c45cf43e","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
