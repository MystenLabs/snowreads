We investigate two extensions of the Sackin index to the class of galled\ntrees and two of its subclasses (simplex galled trees and normal galled trees)\nwhere we consider both labeled and unlabeled galled trees. In all cases, we\nshow that the mean of the Sackin index for a network which is uniformly sampled\nfrom its class is asymptotic to $\\mu n^{3/2}$ for an explicit constant $\\mu$.\nIn addition, we show that the scaled Sackin index convergences weakly and with\nall its moments to the Airy distribution.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xJ68k3zhe_doiGwUspdFevWDJYutSsHKZlE5kjUOkoY","pdfSize":"438299","objectId":"0xe46660a9e72eaa4ad25a0a51aa3041ba6975a9f9d97a2e2b1d6f3cc669888af8","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
