For the energy cascade, $C_\\varepsilon$ is known to\nreflect its basic overall properties, while $\\mu$ quantifies the emerging\nintermittency down the cascade. We find that these quantities are related, as\n$\\mu$ is inversely proportional to $C_\\varepsilon$, providing a new principle\nthat also applies to inhomogeneous flows.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CmUxTnJ1hkBWB648iZNobNp9m5vevMFBkINHKTo97X0","pdfSize":"1485779","objectId":"0x96aad636e8237015b5588b5763569e95d4a5e4c8449025c2e3c06f466b2e26ae","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
