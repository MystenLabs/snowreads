As applications, firstly, we prove the validity of\nthe so-called generalized reverse H\\\"older inequality on the Sierpi\\'nski\ncarpet cable system, which was left open by Devyver, Russ, Yang (Int. Math.\nRes. Not. IMRN (2023), no. 18, 15537-15583). Secondly, we prove that two-sided\nheat kernel estimates alone imply gradient estimate for the heat kernel on\nstrongly recurrent fractal-like cable systems, which improves the main results\nof the aforementioned paper. Thirdly, we obtain H\\\"older (Lipschitz) estimate\nfor heat kernel on general metric measure spaces, which extends the classical\nLi-Yau gradient estimate for heat kernel on Riemannian manifolds.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nB9ivVVDpgvZVoCPXcXKt5VYcdjkdZ6wNoZeK6KtuJ8","pdfSize":"1201485","objectId":"0x5e6369b6a06e01539788216cf677f17f9d32ed8beb9fd2fbe0e7d2e77f2a4b35","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
