Based on the techniques of stochastic\nthermodynamics, we derive the speed-accuracy trade-off for the diffusion\nmodels, which is a trade-off relationship between the speed and accuracy of\ndata generation in diffusion models. Our result implies that the entropy\nproduction rate in the forward process affects the errors in data generation.\nFrom a stochastic thermodynamic perspective, our results provide quantitative\ninsight into how best to generate data in diffusion models. The optimal\nlearning protocol is introduced by the conservative force in stochastic\nthermodynamics and the geodesic of space by the 2-Wasserstein distance in\noptimal transport theory. We numerically illustrate the validity of the\nspeed-accuracy trade-off for the diffusion models with different noise\nschedules such as the cosine schedule, the conditional optimal transport, and\nthe optimal transport.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"alLMZgtdCF1sTVeE39LUjJNVx5wuk4XfYX0E9bHqa2I","pdfSize":"9216499"}
