They correspond to the\nlinear switching system, which is a differential equation $\\dot x(t) =\nA(t)x(t)$, where $A(t) \\in \\mathcal A$ for each $t$. The invariant norm\nidentifies the trajectories $x(t)$ of the fastest asymptotic growth as $t\\to\n+\\infty$. It also solves the stability problem. This norm is difficult to\nconstruct even for a pair of matrices. We show that in case $d=2$ the invariant\nnorm can be found explicitly for every compact matrix family $\\mathcal A$. If\n$\\mathcal A$ does not contain a dominant matrix with a real spectrum, then this\nnorm is always unique (up to a multiplier) and is $C^1$, otherwise, there may\nbe infinitely many norms. All of them can be found and classified.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"UFiHi-KJCbfkmf4zRPG7RaL-Zt0cT1YA7aDLPAgOKp0","pdfSize":"563218","objectId":"0x790f798601fd8b8531e0fa2b3af6dcee22ec42415bff7d246c155542eafd90bf","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
