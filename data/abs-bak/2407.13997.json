In this\nwork, we consider the all-at-once solution of the discretized Navier-Stokes\nequations over a space-time domain using waveform relaxation multigrid methods.\nIn particular, we show how to extend the efficient spatial multigrid relaxation\nmethods from [37] to a waveform relaxation method, and demonstrate the\nefficiency of the resulting monolithic Newton-Krylov-multigrid solver.\nNumerical results demonstrate the scalability of the solver for varying\ndiscretization order and physical parameters.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"X6IrW0kDXNKDi6LLrjKfxRS0MleOKbEWH6VW7CwFqxQ","pdfSize":"574623","objectId":"0x05c94f8509cfe57679798b61a879436e612b9555347ab9ed5821fc14edfccd7b","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
