{"id":"2407.09101","title":"Resistance, oddness and colouring defect of snarks","authors":"Imran Allie","authorsParsed":[["Allie","Imran",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2024 09:03:06 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-15","timestamp":1720774986000,"abstract":"  Let $G$ be a bridgeless cubic graph. The \\textit{resistance} of $G$, denoted\n$r(G)$, is the minimum number of edges which can be removed from $G$ in order\nto render 3-edge-colourability. The \\textit{oddness} of $G$, denoted\n$\\omega(G)$, is the minimum number of odd components in a 2-factor of $G$. The\n\\textit{colouring defect} of $G$ (or simply, the \\textit{defect} of $G$),\ndenoted $\\mu_3(G)$, is the minimum number of edges not contained in any set of\nthree perfect matchings of $G$. These three parameters are regarded as\nmeasurements of uncolourability of snarks, partly because any one of these\nparameters equal zero if and only if $G$ is 3-edge-colourable. It is also known\nthat $r(G) \\geq \\omega(G)$ and that $\\mu_3(G) \\geq \\frac{3}{2}\\omega(G)$\n\\cite{fiol,jinsteffen}. We have shown that the ratio of oddness to resistance\ncan be arbitrarily large for non-trivial snarks \\cite{allie1}. It has also been\nshown that the ratio of the defect to oddness can be arbitrarily large for\nnon-trivial snarks, although this result was only shown for graphs with oddness\nequal to 2 \\cite{karabasetal}. In the same paper, the question was posed\nwhether there exists non-trivial snarks for given resistance $r$ or given\noddness $\\omega$, and arbitrarily large defect. In this paper, we prove a\nstronger result: For any positive integers $r \\geq 2$, even $\\omega \\geq r$,\nand $d \\geq \\frac{3}{2}\\omega$, there exists a non-trivial snark $G$ with\n$r(G)=r$, $\\omega(G)=\\omega$ and $\\mu_3(G) \\geq d$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RN_YQB7-_pzVd6wrF3sbAcdOpNgI9xzBAsXoqYlHeCo","pdfSize":"448266","objectId":"0xfe63c4a5858c235f15957191384a10e7d29281a7f39d5919ff2f373baf1b1b8f","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
