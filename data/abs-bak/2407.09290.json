This study\nexplores the generation of structured data about documents' authenticity\nassessment from natural language texts. Our pipeline exploits Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to select, extract and classify relevant claims about the topic\nwithout the need for training, and Semantic Web technologies to structure and\ntype-validate the LLM's results. The final output is a catalogue of documents\nwhose authenticity has been debated, along with scholars' opinions on their\nauthenticity. This process can serve as a valuable resource for integration\ninto catalogues, allowing room for more intricate queries and analyses on the\nevolution of these debates over centuries.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"kf_P5J91RQWNwJfBlNPrzhcYpTV-jj4kOenZNICn6wk","pdfSize":"262776","objectId":"0x2eedeab857a3f91f28fb2ada1ce9c0e60029d705c7d78af53ae5156ad4a64f30","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
