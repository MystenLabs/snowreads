The magnetic skyrmions can be orientated such that their interaction\nwith domain walls is repulsive, allowing for them to be stored between domain\nwalls. In certain orientations, the skyrmion can be absorbed into the domain\nwall, forming a domain wall kink. In other orientations, it can absorbed to\nform a kink-antikink domain wall with zero topological charge. The magnetic\nskyrmion can even be orientated in such a way that it remains trapped but\ncreates a topological defect-antidefect pair in one of the walls. By altering\nthe phases of one of the chiral domain walls, one can erase or store the\nmagnetic skyrmion as an isolated soliton or as a domain wall\nskyrmion/antiskyrmion. This adds a valuable asset to an ever growing toolbox of\nspintronic nano-devices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"C-FPaXMD0gb0enbqg_marZUjfAVPV-BVrtC0tSVBouc","pdfSize":"26172921"}
