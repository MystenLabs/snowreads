As a corollary, we answer a question of Marrakchi and\nVaes by showing that if $M$ is semifinite and $\\alpha_g$ is not approximately\ninner for all $g\\neq 1$, then $M'\\cap (M\\rtimes_{\\alpha} G)=\\mathbb{C}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tolBAql6sgybclo2BDN5hvBTkKgV_mTfA0ap6drWLpc","pdfSize":"220072","objectId":"0x64d69788f68032dd7e3e47d0d446741f0133b39247194c952b20396da38eae00","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
