It has been found that together with sub-optimal coupling\ninto SMF-28 fibre and half and quarter waveplates, the fiber piano is capable\nof producing and reproducing desired spatial modes up to $LP_{11}$ when using\n808 nm light and up to $LP_{21}$ when using 632.8 nm light. The control of\nspatial mode profile extends down to the single photon level. This is\ndemonstrated with the help of correlated photon pairs generated via spontaneous\nparametric down conversion.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"C4oGCKa9fwdhvswZ8nXFWaboLWqVWAI1-Fd5n-ZjosY","pdfSize":"2101823","objectId":"0xfd34bc3fdc3f8c6b3312912960ecea7975e82f39e0c55ed154abf4ea47f53f5e","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
