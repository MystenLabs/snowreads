The study\nutilizes the eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator and validates their\nconnection with the Shaw-Piere invariant manifold framework for NNMs.\nFurthermore, the study delves into the impact of internal resonance and\ndissipation on the accuracy of this framework by defining a continuous\nquantitative measure for internal resonance. The applicability and robustness\nof the framework for the systems which are very similar qualitatively to that\nof an ENO, are also observed and discussed about the limitations of the\napproximation technique.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wvB4dusk6szKf877wBRWcX5Y_vluwJBCb2LJEjxIW7A","pdfSize":"4093978","objectId":"0x3b64d3f1aaabb6f840366cb8b83951123a0e9daf3de041b3ff0c7332fc05208a","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
