We derive the electric current and heat current\nresulting from voltage and heat biases of the junction, taking into account the\nquasiparticles' internal entropy. We find that when the tunneling processes are\ndominated by quasiparticle tunneling of one type of charge, the effective\ninternal entropy can be inferred from the measurement of the heat current and\nthe charge current. Our methods may be used to conclusively identify\nnon-Abelian quasiparticles, such as the anyons that emerge in the $\\nu = 5/2$\nfractional quantum Hall state.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pf8MzV01QwjmDOeIuFPkyYPtdIFbSQx6Vx32Bht9F1k","pdfSize":"249305"}
