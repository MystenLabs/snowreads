We analyze their\nelectromagnetic transitions into ground-state bottom baryons together with a\nphoton. Together with their mass spectra and strong decays investigated in\nRefs. \\cite{Yang:2020zrh,Tan:2023opd}, a rather complete QCD sum rule study has\nbeen done to understand the $P$-wave singly bottom baryons within the framework\nof heavy quark effective theory. As summarized in\nTables~\\ref{tab:candidate}/\\ref{tab:candidate6f}, some $P$-wave bottom baryons\nhave limited strong decay widths so that their radiative decay widths become\nnon-negligible. We propose to study these excited bottom baryons and their\nradiative decays in the future Belle-II, BESIII, and LHCb experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TmUug4ksmAwvQqF5FxUlMQC_8v4pxnl_Lh6rCO3ZRbo","pdfSize":"2052366"}
