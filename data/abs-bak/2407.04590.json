Our research focuses on the development of\nnon-invasive techniques based on the Object Detection (OD) and Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN) to detect and verify the proper use of various types of\nPPE such as helmets, safety glasses, masks, and protective clothing. This study\nproposes the SH17 Dataset, consisting of 8,099 annotated images containing\n75,994 instances of 17 classes collected from diverse industrial environments,\nto train and validate the OD models. We have trained state-of-the-art OD models\nfor benchmarking, and initial results demonstrate promising accuracy levels\nwith You Only Look Once (YOLO)v9-e model variant exceeding 70.9% in PPE\ndetection. The performance of the model validation on cross-domain datasets\nsuggests that integrating these technologies can significantly improve safety\nmanagement systems, providing a scalable and efficient solution for industries\nstriving to meet human safety regulations and protect their workforce.
