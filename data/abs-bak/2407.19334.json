This spectrometer is capable of\nmeasuring the frequency dependence of the MOKE response function, both the Kerr\nrotation and ellipticity, simultaneously with sub-milliradian accuracy without\nthe need for reference measurement. The instrument's versatility allow it to be\ncoupled to a cryostat with optical windows enabling studies of a variety of\nquantum materials such as unconventional superconductors, two-dimensional\nelectron gas systems, quantum magnets, and other system showing optical Hall\nresponse, at sub-Kelvin temperatures and in high magnetic fields. We\ndemonstrate the functionality of the MOKE spectrometer using an undoped InSb\nwafer as a test sample.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5dxHxo5Ezw36akQMX5YU5P-9XJVFKVW2oLjwFNCFkgI","pdfSize":"523002","objectId":"0xdc8db976574ac3b4e937143c16bc1b1b2f0f2b5bab61a726fcf4ab5b81698753","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
