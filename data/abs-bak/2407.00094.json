We prove that the affine connection on $F$ can locally be\nunderstood as the Levi-Civita connection of some (pseudo-)Riemannian metric if\nand only if the Ricci tensor of the canonical affine connection is symmetric.\nWe also obtain a third equivalent characterization in terms of the covariant\nderivative of the 1-form $\\beta$. We use these results to classify all locally\nmetrizable $m$-Kropina spaces whose 1-forms have a constant causal character.\nIn the special case where the first de Rahm cohomology group of the underlying\nmanifold is trivial (which is true of simply connected manifolds, for\ninstance), we show that global metrizability is equivalent to local\nmetrizability and hence, in that case, our necessary and sufficient conditions\nalso characterize global metrizability. In addition, we further obtain\nexplicitly all Ricci-flat, locally metrizable $m$-Kropina metrics in $(3+1)$D\nwhose 1-forms have a constant causal character. In fact, the only possibilities\nare essentially the following two: either $\\alpha$ is flat and $\\beta$ is\n$\\alpha$-parallel, or $\\alpha$ is a pp-wave and $\\beta$ is $\\alpha$-parallel.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zieUZovAv0tOGwYvz37kEJtt5LgqQUIGG2vdqpkoeT0","pdfSize":"271165","objectId":"0x6a6819adbeb71312f275c499a94a8aec6d42fd555a84e47dd3308aaadb3970b0","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
