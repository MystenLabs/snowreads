This is often done by making an\nindependence assumption about the samples, but this assumption is rarely\nsatisfied in reality. However, state-of-the-art approaches that avoid this\nassumption are not scalable, with $O(n^3)$ runtime and $O(n^2)$ space\ncomplexity. In this paper, we introduce a method that has $O(n^2)$ runtime and\n$O(n)$ space complexity, without assuming independence.\n  We validate our model on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing that\nour method's accuracy is comparable to that of prior work We demonstrate that\nour approach can be used on unprecedentedly large datasets, such as a\nreal-world 1,000,000-cell scRNA-seq dataset; this was impossible with previous\napproaches. Our method maintains the flexibility of prior work, such as the\nability to handle multi-modal tensor-variate datasets and the ability to work\nwith data of arbitrary marginal distributions. An additional advantage of our\nmethod is that, unlike prior work, our hyperparameters are easily\ninterpretable.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Quantitative Biology/Genomics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2OcDEDGHcVFKGIbhlATf76xCowbpa2KxlIZLORh6qic","pdfSize":"1515939","objectId":"0x7f5cce8ade582687397f0a241d4d7868a367362fa8c0121ecbee69d5dd451153","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
