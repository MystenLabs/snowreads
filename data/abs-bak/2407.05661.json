In\ncontrast with the Euclidean case, we consider a variety of totally umbilical\nsupport surfaces, including horospheres, totally geodesic planes, equidistant\nsurfaces and round spheres. In all of them, we explicitly compute the Morse\nindex of the corresponding eigenvalue problem for the Jacobi operator. We also\naddress the stability of compact pieces of Killing cylinders with Dirichlet\nboundary conditions when the boundary is formed by two fixed circles,\nexhibiting an analogous to the Plateau-Rayleigh instability criterion for\nKilling cylinders in the Euclidean space. Finally, we prove that the Delaunay\nsurfaces can be obtained by bifurcating Killing cylinders supported on geodesic\nplanes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9MR3bPG8rE7Q_H0veJubhSuedIB4dSNNYhDsjisHZWo","pdfSize":"494326"}
