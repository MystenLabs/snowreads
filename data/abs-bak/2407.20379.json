A periodically\ntridiagonal matrix $J$ on $L^2(\\mathbb{Z}/N \\mathbb{Z})$ is constructed having\nthe three properties that it commutes with $F_N$, has eigenspaces of dimensions\n1 and 2 only, and the span of its eigenspaces of dimension 1 is precisely\n$\\mathcal C_a$. The simple eigenspaces of $J$ provide an orthonormal eigenbasis\nof the restriction of $F_N$ to $\\mathcal C_a$. The dimension 2 eigenspaces of\n$J$ have canonical basis elements supported on $[-a,a]$ and its complement.\nThese bases give an interpolation formula for reconstructing $f(x)\\in\nL^2(\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z})$ from the values of $f(x)$ and $\\widehat f(x)$ on\n$[-a,a]$, i.e., an explicit Fourier uniqueness pair interpolation formula. The\ncoefficients of the interpolation formula are expressed in terms of theta\nfunctions. Lastly, we construct an explicit basis of $\\mathcal C_a$ having\nextremal support and leverage it to obtain explicit formulas for eigenfunctions\nof $F_N$ in $C_a$ when $\\dim \\mathcal C_a \\leq 4$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Spectral Theory","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yVZAGZUdPOxLmuKNX1G-ZXxOA5VQcxAFAcSrZ6XKtLc","pdfSize":"216812","objectId":"0xb1616ee556bb07067e0f1690befdee98dd27cebf68138bac204e321eaa125347","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
