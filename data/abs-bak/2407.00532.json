One is the\nsubspace generated by integral-weight Hecke eigenforms with nonvanishing\nquadratic twisted central $L$-values. The other is a subspace generated by\nhalf-integral weight Hecke eigenforms with certain nonvanishing Fourier\ncoefficients. Along the way, we show that these subspaces are isomorphic via\nthe Shimura lift.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Sg6BD-S2avM72N5t6PimFIiPFS6e4RqHqijTjWYR2gg","pdfSize":"376626","objectId":"0x9c7d6c1f6891e8bb00dcea0eed58528e8c72e21441375dd3aba073de3872b009","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
