Our study covers important examples such as the time-fractional\ndiffusion equation, the space-time fractional diffusion equation when diffusion\nis under the influence of sub-Laplacian on the Heisenberg group, or general\nstratified Lie groups. We establish the global well-posedness of the Cauchy\nproblem for the general space-time fractional diffusion equation for the\nRockland operator on a graded Lie group in the associated Sobolev spaces. More\nprecisely, we establish the existence and uniqueness results for both\nhomogeneous and inhomogeneous fractional diffusion equations. In addition, we\nalso develop some regularity estimates.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"LmEAMEIyEvswIsjy00n7eSTqwecOc7idjgdd9doPWag","pdfSize":"295643","objectId":"0xf505a81fc20fde53b061383a16cb2091a2708738dba54b37408396d141598827","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
