We analyze the problem of imitation from expert videos with\nvisual discrepancies, and introduce a solution for robust latent space\nestimation using contrastive learning and data augmentation. Provided a\nvisually robust latent space, our algorithm performs imitation entirely within\nthis space using off-policy adversarial imitation learning. We conduct a\nthorough ablation study to justify our design and test C-LAIfO on\nhigh-dimensional continuous robotic tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate how\nC-LAIfO can be combined with other reward signals to facilitate learning on a\nset of challenging hand manipulation tasks with sparse rewards. Our experiments\nshow improved performance compared to baseline methods, highlighting the\neffectiveness of C-LAIfO. To ensure reproducibility, we open source our code.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PhDaUbn_mnqdpgiMxLAc_1ldgVAMQ3idL09Wb6M12Bk","pdfSize":"4346180","objectId":"0xeaac5f2fad4ecb24730706d8477d4595f03808a385fb57c78851ad45c66a08f8","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
