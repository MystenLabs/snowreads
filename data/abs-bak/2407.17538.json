The resulting cyclic dynamic behavior\nis demonstrated through time series plots, phase portraits and their\nstroboscopic phase maps.\n  Employing an eigenvalue stability analysis of the Jacobian of the system, we\nfind out that there are two distinct regimes depending on the exponent and the\namplitude of the higher order interactions of the nonlinear mass term. In\nparticular, the system exhibits a limit cycle oscillatory stable behavior for a\nrange of values of these parameters and a non-cyclic behavior for another\nrange, separated by a curve across which phase transitions would occur between\nthe two regimes. This shows that the observed clumping dynamics in Saturn's F\nring, corresponding to a limit cycle stability regime, can be systematically\nmaintained in presence of physical higher order mass aggregation terms in the\nintroduced model.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jMFKakKiISZbqnlFSuYMEJyhZjahikn4d3SCHDUQLlo","pdfSize":"653152","objectId":"0x909ffc78f384ff74c0989acd7fd62d495719f4aea80a9324e7662a7446cf89bf","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
