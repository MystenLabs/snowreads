The recently proposed lattice HAL QCD $\\phi N$ potential in the\n$^{4}S_{3/2}$ channel does not support either $\\phi N$ or $\\phi NN$ bound\nstates. The HAL QCD $\\phi N$ potential in the $^{2}S_{1/2}$ channel suggests\nthe bound states for $\\phi N$ and $\\phi NN (S=0)$ systems. However, the binding\nenergies are highly sensitive to variations of the enhancement factor $\\beta$,\nand the $\\phi NN$ system is extremely strongly bound in the state $S=0$.\nConsidering a spin-averaged potential %$(\\frac{1}{3}V_{\\phi\nN}^{1/2}+\\frac{2}{3}V_{\\phi N}^{3/2})$ for the state $S=1$ yields a bound state\nfor $^3_\\phi$H $(S=1)$ hypernucleus with the binding energy (BE) 14.9 MeV when\n$\\beta = 6.9$. The evaluation of the BE for the $S=1$, $T=1$ three-body state\nresults in 5.47 MeV. %Also, We evaluated the BE for the $S=1$, $T=1$ three-body\nstate as 5.47 MeV. Additionally, calculations using our approach confirm the\nbound states for the $\\phi NN$ ($S=2,T=0$ and $S=1, T=1$) system previously\npredicted with the Yukawa-type potential motivated by the QCD van der Waals\nattractive force, mediated by multi-gluon exchanges.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zaOjx9zjyPt_BtB_FCyecN_fgkOhKLxkxd9HdTd0YtY","pdfSize":"193889","objectId":"0x6abfc0b9e53322bdcaf916e6ef4e618d830f8b5a02ff48626dd3a6b3a189e771","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
