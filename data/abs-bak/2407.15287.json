To do this, we work with vector bundles over the unordered\nconfiguration space of a manifold $M$ and consider the structure of a\n$2$-monoidal category given by the usual (Hadamard) tensor product of bundles\nand a new (Cauchy) tensor product which provides a symmetrized version of the\nusual external tensor product of vector bundles on $M$. We use the symmetric\nalgebras with respect to both products to obtain a Poisson 2-algebra bundle\nmimicking the construction of Peierls bracket from the causal propagator in\nfield theory. The explicit description of observables from this Poisson algebra\nbundle will be carried out in a forthcoming paper.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OOwRa3_Ra_sv0eFpLxyZirtOqb0T55u2SnpiSgt1gf8","pdfSize":"414096","objectId":"0x4b9b8f3f839b3b0808b8da8a4e64345fd1d3114c4ff3f7773f3df86486e46fe1","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
