It is futile to fit experimental data at a low-$Q^2$\ninput scale by unmodified standard evolution. Our result is supported by recent\ndiscussions in the literature on the unsatisfactory status of standard fits to\nthe experimental data. The color dipole picture (CDP) quantitatively provides\nthe magnitude of the deviation of standard evolution in the low-$x$, low $Q^2$\ndomain from experiment.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"if7QbsxsGutjya8kQ5JvELTVnE9rqjuQxe4w4fRylLk","pdfSize":"667571"}
