Despite neural\nnetwork ensembles' proficiency in this problem, a gap persists between actual\nuncertainties and predicted estimates. A major difficulty here is the lack of\nlabels on the hardness of examples: a typical dataset includes only ground\ntruth target labels, making the uncertainty estimation problem almost\nunsupervised. Our novel approach narrows this gap by integrating expert\nassessments of case complexity into the neural network's learning process,\nutilizing both definitive target labels and supplementary complexity ratings.\nWe validate our methodology for blood typing, leveraging a new dataset\n\"BloodyWell\" unique in augmenting labeled reaction images with complexity\nscores from six medical specialists. Experiments demonstrate enhancement of our\napproach in uncertainty prediction, achieving a 2.5-fold improvement with\nexpert labels and a 35% increase in performance with estimates of neural-based\nexpert consensus.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_agWZ61bSlLLCIkWzkAa12sq9zrjeiGuPMuoSXCRKgY","pdfSize":"6278796","objectId":"0x81c0f04d57c673640608ec834653a81343d9ddcb6e9ae87a25b2bb18940916b9","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
