This paper investigates the\npotential of memristive crossbars in implementing matrix inversion algorithms.\nWe explore both static and dynamic approaches, emphasizing the advantages of\nanalog and in-memory computing for matrix operations beyond multiplication. Our\nresults demonstrate that memristive arrays can significantly reduce\ncomputational complexity and power consumption compared to traditional digital\nmethods for certain matrix tasks. Furthermore, we address the challenges of\ndevice variability, precision, and scalability, providing insights into the\npractical implementation of these algorithms.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"L6sjU5WcZMobE0NuRbl-DcHckQLi0iIRQcdgVtJcOMg","pdfSize":"8538535","objectId":"0x96f3f161bb560a380a96a3f495c2f6fbb86299ed240f03b16adad17306c9c834","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
