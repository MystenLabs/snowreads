As a result of that, it is necessary to properly characterize\nthese instruments. However, there are not natural sources that can be used for\nthis purpose. For this reason, we developed the PROTOtype CALibrator for\nCosmology, PROTOCALC, which is a calibrator source designed for the 90 GHz band\nof these telescopes. This source is purely polarized and the direction of the\npolarization vector is known with an accuracy better than 0.1 deg. This source\nflew for the first time in May 2022 showing promising result.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"f4ZyGp5l6-f7-dIH7ryNRQ_0WmQmguzmN7GqRWbw1TE","pdfSize":"6461061","objectId":"0x0ba29482f2e8028bebe1202a165644685b42f6c061eda051b0411fe07215c02d","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
