We\nintroduced two Standard Model Higgs particles along with vector-like fermions\nand a new particle (S) which is a gauge singlet in the Standard Model. This\nmodification leads to a mass matrix that diverges from the tribimaximal\nneutrino mixing pattern resulting in a non-zero reactor angle ($\\theta_{13}$).\nWe also incorporated a $ Z_2 \\otimes Z_3 \\otimes Z_4$ symmetry for the specific\ninteractions in our model. The additional particle S is a sterile neutrino\nwhich is considered to be a probable dark matter candidate with mass in keV\nrange.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Pv6ziSZVYNVfXWv3aq6Joa89gxVhxdqudPlXkQ5pkB8","pdfSize":"4753071"}
