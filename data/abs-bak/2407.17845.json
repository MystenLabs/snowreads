We have studied\nthe critical behavior around the Curie temperature ($T_C$) using various\ntechniques, including the modified Arrott plot (MAP), the Kouvel-Fisher method\n(KF), and critical isothermal analysis (CI). The derived critical exponents\n$\\beta$ = 0.353(4) and $\\gamma$ = 1.213(5) fall in between the\nthree-dimensional (3D) Ising and 3D Heisenberg type models, suggesting complex\nmagnetic interactions by not falling into any single universality class. On the\nother hand, the renormalization group theory, employing the experimentally\nobtained critical exponents, suggests 3D-Ising-type magnetic interactions\ndecaying with distance as $J(r) = r^{-4.89}$. We also observe an extremely\nlarge uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) of $K_u=2065$\nkJ/m$^3$, the highest ever found in any Cr$_x$Te$_y$ based systems, originating\nfrom the noncollinear ferromagnetic ground state as predicted from the\nfirst-principles calculations. The self-consistent renormalization theory (SCR)\nsuggests Cr$_2$Te$_3$ to be an out-of-plane itinerant ferromagnet. Further, a\nmaximum entropy change of -$\\Delta S_{M}^{max}\\approx$ 2.08 $J/kg-K$ is\nestimated around $T_C$ for the fields applied parallel to the $c$-axis.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"POHoYpEzn46GcL4namLWuQawSx4ShrAlxt4gepl1ZjE","pdfSize":"1842392","objectId":"0x5aba052fa70d2b0d919359450a93fed5297faa743f24773f024133bdc6f63b99","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
