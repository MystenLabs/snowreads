The existence of such embedding enables a reduction\nfrom the version of the matroid secretary problem where the matroid is unknown\nto the version where the matroid is known in advance. We show that online\nmatroid embeddings exist for binary (and hence graphic) and laminar matroids.\nWe also show a negative result showing that no online matroid embedding exists\nfor the class of all matroids. Finally, we define the notion of an approximate\nmatroid embedding, generalizing the notion of {\\alpha}-partition property, and\nprovide an upper bound on the approximability of binary matroids by a partition\nmatroid, matching the lower bound of Dughmi et al.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jc9z91BAqvtIMsFOHlIMi0upMf5SX-TkC5UPeAVwEEQ","pdfSize":"291116","objectId":"0x5f86e8811f1d4683ed499a0ab6c30a7c414e9c36106f403bb095ed1c7392bb8d","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
