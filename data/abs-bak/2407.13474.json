IGSS\noffers two huge advantages over most other approaches to modelling. 1) IGSS has\nthe potential to fit complex non-linear models to a target and 2) the models\nhave the potential to be interpreted as social theory.\n  The paper presents IGSS to a new audience, illustrates how it can contribute,\nand provides software that can be used as a basis of an IGSS study.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Vi-XZudoYEzRcFMj4ZrAYcnT7p9Sq7s9pbACvf5RsHQ","pdfSize":"421156","objectId":"0xd35c58174e47e6ef51b6537dc0e78b34a2097f689d98df8464111977dabbc77b","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
