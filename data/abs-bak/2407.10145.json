Furthermore, if $n$ is even, such a $C^\\infty$ stable map can be so\nconstructed that the restriction to the singular point set is a topological\nembedding. As a corollary, we show that for $n \\geq 4$ even, there always\nexists a $C^\\infty$ stable map $M \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$ with at most one cusp point\nsuch that the restriction to the singular point set is a topological embedding.\nAs another corollary, we give a new proof to the existence of an open book\nstructure on odd dimensional manifolds which extends a given one on the\nboundary, originally due to Quinn. Finally, using the open book structure thus\nconstructed, we show that $k$--connected $n$--dimensional manifolds always\nadmit a fold map into $\\mathbb{R}^2$ without folds of absolute indices $i$ with\n$1 \\leq i \\leq k$, for $n \\geq 7$ odd and $1 \\leq k < (n-3)/2$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"rd8wRpYdaQ4yq3X9_gTFmmF0BbkDZCw-uVdOQ1QdvcM","pdfSize":"339809","objectId":"0x5205955c71c095ba4aff6d8e4762609d5ff4a6967be2e305902bb216ae39916e","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
