The high energy electric theory features gauge dynamics\ninvolving only fermionic matter fields, while the low energy magnetic\ndescription features a quasi-supersymmetric spectrum testable at colliders. The\nflavour theory is constructed via operators generated at the Planck scale. We\nfurther show that duality opens novel avenues for theories of grand\nunification.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DxGHDoren28WWDCrBkoRwupUSJr4v0Dp9X9PGLXmLqc","pdfSize":"375040","objectId":"0xaa065033507199c49a4fc9ce85242e0db3249731f1d17425aa34287039ff432f","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
