It transforms an input program into an abstract\nsyntax tree to infer and add type information. Then, it translates Python\nexpressions and statements into an intermediate representation. Finally, it\nconverts this description into formulae evaluated with satisfiability modulo\ntheories (SMT) solvers. The proposed approach was realized with the efficient\nSMT-based bounded model checker (ESBMC), which resulted in a tool called\nESBMC-Python, the first BMC-based Python-code verifier. Experimental results,\nwith a test suite specifically developed for this purpose, showed its\neffectiveness, where successful and failed tests were correctly evaluated.\nMoreover, it found a real problem in the Ethereum Consensus Specification.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"j814CbbXvZ-DFAf4mA3LdtJtokogyPOBu-4N9pNgilI","pdfSize":"327154"}
