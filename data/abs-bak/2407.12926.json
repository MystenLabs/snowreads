We\ndevelop a new algorithm to test for single-pulse morphology that is insensitive\nto the specific shape of pulses. Instead, it only checks whether or not there\nare multiple, isolated, statistical significant peaks in the light curve. In\naddition, we carry out a citizen science test to assess light curve morphology\nand spectral evolution. We find that, no matter the adopted assessment method,\nbursts characterized by single-peaked prompt emission light curves have a\ngreater tendency to also have a consistently decaying peak energy, or\nhard-to-soft spectral evolution. This contrasts the behavior of multi-peaked\nbursts, for which the tendency is to have a peak frequency that is not\nmonotonically decreasing. We discuss this finding in the theoretical framework\nof internal/external shocks, and find it to be consistent with at least some\nsingle pulse bursts being associated with particularly high-density\nenvironments.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"u-O2N0YytEUybwg5jdH18r-4gIcy_1HwMDJWQpRshfo","pdfSize":"327363","objectId":"0x4c5352acde690931123c803fb825c6c38b4b855d2e2939869c97da5168896076","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
