In this paper, the fast convergence\nand asymptotic-preserving properties of the GSIS are harnessed to remove the\nlimitations of the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. The GSIS, which\nleverages high-order constitutive relations derived from DSMC, is applied\nintermittently, which not only rapidly steers the DSMC towards steady state,\nbut also eliminates the requirement that the cell size must be smaller than the\nmolecular mean free path. Several numerical tests have been conducted to\nvalidate the accuracy and efficiency of this hybrid GSIS-DSMC approach.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YGtoWymI-M6H0lXH7iJwV62Eb1gLD9iuU6KHxWSnCMY","pdfSize":"2215655"}
