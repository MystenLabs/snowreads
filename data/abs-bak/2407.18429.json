We prove that, in most cases, a\nsection of a theta characteristic $\\nu$ (or any odd power of it) different from\n$\\omega$ is a noncongruence modular form. On the other hand, we show how\n$\\nu\\ne\\omega$ gives rise to a ``twisted'' analogue of the diagonal period map\nto a Siegel threefold, whose difference attributes to the stackiness of the\nmoduli of abelian surfaces $\\mathcal{A}_{2}$. Some questions on the\nBrill--Noether theory of the modular curves are answered.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"5cULzbmllbMaLOYD-CU02JxVL2ZS8qvSIgWM8siHg8Q","pdfSize":"411135","objectId":"0xa8827d9593c8898a687a22ce3dca86ad545e28d16bcb3d505b8abefd8158510f","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
