This framework enables us to investigate the complementability\nof closed subspaces within the context of continuous cohomology with\ncoeffcients in Banach modules. As an application, we extend and refine several\ncohomological results from the literature, particularly in the settings of\nnilpotent groups, products of groups, and lattices.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"byf0cVgXQ2lkvuk9Qjxr2FMjvOqc-EE3gTHDA7LAJpI","pdfSize":"360046","objectId":"0xc2a83668d34c74c73a7f6806bf271d0822a3f715179dcc1a2617d82a40445e56","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
