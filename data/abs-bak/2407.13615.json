The data\nwere collected in 2016 with the CMS experiment and correspond to an integrated\nluminosity of 186 nb$^{-1}$. The $\\Lambda_\\mathrm{c}^+$ baryon is reconstructed\nfrom the decay channel $\\Lambda_\\mathrm{c}^+$ $\\to$ K$_\\mathrm{S}^0$, while the\nD$^0$ meson is reconstructed via D$^0$ $\\to$ K$^-$$\\pi^+$. The\n$\\Lambda_\\mathrm{c}^+$ baryon and D$^0$ meson yields are extracted in several\ncharged-particle multiplicity classes. No strong multiplicity dependence of the\n$\\Lambda_\\mathrm{c}^+$-to-D$^0$ yield ratio is observed, unlike the observed\nstrange baryon to strange meson yield ratio of $\\Lambda/\\bar{\\Lambda}$ to\nK$_\\mathrm{S}^0$, which shows a strong multiplicity dependence. This\nobservation indicates different mechanisms for the multiplicity evolution of\nhadronization processes for charm and strange quarks and provides new\nconstraints to the understanding of heavy flavor production and collectivity in\nsmall collision systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"M3a9HgvK0-AOFe4va-b3LJbS5xOfiIjFBT2dCtjVVKs","pdfSize":"1189739","objectId":"0x1068eee0d665afe1ab3abeea9d39529645b0c52785b31a6e03da92440a2d87aa","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
