Our model can reproduce swimmer propulsion for a large range of\nReynolds numbers, and generate wake vortices in the inertial regime,\nreminiscent of the flow generated by the flapping tails of real fish. We\nperformed a numerical exploration of the model from low to high Reynolds\nnumbers and obtained universal laws using scaling arguments. We collected data\nfrom a wide variety of micro-organisms, thereby extending the experimental data\npresented in (M. Gazzola et al., Nature Physics 10, 758, 2014). Our theoretical\nscaling laws compare very well with experimental data across the different\nregimes, from Stokes to turbulent flows. We believe that this model, due to its\nrelatively simple design, will be very useful for obtaining numerical\nsimulations of collective effects within fish schools composed of hundreds of\nindividuals.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RKQ58zvLefLcPu0WAPazKx1ZQ4AsAGXhD9w6jKje6wo","pdfSize":"822099"}
