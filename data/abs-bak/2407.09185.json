The SFA focuses on fast timing (time resolution below 10 {\\mu}s) and\ngood spectroscopy capabilities (energy resolution better than 180 eV @ 6 keV).\nThe sensor, consisting of 19 hexagonally shaped pixels with a total sensitive\narea of ${5.05}\\, cm^{2}$, is connected to three high time resolution\nspectroscopy (HTRS) ASICs, allowing a fast readout of the detector signals. The\ndetector works in a Charge- Sensitive Amplifier configuration. We assembled a\nprototype detector module and present here its mechanical design, describe the\nused sensor, and report about its performance.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"D2JaoG5FKPg7I-Gg-PqI9wqYmfmcaymUSIEJP34V5rA","pdfSize":"3309787","objectId":"0x56b0fc8aaa137c067f7c52c57e9313307ade7a962d7e43700892196c69f51586","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
