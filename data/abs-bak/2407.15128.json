Using the description, we construct maps from the algebra of stable\nfunctions on the $r$-th Moy-Prasad filtration quotient of hyperspecial\nparahorics to the depth-$r$ Bernstein center and use them to attach to each\ndepth-$r$ irreducible representation $\\pi$ an invariant $\\theta(\\pi)$, called\nthe depth-$r$ Deligne-Lusztig parameter of $\\pi$. We show that $\\theta(\\pi)$ is\nequal to the semi-simple part of minimal $K$-types of $\\pi$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fLBwJwoo7_g5RE2ot21Y1_dVcFyV55qO_xOWiiCOoH0","pdfSize":"562566","objectId":"0x7e9b3b124a6a188ba217ff830bac0c6a073b380359ee5fb3a809caf3a95d04b6","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
