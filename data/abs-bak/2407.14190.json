The disrupted companion\nshreds into an accretion disc, out of which a gas giant protoplanet forms due\nto gravitational instability. To explore this scenario, we make use of detailed\nstellar evolution models consistent with WD 1856+534. The minimum mass\ncompanion that produces a gravitationally-unstable disk after tidal disruption\nis $\\sim$$0.15\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$. Planet formation from tidal disruption is a\nnew channel for producing second-generation planets around WDs.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"c0-TYBXr6faHARIcRYCTgL5443F7thjYLOLia59YbWQ","pdfSize":"2961971","objectId":"0x16747d9814468462ddb962d315789e4c6584e64360dd248ea7210264e0d71ed1","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
