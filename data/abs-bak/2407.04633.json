It also dismantles flawed concepts, such as assigning\nphysical meaning to Lagrange multipliers and numerous others. This work also\nprovides a comprehensive understanding of the Legendre transform via\ngeometrical, mathematical and physical insights, as well as its connection to\nthe experimental setup. The central result of this paper is the comprehensive\nformalisation of key concepts, including ensembles, variable dependencies,\npotentials and natural variables. Furthermore, the framework of thermodynamics,\nthe state function and the Euler inequality are rigorously proven from the\naxiom of statistical physics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DNESWDFaKgxkTk7KatQerQBv-IivGQO53CErHZkIxvM","pdfSize":"249859"}
