HMHD is a challenging system to solve\nnumerically because it supports stiff fast dispersive waves. The preconditioner\nis formulated using an operator-split approximate block factorization (Schur\ncomplement), informed by physics insight. We use a vector-potential formulation\n(instead of a magnetic field one) to allow a clean segregation of the\nproblematic $\\nabla \\times \\nabla \\times$ operator in the electron Ohm's law\nsubsystem. This segregation allows the formulation of an effective damped\nblock-Jacobi smoother for multigrid. We demonstrate by analysis that our\nproposed block-Jacobi iteration is convergent and has the smoothing property.\nThe resulting HMHD solver is verified linearly with wave propagation examples,\nand nonlinearly with the GEM challenge reconnection problem by comparison\nagainst another HMHD code. We demonstrate the excellent algorithmic and\nparallel performance of the algorithm up to 16384 MPI tasks in two dimensions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"IWNs-wDEkxcVYfMit5xe8FxwPXaBENmjEBUFR6dxnJ4","pdfSize":"825381"}
