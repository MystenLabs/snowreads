We show that,\ncompared with usual linear functions, non-linear responses enhance final\nconsensus and reduce deliberation time. This improvement comes at the cost of\nreduced accuracy in identifying the best option. Nonetheless, for value-based\ntasks, the benefits of faster consensus and enhanced decision-making might\noutweigh this drawback.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"v6BwtmSPf-ziEAg7NwAL9Z3Ekpf3B9InFZi8ry_rnmI","pdfSize":"737058","objectId":"0xe8c473c845475baec9ed2b5a7c450a44f865d084e53bdaa0637c09695530cced","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
