This estimator enjoys a linear rate of\nconvergence as a function of the Hausdorff distance under mild regularity\nconditions on $X$. Our approach combines tools from both geometric measure\ntheory and persistent homology, extending the noise filtering properties of\npersistent homology from the realm of topology to geometry.
