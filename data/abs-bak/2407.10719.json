A\nlarge variety of measurements in fixed-target and collider experiments provide\nincreasingly precise constraints on various aspects of nuclear PDFs, including\nshadowing, antishadowing, the EMC effect, Fermi motion, flavour separation,\ndeuteron binding, target-mass and other higher-twist effects. We give\nparticular emphasis to measurements carried out in proton-lead collisions at\nthe Large Hadron Collider, which have revolutionised the global analysis during\nthe past decade. These measurements include electroweak boson, isolated photon,\nsingle inclusive hadron, jet, and heavy-flavour observables.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"c677M4_mfePPAi8fElCLih24e-Llzyx5iediFmWSwds","pdfSize":"2174435","objectId":"0x67ac60f1b81de02e52f0a83d473bbf1c3e7083ed3d979a6f317bddf3ad882296","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
