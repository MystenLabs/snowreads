There is a need for improved\ndiagnostic methods for immediate medical assessments for optimal patient\noutcomes. This paper introduces VoxMed, a UI-assisted one-step classifier that\nuses digital stethoscope recordings to diagnose respiratory diseases. It\nemploys an Audio Spectrogram Transformer(AST) for feature extraction and a 1-D\nCNN-based architecture to classify respiratory diseases, offering professionals\ninformation regarding their patients respiratory health in seconds. We use the\nICBHI dataset, which includes stethoscope recordings collected from patients in\nGreece and Portugal, to classify respiratory diseases.
