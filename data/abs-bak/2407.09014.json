However, language models\noften face challenges when given extensive information, diminishing their\neffectiveness in solving questions. Context compression tackles this issue by\nfiltering out irrelevant information, but current methods still struggle in\nrealistic scenarios where crucial information cannot be captured with a\nsingle-step approach. To overcome this limitation, we introduce CompAct, a\nnovel framework that employs an active strategy to condense extensive documents\nwithout losing key information. Our experiments demonstrate that CompAct brings\nsignificant improvements in both performance and compression rate on multi-hop\nquestion-answering (QA) benchmarks. CompAct flexibly operates as a\ncost-efficient plug-in module with various off-the-shelf retrievers or readers,\nachieving exceptionally high compression rates (47x).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mjqZU7pyryluz6cXMP-Uj7jHIXcbavglh68U4TtOoZU","pdfSize":"495361","objectId":"0x3d9b1e8244b878034a0993173afb8d76044814babefd0c63ac6d2c80cd58bcb3","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
