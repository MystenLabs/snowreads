While there\nare advanced data structures for random access to grammar-compressed strings\nthat guarantee theoretical query time and space bounds, little has been done\nfor the \\emph{practical} perspective of this important problem. In this paper,\nwe revisit a well-known folklore random access algorithm for grammars in the\nChomsky normal form, modify it to work directly on general grammars, and show\nthat this modified version is fast and memory efficient in practice.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pVk4pNKKfK-cBwo_uU7E-TNXAU0gftzBzxpl0hOb80o","pdfSize":"236517","objectId":"0x0e14cc22c6b214d1f013f92545045b72794a6ef7676c2c3bd15e6cd1a7674065","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
