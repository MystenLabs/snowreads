In regression analysis of compositional data,\nthe presence of covariate measurement errors poses grand challenges for\nexisting statistical error-in-variable regression analysis methods since\nmeasurement error in one component of the composition has an impact on others.\nTo simultaneously address the compositional nature and measurement errors in\nthe high-dimensional design matrix of compositional covariates, we propose a\nnew method named Error-in-composition (Eric) Lasso for regression analysis of\ncorrupted compositional predictors. Estimation error bounds of Eric Lasso and\nits asymptotic sign-consistent selection properties are established. We then\nillustrate the finite sample performance of Eric Lasso using simulation studies\nand demonstrate its potential usefulness in a real data application example.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ad_SPGKwPRSLwD_JKeik9Hok23QxVao5_sMvnezX7Hc","pdfSize":"714513","objectId":"0x83b2bf5540888b64f7ea65ef9c2616e9dfebf1bdd0ff0c9922471a495dcb4ca0","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
