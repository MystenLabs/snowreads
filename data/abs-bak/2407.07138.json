Our study\ninvestigates the varying impacts of external support, uncovering a surprising\nabsence of enduring effects on network activity. We also investigate the\nnetwork's response to several notable incidents, including the Ronin Hack and\nthe United States Securities and Exchange Commission's hearing on\ncryptocurrencies, revealing a generally resilient structure with limited\nlong-term disturbances. A critical aspect of our analysis focuses on the\n\"whales,\" or major stakeholders in The Sandbox, where we uncover their pivotal\nrole in influencing network trends, noting a significant shift in their\nengagement over time. This research sheds light on the intricate workings of\nGameFi ecosystems and contributes to the broader discourse on the intersection\nof the Web, AI, and society, particularly in understanding the resilience and\ndynamics of emerging digital economies. We particularly note the parallels of\nthe long-tail behavior we see in web-based ecosystems appearing in this niche\ndomain of GameFi. Our findings hold significant implications for the future\ndevelopment of equitable and sustainable GameFi dApps, offering insights into\nstakeholder behavior and network resilience in the face of external challenges\nand opportunities.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UL3GnRzA2xIlLzteECtvSIUuYrkAPTcx2JIilT9zIRU","pdfSize":"4828792"}
