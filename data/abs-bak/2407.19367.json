This approach leverages the smoother properties of\nthese residuals, enhancing deep learning performance. Utilizing ten years of\ndaily S&P 500 index option data, our empirical analysis demonstrates that\nlearning the residuals, using the mean squared one-step hedging error as the\nloss function, significantly improves hedging performance over directly\nlearning the hedging function, often by more than 100%. Adding input features\nwhen learning the residuals enhances hedging performance more for puts than\ncalls, with market sentiment being less crucial. Furthermore, learning the\nresiduals with three years of data matches the hedging performance of directly\nlearning with ten years of data, proving that our method demands less data.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance","Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5kNvb11wvAKFHndD2uoLPJD1BrFAKS6tIn1cckr-iSQ","pdfSize":"297144","objectId":"0x069610b6a10a7cee606e233b483ee34fd1762f53c1423e57c01d08efe3f35d6e","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
