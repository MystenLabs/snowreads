We\ninvestigate two systems, a quasi-two-dimensional Mott insulator\n$\\beta^\\prime$-(BEDT-TTF)$_{2}$ICl$_{2}$ with an AFM ground state, and several\nmembers of quasi-one-dimensional (TMTTF)$_2$$X$ showing CO. The stabilities of\nthe AFM and CO states are compared between the use of a standard\nexchange-correlation functional based on the generalized gradient approximation\nand that of a range-separated hybrid functional; we find that the latter\ndescribes these states better. For $\\beta^\\prime$-(BEDT-TTF)$_{2}$ICl$_{2}$,\nthe AFM order is much stabilized with a wider band gap. For (TMTTF)$_2$$X$,\nonly by using the hybrid functional, the AFM insulating state is realized and\nthe CO states coexisting with AFM order are stable under structural\noptimization, whose stability among different \\textit{X} shows the tendency\nconsistent with experiments.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"0lTRqMhqZW06bIi64zy5lDMFb-pcHeQ96fQnti5zQpo","pdfSize":"8049894"}
