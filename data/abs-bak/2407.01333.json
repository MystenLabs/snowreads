Therefore, the importance of simulation testing before real-world\ntesting is self-evident. In recent years, the release of 3D simulators for\nautonomous driving, represented by Carla and CarSim, marks the transition of\nautonomous driving simulation testing environments from simple 2D overhead\nviews to complex 3D models. During simulation testing, experimenters need to\nbuild static scenes and dynamic traffic flows, pedestrian flows, and other\nexperimental elements to construct experimental scenarios. When building static\nscenes in 3D simulators, experimenters often need to manually construct 3D\nmodels, set parameters and attributes, which is time-consuming and\nlabor-intensive. This thesis proposes an automated program generation\nframework. Based on deep reinforcement learning, this framework can generate\ndifferent 2D ground script codes, on which 3D model files and map model files\nare built. The generated 3D ground scenes are displayed in the Carla simulator,\nwhere experimenters can use this scene for navigation algorithm simulation\ntesting.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fRjTz3mcTN_FCH2QN-RqMu_zoP5Zes95ZyFPOMy3q8A","pdfSize":"5665216","objectId":"0x12894e1fa87ce6c1478dafcf9e4f080cb4bda6355bfd9244ac9bc15c94435033","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
