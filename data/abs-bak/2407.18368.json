The diffusive memristor\nis known to produce regular, chaotic and stochastic behaviors which leads to\ninteresting phenomena resulting from the interactions between the behavioral\nproperties. The interactions along with the instabilities that lead to the\nunique spiking phenomena are not fully understood due to the complexities\nassociated with examining the stochastic properties within the diffusive\nmemristor. In this work, we analyze both the classical and the noise induced\nbifurcations that a set of stochastic differential equations, justified through\na Fokker-Planck equation used to model the diffusive memristor, can produce.\nFinally, we replicate the results of the numerical stochastic threshold\nphenomena with experimentally measured spiking.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rA0CWiPyD4CvZtStMOdMdFhWGUYT-Dy6SYAx6t84NKM","pdfSize":"4906133","objectId":"0xb15542cc366ae4378629d8bf93f7f687e1a210e8d6263aa775a64caaaeb2188e","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
