Recent studies suggest that transformer-based language models can be\nutilized as material generative models to expand chemical space and explore\nmaterials with desired properties. In this work, we introduce the Catalyst\nGenerative Pretrained Transformer (CatGPT), trained to generate string\nrepresentations of inorganic catalyst structures from a vast chemical space.\nCatGPT not only demonstrates high performance in generating valid and accurate\ncatalyst structures but also serves as a foundation model for generating\ndesired types of catalysts by fine-tuning with sparse and specified datasets.\nAs an example, we fine-tuned the pretrained CatGPT using a binary alloy\ncatalyst dataset designed for screening two-electron oxygen reduction reaction\n(2e-ORR) catalyst and generate catalyst structures specialized for 2e-ORR. Our\nwork demonstrates the potential of language models as generative tools for\ncatalyst discovery.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lTaA5ZNckr7e-bvZVWLYnm_-n07Lxsuqu2gegdaKApQ","pdfSize":"960879","objectId":"0x89fae4408d4222492c6e1bf876611f949450830a26be5f81b9cd0584abb5621d","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
