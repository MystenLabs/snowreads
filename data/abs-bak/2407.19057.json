To better satisfy\nthe stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA) we utilize stochastic\ncounterfactuals within a propensity-prognosis model of the data generating\nprocess. For more precise identification we utilize knowledge of discordant\ntwin outcomes as evidence for randomness in the data generating process. Our\napproach culminates with a constrained optimization problem; the solution gives\nupper and lower bounds for the ATE. We demonstrate the applicability of our\nintroduced methodology with three example applications.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Gkf8zlgwKbLQQbiN8KWctz36E6AC2avS1ys30bLjaTM","pdfSize":"147117","objectId":"0xd43a505287a036ffb6a6d25e2025d4401e886be176a099d6020bee407f6934a0","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
