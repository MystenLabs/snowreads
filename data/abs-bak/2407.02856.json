We explore the performance disparity\nthat arises when models are applied to incomplete data typical in real-world,\nreal-time network environments. Our findings demonstrate a significant decline\nin model performance, with precision and recall dropping by up to 30\\% under\ncertain conditions when models trained on complete flows are tested against\npartial flows. Conversely, models trained and tested on consistently complete\nor partial datasets maintain robustness, highlighting the importance of dataset\nconsistency in training. The study reveals that a minimum of 7 packets in the\ntest set is required for maintaining reliable detection rates. These results\nunderscore the need for tailored training strategies that can effectively adapt\nto the dynamics of partial data, enhancing the practical applicability of\nanomaly detection systems in operational settings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"o4lRXi0Ir1ud6PtUvhuHn6XhJosWiDQOnGfl3MCH0uA","pdfSize":"696234","objectId":"0xa16a5c015c112060c8f94be905c4a12071e686a2e2cee59b5c1c11e9447d6bf7","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
