We give simulation results of benchmark examples that\nillustrate the performance of the proposed adaptive observer.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"rVpTNFlt8dF1kziZvMb0OWEQ_cVqrstcsIYM-ZDNvJE","pdfSize":"3294276","objectId":"0x70ee5fc72155aa2243fab1dd3ec51fd78e62e4aa3fdebd7fe6f6b9ba443885d1","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
