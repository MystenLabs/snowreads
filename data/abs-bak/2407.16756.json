We investigate this for several\ndifferent flux choices in the $2^6$ model and find two examples that are\ninconsistent with the Refined Tadpole Conjecture. We also present, to our\nknowledge, the first 4d $\\mathcal{N}=1$ Minkowski solution in string theory\nwithout any flat direction.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EwVcENzDNJpkXKdBuHyXfhc5NPnYR2rmWaELlXobqP0","pdfSize":"585694","objectId":"0xb4e1f242cb8fee4fe6a4642d5b474f241e879c0ae5cea1693aa0dd164ee9e946","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
