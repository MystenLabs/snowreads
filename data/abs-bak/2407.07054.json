DP-BBVFL uses a smart contract to\naggregate the feature representations, i.e., the embeddings, from clients\ntransparently. We apply local differential privacy to provide privacy for\nembeddings stored on a blockchain, hence protecting the original data. We\nprovide the first prototype application of differential privacy with blockchain\nfor vertical federated learning. Our experiments with medical data show that\nDP-BBVFL achieves high accuracy with a tradeoff in training time due to\non-chain aggregation. This innovative fusion of differential privacy and\nblockchain technology in DP-BBVFL could herald a new era of collaborative and\ntrustworthy machine learning applications across several decentralized\napplication domains.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rGO1K7uqEi0laz9fvVjqoVne4Cy6RtM-Ps7L5qUFdts","pdfSize":"647089"}
