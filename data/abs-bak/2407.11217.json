We focus on the Euclidean $k$-median and $k$-means\nproblems, two of the standard ways to model the task of clustering.\n  For these, the go-to algorithm is $k$-means++, which yields an $O(\\log\nk)$-approximation in time $\\tilde O(nkd)$. While it is possible to improve\neither the approximation factor [Lattanzi and Sohler, ICML19] or the running\ntime [Cohen-Addad et al., NeurIPS 20], it is unknown how precise a linear-time\nalgorithm can be.\n  In this paper, we almost answer this question by presenting an almost\nlinear-time algorithm to compute a constant-factor approximation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wkrfwIJT0EZQTgpVnc-qsk2DY9BjjFBsSC9htVZ6x_o","pdfSize":"259082","objectId":"0xcde634067f32bc35bd6bf2146cdf4d53127fe1a5194737b2a9040e5289977c03","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
