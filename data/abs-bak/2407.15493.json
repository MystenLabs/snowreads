Riemannian submersions have been instrumental in\nthe construction of new Riemannian metrics from existing ones. Therefore, being\ngeneralizations of Riemannian submersions, conformal submersions are potential\ntools for constructing new examples of (special) Riemannian manifolds. A\nconformal submersion is said to be rigid if it reduces to a Riemannian\nsubmersion up to homothety. In this paper, we study curvature conditions that\nforce conformal submersions to be rigid. Moreover, under suitable\ncircumstances, using these rigidity criteria for conformal submersions, we\nconclude the rigidity of certain quasi-Einstein metrics.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rnZCO_j6zcy5sHbMsGcWS1OOMOQj2PHj5wp2APo1bLg","pdfSize":"299593","objectId":"0x0ac276f94d21e8895f81fbcde4bb8aa924349a08fce848e4e94007627a2d710a","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
