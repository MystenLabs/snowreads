When applied to quantum\nmechanics, first term in the sum is formally equivalent to Poisson bracket in\nclassical mechanics, which is a well-known result. The novelty respect other\npapers is the type of functions of operators considered: equations mentioned\nare proved valid when each function is an infinite series of positive and\nnegative powers of these operators, as long as every series converges.\nTherefore, this formalism can be applied to functions such as the Coulomb\npotential, where the inverse of radial distance cannot be expressed as a Taylor\nseries.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"tLIBseV2lw-D1gmTAGXXq62cq1D4tJt5B48X4bMvS0Q","pdfSize":"208457","objectId":"0xee4874483267dbdb1878ad72233e2809b1adc3e3ed20d5d11f6365e6b77212e8","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
