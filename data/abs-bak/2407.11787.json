Orange and red phosphorescence have also been frequently observed in\nlab-grown near-colourless high-pressure high-temperature diamonds following\noptical excitation, and their luminescence mechanisms are shown to be different\nfrom that of the blue-green phosphorescence. The physics of the orange and red\nluminescence and phosphorescence bands including the optical-excitation\ndependency (UV-NIR), temperature dependency (20 - 573 K), and related charge\ntransfer process are investigated by a combination of self-built time-resolved\nimaging/spectroscopic techniques. In this paper, an alternative model for\nlong-lived phosphorescence based on charge trapping is proposed to explain the\norange phosphorescence/ thermoluminescence band. Additionally, the red\nphosphorescence band are attributed to point defect which possibly has a\nthree-level phosphorescence system.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"G_dNGp6Ph9Bbd9rfQAKXwdzyF0-weuSA8pKsvYRspQE","pdfSize":"6521433","objectId":"0xa1586c60676e3f0ee1f6f71badeb8101705fd95df306d2d4a20d154cb270ed31","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
