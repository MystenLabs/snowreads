The effect\nis demonstrated in a mixed-dimensional model, where dopants travel along a\ntwo-leg ladder, while the spins feature Ising interactions along the rungs and\nthe legs of the ladder. The dynamics following the sudden immersion of two\nnearest neighbor dopants in an infinite temperature spin lattice shows that\nthermal spin disorder frustrates the relative motion of the dopants and\nenforces them to co-propagate. The predictions are shown to be realistically\ntestable in quantum simulation experiments.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"J87IKiZT_v2anAZO_5cM072ABmVDPWyLbJ0HNLbSl3o","pdfSize":"694656","objectId":"0x4a55b7d31365401f5f5538170b270471f6df2cf8a6b8fd6cc9905cbf33115218","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
