While LLM-based techniques\nprovide state-of-the-art results on many standard benchmarks, their performance\nsignificantly drops when applied to large enterprise databases. The reason is\nthat these databases have a large number of tables with complex relationships\nthat are challenging for LLMs to reason about. We analyze challenges that LLMs\nface in these settings and propose a new solution that combines the power of\nLLMs in understanding questions with automated reasoning techniques to handle\ncomplex database constraints. Based on these ideas, we have developed a new\nframework that outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in zero-shot text-to-SQL\non complex benchmarks\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kh486lIvJaT9hBIzCWiU_5kbXzQ9Pr-X19QKAUqmi7I","pdfSize":"492171"}
