While\ntraditional methods such as GCC, MUSIC, and SRP-PHAT are effective in static\nsettings, they perform worse in noisy, reverberant conditions. Deep learning\nmodels, particularly CNNs, offer improvements but struggle with a mismatch\nconfiguration between the training and inference phases. The proposed DOA-PNN\novercomes these limitations by incorporating task incremental learning of\ncontinual learning, allowing for adaptation across varying acoustic scenarios\nwith less forgetting of previously learned knowledge. Featuring task-specific\nsub-networks and a scaling mechanism, DOA-PNN efficiently manages parameter\ngrowth, ensuring high performance across incremental microphone configurations.\nWe study DOA-PNN on a simulated data under various mic distance based\nmicrophone settings. The studies reveal its capability to maintain performance\nwith minimal parameter increase, presenting an efficient solution for DOA\nestimation.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Sound"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xnTO6cMJ98N9-959w5lrnGMFAwaT9w-JOoyeDcpdyMI","pdfSize":"842055"}
