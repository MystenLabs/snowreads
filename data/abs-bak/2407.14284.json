To this effect we develop a novel supervaluational\nframework, called strong Kleene supervaluation, that we take to be a promising\nframework for handling the truth-conditions of non-monotone notion in the\npresence of semantic indeterminacy more generally.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"a8glvoeqPUqwrTNomHU1roLa4yTnl1FCtMamhfbRVYM","pdfSize":"424703","objectId":"0x43dffa645b637e19b3f921ba2f3bd65b07b05b89bf291a111f2df21cf9726fc0","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
