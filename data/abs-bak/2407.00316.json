However, this assumption does not\nhold in real-life settings where obstructions are common, resulting in only\npartial visibility of the human. Considering this, we present OccFusion, an\napproach that utilizes efficient 3D Gaussian splatting supervised by pretrained\n2D diffusion models for efficient and high-fidelity human rendering. We propose\na pipeline consisting of three stages. In the Initialization stage, complete\nhuman masks are generated from partial visibility masks. In the Optimization\nstage, 3D human Gaussians are optimized with additional supervision by\nScore-Distillation Sampling (SDS) to create a complete geometry of the human.\nFinally, in the Refinement stage, in-context inpainting is designed to further\nimprove rendering quality on the less observed human body parts. We evaluate\nOccFusion on ZJU-MoCap and challenging OcMotion sequences and find that it\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in the rendering of occluded humans.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"foE8-syxEMwovW_4Tx5PEqoozpCwh8Hnd8nfrQu9TP4","pdfSize":"8472487","objectId":"0x49ff63aeea5faa26b3ef313500374ae22a1da80c47ee1a6a93c78d2b8566d588","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
