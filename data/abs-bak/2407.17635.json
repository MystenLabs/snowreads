Our study incorporates\noperational and damaged bikes, a heterogeneous fleet, and multiple visits\nbetween stations and the depot. The objective is to minimize the weighted sum\nof the deviation from the target number of bikes for each station, the number\nof damaged bikes not removed, and the total time used by vehicles. To solve\nthis problem, we propose a matheuristic approach based on a randomized\nmulti-start algorithm integrated with an integer programming model for\noptimizing the number of operatives and damaged bikes that will be moved\nbetween stations and/or the depot (loading instructions). The algorithm's\neffectiveness was assessed using instances derived from real-world data,\nyielding encouraging results. Furthermore, we adapted our algorithm to a\nsimpler problem studied in the literature, achieving competitive outcomes\ncompared to other existing methods. The experimental results in both scenarios\ndemonstrate that this algorithm can generate high-quality solutions within a\nshort computational time.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fIaW9t25vlrQSkF_GNgM1Hr-2U9XW5707jOtmFfMrys","pdfSize":"263842","objectId":"0xf97ed52ae8c831ffc91d385e54b2c5be4a00faa8db1572427c393ab88b132272","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
