It is worth noting that not only the control variable\nenters into all the coefficients, but also the jump size \"$e$\" . We first\nproposed that the solution $Z$ of BSDEP also contains the variable \"$e$\", which\nis different from previous articles and we provide an explanation in Remark\n2.1.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"X3cziSsITS2pa7IR_EVnXfShbGc0kNn5QkjT-V9PQx4","pdfSize":"312159"}
