In telecommunications, for example, spatial, temporal,\nand frequency diversity, as well as redundant coding, are fundamental concepts\nthat have enabled the design of extremely efficient systems. In machine\nlearning, in particular with neural networks, diversity is not always a concept\nthat is emphasized or at least clearly identified. This paper proposes a neural\nnetwork architecture that builds upon various diversity principles, some of\nthem already known, others more original. Our architecture obtains remarkable\nresults, with a record self-supervised learning accuracy of 99. 57% in MNIST,\nand a top tier promising semi-supervised learning accuracy of 94.21% in\nCIFAR-10 using only 25 labels per class.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"A2zK9RVUI9qZNL-_7Xtrww9kFbxmOr4uyED6aGRFd78","pdfSize":"316903","objectId":"0x550ccedcec6ed5d636e8a281cfd1c39ba7967026902fe334ab6ee393ecfee967","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
