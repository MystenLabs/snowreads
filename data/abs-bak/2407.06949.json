The aim of this manuscript\nis twofold. First, we study the decay estimate for a class of dispersive\nsemigroup of the form $e^{it\\phi(\\sqrt{-\\Delta_\\kappa})}$.W e overcome the\ndifficulty arising from the non-homogeneousity of $\\phi$ by frequency\nlocalization. As applications, in the next part of the paper, we establish\nStrichartz estimates for some concrete wave equations associated with the Dunkl\nLaplacian $\\Delta_k,$ which corresponds to $\\phi(r)=r, r^2, r^2+r^4,\n\\sqrt{1+r^2}, \\sqrt{1+r^4}$, and $r^\\mu,0<\\mu\\leq 2, \\mu\\neq 1$. More\nprecisely, we unify and simplify all the known dispersive estimates and extend\nto more general cases. Finally, using the decay estimates, we prove the\nglobal-in-time existence of small data Sobolev solutions for the nonlinear\nKlein-Gordon equation and beam equation with the power type nonlinearities.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Z-dz33brgheC98vDo0Rv67DGWfjjoAUGGqExbm1vEf8","pdfSize":"402188"}
