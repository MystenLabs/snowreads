We probe the parameter space of the model, constrained\nby relic density and direct detection, and investigate the generation of\ngravitational waves (GWs) produced by an electroweak first-order phase\ntransition (EFOPT). The analysis demonstrates that there are points in the\nparameter space, leading to a detectable GW spectrum arising from the\nfirst-order phase transition, which is also consistent with the DM relic\nabundance and direct detection bounds. These GWs could be observed by\nforthcoming space-based interferometers such as the Big Bang Observer (BBO),\nDecihertz Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (DECIGO), and\nUltimate-DECIGO (UDECIGO).\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Or0GFKd5xtCCN7YQpYJagD5dtMnKg3Ip3EidTYpDrpA","pdfSize":"2270581","objectId":"0xa141d87ab05acf6cfa92257c60b042bf7446c8d85843bc3078de5fda0def5f20","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
