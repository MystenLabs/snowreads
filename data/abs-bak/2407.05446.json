It is thus imperative to understand and evaluate the current posture of\ne-payment applications from three major user-facing angles: security, privacy,\nand usability. To this, we created a high-fidelity prototype of an e-payment\napplication that encompassed features that we wanted to test with users. We\nthen conducted a pilot study where we recruited 12 participants who tested our\nprototype. We find that both security and privacy are important for users of\ne-payment applications. Additionally, some participants perceive the strength\nof security and privacy based on the usability of the application. We provide\nrecommendations such as universal design of e-payment applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"V15wjrHB61OhKSZOH4VbuE1MKHsZUM62K1CsDP_ZWMw","pdfSize":"189145"}
