In this study, we focus on two specific\ntypes of orbits, namely the plunging geodesics inward from the ISCO and\nhomoclinic geodesics, to uncover the polarization features associated with\nnon-circular motion in a Kerr spacetime. For an on-axis observer, we\nspecifically develop an approximate function to describe gravitational lensing\nalong the azimuthal direction and establish a simplified synchrotron emission\nmodel. Based on these, we analyze the polarized patterns of hotspots\naccumulated over time and their Stokes parameters. Moreover, we explore the\npolarized image of the plunging region within a thin accretion disk.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"U83fnhydwm6cWCE33EcT4LJ1UvuMBDBY_fJM-L4QDDs","pdfSize":"4390370","objectId":"0x7c446798802deafa3ade981f9aa61c6e705a08938db7a70965b9bebf4f88aa15","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
