Moreover, the\n$\\alpha$-beryllene was shown to host type-I Dirac fermions with the existence\nof nontrivial edge states. We observe significantly weaker superconducting\nproperties of both beryllene configurations. We argue that the superconducting\ngap evolution with temperature, as shown in Figure 5 (b and d) of Li\n$\\textit{et al.}$, exhibits clearly unphysical trends with increasing\ntemperature, leading to significantly overestimated values of the critical\ntemperature and erroneous conclusions concerning the two-gap superconducting\nnature of $\\beta$-beryllene. On a positive note, we report the value of the gap\nin the Dirac cone of the topological states of interest that exceeds the\ntemperature range of superconductivity in $\\alpha$-beryllene, supporting the\ncoexistence of topological features and superconductivity in this material.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uCqG6WDOLIl2xf-8VarHt7HkOsGEu3Kbb4BMG6bOWUE","pdfSize":"2481515","objectId":"0x91f3b71df5d4e4963182a7f49f09dd010233873a70d24aabb051923538ed0837","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
