The masses of the composite particles, the pion\nand sigma meson, are computed by two independent methods. One is the improved\none-point-function scheme, where we measure the local meson operator coupled to\nthe boundary state and extract the mass from its exponential decay. Since the\n$\\theta$ term causes a nontrivial operator mixing, we unravel it by\ndiagonalizing the correlation matrix to define the meson operator. The other is\nthe dispersion-relation scheme, a heuristic approach specific to Hamiltonian\nformalism. We obtain the dispersion relation directly by measuring the energy\nand momentum of the excited states. The sign problem is circumvented in these\nmethods, and their results agree with each other even for large $\\theta$. We\nreveal that the $\\theta$-dependence of the pion mass at $m/g=0.1$ is consistent\nwith the prediction by the bosonized model. We also find that the mass of the\nsigma meson satisfies the semi-classical formula,\n$M_{\\sigma}/M_{\\pi}=\\sqrt{3}$, for almost all region of $\\theta$. While the\nsigma meson is a stable particle thanks to this relation, the eta meson is no\nlonger protected by the $G$-parity and becomes unstable for $\\theta\\neq 0$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"C5w0FkiNuhErMG_CrZKxogRuaTxi-7jYBGJBxFMaby0","pdfSize":"1319187","objectId":"0x03ffa8dd9b8ffbbf6211c4ee41e677fd8c5385acba21232ffaf24151b045dd86","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
