This framework contains\nde Rham's functional equations. We consider some real analytic properties of\nthe solution in the case that the equation is driven by non-affine maps, in\nparticular, linear fractional transformations. We give sufficient conditions\nfor the regularity in the sense of Ullman-Stahl-Totik and for the singularity\nof the solution.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CIjXdZgkK2q_CTCiJDKq6m8PTkgLG2K-BnNZFf1WLtA","pdfSize":"265371","objectId":"0xa1c01aa1a3d7709ba438087c745e715f9e39337346dd77cb2b803d9b19c2a557","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
