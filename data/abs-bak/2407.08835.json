Utilizing a flipped classroom model, the course aims to equip students\nwith the necessary competencies to handle real-world data analysis challenges\nand effective statistical practice in general. The curriculum includes\npractical tools such as version control with Git, dynamic reporting, unit\ntesting and containerization to foster reproducibility, and integrity in\nstatistical practice. Feedback gathered from both staff and students\npost-implementation indicates that the course significantly enhances student\nreadiness for professional and academic environments, demonstrating the\neffectiveness of this educational approach.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Other Statistics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"1Ceo89qTuMPJP0H9LjJqhkRTM1MCm25keRvv892BEUE","pdfSize":"746683","objectId":"0x6872f2555e1b14a5cb1f4f33877ff36dad4655330cde77851574438012ac89f5","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
