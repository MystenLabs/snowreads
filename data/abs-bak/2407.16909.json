Given the growing demand for a computing-skilled workforce, it is\nessential to adapt educational methods to capture the interest of a broader\naudience than what current computing education typically targets. Engaging\neducational experiences have been shown to have a positive impact on learning\noutcomes and examination performance, especially within computing education.\nMoreover, physical computing devices have been shown to correlate with\nincreased student motivation when students are studying computer science.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xuqfuCbkxmI_HJ_y7Vu5bj0RCjhMtUHHnHrI_IQyFEA","pdfSize":"826571","objectId":"0xf892e36833a8f59315c39e891ebb790db939bd9a2404eb6a839f77004e775676","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
