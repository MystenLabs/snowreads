Although a\nquantum version of the Sanov theorem was proposed in Bjelakovic et al (Commun.\nMath. Phys., 260, p.659 (2005)), the classical case of their statement is not\nthe same as Sanov theorem because Sanov theorem discusses the behavior of the\nempirical distribution when the empirical distribution is different from the\ntrue distribution, but they studied a problem related to quantum hypothesis\ntesting, whose classical version can be shown by classical Sanov theorem. We\npropose another quantum version of Sanov theorem by considering the quantum\nanalog of the empirical distribution.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6kWjRhaU1uC9gIRJHUKlVsj09Gq4IJkou68ESVkWdS4","pdfSize":"171469","objectId":"0x07c4fc1d666a5476f74cf1843361728112b6053f9e89b4a18c1f184d289e0d41","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
