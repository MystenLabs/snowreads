Users interacted with a novel web-based AI system designed to ask\nfollow-up questions. Users requested documents they would like the AI to\nproduce. The AI then generated follow-up questions to clarify the user's needs\nor offer additional insights before generating the requested documents. After\nanswering the questions, users were shown a document generated using both the\ninitial request and the questions and answers, and a document generated using\nonly the initial request. Users indicated which document they preferred and\ngave feedback about their experience with the question-answering process. The\nfindings of this study show clear benefits to question-asking both in document\npreference and in the qualitative user experience. This study further shows\nthat users found more value in questions which were thought-provoking,\nopen-ended, or offered unique insights into the user's request as opposed to\nsimple information-gathering questions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GmPsBJwrP6el30G3af1Q-aiT6jAfZVEhIDRwGJ2q_6Q","pdfSize":"441761","objectId":"0xb7d058d0ea9840218353f537a6592e34de9308eb6d36ac316c91378f10703c7f","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
