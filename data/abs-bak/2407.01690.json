The cusp-core problem is one\nof the most outstanding. However, current simulations are unable to consider\nquantum statistical effects. For a fermionic dark matter halo, a degenerate\ninner core induces an extended outer core that dominates in gravity in the\nregion relevant for rotation curve observation. We study the properties of this\nouter core and show that its density and radius are correlated. The prediction\nremarkably agrees with the measured scaling relation in both the slope and the\nmagnitude. Such consistency suggests that the observed cored profiles do not\ncontradict massive dark matter but indicate its fermionic nature.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mLBsAmx0N8zTIq_ujFT1CmTS9fUIwEtWnAgYQ9CaHrc","pdfSize":"410270","objectId":"0x952e078c0c0e19f38201a46150ab6d590970d31d99310fdd5988dc13e7db7340","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
