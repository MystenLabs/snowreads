Following the ABMP\nmethodology, the fit extracts simultaneously proton PDFs, the strong coupling\n$\\alpha_s(M_Z)$ and heavy-quark masses at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO)\naccuracy in QCD. It includes recent high-statistics data on absolute total\ninclusive cross sections for $t\\bar{t}+X$, the sum of $(t + X)$ and $(\\bar{t} +\nX)$ hadroproduction, and normalized inclusive data double-differential in the\ninvariant mass and rapidity of the $t\\bar{t}$ pair at $\\sqrt{S}=13$ TeV. The\ngluon PDF at large $x$ and the top-quark mass value derived from these data are\nwell compatible with the previous ABMP16 results, but with significantly\nsmaller uncertainties, reduced by up to a factor of two. At NNLO in QCD we\nobtain for the strong coupling the value $\\alpha_s^{(n_f=5)}(M_Z)= 0.1150 \\pm\n0.0009$ and for the top-quark mass in the ${\\overline{\\mbox{MS}}}$-scheme\n$m_t(m_t) = 160.6 \\pm 0.6$ GeV, corresponding to $m_t^{\\rm pole} = 170.2 \\pm\n0.7$ GeV in the on-shell scheme. The new fit, dubbed ABMPtt, is publicly\nreleased in grids in LHAPDF format.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"gDiOlie69qjoi4Numxjljz1GfumzVjDDQUweXI3V9N0","pdfSize":"1601710","objectId":"0x9c125fe1c7270f8f3c69cf8e5688ade260cf5e5266d94c7f7e8bce3960ccdd05","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
