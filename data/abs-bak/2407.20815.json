Topics\ncovered include an introduction to higher-form symmetries with selected\napplications: Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories in the continuum and on\nthe lattice, statistical mechanical systems, the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly from\nthe point of view of non-invertible symmetry, and magnetohydrodynamics.\nMathematical formalism is kept to a minimum and an emphasis is placed on\nunderstanding the global symmetry structure present in well-known models.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AwUmIAh-xNr_jyeUcc7alceHk6lcJ037B7ZZkeqH6YY","pdfSize":"10389725","objectId":"0xe6a171e955ef3302aa6178405752d06fdf38f06a7db4b227231739c4012c6f26","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
