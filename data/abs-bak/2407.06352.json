For a large class of radially symmetric and rapidly\ndecaying probability laws, we prove for the first time the asymptotic rate of\nconvergence for the whole range of power exponents $p$ and dimensions $d$.\nMoreover we identify the exact prefactor when $p\\le d$. We cover in particular\nthe Gaussian case, going far beyond the currently known bounds. Our proof\ntechnique is based on approximate sub- and super-additivity bounds along a\ngeometric decomposition adapted to some features the density, such as its\nradial symmetry and its decay at infinity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"56OQMYChJcWIesqsBzuUDlsZpwDHOhab92W9BUGyk00","pdfSize":"426945"}
