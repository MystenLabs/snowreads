Experimental\ncollaborations are developing and constructing next-generation neutrino\ntelescopes with improved optical modules (OMs) and larger geometrical volumes\nto increase their efficiency in the multi-TeV energy range and extend their\nreach to EeV energies. Although most existing telescopes share similar OM\nlayouts, more layout options should be explored for next-generation detectors\nto maximize discovery capability. In this work, we study a set of layouts at\ndifferent geometrical volumes and evaluate the signal event selection\nefficiency and reconstruction fidelity under both an only trigger-level linear\nregression algorithm and an offline Graph Neural Network (GNN) reconstruction.\nOur methodology and findings serve as first steps toward an optimized, global\nnetwork of neutrino telescopes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8bUT2TghA5cynQbsYB-Y0V2iK9TGk_BD9kbrjQLtgEM","pdfSize":"1193986","objectId":"0xe23f33eb817765a264522ec369e262f8e9005435e05cac4a98481c63dd33454b","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
