While earlier theoretical frameworks focused on\ninstantaneous resetting, wherein the system is directly teleported to a given\nstate, there is a growing interest in physical resetting mechanisms that\ninvolve a finite return time. However employing such a mechanism involves cost\nand the effect of this cost on the search time remains largely unexplored. Yet\nanswering this is important in order to design cost-efficient resetting\nstrategies. Motivated from this, we present a thermodynamic analysis of a\ndiffusing particle whose position is intermittently reset to a specific site by\nemploying a stochastic return protocol with external confining trap. We show\nfor a family of potentials $U_R(x) \\sim |x|^{m}$ with $m>0$, it is possible to\nfind optimal potential shape that minimises the expected first-passage time for\na given value of the thermodynamic cost, i.e. mean work. By varying this value,\nwe then obtain the Pareto optimal front, and demonstrate a trade-off relation\nbetween the first-passage time and the work done.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YkdODSzp9tmmDN9DgOSS609m3yuQBJfkzSWj1y0C3-4","pdfSize":"1847473","objectId":"0x254a6708386eca49f239a0eefa054079fe5cc86d9d4044365cb7015c57bd063f","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
