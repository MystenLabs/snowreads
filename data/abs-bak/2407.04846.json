This\nphenomenon happens for many real datasets and when it does, it sparks both\nmagic and consternation, but mostly magic. In light of the Rashomon Effect,\nthis perspective piece proposes reshaping the way we think about machine\nlearning, particularly for tabular data problems in the nondeterministic\n(noisy) setting. We address how the Rashomon Effect impacts (1) the existence\nof simple-yet-accurate models, (2) flexibility to address user preferences,\nsuch as fairness and monotonicity, without losing performance, (3) uncertainty\nin predictions, fairness, and explanations, (4) reliable variable importance,\n(5) algorithm choice, specifically, providing advanced knowledge of which\nalgorithms might be suitable for a given problem, and (6) public policy. We\nalso discuss a theory of when the Rashomon Effect occurs and why. Our goal is\nto illustrate how the Rashomon Effect can have a massive impact on the use of\nmachine learning for complex problems in society.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"xijou0XToK0uAkTUqrmlsK4BqddkZpdmTHhMuPJ8WI0","pdfSize":"5245509"}
