We work in Homotopy Type Theory\nand Univalent Foundations, but reason informally. The main result is a\nconstructive and univalent proof that the two definitions coincide, giving an\nequivalence between the respective categories of qcqs-schemes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0kKIlCvkvglWkxe78wVx79jUmxOht3NuCXJoflgcR58","pdfSize":"639310","objectId":"0xf431c16f719eefd8735f158a649d3c6d1b186020d7f528f60be5e15188d3bba5","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
