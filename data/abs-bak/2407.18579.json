The emission angle can be adjusted by the flying focus technique which\ndetermines the speed and direction of the ionization front. When the ionization\nfront velocity becomes superluminal, the THz emission corresponds to classical\nCherenkov radiation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Eq38rtayCeFhynF3RyiLRJLN4MXJ8AylDrpi5Eb8tfc","pdfSize":"1118971","objectId":"0x208d1f63295283a0535f3e012733cb0554d9dbf30269ceee89334b69e3014883","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
