In practice, regularization\nis mandatory for applications that require out-of-sample estimates. To this\nend, we introduce a regularized estimator built from entropic optimal\ntransport, by extending the definition of the entropic map to the spherical\nsetting. We propose a stochastic algorithm to directly solve a continuous OT\nproblem between the uniform distribution and a target distribution, by\nexpanding Kantorovich potentials in the basis of spherical harmonics. In\naddition, we define the directional Monge-Kantorovich depth, a companion\nconcept for OT-based quantiles. We show that it benefits from desirable\nproperties related to Liu-Zuo-Serfling axioms for the statistical analysis of\ndirectional data. Building on our regularized estimators, we illustrate the\nbenefits of our methodology for data analysis.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OyySca7jNlxTWZrXLVbEcV--0JzfxPbpgUglzIC68Uc","pdfSize":"3395517","objectId":"0x5c8c906921fc3501a4e0c571ecdff28f60f19e75a187d791fec5834ec2e96ee4","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
