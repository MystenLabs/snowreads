Analyzing approximately 47 million Facebook posts, this\nstudy investigates the interactions of around 170 million users with news\npages, revealing distinct patterns based on political orientations. While users\ngenerally prefer content that reflects their political biases, the extent of\nengagement varies even among individuals with similar ideological leanings.\nSpecifically, political biases heavily influence commenting behaviors,\nparticularly among users leaning towards the center-left and the right.\nConversely, the 'likes' from center-left and centrist users are more indicative\nof their political affiliations. This research illuminates the complex\nrelationship between social media behavior and political polarization, offering\nnew insights into the manifestation of ideological divisions online.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OEW6kNmh5f1i7SrIlp_ywRj1U_mklo7fk6qJ1cry9Vk","pdfSize":"489525"}
