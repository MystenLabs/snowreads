This study proposes a\nmethodology for generating and verifying ZKPs to ensure the computational\nintegrity of cryptographic hashing, specifically focusing on the SHA-256\nalgorithm. By leveraging the Plonky2 framework, which implements the PLONK\nprotocol with FRI commitment scheme, we demonstrate the efficiency and\nscalability of our approach for both random data and real data blocks from the\nNEAR blockchain. The experimental results show consistent performance across\ndifferent data sizes and types, with the time required for proof generation and\nverification remaining within acceptable limits. The generated circuits and\nproofs maintain manageable sizes, even for real-world data blocks with a large\nnumber of transactions. The proposed methodology contributes to the development\nof secure and trustworthy blockchain systems, where the integrity of\ncomputations can be verified without revealing the underlying data. Further\nresearch is needed to assess the applicability of the approach to other\ncryptographic primitives and to evaluate its performance in more complex\nreal-world scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XAZOQeUg-r5R-4GFJfGP92VC3rnxSDp_RPGstIee4VM","pdfSize":"405292"}
