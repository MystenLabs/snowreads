Axions, originally proposed to solve the strong CP problem,\nemerge as compelling candidates for both dark matter and dark energy components\nof the universe. String theory, offering a unified perspective on fundamental\nforces, predicts a rich spectrum of axion-like particles (ALPs) arising from\nits compactification schemes. This paper provides a comprehensive review of\naxion physics within string theory, detailing their theoretical foundations,\nemergence from compactification processes, and roles in cosmological models.\nKey aspects covered include the Peccei-Quinn mechanism, the structure of ALPs,\ntheir moduli stabilization, and implications for observational signatures in\ndark matter, dark energy, and cosmological inflation scenarios. Insights from\nongoing experimental efforts and future directions in axion cosmology are also\ndiscussed\n","subjects":["Physics/General Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"I4F4K_A7ihngm7BHArJlVMab74Z3VNM6D8rCv9kfMVw","pdfSize":"138635","objectId":"0xf8530f6e358de7085fc384743b897a855c6ec8a3bc8b364c0b7a5d6e7293e743","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
