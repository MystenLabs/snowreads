Over time, researchers have explored various intrinsic and\nextrinsic parameters to modulate and direct these processes. This review\narticle focuses on how external fields, specifically electric and magnetic\nfields, can control the self-assembly of mesoscopic particles at interfaces. By\nadjusting particle shape and size, attractive forces can be finely tuned.\nAdditionally, the strength and direction of external fields significantly\ninfluence the final assembled structure. These systems offer promising\npotential for innovative applications in drug delivery, catalysis, and other\ntransport phenomena.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jSOsDaNiGs-sPGWhI-kD3ChwoSEcavGiQjeGyi_wD68","pdfSize":"770204","objectId":"0x8dff8c4ca7c73bb0d029a6d8d29ad5e607e0cde7908cc061141facf77ea7cc86","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
