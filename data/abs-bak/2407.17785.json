In the case of a two-terminal-pair configuration, we\ndemonstrate that the effect of 2.5 m long measuring cables, which are\ninevitable for some special applications, can be corrected in the whole\nfrequency range up to 2 MHz with an uncertainty of 9E-6 (k = 1) relative to the\ndc resistance value. Furthermore, the systematic effects of the LCR meter were\ninvestigated. Though distinctly larger than the resolution of the LCR meter,\nthese effects are accurately reproducible. As such it should be possible in the\nfuture to calibrate the LCR meter against a well-known calculable\nhigh-frequency resistance standard with an uncertainty close to the\nfew-parts-per-million type-A uncertainty of the LCR meter.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QRsYVNAC6w1YeCK4A8K04UgK5kongRCUefS6xU5c_kI","pdfSize":"1410319","objectId":"0x8f4580c77220b9e1bebfc303752bef5d51a3429c43950e64e583c37814de1f9a","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
