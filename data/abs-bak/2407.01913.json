The\nkey idea is to approximate the heat equations by a system of hyperbolic heat\nequations that involve only first-order differential operators. This scheme\nrequires relatively simple interaction terms in the Hamiltonian, which are the\nelectric and magnetic dipole moment-like interaction terms that would be\npresent in a Jaynes-Cummings-like model. For a d-dimensional problem, we show\nthat it is much more appropriate to use a single d-level quantum system - a\nqudit - instead of its qubit counterpart, and d+1 qumodes. The total resource\ncost is efficient in d and precision error, and has potential for realisability\nfor instance in cavity and circuit QED systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4cMM0Y6s9Z3m6fmq_PjN6UXhdLMzsfILV4BDC0x6oVo","pdfSize":"897376","objectId":"0x81419d53423e6d55635364a60c7ffca6e3fdb07f79e455cd3725c443c776f93b","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
