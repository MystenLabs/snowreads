They can\nbe viewed as a generalization of the Sz\\'asz--Mirakjan--Durrmeyer operators\n[9], Phillips operators [11] and corresponding Kantorovich modifications of\nhigher order.\n  For $j\\in {\\mathbb{N}}$, these operators possess the exceptional property to\npreserve constants and the monomial $x^{j}$. It turns out, that an extension of\nthis family covers certain well-known operators studied before, so that the\noutcoming results could be unified.\n  We present the complete asymptotic expansion for the sequence of these\noperators. All its coefficients are given in a concise form. In order to prove\nthe expansions for the class of locally integrable functions of exponential\ngrowth on the positive half-axis, we derive a localization result which is\ninteresting in itself.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MRkj4UfLtO-Hb1VDtVL4v_pWzfoL36Vw05NVIDzrT14","pdfSize":"199466","objectId":"0xf59268d50613f9b89b31b336738e20b852d68c1b8b0ff3b58a70df389a3dad7e","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
