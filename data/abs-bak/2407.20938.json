Here using high-throughput density functional theory calculations,\nwe design and predict tetragonal vdW-layered quantum materials in the\nMPd$_5$I$_2$ structure (M=Ga, In and 3d transition metals). Our study shows\nthat besides the known AlPd$_5$I$_2$, the -MPd$_5$- structural motif of\nthree-layer slabs separated by two I layers can host a variety of metal\nelements giving arise to topological interesting features and highly tunable\nmagnetic properties in both bulk and single layer 2D structures. Among them,\nTiPd$_5$I$_2$ and InPd$_5$I$_2$ host a pair of Dirac points and a likely strong\ntopological insulator state for the band manifolds just above and below the top\nvalence band, respectively, with their single layers possibly hosting quantum\nspin Hall states. CrPd$_5$I$_2$ is a ferromagnet with a large out-of-plane\nmagneto-anisotropy energy, desirable for rare-earth-free permanent magnets.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ExhVmt0TgbJez6l-4nDc25Z1CBLCFFFmILP8XaNVK_Q","pdfSize":"5548132","objectId":"0xe618a365c0d05484303268335f096b665c06601d4663d9535f07c1669f96e7d9","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
