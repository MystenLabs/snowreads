This\npaper proposes a 32-element monocrystalline thick-layer Germanium photovoltaic\npanel for efficient harvesting of a collimated 1.13-meter-diameter beam.The\n0.78-meter squared PV panel is constructed from commercial Ge wafers. For\nincident continuous-wave laser-beam power in the 4000 to 10000 Watt range, our\nthermal and electrical and infrared simulations predict 660 to 1510 Watts of\nelectrical output at panel temperatures of 350 to 423 Kelvin.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"I68u21kCXhgjjn-5GF5uhbgKgXglW5Q5a4wQ-WdinlI","pdfSize":"590111","objectId":"0xc2bb77f9eff560bf4573207f77233caa25db1df418a2fc5fdb3e21f4b3fa76f4","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
