In this paper, we\ninvestigate how pose and shadow impact a classifier's performance, using the\nspecific application of handwashing action recognition. To accomplish this, we\ngenerate synthetic data with desired variations to introduce controlled\ndistribution shift. Using our synthetic dataset, we define a classifier's\nbreakdown points to be where the system's performance starts to degrade\nsharply, and we show these are heavily impacted by pose and shadow conditions.\nIn particular, heavier and larger shadows create earlier breakdown points.\nAlso, it is intriguing to observe model accuracy drop to almost zero with\nbigger changes in pose. Moreover, we propose a simple mitigation strategy for\npose-induced breakdown points by utilizing additional training data from\nnon-canonical poses. Results show that the optimal choices of additional\ntraining poses are those with moderate deviations from the canonical poses with\n50-60 degrees of rotation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ltxgBm8cpFoOVIykEfvgjJkKu9UgkP_UHTepXf06c38","pdfSize":"43235408","objectId":"0xe268583f81d091a0fa6daee6e8347bdf5731ec3926167918b9214e3427c7e764","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
