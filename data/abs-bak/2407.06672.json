The system is equivalent to an inertial Brownian particle\nconfined in a harmonic potential whose center is controlled by a feedback\nprotocol which measures the particle position at a specific sampling frequency\n$1/{\\tau}$. Several feedback protocols are applied and the power generated by\nthe engine is measured as a function of the oscillator parameters and the\nsampling frequency. The optimal parameters are then determined. The results are\ncompared to the theoretical predictions and numerical simulations on overdamped\nsystems. We highlight the specific effects of inertia, which can be used to\nincrease the amount of power extracted by the engine. In the regime of large\n$\\tau$, we show that the produced work has a tight bound determined by\ninformation theories.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"1Y6AaI9LWk4gt7lUWhBJzOKcaCmaaAWN7yJn_nVBiFI","pdfSize":"782052"}
