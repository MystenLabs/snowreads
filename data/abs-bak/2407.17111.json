However, reliable automatic detection methods to generate such\nvisualizations require costly, knowledge-intensive training data. To facilitate\ndata collection for media bias datasets, we present News Ninja, a game\nemploying data-collecting game mechanics to generate a crowdsourced dataset.\nBefore annotating sentences, players are educated on media bias via a tutorial.\nOur findings show that datasets gathered with crowdsourced workers trained on\nNews Ninja can reach significantly higher inter-annotator agreements than\nexpert and crowdsourced datasets with similar data quality. As News Ninja\nencourages continuous play, it allows datasets to adapt to the reception and\ncontextualization of news over time, presenting a promising strategy to reduce\ndata collection expenses, educate players, and promote long-term bias\nmitigation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tzzjwIRPV-GATa2f9g20_67DDYtJDV-rmo7FYKS0JNk","pdfSize":"25019702","objectId":"0x28bbcbd65a278cfe70a4ecd2cda0312978e40855e77c570a215151691655c2e2","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
