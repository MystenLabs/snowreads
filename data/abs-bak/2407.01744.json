These are sets of $bd$ points in $\\mathbb{P}^4$ whose\nprojection from a general point to a hyperplane is a full intersection, i.e.,\nthe intersection of a curve of degree $b$ and a surface of degree $d$. We show\nthat such nontrivial sets exist if and only if $b\\geq 4$ and $d\\geq 2$.\nSomewhat surprisingly, for infinitely many values of $b$ and $d$ there exist\nsuch sets in linear general position. The note contains open questions and\nproblems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"wdu528b43NkNWBfu8nmInPVkm-8GlCeoKbnh-zZ3HkY","pdfSize":"369354","objectId":"0xc182973e3f97c097d4c37ce03a1122c0d45cacf347547a29aa99d7185fe4c1d6","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
