In the spin-1/2\ncase, it was also shown, through an appropriate limit of the non-skew symmetric\nXXZ Richardson-Gaudin models, that it remained integrable even when the\nmagnetic field is tilted to contain an in-plane component. Although the model\nhas not yet been shown to explicitly belong to a known class of Richardson-\nGaudin models, we show, in this work, that the spin-1 case also remains\nintegrable in a titled magnetic field. We do so by writing explicitly the\ncomplete set of conserved charges, then showing that these operators obey\npolynomial relations. It is finally demonstrated numerically that dark states,\nfor which the central spin is completely unentangled with the bath, can emerge\nat strong enough coupling just as they do in the central spin-1/2 model in an\narbitrarily oriented magnetic field.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1H1FxBRxPEh4qyB-7pSpvzo-y1LMT2VmQtj1tJ4n_mc","pdfSize":"664790"}
