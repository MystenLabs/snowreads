The demon mode is a low-energy\nelectronic excitation, and it has been suggested that it could contribute to a\nreduced Coulomb repulsion and even a possible attractive interaction between\nelectrons. In this study, we explicitly calculate the dynamically screened\nCoulomb interaction for Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ by using a renormalized tight-binding\nband structure and the random phase approximation for the dielectric function.\nAlthough the focus here is on Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, this material is considered mainly\nas a prototype system, having an observed demon mode, and our results should be\nconsidered as a guide for application to other systems. Our calculations show\nthat there are regions in ($\\mathbf{q}$, $\\omega$) space where the Coulomb\ninteraction becomes attractive. We find that, although the demon mode is not\ncapable of producing a total attractive electron pairing interaction in\nSr$_2$RuO$_4$, it does contribute to a significant reduction in the Coulomb\nrepulsion at the relevant pairing energy scale.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"b4ekqQfglN9-q5cmOFbLWPmG6QuiJ5rtckb5x4V-ITI","pdfSize":"1825027","objectId":"0x8f70b71742ba050fd8572e31dccfcd6bd1631ec51a9a6783ed12e8a13ce9d0cb","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
