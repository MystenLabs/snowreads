By\ncalculating the equivalent components for each segment of the channel:\nconductance, capacitance, and inductance, based on the voltages at the\nsegment's nodes, our model accommodates non-uniform variations along the\nchannel. We validate the efficacy of this approach by comparing terahertz (THz)\nresponse simulations with experimental data and MOSA1, EKV TeraFET SPICE\nmodels, analytical theories, and Multiphysics simulations.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"zdMjvQLc55WDlKXUoBbMsHDscSYCZwvrOD8zMGl4TgM","pdfSize":"795976","objectId":"0x75b826891be7b57d48659bd12bc8a3ef9799aaa9a85cc9c26e06fd947bcb1473","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
