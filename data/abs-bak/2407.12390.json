Our proposal uses the\nwell-known DDAMFN architecture as base to effectively predict valence-arousal,\nemotion recognition, and facial action units. We demonstrate the architecture\nability to handle these tasks simultaneously, providing insights into its\narchitecture and the rationale behind its design. Additionally, we compare our\nresults for a multitask solution with independent single-task performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"wGEdECnTsblFVYNg76AhAqCsSMcuR3Qh-bVYVYAQhgk","pdfSize":"379347","objectId":"0x858c6ac01836fc80db9681999184265536319dfb8520d0bdbf062897f98f0d5e","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
