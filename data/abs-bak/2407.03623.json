Traditional methods\nonly target labeled attributes, ignoring biases from unlabeled ones. Using\ntext-guided inpainting models, our approach ensures protected group\nindependence from all attributes and mitigates inpainting biases through data\nfiltering. Evaluations on multi-label image classification and image captioning\ntasks show our method effectively reduces bias without compromising performance\nacross various models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iTTNpeE6EbADXwJO4Mm2eUaa9gXNf9sFHYTRc_cQ0JM","pdfSize":"5330492"}
