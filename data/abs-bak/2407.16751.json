These\ncontributions are particularly relevant when symmetry-protected low scale\nseesaw models are embeded in the SMEFT, since large neutrino Yukawa couplings\nare expected. By combining our results with the already available gauge\nanomalous dimensions, we provide the complete set of one-loop renormalization\ngroup evolution equations for the dimension six $\\nu$SMEFT. As a possible\nphenomenological implication of our results, we discuss the sensitivity of\nlepton flavor-violating observables to $\\nu$SMEFT operators, focusing on the\nmore sensitive $\\mu\\to e$ transitions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hQas68A6cPKb1vYZcOSMZ5M-TMKimhQsghlESgmnV4Q","pdfSize":"888662","objectId":"0x6df74ee12203fc61a327266ce9868bacf8c1dca5963723483f4b3e7df64219b9","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
