One of\nthe main focuses of this work is to construct the Backlund transformation for\nthe different solutions of that equation through its associated Riccati\nequation and then that transformations further reduces to its algebraic\nanalogue with the help of One-fold Darboux solution. Finally, its exact\nsolutions upto three solitons are calculated with their graphical\nrepresentations which reveal dynamical profiles of these solutions.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"SOc0hhJlJGTGD8XQr82bqSW7aTSzOXSMB0kvbldR5iA","pdfSize":"3373734","objectId":"0x2fea7cfc613dbba8917bc8e19ddbfe341357bf4903d77fa7c351ad322b8dd0d3","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
