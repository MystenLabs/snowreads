The Noether\nsymmetry vector identifies a transformation in the augmented space so that the\nfield equations become solvable. The cosmological solutions are analyzed from\nthe observational point of view. Finally, for quantum cosmology, the\nWheeler-DeWitt (WD) has been formulated and solutions have been determined by\nidentifying the periodic nature of the wave function using conserved (Noether)\ncharge.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fxI1ho_WRRHMff2UFrduJM4QQv1-BBcso02ZMYG6Nu4","pdfSize":"210584","objectId":"0xa330557712977cd7197fe1f73a3c6056481d58c74984bdb0b726958b9853fd25","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
