For a widely prevalent and challenging use case, namely single-cell gene\nexpression data measured after intervention at multiple time points with\nunknown joint distributions, there is only one known specifically developed\nmethod, which does not fully utilize the rich information contained in this\ndata type. We develop an inference method for the GRN in this case, netWork\ninfErence by covariaNce DYnamics, dubbed WENDY. The core idea of WENDY is to\nmodel the dynamics of the covariance matrix, and solve this dynamics as an\noptimization problem to determine the regulatory relationships. To evaluate its\neffectiveness, we compare WENDY with other inference methods using synthetic\ndata and experimental data. Our results demonstrate that WENDY performs well\nacross different data sets.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Molecular Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"N6UQ8Z4MBypgc3YXa7NEsJciQ9ScjjUmNWCJd4RlvPI","pdfSize":"320464","objectId":"0xded0bcdb8d8f1e601cbc7e0f8c395452ef08c30e3847bd3b1068ebe5506bc767","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
