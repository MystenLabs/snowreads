However, in real-world\napplications, the presence of various missing modality cases often leads to a\ndegradation in the model's performance. In this work, we propose a novel\nmultimodal Transformer framework using prompt learning to address the issue of\nmissing modalities. Our method introduces three types of prompts: generative\nprompts, missing-signal prompts, and missing-type prompts. These prompts enable\nthe generation of missing modality features and facilitate the learning of\nintra- and inter-modality information. Through prompt learning, we achieve a\nsubstantial reduction in the number of trainable parameters. Our proposed\nmethod outperforms other methods significantly across all evaluation metrics.\nExtensive experiments and ablation studies are conducted to demonstrate the\neffectiveness and robustness of our method, showcasing its ability to\neffectively handle missing modalities.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_YhS2x1GibDRe7E0mIUpvZ90264pw8r2kty6V1r25Hk","pdfSize":"608900"}
