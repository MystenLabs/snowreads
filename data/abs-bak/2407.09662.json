Simulating these two-photon transitions is\nchallenging due to the continuum-continuum transition term. The hydrogenic\napproximation within second-order perturbation theory has been widely used due\nto the existence of analytical expressions of the wave functions. So far, only\n(partially) asymptotic results have been derived, which fail to correctly\ndescribe the low-kinetic-energy behaviour, especially for high angular-momentum\nstates. Here, we report an analytical expression that overcome these\nlimitations. They are based on the Appell's F1 function and use the confluent\nhypergeometric function of the second kind as the intermediate states. We show\nthat the derived formula can be applied to arbitrarily high angular momenta and\nquantitatively agrees with the numerical simulations using the time-dependent\nSchr\\\"odinger equation. Furthermore, we give an angular-momentum-dependent\nasymptotic form of the outgoing wavefunction and their continuum-continuum\ndipole transition amplitudes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"7_g7aJhImdZlIECdbojzRmlIBSzMVb2dVMCZcrqoBcE","pdfSize":"4045084","objectId":"0x246c472df0a4a7d284c31603d9b3d0c756678acaddd58abf2db184724f142943","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
