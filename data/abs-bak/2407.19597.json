Array-based apertures exhibit mutual coupling between\nthe array elements, which can significantly degrade the performance of the\nlocalization method. In this paper, we propose two methods to localize\nnear-field sources by direction of arrival (DOA) and range estimations in the\npresence of mutual coupling. The first method utilizes a two-dimensional search\nto estimate DOA and the range of the source. Therefore, it suffers from a high\ncomputational load. The second method reduces the two-dimensional search to\none-dimensional, thus decreasing the computational complexity while offering\nsimilar DOA and range estimation performance. Besides, our second method\nreduces computational time by over 50% compared to the multiple signal\nclassification (MUSIC) algorithm.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GiS5dQWymWrH_x3Tn96Zn639Ti_A-c38wKfJo98Yx40","pdfSize":"187723","objectId":"0x7b914f85303024c1296b90abb9e6045ea22a15124799fd237939413b84badabc","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
