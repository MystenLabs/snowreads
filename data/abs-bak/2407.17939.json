In\nthis paper, we address this question using a stochastic model of random\nrecurrent neural networks that undergoes a transition from quiescence to chaos\nat a critical heterogeneity. In the thermodynamic limit, using dynamical mean\nfield theory, we obtain an exact expression for the averaged entropy production\nrate - a measure of irreversibility - for any heterogeneity level J. We show\nhow this quantity becomes a constant at the onset of chaos while changing its\nfunctional form upon crossing this point. The latter can be elucidated by\nclosed-form approximations valid for below and slightly above the critical\npoint and for large J.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"d9Jc1_uhbeZnHyyjbsKYFO42l7DR_A0sCRuZJOx8hx4","pdfSize":"1432689","objectId":"0xad944528bb6fd2fedb7b9f55cbee0cd5ede4fe0083ced3ec4ebd8dc1d8b12df4","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
