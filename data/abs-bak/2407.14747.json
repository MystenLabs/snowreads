Assuming\nthat the data from predefined candidates of sensor placements follow a\nmultivariate normal distribution, we defined mutual information (MI) between\nthe data from selected sensor positions and the data from the others as an\nobjective function, and formulated it in a Quadratic Unconstrainted Binary\nOptimization (QUBO) problem by using a method we proposed. As an example, we\ncalculated optimal solutions of the objective functions for 3 candidates of\nsensor placements using a quantum annealing machine, and confirmed that the\nresults obtained were reasonable. The formulation method we proposed can be\napplied to any number of sensors, and it is expected that the advantage of\nquantum annealing emerges as the number of sensors increases.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mse56ZRJoS_X2QjcTI3xfmkUWqimAefg9Rt15lejIS8","pdfSize":"457062","objectId":"0x82ab1a89520c6e2026fde0999938a57db1f2d32ac928315328694a843b84be71","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
