Using constrained random phase approximation calculations, we\nderived screened Coulomb interaction parameters and revealed a competition\nbetween localization and screening effects, which results in nonmonotonic\nbehavior with d-orbital occupation. We highlight the significant role and\nnonlocality of inter-site Coulomb interactions, V, comparable in magnitude to\nthe local interaction, U. Our DFT+U+V results exemplarily show the\nrepresentative band renormalization, and deviations from ideal extended Hubbard\nmodels due to increased hybridization between transition metal d and oxygen p\norbitals as occupation increases. We further demonstrate that the inclusion of\nthe inter-site V is essential for accurately reproducing the experimental\nmagnetic order in transition metal oxides.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2q4ViF2wjRSLLgBZxjFAKIlB7VZAaR436-j__EnLFtM","pdfSize":"1243654"}
