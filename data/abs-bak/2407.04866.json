While promising classifiers can be obtained through deep\nlearning models, these approaches lack explainability, where the classification\nresults are hard to interpret in a human-understandable way. In this paper, we\npresent an explainable metric learning framework, which constructs hierarchical\nlevels of semantic segments of an image for better interpretability. The key\nmethodology involves a bottom-up learning strategy, starting by training the\nlocal metric learning model for the individual segments and then combining\nsegments to compose comprehensive metrics in a tree. Specifically, our approach\nenables a more human-understandable similarity measurement between two images\nbased on the semantic segments within it, which can be utilized to generate new\nsamples to reduce bias in a training dataset. Extensive experimental evaluation\ndemonstrates that the proposed approach can drastically improve model accuracy\ncompared with state-of-the-art methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mpA4dJx2JnoY_4p_tbH5ozjlFjIOv9uHG9b2qNspGjQ","pdfSize":"1184540"}
