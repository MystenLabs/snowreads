A priori, it is not clear if this is a local feature\nspecific to the Solar neighbourhood in the Milky Way, or if it is a generic\nproperty of the galactic cosmic ray spectrum. We argue that combining gamma-ray\nand cosmic-ray data of LHAASO indicates that the knee is a local feature. In\norder to demonstrate this, we derive a model for the local cosmic-ray spectra\nand composition, consistent with the recent LHAASO measurements of the\nall-particle spectrum and the mean logarithmic mass in the knee region. We\ncalculate the spectrum of diffuse gamma-ray emission based on this model and\nfind that the expected spectral shape of the diffuse gamma-ray flux is not\nconsistent with LHAASO measurements of the diffuse gamma-ray emission in the\n10-100 TeV energy range.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SdhikCBsQ_-cJWRHl2C_6f29JhVGDbPlsqnvIen9608","pdfSize":"503592","objectId":"0x5e1234c1ac9a1691cc464c9fe8bac7bd088d61b9ffd73b014762df9d8b0e329a","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
