We derive a stochastic integral\nequation for the conditional value of the signal given the observation, which\ncan be considered a time-space analogue of the classical Kalman filter. The\nresult is illustrated with examples of the filtering problem involving noisy\nobservations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iz_kluGiGlETmd9AZ_po7gvOZwhtJklkT749bk3O0is","pdfSize":"174611"}
