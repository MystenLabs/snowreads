In this paper, we propose a novel approach to\nconstruct the algebraic curve that interpolates a set of data (points or\nneighborhoods). This approach aims to search the polynomial with the smallest\ndegree interpolating the given data. Moreover, the paper also presents an\nefficient method to reconstruct the algebraic curve of integer coefficients\nwith the smallest degree and the least monomials that interpolates the provided\ndata. The problems are converted into optimization problems and are solved via\nLagrange multipliers methods and symbolic computation. Various examples are\npresented to illustrate the proposed approaches.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MkjrMOe17LJqY5BxUV49_te7qm-hclCxfa_A_FxmCyg","pdfSize":"471974"}
