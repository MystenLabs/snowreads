This method applies beamforming (BF) to each microphone\narray, and the common components among the BF outputs are estimated as the\ntarget source. This study proposes a new common component extraction method\nbased on nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) for higher model\ninterpretability and more robust spotforming against hyperparameters. Moreover,\nattractor-based regularization was introduced to facilitate the automatic\nselection of optimal target bases in the NTF. Experimental results show that\nthe proposed method performs better than conventional methods in spotforming\nperformance and also shows some characteristics suitable for practical use.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"pcx3mFLoCltz72IGDOfmu-pWSuTDb8K6Tfc9HqkpPNU","pdfSize":"3442510","objectId":"0x3a691ab681ade748cab7cbb22c49d6f5d32240cea4b429848b3834f26f5d2d33","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
