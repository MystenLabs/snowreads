Thanks\nto its quantitative assertions, eRHL overcomes randomness alignment\nrestrictions from prior logics, including PRHL, a popular relational program\nlogic used to reason about security of cryptographic constructions, and apRHL,\na variant of PRHL for differential privacy. As a result, eRHL is the first\nrelational probabilistic program logic to be supported by non-trivial soundness\nand completeness results for all almost surely terminating programs. We show\nthat eRHL is sound and complete with respect to program equivalence,\nstatistical distance, and differential privacy. We also show that every PRHL\njudgment is valid iff it is provable in eRHL. We showcase the practical\nbenefits of eRHL with examples that are beyond reach of PRHL and apRHL.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"gwo4eDGFN1-YUOFRlh9iDg3Tb0kHvil0i_Nj1bjwxso","pdfSize":"681477","objectId":"0x63ba4988dd0872672d950de0ef3b395d67a33fa744acf8b6f718b77820658fd9","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
