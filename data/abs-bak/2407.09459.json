Using the MediaPipe library, the system\ntranslates eye movements into precise drone commands, enabling effective remote\npiloting. In testing, GazeRace demonstrated an 18% reduction in drone\ntrajectory length while maintaining competitive speed with traditional\ncontrols. The results suggest that this approach enhances control accuracy and\nreduces user frustration, offering a significant advancement in the field of\nhuman-computer interaction and drone navigation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"FB9CkXhDKZ7litP-X1kjAJ8CNI7c1JGnMWfLuNVNYnA","pdfSize":"2851211","objectId":"0xa2a62fc0ffccc327ec7fb78dac13f1de992b63d987eeaa9b40d4f8a040ccc874","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
