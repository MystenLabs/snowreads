The main drawback of lossy data\ncompression is the introduction of error. This paper explains why many\nerror-bounded compressors occasionally violate the error bound and presents the\nsolutions we use in LC, a CPU/GPU compatible lossy compression framework, to\nguarantee the error bound for all supported types of quantizers. We show that\nour solutions maintain high compression ratios and cause no appreciable change\nin throughput.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GP5OL9kXHariwwyg0CJjHobrjiOGbLZYrPbnExWOtik","pdfSize":"588803","objectId":"0xc3262b5a3419e7a52aca940bbe68840a462770674eeb68d1d01902f9f114171a","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
