Since it was known in\n1995 how to compute the Fr\\'{e}chet distance of these two curves in $O(mn\\log\n(mn))$ time, it has been an open problem whether the running time can be\nreduced to $o(n^2)$ when $m = \\Omega(n)$. In the mean time, several well-known\nquadratic time barriers in computational geometry have been overcome: 3SUM,\nsome 3SUM-hard problems, and the computation of some distances between two\npolygonal curves, including the discrete Fr\\'{e}chet distance, the dynamic time\nwarping distance, and the geometric edit distance. It is curious that the\nquadratic time barrier for Fr\\'{e}chet distance still stands. We present an\nalgorithm to compute the Fr\\'echet distance in $O(mn(\\log\\log n)^{2+\\mu}\\log\nn/\\log^{1+\\mu} m)$ expected time for some constant $\\mu \\in (0,1)$. It is the\nfirst algorithm that returns the Fr\\'{e}chet distance in $o(mn)$ time when $m =\n\\Omega(n^{\\varepsilon})$ for any fixed $\\varepsilon \\in (0,1]$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FB5a2yKtbb-7toAmXaP9VneJM28b5Jq7KDFbGi2pHPk","pdfSize":"524612"}
