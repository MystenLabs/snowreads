The individual contributions of\nthe various nuclear responses are presented and discussed, and the results are\nalso illustrated in terms of the nuclear recoil energy. Analytical expressions\nentering the cross sections are given in order to achieve a direct connection\nwith experimental observables.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"l03BdGtjwVsprf-NlVxg8lKV7QKSCcJM46XIMad6Yus","pdfSize":"1198129","objectId":"0x2524720bdadb2cc55cea483020212d57db151108a7ba924ed0018b643851e263","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
