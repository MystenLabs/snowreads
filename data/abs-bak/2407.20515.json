Advanced image pre-processing techniques, including noise addition\nand blurring, are employed to improve marker detection accuracy and robustness.\nInitial results show promising potential for autonomous space debris removal,\nsupporting proactive strategies for space sustainability. The effectiveness of\nour approach suggests that our estimation method could significantly enhance\nthe safety and efficiency of debris removal operations by implementing more\nrobust and autonomous systems in actual space missions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qLOdqDBGXXvlyilpkUHAMsCcc5L_KtQSxicrZv9R2LU","pdfSize":"1876276","objectId":"0xf82bdf2b4717f9589d1c409a118d68625b0b44525ee7937330353d8f38dfc416","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
