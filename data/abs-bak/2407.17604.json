The higher frequency plastic optics require\nconsistently thin polymer coats across a wide area, while wider bandwidths\nrequire multilayer designs. We present multilayer AR coats for plastic optics\nof the high frequency BICEP Array receiver (200-300 GHz) utilizing an expanded\npolytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membrane, layered and compressively heat-bonded\nto itself. This process allows for a range of densities (from 0.3g/cc to 1g/cc)\nand thicknesses (>0.05mm) over a wide radius (33cm), opening the parameter\nspace of potential AR coats in interesting directions. The layered ePTFE\nmembrane has been combined with other polymer layers to produce band average\nreflections between 0.2% and 0.6% on high density polyethylene and a thin high\nmodulus polyethylene window, respectively.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"R0I0gxBtZfRidEA5xeI8EAazFPiAod6gSOR-RilHRJ4","pdfSize":"4647402","objectId":"0x9576258bf6b8518ae2c58a53672cf1417cedc09b93ca5c2cac595bbed3dac600","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
