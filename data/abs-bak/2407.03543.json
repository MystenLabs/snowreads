However,\nexisting works primarily focus on mitigating defenses against already\nidentified real-world attacks. This paper introduces secure blockchain-mempool\ndesigns capable of defending against any form of asymmetric eviction DoS\nattacks. We establish formal security definitions for mempools under the\neviction-based attack vector. Our proposed secure transaction admission\nalgorithm, named \\textsc{saferAd-CP}, ensures eviction-security by providing a\nprovable lower bound on the cost of executing eviction DoS attacks. Through\nevaluation with real transaction trace replays, \\textsc{saferAd-CP}\ndemonstrates negligible latency and significantly high lower bounds against any\neviction attack, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness in securing\nblockchain mempools.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NvN0w8_wyAtaztl-IuII_TU6hDw8cE-lZx0qI-4hycA","pdfSize":"559446"}
