However, they may ignore correlation between pixels\nfrom an image to pursue better denoising performance. Window transformer can\nuse long- and short-distance modeling to interact pixels to address mentioned\nproblem. To make a tradeoff between distance modeling and denoising time, we\npropose a heterogeneous window transformer (HWformer) for image denoising.\nHWformer first designs heterogeneous global windows to capture global context\ninformation for improving denoising effects. To build a bridge between long and\nshort-distance modeling, global windows are horizontally and vertically shifted\nto facilitate diversified information without increasing denoising time. To\nprevent the information loss phenomenon of independent patches, sparse idea is\nguided a feed-forward network to extract local information of neighboring\npatches. The proposed HWformer only takes 30% of popular Restormer in terms of\ndenoising time.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"sPG3xb9EdrThtEWmlO3I_P0dmV-HvsPdQq1MDkuPpzc","pdfSize":"8672593"}
