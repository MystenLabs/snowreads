In this study, a galvanic coupled\n(GC)-based IBC channel has been investigated for implantable configuration both\ntheoretically and experimentally in the frequency range of 0 to 2.5 MHz.\nTheoretical studies were performed by using finite element method (FEM) based\nsimulation software, called Comsol Multiphysics. A cylindrical human arm was\nmodeled with realistic values. Experimental studies were carried out with\nchicken breast tissue as a substitute for human tissue. The pseudorandom noise\n(PN) sequences were transmitted to investigate the correlative channel sounder\nof tissue model. Results showed that the frequency affects signal propagation\nthrough the tissue model. Additionally, it is crucial to cancel common-mode\nnoise in the IBC channel to enhance communication quality.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"XIBOiFfplhiH7dvhkwThC13we2LJUqsy7V0xuHfRzUU","pdfSize":"3295023","objectId":"0x3c5b99741fdd944624f23be14a25dd5a264e60e88a28e4d57729f411c27ca931","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
