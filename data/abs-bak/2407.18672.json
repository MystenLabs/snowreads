Twenty-four currents of the the gluonic\nhidden-charm tetraquark states in $[\\bar{3}_c]_{c\nq}\\otimes[8_c]_{G}\\otimes[3_c]_{\\bar{c} \\bar{q^\\prime}}$ configuration are\nconstructed, and their mass spectrum are evaluated in the framework of QCD sum\nrules with quantum numbers of $J^P=0^{+}$, $0^{-}$, $1^{-}$, and $1^{+}$. The\nnonperturbative contributions up to dimension 8 are taken into account. The\nresults indicate that there may be exist 14 gluonic hidden-charm tetraquark\nstates, and their corresponding hidden-bottom partners are also evaluated. The\npossible production and decay modes of the gluonic tetraquark states are\nanalyzed, which are hopefully measurable in BESIII, BELLEII, PANDA, Super-B,\nand LHCb experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"E0l8o8ejQiflbMZfKtF7-HKSlp-VaA3fZNSErRZj4ew","pdfSize":"1484227","objectId":"0xf76fef5e890a1741aa7cabf6d3a1cfa3bcf8de358cde665ff3b2580af11b74ed","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
