Our\nresults show that the interaction with the flow field around the bubble remains\nthe dominant effect. Nonlinear dependencies in this process can enhance the\nturbulent collision rate by up to 100\\% compared to quiescent flow.\nFluctuations in the bubble slip velocity during the interaction with the\nparticle additionally increase the collision rate. We present a\nfrozen-turbulence model that captures the relevant effects providing a\nphysically consistent framework to model collisions of small inertial particles\nwith finite-sized objects in turbulence.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HlLjUkJP8WJ4GlbRqGhbJO7kMk_C0dY0ysXTGkWF1xE","pdfSize":"1611817","objectId":"0x127ed559ff7542fe3d08a515a1d446fd5d2a00ea99491b60fca495785a321e88","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
