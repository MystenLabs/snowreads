We find a critical\nmonopole charge below which the solution exhibits Van-der Waals like behaviors.\nIn the context of holography, this could be intepreted using the boundary\ndegrees of freedoms. As an example, we study the phase diagram in the four\ndimensions analytically. We further analyze the microstructures of the solution\nusing Ruppeiner geometry. We find that repulsive interactions dominates for\nblack holes in a wide range of temperatures. However, around the critical\npoint, attractive interactions is dominant and the Ruppeiner scalar curvature\nshows universal behaviors: it has a critical exponent $2$ and coefficient\n$-1/8$ in diverse dimensions. Universality of the results is interpreted from\nthe scaling behavior of free energy near the critical point for Van-der Waals\nlike fluids.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5iAayWxrRNRtGvw4ygoDma8At41DU6Ch4s6i-cirXpE","pdfSize":"2095099","objectId":"0x1ba940b29b2f380abc486f53bba5ba797e8f326d46771afbaf057d7f2b3d6ff5","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
