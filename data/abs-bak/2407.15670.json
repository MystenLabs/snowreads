This paper shows a proof of concept of easy and\nlightweight monitoring of energy behaviors at the scale of a whole data center,\na user or a job submission. Our system uses software wattmeters and we validate\nour setup with per node accurate external wattmeters. Results show that there\nis an interesting potential from the efficiency point of view, providing\narguments to create user engagement thanks to energy monitoring.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bzOPkcGV8LLpsieVSjC4lBGCTjscwfrQwR2SCEEDxC8","pdfSize":"766315","objectId":"0x5c1526f0417b8ceba951dc8fb20b1c6518aedaa947dd475564827056d6326892","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
