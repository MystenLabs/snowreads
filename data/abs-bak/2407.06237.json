Traditional pseudocosts\nestimate changes in the objective function due to variable bound changes during\nthe branch-and-bound process. By integrating reinforcement learning concepts,\nwe propose a novel approach incorporating a forward-looking perspective into\npseudocost estimation. We present the motivation behind discounted pseudocosts\nand discuss how they represent the anticipated reward for branching after one\nlevel of exploration in the MILP problem space. Initial experiments on MIPLIB\n2017 benchmark instances demonstrate the potential of discounted pseudocosts to\nenhance branching strategies and accelerate the solution process for\nchallenging MILP problems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"53QXcuVBlz8kf_ShxfILqEjSOpwBGjBvpM35bTYD004","pdfSize":"110755"}
