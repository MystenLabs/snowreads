Most approaches aim at\nselecting informative or representative sample points to achieve good overall\ninformation of the full data. The present work takes the view that sampling\ntechniques are recommended for the region we focus on and summary measures are\nenough to collect the information for the rest according to a well-designed\ndata partitioning. We propose a multi-resolution subsampling strategy that\ncombines global information described by summary measures and local information\nobtained from selected subsample points. We show that the proposed method will\nlead to a more efficient subsample-based estimator for general large-scale\nclassification problems. Some asymptotic properties of the proposed method are\nestablished and connections to existing subsampling procedures are explored.\nFinally, we illustrate the proposed subsampling strategy via simulated and\nreal-world examples.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"9dWH17uWF9qLbbVFv9ot6LkuU_Tm3Fv3Hus8kScp-VQ","pdfSize":"967698"}
