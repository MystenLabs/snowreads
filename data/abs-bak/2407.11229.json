However, the robustness and consistency of current Visual\nLanguage Models (VLMs) in this field remain under-explored. This paper\nevaluates state-of-the-art VLMs on comprehensive datasets, developed\nspecifically for this study, encompassing diverse question categories and chart\nformats. We investigate two key aspects: 1) the models' ability to handle\nvarying levels of chart and question complexity, and 2) their robustness across\ndifferent visual representations of the same underlying data. Our analysis\nreveals significant performance variations based on question and chart types,\nhighlighting both strengths and weaknesses of current models. Additionally, we\nidentify areas for improvement and propose future research directions to build\nmore robust and reliable CQA systems. This study sheds light on the limitations\nof current models and paves the way for future advancements in the field.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7oXUjUOwVwaRpvXXny4sGbzPmMJGPG9m2bieI6oJ_0Q","pdfSize":"41897700","objectId":"0x037f654ca254a57bcf1158facb9387b387eb3c57b78bd462d87aab5d46c293b0","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
