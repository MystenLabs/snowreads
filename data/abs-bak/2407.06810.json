In particular,\nquantum batteries have the scope to exploit the wonders of quantum mechanics in\norder to boost their performance as compared to their electrochemical\nequivalents. Here we show how an exponential enhancement in stored energy can\nbe achieved with a quantum battery thanks to a two-photon charging protocol. We\nconsider theoretically a quantum battery modelled as a quantum harmonic\noscillator, which when driven by a quadratic field (manifested by a Gaussian\npulse envelope) gives rise to squeezing of the battery. This quantum squeezing\nensures that the population of the battery is driven exponentially up its\nbosonic energy ladder. Our results demonstrate a plausible mechanism for\nquickly storing a vast amount of energy in a quantum object defined by\ncontinuous variables, which may be explored experimentally in a variety of\nquantum optical platforms.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hWao95jVtxwASu3wRsTLZYNYOXWcj4-18oRvMWinRjs","pdfSize":"1031603"}
