While previous LHC searches have primarily focused on the\n$H^\\pm\\to\\tau\\nu$ decay mode, the decay channel into an off-shell top quark and\na bottom quark, $H^\\pm \\rightarrow t^*b$, is leading or subleading for $H^\\pm$\nmasses between 130 and 170 GeV. This study investigates the discovery potential\nof future colliders for this off-shell decay mode through pair-produced charged\nHiggs bosons decaying via $H^+H^-\\rightarrow t^*b\\tau\\nu\\rightarrow\nbbjj\\tau\\nu$. We perform signal-to-background analyses at the HL-LHC and a\nprospective 100 TeV proton-proton collider, employing cut-flow strategies and\nthe Boosted Decision Tree method. However, due to the softness of the $b$ jets,\nsignal significances fall below detection thresholds at these facilities.\nExtending our study to a multi-TeV muon collider (MuC), we demonstrate that a 3\nTeV MuC achieves high signal significance, surpassing the $5\\sigma$ threshold\nwith an integrated luminosity of 1 ab$^{-1}$, assuming a 10\\% background\nuncertainty. Specifically, for $M_{H^\\pm} = 130$, 150, and 170 GeV, the\nsignificances are 13.7, 13.5, and 6.06, respectively. In contrast, a 10 TeV MuC\nrequires 10 ab$^{-1}$ to achieve similar results. Our findings highlight the\ncritical role of the MuC in probing the new signal channel $H^\\pm\\rightarrow\nt^*b$, offering a promising avenue for future charged Higgs boson searches\ninvolving off-shell top quarks.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ODY39S7p3WX3qHDdZdf2nl6CvyqCGBftKTcZcNaAMkk","pdfSize":"1258532","objectId":"0x28e37b3130f6fc2e3d3eb21586343480325ace94f0ca17c451d67779b8ef9945","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
