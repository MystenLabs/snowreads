Semiconductor quantum\ndots (QDs) are attractive candidates that emit high-quality quantum states of\nlight, however at a rate limited by their spontaneous radiative lifetime. In\nthis study, we utilize the Purcell effect to demonstrate up to a 38-fold\nenhancement in the emission rate of InAs QDs by coupling them to metal-clad\nGaAs nanopillars. These cavities, featuring a sub-wavelength mode volume of\n4.5x10-4 ({\\lambda}/n)3 and quality factor of 62, enable Purcell-enhanced\nsingle-photon emission across a large bandwidth of 15 nm with a multi-photon\nemission probability as low as 0.5 %. The broadband nature of the cavity\neliminates the need for implementing tuning mechanisms typically required to\nachieve QD-cavity resonance, thus relaxing fabrication constraints. Ultimately,\nthis QD-cavity architecture represents a significant stride towards developing\nsolid-state quantum emitters generating near-ideal single-photon states at\nGHz-level repetition rates.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"oENAV7hvGXDPhbFxoTmfsA-zOqCQyD2islJmQ0ACboM","pdfSize":"2928151","objectId":"0xa29f7f97113041d90c136f5cf88192d6c4fd24b673baefa0d294b484ca1febbf","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
