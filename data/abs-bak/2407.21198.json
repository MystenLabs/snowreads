To do this, we use Tarski operators defined on the lattices of\nworker-quasi-stable and firm-quasi-stable matchings. These operators resemble\nlay-off and vacancy chain dynamics, respectively. First, we compute the lattice\noperations in the many-to-one model. Then, we extend these operations to a\nmany-to-many model with substitutable choice functions on one side and\nresponsive preferences on the other, via a morphism that relates many-to-one\nwith many-to-many matchings in a natural way. Finally, we present the lattice\noperations in the many-to-many model with substitutable choice functions on\nboth sides.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BbK5bSJl4ohOSqFk8lemCeepUlfldX1HtHrz0KQjf4g","pdfSize":"343173","objectId":"0xbf944bb006a1a78fa19980bf173444573e5b8cd2a256768df25428c3538eed4f","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
