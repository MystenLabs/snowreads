Depending on the size of the\nextended source combined with the spatial resolution and spectral dispersion of\nthe instrument, there may be locations in the focal plane where spectral lines\nfrom different spatial locations overlap on the detector. An unfolding method\nhas been successfully developed and demonstrated on the recent rocket flight of\nthe Marshall Grazing Incidence X-ray Spectrometer (MaGIXS), which observed\nseveral strong emission lines in the 8 to 30 {\\AA} wavelength range from two\nX-ray bright points and a portion of an active region. In this paper, we\npresent a systematic investigation of the parameters that control and optimize\nthe inversion method to unfold slitless spectrograph data.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vChyPnyxDrmbbF8jWh6jp6nN2Lkak9H8LFbllPLr6tY","pdfSize":"13798420","objectId":"0x1f5c1829a52e288aa4a1fdf911106d1317cb0e80946e492b48b01f9592ca338a","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
