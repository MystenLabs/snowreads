This principle ensures\nthat as long as a process operates within DS, it consistently produces a\nproduct that meets specifications. A novel DS identification method called the\nR-DS identifier has been developed. It makes no assumptions about the\nunderlying model - the only requirement is that each model constraint (CQA)\nshould be approximated by a multivariate polynomial model. The method utilizes\nthe methodology of Rvachev's R-functions and allows for explicit analytical\nrepresentation of the DS with only a limited number of model runs. R-functions\nprovide a framework for representing complex geometric shapes and performing\noperations on them through implicit functions. The theory of R-functions\nenables the solution of geometric problem such as identification of DS through\nalgebraic manipulation. It is more practical than traditional sampling or\noptimization-based methods. The method is illustrated using a batch reactor\nsystem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Brq3XY_UklLlzgu3gie4Q2tcToxVrCAtPFo_OYc554E","pdfSize":"902746","objectId":"0xe3d32443dfde949576f4c2d0ebd44cf6d458d22e0b8bfe17e99b01d56f204acc","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
