We show that the generating\nfunction of the tree series represented by such an automaton is differentially\nalgebraic. Conversely, we give an algorithm that inputs a differentially\nalgebraic power series, represented as a solution of a rational dynamical\nsystem, and outputs an automaton whose generating function is the given series.\nSuch an automaton yields a recurrence that can be used to compute the terms of\nthe power series. We use the algorithm to obtain automaton representations of\nexponential generating functions of families of combinatorial objects given as\ncombinatorial species. Using techniques from differential algebra, we show that\nit is decidable both whether two automata represent the same formal tree series\nand whether they have the same generating function.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rf60Ok5_qZCcgkUzm8j7Ckpn_brhpToAkHfUEls6WL0","pdfSize":"412115","objectId":"0x1a4eebb13b901677f7646cb1b7c27f946e8ec01b28b514508795566030862dd2","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
