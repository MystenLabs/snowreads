Here, after confirming that the 2D nature of the lattice\nis preserved up to 8 GPa in 6R-TaS2, we documented an unusual evolution of CDW\nand SC by conducting highpressure electronic transport measurements. Upon\ncompression, we observe a gradual suppression of CDW within the 1T-layers,\nwhile the SC exhibits a dome-shaped behavior that terminates at a critical\npressure Pc around 2.9 GPa. By taking account of the fact that the substantial\nsuppression of SC is concomitant with the complete collapse of CDW order at Pc,\nwe argue that the 6R-TaS2 behaves like a stack of Josephson junctions and thus\nthe suppressed superconductivity can be attributed to the weakening of\nJosephson coupling associated with the presence of CDW fluctuations in the\n1T-layers. Furthermore, the SC reversely enhances above Pc, implying the\ndevelopment of emergent superconductivity in the 1T-layers after the melting of\nT-layer CDW orders. These results show that the 6R-TaS2 not only provides a\npromising platform to explore emergent phenomena but also serves as a model\nsystem to study the complex interactions between competing electronic states.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"g7mCwnOR2lfDuEJW6N4IIE-PvezSGJEOs7lBw6Km_Lo","pdfSize":"948362","objectId":"0x76d05630f7df018fe703f95740466d3231e84b86ff4440d0f1d76dab2c0754c7","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
