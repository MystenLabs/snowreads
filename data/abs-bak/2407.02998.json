This work examines a class of FN models based on\n$\\mathbb{Z}_N$ discrete symmetries. We chart the allowed parameter space from a\nset of theoretical considerations and construct explicit renormalizable\ncompletions with minimal field content necessary to generate consistent\ntextures. We then conduct comprehensive phenomenological analyses of two\nparticularly elegant $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_8$ models, highlighting the\ninterplay between the effects of the ALP and the associated UV fields. We find\nthat the FN scale can be as low as a few TeV.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"x37MGyDkhBiXu2luZtTLyK-DbExsD4CqRUwChg0zOcQ","pdfSize":"4137989","objectId":"0xd8c36f5f3aae46dbb096e40e119d2304e7edd683bc61335b25ba28c5a4032c19","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
