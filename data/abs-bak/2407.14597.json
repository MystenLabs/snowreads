Next, I\nintroduce the antenna functions required for the construction of infrared\ncounterterms for final-state radiation at this order. Lastly, I describe the\nevaluation of the antenna functions and their phase-space integration, first\npresented in [1-3], and I elaborate on their application to precision\nobservables in jet production at lepton colliders.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"62yjmnJGLWHf_YVifYqDyut055BhKhhBMjDMgPXUtbQ","pdfSize":"213627","objectId":"0x25e8b349c653eb97496b8df1130db9f35ab067f81112ebed9b528a7a3c5d3715","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
