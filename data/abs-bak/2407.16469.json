Low $T$/high\n$\\mu_0 H$ transport is performed for arbitrary field directions, and an\nanalytical framework is established. The source of the negative longitudinal\nmagnetoresistance is identified as the Kondo effect stemming from Pt-vacancies\ncontributing an uncompensated spin, exclusively at the sample surface. The\nconcentration of vacancies and the sample thickness are identified as tuning\nparameters. The findings are substantiated by density functional theory, which\ncorroborates the proposed Pt-vacancy model.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UIjCF-eHC04zYEiRjVbvq03cEFPPAe1-ynxKt2sdo2g","pdfSize":"15098908","objectId":"0xd9c419b829f03da641eee4e769f2dc0f2c23075cf40414ca4e0f7b52406cd53a","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
