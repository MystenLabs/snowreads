Assuming that the potential wells are\nsymmetric, we derive the semi-classical asymptotics of the splitting between\nthe ground and second state energies. The flux effects due to the Aharonov-Bohm\nvector potential are of lower order compared to the contributions coming from\nthe potential wells.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Spectral Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"rummAc78VvnkGtB8UpPFPvt0_A4EIbjPGwdO7MQY9gA","pdfSize":"418639","objectId":"0xf03fca3c41dcfeb7f7277ff8ea8f3746d6f37b5c9c8fb2decd87c526dca5aad0","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
