In these models, one potential goal is to determine if\nnoise can induce transitions between states, and if so, to calculate the most\nprobable escape path from an attractor. In the small noise limit, the\nFreidlin-Wentzell theory of large deviations provides a variational framework\nto calculate these paths. This work focuses on using large deviation theory to\ncalculate such paths for stochastic gradient systems with non-gradient\nperturbations. While for gradient systems the most probable escape paths\nconsist of time-reversed heteroclinic orbits, for general systems it can be a\nchallenging calculation. By applying Melnikov theory to the resulting\nEuler-Lagrange equations recast in Hamiltonian form, we determine a condition\nfor when the optimal escape path is the heteroclinic orbit for the perturbed\nsystem. We provide a numerical example to illustrate how the computed most\nprobable escape path compares with the theoretical result.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mEaURoJqehBR0JIAxsilIj9t82cxUBsxVJZk74Tv9R8","pdfSize":"528963","objectId":"0x1773a579eb40d75a8e37e7cb89cb044e5bbd05bbf9f2727814ff1f995c042005","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
