Bochi and P. Laskawiec constructed an example of a set of\nmatrices $\\{A,B\\}$ having two different (up to cyclic permutations of factors)\nspectrum maximizing products, $AABABB$ and $BBABAA$. In this paper, we identify\na class of matrix sets for which the existence of at least one spectrum\nmaximizing product with an odd number of factors automatically entails the\nexistence of another spectrum maximizing product. Moreover, in addition to\nBochi--Laskawiec's example, the number of factors of the same name (factors of\nthe form $A$ or $B$) in these matrix products turns out to be different. The\nefficiency of the proposed approach is confirmed by constructing an example of\na set of $2\\times2$ matrices $\\{A,B\\}$ that has spectrum maximizing products of\nthe form $BAA$ and $BBA$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0mkesn9SbfnV1uKkZDg0zMxErK4nxenpSUoVxSk64yg","pdfSize":"592407","objectId":"0xf1ccd9df6734d19e44618712f57aca1db624f161805936d446a7dcc20572926c","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
