We show that the scaled packing topological\npressures can be determined by the scaled Bowen topological pressures. We\nobtain Billingsley's Theorem for the scaled packing pressures with a\n$G$-action. Then we get a variational principle between the scaled packing\npressures and the scaled measure-theoretic upper local pressures.
