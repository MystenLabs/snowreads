In our calculations, we have considered the neutron\nstar matter as a beta-stable nuclear matter. We have put the results concerning\nthe TBF effect in perspective against two-body results and other calculations\nof three-nucleon interactions, using the Urbana v14 potential and the parabolic\napproximation of the nuclear-matter energy for approximating the problem of\nasymmetric nuclear matter. As such, solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff\nequation, we have estimated bulk properties of neutron stars and investigated\nhow the present calculations would agree with the expected dynamical-stability\ncondition.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sQXYrAa4XR5YXP508Tv1ejBU6Xb1CbknPQkUXSC1BeA","pdfSize":"826409","objectId":"0x41246fe0809a7939a69a53c1913e1220e8c01ee106eddebb5fd38ceda7a31256","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
