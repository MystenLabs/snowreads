We take a robust optimization approach and soft-constraint\nanalysis, a min-max stochastic linear-quadratic optimal control problem is\nsolved by the follower firstly. Then, the leader deal with a max-min stochastic\nlinear-quadratic optimal control problem of forward-backward stochastic\ndifferential equations in an augmented space. State feedback representation of\nthe robust Stackelberg equilibrium is given in a more explicit form by\ndecoupling technique, via some Riccati equations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"iwFjUAnepLSNiVd7IS5euJbBwb-tFkPXkNhURwDRBXw","pdfSize":"530107"}
