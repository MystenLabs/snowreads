Those models still fail to fully\ndescribe hadron production. In particular, angular correlations for like-sign\nbaryons are not reproduced by the models. The upgraded ALICE detector and the\nnew analysis framework allow for precise measurements of baryon angular\ncorrelations which provide stronger constraints on the hadronization\nmechanisms.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ixDhF5FAMKIJ1dRtK3WmIuIY-74UXWyFzhx_X56K9OY","pdfSize":"1497135"}
