Our\ninvestigation focused on individual gold nanorods and nanodisks of various\nsizes. We observed that oscillation frequencies increase linearly as\ntemperature decreases until saturation is reached at cryogenic temperatures.\nThis behavior is explained by the temperature dependence of the elastic\nmodulus, with a Debye temperature compatible with reported bulk values for\ngold. To describe the behavior of the quality factor, we developed a model\nconsidering the nanostructures as anelastic solids, identifying a dissipation\npeak around 150 K due to a thermally activated process, likely of the\nNiblett-Wilks mechanism type. Importantly, our findings suggest that external\ndissipation factors are more critical to improving quality factors than\ninternal friction, which can be increased by modifying the nanoresonator's\nenvironment. Our results enable the design of structures with high vibration\nfrequencies and quality factors by effectively controlling external losses.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"zQsilU0FUIJjdqHUQxUjkYZDPBSp76yWdjejWHGWQ98","pdfSize":"9157395"}
