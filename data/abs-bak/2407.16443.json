In this paper, we design new linear-time algorithms to construct\nalphabetic codes, and we show that the obtained codes are not too far from\nbeing optimal. Moreover, we exploit our results on alphabetic codes to provide\nnew bounds on the average cost of optimal binary search trees. Our results\nimprove on the best-known bounds on the average cost of optimal binary search\ntrees present in the literature.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qCkAKTvTBn0r_HZQkefLZiWz4r5Q1wE78HmOBD2GjwI","pdfSize":"487320","objectId":"0x2930e50979455e3a97809d1d4ef7d0170119a79c29a184e2819ad293fd40bb20","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
