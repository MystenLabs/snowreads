To counter this, we have developed strategies within\ncurriculum to reduce the dependencies on LMMs that represented by ChatGPT-4o.\nThese include designing course topics that encourage hands-on problem-solving.\nThe proposed strategies were demonstrated through an actual course\nimplementation. Preliminary results show that the methods effectively enhance\nstudent engagement and understanding, balancing the benefits of technology with\nthe preservation of traditional learning principles.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BfMQ44c9F8W_HaBqCDVNjRl7l4yR1jxc4kU3uq-aGKE","pdfSize":"366639","objectId":"0x21173c067407580ac4a80d905db28b4d1eabc01a10ed2e73d8d4ff1cbf8f977c","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
