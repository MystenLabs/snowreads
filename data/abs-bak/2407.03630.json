Although quality inspection can be made by a human expert while\nmanufacturing, this operation is prone to errors. One possible solution may be\nusing standard machine vision techniques to automatically detect defects on\nwood surfaces. Due to the random texture on wood surfaces, this solution is\nalso not possible most of the times. Therefore, more advanced and novel machine\nvision techniques are needed to automatically inspect wood surfaces. In this\nstudy, we propose such a solution based on support region extraction from the\ngradient magnitude and the Laplacian of Gaussian response of the wood surface\nimage. We introduce novel structural and conditional statistical features using\nthese support regions. Then, we classify different defect types on wood\nsurfaces using our novel features. We tested our automated wood surface\ninspection system on a large data set and obtained very promising results.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HgeAe8RMFvt2tiYfVmtZPZX4V-8oDw5cBNVzTRVRq3s","pdfSize":"338976"}
