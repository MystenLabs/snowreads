Especially Sub-Saharan Africa\ncan benefit from it enabling an increased access to clean energy through\nutilizing its beneficial conditions for renewable energies. However, developing\ngreen hydrogen strategies for Sub-Saharan Africa requires highly detailed and\nconsistent information ranging from technical, environmental, economic, and\nsocial dimensions, which is currently lacking in literature. Therefore, this\npaper provides a comprehensive novel approach embedding the required range of\ndisciplines to analyze green hydrogen cost-potentials in Sub-Saharan Africa.\nThis approach stretches from a dedicated land eligibility based on local\npreferences, a location specific renewable energy simulation, locally derived\nsustainable groundwater limitations under climate change, an optimization of\nlocal hydrogen energy systems, and a socio-economic indicator-based impact\nanalysis. The capability of the approach is shown for case study regions in\nSub-Saharan Africa highlighting the need for a unified, interdisciplinary\napproach.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"9Iy3PzrdfUdXu8gksdD1fgdgPX4vxPkJIG5rGpq1bgM","pdfSize":"1867775","objectId":"0xe9583a1779bfba58539ae16c67836b9167d4b22636277605f94df8d9cd4ae6eb","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
