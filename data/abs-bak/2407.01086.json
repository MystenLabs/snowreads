This article\nintroduces a novel multi-UAV-aided MEC system operating at THz frequencies to\nminimize expected user service delays, including communication and computation\nlatency. We address this challenge by jointly optimizing UAV relay selection,\npower control, positioning, and user-resource association for task offloading\nand resource allocation. To tackle the problem's complexities, we decompose it\ninto four subproblems, each solved optimally with our proposed algorithm. An\niterative penalty dual decomposition (PDD) algorithm approximates the original\nproblem's solution. Numerical results demonstrate that our PDD-based approach\noutperforms baseline algorithms in terms of expected user service delay.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6FHG168oGg5-xxKSfy59gn9WP1jaqqSX0seVL0E_jSA","pdfSize":"545054","objectId":"0x84506e6d8dbfd81484daea7f6476d282428dfb17368a27f51cacf4d2a28eeba4","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
