One approach to address this is to augment an existing gray-box\nmodel with data-driven residual estimators. The efficacy of such estimators,\nand hence the performance of the EMS, relies on the availability of sufficient\nand suitable training data. In this work, we evaluate how different data\navailability scenarios affect estimator and controller performance. To do this,\nwe perform software-in-the-loop (SiL) simulation with a physics-based digital\ntwin using real measurement data. Simulation results show that acceptable\nestimation and control performance can already be achieved with limited\navailable data, and we confirm that leveraging historical data for pretraining\nboosts efficacy.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"8NjhF8y3kEmwsqxdAujLc8mglpVoxYY_UYvi1UbFhS8","pdfSize":"508341","objectId":"0x29203f1bf9014faae59521c826ee5537c1ef803449cbabcac58177d594e9c489","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
