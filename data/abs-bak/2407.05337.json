The advantage of representing an application with a\nworkflow is the possibility of exploiting Workflow Management System (WMS)\nfeatures such as portability. A relevant feature that some WMSs supply is\nreliability. Over recent years, the emergence of hybrid workflows has posed new\nand intriguing challenges by increasing the possibility of distributing\ncomputations involving heterogeneous and independent environments.\nConsequently, the number of possible points of failure in the execution\nincreased, creating different important challenges that are interesting to\nstudy. This paper presents the implementation of a fault tolerance mechanism\nfor hybrid workflows based on the recovery and rollback approach. A\nrepresentation of the hybrid workflows with the formal framework is provided,\ntogether with the experiments demonstrating the functionality of implementing\napproach.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"b3n8p4IlGsUPfLQn93etgKy3CQSB-BG9XMiSD2hdu74","pdfSize":"1025149"}
