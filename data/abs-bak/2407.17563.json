For example, Hamiltonian symmetries may limit allowed\nstate transitions or simplify learning parameters in machine learning\napplications, and certain asymmetric quantum states are known to be resourceful\nin various applications. Symmetry testing algorithms provide a means to\nidentify and quantify these properties with respect to a representation of a\ngroup. In this paper, we present a collection of quantum algorithms that\nrealize projections onto the symmetric subspace, as well as the asymmetric\nsubspace, of quantum systems. We describe how this can be modified to realize\nan antisymmetric projection as well, and we show how projectors can be combined\nin a systematic way to effectively measure various projections in a single\nquantum circuit. Using these constructions, we demonstrate applications such as\ntesting for Werner-state symmetry and estimating Schmidt ranks of bipartite\nstates, supported by experimental data from IBM Quantum systems. This work\nunderscores the pivotal role of symmetry in simplifying quantum calculations\nand advancing quantum information tasks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7UHuVyUVtWC7BXFnLX15q10JmImCQ769cexeT-H78L8","pdfSize":"756618","objectId":"0x9e6f7343835468ccc25407d1458a91e7e421a95bb8f5d232ad201c83574e25a4","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
