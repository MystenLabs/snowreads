Despite the recent outpouring of interest in private mean\nestimation, privatizing U-statistics has received little attention. While\nexisting private mean estimation algorithms can be applied to obtain confidence\nintervals, we show that they can lead to suboptimal private error, e.g.,\nconstant-factor inflation in the leading term, or even $\\Theta(1/n)$ rather\nthan $O(1/n^2)$ in degenerate settings. To remedy this, we propose a new\nthresholding-based approach using \\emph{local H\\'ajek projections} to reweight\ndifferent subsets of the data. This leads to nearly optimal private error for\nnon-degenerate U-statistics and a strong indication of near-optimality for\ndegenerate U-statistics.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ibgRrGUGpljI_9EJgzXakd1nhGMPHWwZltsBaKNwbqE","pdfSize":"1090617"}
