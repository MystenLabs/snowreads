Under\nactive inference, communication can be cast as sharing beliefs between\nfree-energy minimizing agents, where one agent's beliefs get transformed into\nan observation modality for the other. However, the best approach for\ntransforming beliefs into observations remains an open question. In this paper,\nwe demonstrate that naively sharing posterior beliefs can give rise to the\nnegative social dynamics of echo chambers and self-doubt. We propose an\nalternate belief sharing strategy which mitigates these issues.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SV4kGCuqq5Gc6O6nx9BFRbcYj5jDLLOl-P1ygmmBSu4","pdfSize":"605000","objectId":"0x1002789446de3cebb080687fa3717dcd21f68ad55f088121f9e4bce6ef1a39f1","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
