First half of the algorithm is about deciding whether given finitely\ngenerated group is contained in an algebraic group. For the next half, we\ncompute the totality of the invariant subvarieties for a single triangular\nautomorphism. Then, the computation for the individual generators is applied to\ncompute the orbit Zariski closure for a finitely generated group.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"G0KEG0znS1Yx8UBo0muXBnPCGFnA1-qTAGwDU9YJA-I","pdfSize":"323954","objectId":"0x3bb0782d04bd3711602fb6a2ed2778b38534ec28eee558d9299fa796ae777b47","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
