In our previous work, we have shown\nthat hadronuclear (p-p) interactions in AGN jets could be important and\ngenerate detectable very-high-energy emissions. Here, we further explore these\ninteractions in the AGN jets based on their luminosity function. The diffuse\nneutrino flux and corresponding $\\gamma$-ray flux have been calculated and\ncompared with observational data. In our modeling, two beaming patterns are\nconsidered separately. To make sure that the corresponding $\\gamma$-ray flux\ndoes not overshoot the diffuse $\\gamma$-ray background, we find that if the\nneutrino production region in jet is opaque to $\\gamma$ rays, p-p interactions\nin AGN jets with a small viewing angle (the blazar case) are able to interpret\nthe PeV neutrino background. Similarly, AGN jets with a large viewing angle\n(the radio galaxy case) may interpret the TeV neutrino background. While, if\nthe neutrino production region is transparent to $\\gamma$ rays, only blazars\nhave the potential to interpret the DNB around PeV band. Some caveats are also\ndiscussed.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"381DAvvTSeSlAIVvFneQW90OnDJCkH475LjRdfuLgqI","pdfSize":"608262"}
