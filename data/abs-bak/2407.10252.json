The task\nspans five languages: Arabic, Bulgarian, English, German, and Italian, along\nwith a multilingual category. Our approach involved several key techniques.\nInitially, we preprocessed the data through parts of speech (POS) tagging,\nidentification of question marks, and application of attention masks. We\nfine-tuned the sentiment-based Transformer model\n'MarieAngeA13/Sentiment-Analysis-BERT' on our dataset. Given the imbalance with\nmore objective data, we implemented a custom classifier that assigned greater\nweight to objective data. Additionally, we translated non-English data into\nEnglish to maintain consistency across the dataset. Our model achieved notable\nresults, scoring top marks for the multilingual dataset (Macro F1=0.7121) and\nGerman (Macro F1=0.7908). It ranked second for Arabic (Macro F1=0.4908) and\nBulgarian (Macro F1=0.7169), third for Italian (Macro F1=0.7430), and ninth for\nEnglish (Macro F1=0.6893).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"H4xczGrdMJBWHat9Y9IX47oNLQ8gKf0S2Q9kgRcxBBI","pdfSize":"690923","objectId":"0x3550b2f96e03fa491677ac77505fdc8d0efeb64ac67358c9a2205fa391a595a1","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
