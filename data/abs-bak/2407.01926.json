We employed a cost\nfunction based on signal constraints to iteratively update the neural network\non a single dataset. The method was validated using phantom experiments and in\nvivo scans. Results showed close alignment between measured and reference\ndouble bond values, with phantom experiments yielding a Pearson correlation\ncoefficient of 0.96 (p = .0005). In vivo results demonstrated good agreement in\nsubcutaneous fat. We conclude that Deep Image Prior shows feasibility for\nquantifying double bonds and fatty acid content from chemical-shift encoded\nmulti-echo MRI.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"iWkclr2Bwq3R0KKVp1uGCOy3zoGYVVZHJ2O6nbpK1LE","pdfSize":"1038101","objectId":"0xaac590bbe8504cc02f2668963f668ee717094aeb2fa7afa84e38e2f40852394b","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
