We first begin by arguing that just as in the classical case, a\nuniversal bound on the von Neumann entropy could have either an epistemic or\nontological origin. We then consider several possible ways of explaining the\nbound as a consequence of features of the entanglement entropy. We discuss\nconsider area laws in condensed matter and quantum field theory, arguing that\nthey suggest an epistemic reading of the bound. We also discuss the 'spacetime\nfrom entanglement' programme, arguing that entanglement alone may not be able\nto full ground spacetime topology, but it could potentially play a role in\ndetermining the spacetime metric, in which case it would potentially support a\nmore ontological reading of the bound.\n","subjects":["Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_Y-5lNTDbeOaFMPQfLe96wOlxrym_areG-Tc_eszvpo","pdfSize":"227819","objectId":"0x9dd2aa3e9505991111c863a4425d002a9b05959b064d98d882d03c9334d64b31","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
