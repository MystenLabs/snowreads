We start with some reminders from the theory of classical stochastic\nprocesses. We then provide a brief overview of quantum mechanics and quantum\nfield theory, from the viewpoint of quantum probability and adopting the\nlanguage of Hudson and Parthasarathy. We introduce quantum stochastic processes\non a boson Fock space and their calculus. Whenever possible, we make\nconnections with the relevant concepts in classical probability theory. As an\napplication of the theory, we introduce the theory of open quantum systems,\nwith emphasis on the physics and modeling aspects of these systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"G7XQCbpP9c69vXu4orZCfbWRpT3Ma9GxtCI3MeB5JVY","pdfSize":"754620"}
