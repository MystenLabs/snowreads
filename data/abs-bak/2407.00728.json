As a first step in this direction, we investigate the\nspin properties of ferromagnetically coupled triangulenes, triangular\nnanographenes with spin $S = 1$. Combining in-solution synthesis of rationally\ndesigned molecular precursors and on-surface synthesis, we achieve covalently\nbonded $S = 2$ triangulene dimers and $S = 3$ trimers on Au(111). Starting from\nthe triangulene dimer, we thoroughly characterize its low-energy magnetic\nexcitations using inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS). IETS\nreveals conductance steps identified as a quintet to triplet excitation, and a\nzero-bias peak stemming from higher-order spin-spin scattering of the 5-fold\ndegenerate ferromagnetic ground state. The Heisenberg picture captures the\nrelevant parameters of inter-triangulene ferromagnetic exchange, and its\nsuccessful extension to the larger $S = 3$ system confirms the model's\naccuracy. We expect that the addition of ferromagnetically coupled building\nblocks to the toolbox of magnetic nanographenes opens new opportunities to\ndesign carbon materials with complex magnetic ground states.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0vEH7g188tuEjC8viaF3cbfqfZhln3h3_ucrszElXpc","pdfSize":"4920871","objectId":"0x16c4a1b5c59587d70af0539e3e688f4ad70906ccc2aad32b7699aa15b4be6e8f","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
