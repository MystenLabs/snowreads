The application implements the\nwidely used Kane model, capable of reliable predictions of transport and\noptical properties for a large variety of topological and non-topological\nmaterials with a zincblende crystal structure. The application automates the\ntedious steps of simulating band structures. The user inputs the relevant\nphysical parameters on the command line, for example materials and dimensions\nof the device, magnetic field, and temperature. The program constructs the\nappropriate matrix Hamiltonian on a discretized lattice of spatial coordinates\nand diagonalizes it. The physical observables are extracted from the\neigenvalues and eigenvectors and saved as output. The program is highly\ncustomizable with a large set of configuration options and material parameters.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mPC9goJNam1NOe4mwkcYJn6kUENaNCTtwGj8E2T0r-k","pdfSize":"4803798","objectId":"0x61617e082b3014eeafddf6757cab9911abd6d55188e25c1347e3799338e53e69","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
