Existing kinetic energy density functionals are based on model\npotentials and require empirical parametrizations to fit the accurate values of\nthe kinetic energy of atoms. Moreover, the correct kinetic energy density which\nproduces proper atomic shell structure is still an unsolved problem. In this\nwork, we have developed an exact methodology which can be used to\nsystematically derive kinetic energy of an electronic system. We have also\nshown how the kinetic energy is dependent upon number of electrons $N$ and the\natomic charge $Z$ using a qualitatively similar model system. We have also\nconnected our methodology with other forms of Green's functions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"w-uvjtPyyQgQ2-N3OnczVr4PhynZhdt53mbwWlg8yjA","pdfSize":"841110","objectId":"0x5b354962f6455680e2a1b162e203d77d18d94472be4a0f081d2c62da5d131974","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
