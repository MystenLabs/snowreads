Nevertheless, the presence of coherence\nerrors, typically arising from miscalibration and inter-qubit crosstalk, is a\nsignificant challenge to the scalability of quantum computing. Such errors are\noften addressed using a refined Pauli twirling scheme called Randomized\nCompiling (RC) that converts the coherent errors into incoherent errors that\ncan then be mitigated by conventional QEM. Unfortunately for multi-qubit gates,\nRC is restricted to Clifford gates such as CNOT and CPHASE. However, it has\nbeen demonstrated experimentally that a direct implementation of multi-qubit\nnon-Clifford gates, i.e. without using multi-qubit Clifford gates, has reduced\nthe depth of the circuit by a factor of four and more. Recently, a framework\ncalled pseudo-twirling (PST) for treating coherent error in multi-qubit\nnon-Clifford gates has been introduced and experimentally demonstrated. We show\nanalytically that a higher order correction to the existing PST theory yields\nan over-rotation coherent error generated by the PST protocol itself. This PST\neffect has no analogue in RC. Although the small induced over-rotation can\namount to a significant coherent error in deep circuits, we explain why it does\nnot degrade the performance of the gate.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"K7q-ctS02uqo9aRw2aqnr33XZDfHSJ4dhcXREayTlWc","pdfSize":"897447"}
