This paper investigates the equalization of propeller modulation\neffects on RF signals, specifically targeting applications in navigation aids\nsuch as Instrument Landing Systems (ILS). By employing a continuous reference\ntone, the propeller-induced Doppler spread can be effectively captured and\nequalized, improving signal integrity and accuracy. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that the proposed equalization method significantly reduces DDM\ndeviation caused by propeller modulation, even under various propeller speeds.\nThe findings suggest that incorporating such equalization techniques can\nenhance the reliability and efficiency of drone-based RF inspections.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0-_d9b5iMjJmWMfGQsCDOFGE_GwUp3d5vr2S_AhKxwY","pdfSize":"493257","objectId":"0xf12d01d9c1a444c771974c12116cd5b73d825a8fd3e172b037a6f4ab9a73c50f","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
