Conventionally, the optimization of VQAs predominantly relies\non manually designed optimizers. However, learning to optimize (L2O)\ndemonstrates impressive performance by training small neural networks to\nreplace handcrafted optimizers. In our work, we propose L2O-$g^{\\dagger}$, a\n$\\textit{quantum-aware}$ learned optimizer that leverages the Fubini-Study\nmetric tensor ($g^{\\dagger}$) and long short-term memory networks. We\ntheoretically derive the update equation inspired by the lookahead optimizer\nand incorporate the quantum geometry of the optimization landscape in the\nlearned optimizer to balance fast convergence and generalization. Empirically,\nwe conduct comprehensive experiments across a range of VQA problems. Our\nresults demonstrate that L2O-$g^{\\dagger}$ not only outperforms the current\nSOTA hand-designed optimizer without any hyperparameter tuning but also shows\nstrong out-of-distribution generalization compared to previous L2O optimizers.\nWe achieve this by training L2O-$g^{\\dagger}$ on just a single generic PQC\ninstance. Our novel $\\textit{quantum-aware}$ learned optimizer,\nL2O-$g^{\\dagger}$, presents an advancement in addressing the challenges of\nVQAs, making it a valuable tool in the NISQ era.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"rvsXCRx1qOjKLhd4291n9cHcWJvb7il5O1U1vaRC4es","pdfSize":"32146883","objectId":"0xaa217123e276dad61e7f365bb233eb07f416aa1c14b9731ac1a2fec70dd823bd","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
