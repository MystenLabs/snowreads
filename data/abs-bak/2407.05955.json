A theoretical model is proposed to explain the observed\nbehaviour, including the observed range of variations of $Sk_w$. The model\nclarifies why $Sk_w$ cannot be predicted from down-gradient closure\napproximations routinely employed in meteorological and climate models whereby\n$Sk_w$ impacts cloud formation and dispersion processes. The model also offers\nan alternative and implementable approach.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SGzfX9hfZh8Zs-mes_4Dw5KoHWJSPQe-NUiLdnvHsRo","pdfSize":"478157"}
