This algorithm is built upon a recursive series of Bayesian\nposteriors using a method we call Greedy Bayes. Sampling of the Bayesian\nposterior for neuron weight vectors $w$ of dimension $d$ is challenging because\nof its multimodality. Our algorithm to tackle this problem is based on a\ncoupling of the posterior density for $w$ with an auxiliary random variable\n$\\xi$.\n  The resulting reverse conditional $w|\\xi$ of neuron weights given auxiliary\nrandom variable is shown to be log concave. In the construction of the\nposterior distributions we provide some freedom in the choice of the prior. In\nparticular, for Gaussian priors on $w$ with suitably small variance, the\nresulting marginal density of the auxiliary variable $\\xi$ is proven to be\nstrictly log concave for all dimensions $d$. For a uniform prior on the unit\n$\\ell_1$ ball, evidence is given that the density of $\\xi$ is again strictly\nlog concave for sufficiently large $d$.\n  The score of the marginal density of the auxiliary random variable $\\xi$ is\ndetermined by an expectation over $w|\\xi$ and thus can be computed by various\nrapidly mixing Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Moreover, the computation of\nthe score of $\\xi$ permits methods of sampling $\\xi$ by a stochastic diffusion\n(Langevin dynamics) with drift function built from this score. With such\ndynamics, information-theoretic methods pioneered by Bakry and Emery show that\naccurate sampling of $\\xi$ is obtained rapidly when its density is indeed\nstrictly log-concave. After which, one more draw from $w|\\xi$, produces neuron\nweights $w$ whose marginal distribution is from the desired posterior.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"e1spKVjCNHlryffNhV-5tK6wlYQJna1SauSbk_mZm9Y","pdfSize":"178937","objectId":"0xbc35a440db4fbbb00f3e795042a713f9bcd0f88e768b0a0459774e9f3dfd94a9","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
