Previous generations of satellites were capturing a\nlimited number of spectral bands, and a few expert-designed vegetation indices\nwere sufficient to harness their potential. New generations of multi- and\nhyperspectral satellites can however capture additional bands, but are not yet\nefficiently exploited. In this work, we propose an explainable-AI-based method\nto select and design suitable vegetation indices. We first train a deep neural\nnetwork using multispectral satellite data, then extract feature importance to\nidentify the most influential bands. We subsequently select suitable existing\nvegetation indices or modify them to incorporate the identified bands and\nretrain our model. We validate our approach on a crop classification task. Our\nresults indicate that models trained on individual indices achieve comparable\nresults to the baseline model trained on all bands, while the combination of\ntwo indices surpasses the baseline in certain cases.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uR16jJsw5m7q-GdYzodd6EyO04uOwIwy6uKqpHAxVr4","pdfSize":"391002","objectId":"0xcbc44fee1dc9b2ae2881ea5b5784698c0c0c4cdeb1e8c682753770291b99b3a0","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
