However, the reasoning ability of edge devices is constrained by\nthe classic machine learning model capacity. In this paper, we present a\nnon-invasive ambient sensing system that can detect multiple activities and\napply large language models (LLMs) to reason the activity sequences. This\nmethod effectively combines edge devices and LLMs to help elderly people in\ntheir daily activities, such as reminding them to take pills or handling\nemergencies like falls. The LLM-based edge device can also serve as an\ninterface to interact with elderly people, especially with memory issue,\nassisting them in their daily lives. By deploying such a system, we believe\nthat the smart sensing system can improve the quality of life for older people\nand provide more efficient protection\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5QlnvngJF-DG5wa0LgN-pbfltOMicn2ibmTRF1vmKSs","pdfSize":"1164615","objectId":"0xf4403411c0d1626cca6d2757d35ce35cddbbff683504b2c4da10c93c8b03a4e4","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
