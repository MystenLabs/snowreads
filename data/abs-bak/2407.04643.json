While reducing the thickness of two-dimensional (2D) materials to\na few layers significantly enhances {\\mu}0Hc2(0) with accompanied potential\nunconventional pairing mechanisms, further dimensional reduction to 1D\ncompounds rarely exceeds the expected Pauli limit. Here, we report the\ndiscovery of a 1D granular Ta-Te nanowire that becomes superconducting under\nhigh pressure, with a maximum critical temperature (Tc) of 5.1 K. Remarkably,\nthe {\\mu}0Hc2(0) reaches 16 T, which is twice the Pauli limit, setting a record\nof {\\mu}0Hc2 (0) in all the reported 1D superconductors. Our work demonstrates\nthat the Ta-Te nanowire not only is a potential candidate for applications in\nhigh magnetic fields, but also provides an ideal platform for further\ninvestigations of the mechanisms between nanowires and large {\\mu}0Hc2(0).\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"K-RgN_dVEKYYGuxPtR8mcjiFgUx8t2pUWJdCFpUXb2I","pdfSize":"1893143"}
