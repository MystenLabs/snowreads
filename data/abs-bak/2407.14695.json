R, on its side, remains a dominant language for\nstatistical analysis and visualization. However, certain libraries have become\noutdated, limiting their functionality and performance. Users can use Python's\nadvanced machine learning and AI capabilities alongside R's robust statistical\npackages by combining these two programming languages. This paper explores\nusing R's reticulate package to call Python from R, providing practical\nexamples and highlighting scenarios where this integration enhances\nproductivity and analytical capabilities. With a few hello-world code snippets,\nwe demonstrate how to run Python's scikit-learn, pytorch and OpenAI gym\nlibraries for building Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Reinforcement\nLearning projects easily.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"i2ATDHDRXC7ev5qjrm89LXyhfpe7joRzQsFyZRz1NJg","pdfSize":"278766","objectId":"0xa9ad8fada463b3af57c920bd71de9e8d0794507017b9156cbb9f849ca22691d4","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
