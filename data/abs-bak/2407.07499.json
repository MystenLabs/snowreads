The origin of\nthe escort distributions is ascribed to the fact that the effective statistical\ndescription of the underlying system is provided by the measured\nGromov-Hausdorff limit of a sequence of manifolds having a warped product\nmetric structure. We interpret the entropic parameter \\ q \\ appearing in escort\ndistributions as a \"dimension\" related to the fibration structure of the\nunderlying phase spaces.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nazNWF5CldiiutVXVgZxaTSASIHN52uFGBnRbz7tzDg","pdfSize":"115749","objectId":"0xb6ac9a3eeaadf9a61a862d674dbfb1e865c3be789ecfd11c9cb92b2b279a4f48","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
