Since\nsuch an actuator schedule is not unique, we look for a schedule that minimizes\nthe energy of sparse inputs. For this, we optimize the trace of the inverse of\nthe resulting controllability Gramian, which is an approximate measure of the\naverage energy of the inputs. We present a greedy algorithm along with its\ntheoretical guarantees. Finally, we empirically show that our greedy algorithm\nensures the controllability of the linear system with a small number of active\nactuators per time step without a significant average energy expenditure\ncompared to the fully actuated system.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hS5eoErn2-lIPeikNUh-v0C-CO3o8-pRw8ZqMaWkErQ","pdfSize":"424990","objectId":"0x2fc770ad3c907c22abd413e76a878bd708302e078834f2b843c97cf5c71c9505","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
