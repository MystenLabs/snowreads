Beside a review of the different algorithms proposed\nin the literature, we provide a comprehensive and pedagogical derivation of the\ntwo formalisms on which these techniques are based: the scattering approach and\nthe Green's function approach. We show that the scattering problem can be\nformulated as a system of linear equations and that different existing\nalgorithms for solving this scattering problem amount to different sequences of\nGaussian elimination. We explicitly prove the equivalence of the two\nformalisms. We discuss the stability and numerical complexity of the existing\nmethods.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2ICRY58OgVn4GL7QWzH40QOOgvXhP9QDZ3BVBrJEgZE","pdfSize":"3294199","objectId":"0xe44fb4412adb974e3331a7388af2a9987bfac74eab3ff85a5bca66610cfa3a66","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
