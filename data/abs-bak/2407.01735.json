We illustrate that our\nmethod works for heralded single-photon as well as weak attenuated sources. We\nalso study the influence of error from our equipment and show that\npost-selection renders robustness to our scheme against noise. We further\ndemonstrate that with a small extension, we can quantify the transmittance of\nthe imperfect absorber by using the process of weak value amplification (WVA)\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qwGnVxfE7SGMt2T7P6qRwWDjbJHo0Xa4FLh93Pw5EG4","pdfSize":"643121","objectId":"0xb131992cd561c2b8614bafe59a6553cd71a24671ca4848febe6524dc4df0b7bf","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
