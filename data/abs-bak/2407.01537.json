WaveShot is designed for the modern demands of film production,\nadvertising, documentaries, and visual arts, equipped with professional-grade\nwaterproof cameras and advanced technology to capture static and dynamic scenes\non waterways. We discuss the development and advantages of WaveShot,\nhighlighting its portability, ease of transport, and rapid deployment\ncapabilities. Experimental validation showcasing WaveShot's stability and\nhigh-quality video capture in various water conditions, and the integration of\nmonocular depth estimation algorithms to enhance the operator's spatial\nperception. The paper concludes by exploring WaveShot's real-world\napplications, its user-friendly remote operation, and future enhancements such\nas gimbal integration and advanced computer vision for optimized videography on\nwater surfaces.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"E-SRn3rDAXzr03ajlEodcvxK-MrtZh4w7eVp6UQ5OeM","pdfSize":"9377991","objectId":"0x5ba93e7167b431199715256507f0bbe532e1c6c13ffa8fd3b9c59cc2dc03d8cd","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
