Policy makers often introduce ad hoc quantity limits-limits on the\nconsumption or possession of a substance-something which current economic\nmodels of addiction have failed to address. This paper enriches Bernheim and\nRangel (2004)'s model of addiction driven by cue-triggered decisions by\nincorporating endogenous choice of how much of the addictive good to consume,\ninstead of just whether or not consumption happens. Stricter quality limits\nimprove welfare as long as they do not preclude the myopically optimal level of\nconsumption.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"v-BrPh-JJBqFDLaYJdL56k1ddCPkdeLZhYyVl8XSvvg","pdfSize":"482104","objectId":"0x3e9434e4d9c61543d0a65958e9904a5379049fc4d5744f05edff2e91cb36ba43","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
