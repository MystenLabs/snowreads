When the density satisfies some mild conditions, e.g., when it has\nconnected support, is continuous, and vanishes only at infinity, or when the\nconnected components of the density satisfy these conditions, our axiomatic\ndefinition results in Hartigan's definition of cluster tree.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gEeVpIbzrMV6EJIgM01wSoxCyvbMiRPT8TNfYYOaobc","pdfSize":"1856346"}
