Ganguly and the second author\nintroduced the notion of consistency to describe classes of actions that\nrespect deletion-contraction in a precise sense, and proved the consistency of\nrotor-routing torsors (and uniqueness thereof) for plane graphs.\n  In this work, we prove that the class of actions introduced by Backman,\nBaker, and the fourth author, is consistent for regular matroids. More\nprecisely, we prove the consistency of its generalization given by Backman,\nSantos and the fourth author, and independently by the first author. This\nextends the above existence assertion, as well as makes progress on the goal of\nclassifying all consistent actions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BwdfQwoz_T0axRJ0XqiNJk5ed9mqC5WN6M3mzeto-F8","pdfSize":"420708"}
