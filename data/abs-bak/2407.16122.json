This\ninfrared-safe scheme modifies the parton distribution evolution equations to\nincorporate the corrections from emergent hadron mass mechanisms and\nparton-parton recombination at low $Q^2$. The effective parton mass, generated\nby dynamical chiral symmetry breaking, slows the evolution of parton\ndistributions in the infrared region, causing the DGLAP evolution to freeze\nwhen $Q^2\\ll M_{\\rm q/g}$. Notably, this scheme renders the high-$Q^2$ parton\ndistributions insensitive to the choice of input hadronic scale. The\nparton-parton recombination effect is crucial in suppressing the rapid growth\nof parton distributions at small $x$, consistent with experimental data. When\napplied to three valence quark distributions derived from a quark model, our\nscheme yields parton distributions that agree well with deep-inelastic\nscattering data in both large-$x$ and small-$x$ regions, providing a unified\ndescription of nucleon structure across the entire $Q^2$ range.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"FVCO7-OUarcRHKSVU5g8ZKAnIS8eQW64hAY3YMHvhyQ","pdfSize":"569283","objectId":"0xbb6ad044c139c2be5059b8f43f34766db437534f79f4ba7042ecc8f0ded19887","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
