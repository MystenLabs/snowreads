The first law of stochastic thermodynamics is reformulated and the\nfluctuation theorems are proved on this level, with emphasis on maintaining\nfully general covariance and on the choice of observers.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OMJ0iODvz1oWULIyZZNReoYAciCoI9X_mK3UqO0sxhk","pdfSize":"574030","objectId":"0x203dc6295f4fc9faf79924bc6639aa2f767135efd5faa490a500f96ff2b5ffa3","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
