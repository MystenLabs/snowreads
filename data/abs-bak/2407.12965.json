The latest spectroscopic\ndata indicates that these galaxies contain an evolved stellar population,\nreflecting an early episode of high star-formation-rate. The appearance of\nbroad emission lines suggests that a central overmassive black hole also powers\nthese galaxies. I propose that LRD galaxies represent the low-spin tail of the\ngalaxy population. Low-spin galaxies host a more compact gaseous disk with an\nenhanced star formation rate relative to typical galaxies at the same redshift.\nThe compact disk feeds efficiently a central black hole, as predicted by\nEisenstein & Loeb (1995).\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cwlC9rWQoyB34Q8CXPputNs1KaidsDPeTBK0DHz8Ki8","pdfSize":"82881","objectId":"0x04c041697acd0bfd84f0f074b7d15fe6dc36e393c9b1b18ccf916ea43e885924","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
