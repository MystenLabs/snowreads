Traditional vortex extraction methods,\nnotably region-based techniques, often overlook the entanglement phenomenon,\nresulting in the inclusion of multiple vortices within a single extracted\nregion. Their separation is necessary for quantifying different types of\nvortices and their statistics. In this study, we propose a novel vortex\nseparation method that extends the conventional contour tree-based segmentation\napproach with an additional step termed \"layering\". Upon extracting a vortical\nregion using specified vortex criteria (e.g., $\\lambda_2$), we initially\nestablish topological segmentation based on the contour tree, followed by the\nlayering process to allocate appropriate segmentation IDs to unsegmented cells,\nthus separating individual vortices within the region. However, these regions\nmay still suffer from inaccurate splits, which we address statistically by\nleveraging the continuity of vorticity lines across the split boundaries. Our\nfindings demonstrate a significant improvement in both the separation of\nvortices and the mitigation of inaccurate splits compared to prior methods.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"QvGmMKLi6yADYTJHfHyKRSrERohzgdbQdQLMoCIWobA","pdfSize":"6422771"}
