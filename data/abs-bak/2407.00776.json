The appropriate\nclassical limit of the model allows us to obtain a phase diagram identifying\ndifferent dynamical phases, especially the onset of chaos. Both classically and\nquantum mechanically, we demonstrate the emergence of a steady state in the\nchaotic regime and analyze its properties. The interplay between quantum\nfluctuation and chaos leads to enhanced mixing dynamics and dephasing,\nresulting in the formation of an incoherent photonic fluid. The steady state\nexhibits an intriguing phenomenon of subsystem thermalization even outside the\nchaotic regime; however, its effective temperature increases with the degree of\nchaos. Moreover, the statistical properties of the steady state show a close\nconnection with the random matrix theory. Finally, we discuss the experimental\nrelevance of our findings, which can be tested in cavity and circuit quantum\nelectrodynamics setups.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"86OQ4lPnHyakVOwh_cnjsvpCn6QRmWLQYhsEKctCvXs","pdfSize":"4223739","objectId":"0xada8a709bce3ec26b356baa0fbadb4e4da7801ff3eb20e07db340e43bc3f25b5","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
