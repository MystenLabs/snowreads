We employ ValueScope to dissect\nand analyze linguistic and stylistic expressions across 13 Reddit communities\ncategorized under gender, politics, science, and finance. Our analysis provides\na quantitative foundation showing that even closely related communities exhibit\nremarkably diverse norms. This diversity supports existing theories and adds a\nnew dimension--community preference--to understanding community interactions.\nValueScope not only delineates differing social norms among communities but\nalso effectively traces their evolution and the influence of significant\nexternal events like the U.S. presidential elections and the emergence of new\nsub-communities. The framework thus highlights the pivotal role of social norms\nin shaping online interactions, presenting a substantial advance in both the\ntheory and application of social norm studies in digital spaces.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uHqEatKNKIRz1r95jMFQJVaUbdcMuculK3564dlq5DM","pdfSize":"6385807","objectId":"0x1df304ca2cd2725cbb8e4841521af883932a054f70a2f712396cf8161890b444","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
