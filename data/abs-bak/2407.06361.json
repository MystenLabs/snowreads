Our characterization is based on\ndistinguished invariant foliations, similar to those studied by\nGuichard-Wienhard in $\\text{PSL}_4(\\mathbb{R})$.\n  We connect to the dynamics of Hitchin representations by constructing\nrefraction flows for all positive roots in general\n$\\mathfrak{sl}_n(\\mathbb{R})$ in our setting. For $n = 3$, leaves of our\none-dimensional foliations are flow-lines. One consequence is that the highest\nroot flows are $C^{1+\\alpha}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TP-0WknYBLI5EYHncw8wJpgJ9AyHcGAqyGh4udFcLbQ","pdfSize":"1012473"}
