Such smooth changes are parametrized by a H\\\"{o}lder exponent $\\beta$\nand coefficient $\\lambda$. While various sub-cases of this general model have\nbeen studied in isolation, we first establish the minimax dynamic regret rate\ngenerally for all $K,\\beta,\\lambda$. Next, we show this optimal dynamic regret\ncan be attained adaptively, without knowledge of $\\beta,\\lambda$. To contrast,\neven with parameter knowledge, upper bounds were only previously known for\nlimited regimes $\\beta\\leq 1$ and $\\beta=2$ (Slivkins, 2014; Krishnamurthy and\nGopalan, 2021; Manegueu et al., 2021; Jia et al.,2023). Thus, our work resolves\nopen questions raised by these disparate threads of the literature.\n  We also study the problem of attaining faster gap-dependent regret rates in\nnon-stationary bandits. While such rates are long known to be impossible in\ngeneral (Garivier and Moulines, 2011), we show that environments admitting a\nsafe arm (Suk and Kpotufe, 2022) allow for much faster rates than the\nworst-case scaling with $\\sqrt{T}$. While previous works in this direction\nfocused on attaining the usual logarithmic regret bounds, as summed over\nstationary periods, our new gap-dependent rates reveal new optimistic regimes\nof non-stationarity where even the logarithmic bounds are pessimistic. We show\nour new gap-dependent rate is tight and that its achievability (i.e., as made\npossible by a safe arm) has a surprisingly simple and clean characterization\nwithin the smooth H\\\"{o}lder class model.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YMBshD33HhA9VRoBd8GUfbtLw1rbwK3DzcvJWtyw_Lw","pdfSize":"488652","objectId":"0x4fedd5634d7830f208429baec6cfc2f19c58383e23b37f3988ac0535ce2c4455","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
