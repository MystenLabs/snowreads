On flat space background it\ncan be represented as a sum of two tensor differential operators acting on\nscalar structure functions. On a general background these tensor differential\noperators can be constructed from the linearized Ricci scalar and the\nlinearized Weyl tensor. However, in cosmology one requires a third contribution\nwhich we derive here.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CqaiJlfrgch_K1CXQSacp6UyAxl-jhbwgl42W1KaPEM","pdfSize":"173883","objectId":"0xa3634e42238cc0521462f9bf04dac10af515a134a7111849bec691174af927f5","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
