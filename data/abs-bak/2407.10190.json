Kripke frames. It is\nknown to be complete w.r.t. topological semantics, where the diamond modalities\ncorrespond to topological derivative operations. However, the topologies needed\nfor the completeness proof are highly non-constructive. The question of\ncompleteness of GLP w.r.t. natural scattered topologies on ordinals is\ndependent on large cardinal axioms of set theory and is still open. So far, we\nare lacking a useable class of models for which GLP is complete.\n  In this paper we define a natural class of countable general topological\nframes on ordinals for which GLP is sound and complete. The associated\ntopologies are the same as the ordinal topologies introduced by Thomas Icard.\nHowever, the key point is to specify a suitable algebra of subsets of an\nordinal closed under the boolean and topological derivative operations. The\nalgebras we define are based on the notion of a periodic set of ordinals\ngeneralizing that of an ultimately periodic binary omega-word.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3GPAS4J4WIHuB0SvfrXW9UM3kc2zCY0tpA_rCn8txrQ","pdfSize":"298295","objectId":"0xbd9b517a8602c01bbc42c9e271b0a9ee7a258a3d7055b8b10721ce0fbb4b4065","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
