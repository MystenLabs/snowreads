Employing the Krori-Barua metric ansatz (K.D.\nKrori, J. Barua, J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 8 (1975) 508) along with a linear form\nof $f(Q)$ model, {\\it viz.}, $f(Q)=\\alpha_{0}+\\alpha_{1}Q$, we obtain a\ntractable set of exact relativistic solutions of the field equations. A\nspecific form of charge $(q=q_{0}r^{3})$ is considered here for the present\nanalysis. Using the data sets of $\\rho$ and $p_{r}$ along with the method of\ncurve fitting, we have obtained the best fit equation of state in the model,\nwhich is incorporated in the numerical solutions of the TOV equations to\ndetermine the maximum mass and radius in this scenario. With increasing charge\nintensity $(q_{0})$ from 0.0002 to 0.0006, the maximum mass ranges from\n$2.838-2.869~M_{\\odot}$, and the corresponding radii range from\n$12.0039-12.0822~Km$. Moreover, the predicted radii of some recently observed\npulsars and GW 190814 show that our model also complies with the estimated\nradii based on the observational results. Our model is found to satisfy all the\ncharacteristic features, such as behaviour of matter variables, causality\ncondition, energy constraints and stability criteria, which are pertinent in\nthe context of a stable stellar configuration to emerge as a viable and\nphysically acceptable stellar model in the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"BMijxagXQNoDgcEQI_yRfG1AMkf0LyB3-09I4T0LGRI","pdfSize":"1269488","objectId":"0x2b6f92095f75a148e273e7450f940e73eb06faadb0f231d455857c078f544552","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
