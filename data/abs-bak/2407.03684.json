Despite algorithmic\nprogress, challenges related to appearance change persist, with existing\ndatasets often focusing on seasonal and weather variations but overlooking\nterrain changes. Understanding terrain alterations becomes critical for\neffective place recognition, given the aging infrastructure and ongoing city\nrepairs. For real-world applicability, the comprehensive evaluation of\nalgorithms must consider spatial dynamics. To address existing limitations, we\npresent a novel multi-session place recognition dataset acquired from an active\nconstruction site. Our dataset captures ongoing construction progress through\nmultiple data collections, facilitating evaluation in dynamic environments. It\nincludes camera images, LiDAR point cloud data, and IMU data, enabling visual\nand LiDAR-based place recognition techniques, and supporting sensor fusion.\nAdditionally, we provide ground truth information for range-based place\nrecognition evaluation. Our dataset aims to advance place recognition\nalgorithms in challenging and dynamic settings.
