One possibility is the\nformation of sulfur chains, which would be difficult to detect by spectroscopic\ntechniques. This work explores the formation of sulfur chains experimentally,\nboth in pure H$_2$S ice samples and in H$_2$O:H$_2$S ice mixtures. An\nultra-high vacuum chamber, ISAC, eqquipped with FTIR and QMS, was used for the\nexperiments. Our results show that the formation of H$_2$S$_x$ species is\nefficient, not only in pure H$_2$S ice samples, but also in water-rich ice\nsamples. Large sulfur chains are formed more efficiently at low temperatures\n($\\approx$10 K), while high temperatures ($\\approx$50 K) favour the formation\nof short sulfur chains. Mass spectra of H$_2$S$_x$, x~=~2-6, species are\npresented for the first time. Their analysis suggests that H$_2$S$_x$ species\nare favoured in comparison with S$_x$ chains. Nevertheless, the detection of\nseveral S$_x^+$ fragments at high temperatures in H$_2$S:H$_2$O ice mixtures\nsuggests the presence of S$_8$ in the irradiated ice samples, which could\nsublimate from 260~K. ROSINA instrument data from the cometary Rosetta mission\ndetected mass-to-charge ratios 96 and 128. Comparing these detections with our\nexperiments, we propose two alternatives: 1) H$_2$S$_4$ and H$_2$S$_5$ to be\nresponsible of those S$_3^+$ and S$_4^+$ cations, respectively, or 2) S$_8$\nspecies, sublimating and being fragmented in the mass spectrometer. If S$_8$ is\nthe parent molecule, then S$_5^+$ and S$_6^+$ cations could be also detected in\nfuture missions by broadening the mass spectrometer range.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1CniDLkJ2r9j6UkqDnRIJx_CYBm7R_iKExNCkRJfJew","pdfSize":"888837","objectId":"0x7a7e1a2226215ab91e2611480fff74a7de74db05d2251a5a27a62b13ff15e415","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
