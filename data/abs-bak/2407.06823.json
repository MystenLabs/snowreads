In this work, we present a novel method for\nautomatic cue point estimation, interpreted as a computer vision object\ndetection task. Our proposed system is based on a pre-trained object detection\ntransformer which we fine-tune on our novel cue point dataset. Our provided\ndataset contains 21k manually annotated cue points from human experts as well\nas metronome information for nearly 5k individual tracks, making this dataset\n35x larger than the previously available cue point dataset. Unlike previous\nmethods, our approach does not require low-level musical information analysis,\nwhile demonstrating increased precision in retrieving cue point positions.\nMoreover, our proposed method demonstrates high adherence to phrasing, a type\nof high-level music structure commonly emphasized in electronic dance music.\nThe code, model checkpoints, and dataset are made publicly available.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"InD1CMwldjBaH5xrrqEmJc66RUuT7evjIJPBndDEeLo","pdfSize":"1694504"}
