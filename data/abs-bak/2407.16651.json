In this work, we report dust and gas\nobservational hints of planet formation in the disk around\n2MASS-J16120668-301027, as part of the ALMA Large Program \"AGE-PRO: ALMA survey\nof Gas Evolution in Protoplanetary disks\". The disk was imaged with the Atacama\nLarge Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at Band 6 (1.3 mm) in dust\ncontinuum emission and four molecular lines: $^{12}$CO(J=2-1),\n$^{13}$CO(J=2-1), C$^{18}$O(J=2-1), and H$_2$CO(J=3$_{(3,0)}$-2$_{(2,0)}$).\nResolved observations of the dust continuum emission (angular resolution of\n$\\sim 150$ mas, 20 au) show a ring-like structure with a peak at $0.57 ^{\\prime\n\\prime}$ (75 au), a deep gap with a minimum at 0.24$^{\\prime \\prime}$ (31 au),\nan inner disk, a bridge connecting the inner disk and the outer ring, along\nwith a spiral arm structure, and a tentative detection (to $3\\sigma$) of a\ncompact emission at the center of the disk gap, with an estimated dust mass of\n$\\sim 2.7-12.9$ Lunar masses. We also detected a kinematic kink (not coincident\nwith any dust substructure) through several $^{12}$CO channel maps (angular\nresolution $\\sim$ 200 mas, 30 au), located at a radius of $\\sim 0.875^{\\prime\n\\prime}$ (115.6 au). After modeling the $^{12}$CO velocity rotation around the\nprotostar, we identified a tentative rotating-like structure at the kink\nlocation with a geometry similar to that of the disk. We discuss potential\nexplanations for the dust and gas substructures observed in the disk, and their\npotential connection to signatures of planet formation.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0TIB1EnCxxktQFvtK18tjSuI-jO0DlPMAO9YWYDI3_I","pdfSize":"6150704","objectId":"0xfe17359c462f2990c12b7540ed7ad003975506adb8f9c89bba8b4dc0148b07bf","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
