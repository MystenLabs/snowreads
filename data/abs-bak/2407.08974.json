To explore powerful anticancer peptides, artificial intelligence\n(AI)-based approaches have been developed to systematically screen potential\ncandidates. However, the lack of efficient featurization of peptides has become\na bottleneck for these machine-learning models. In this paper, we propose a\ntopology-enhanced machine learning model (Top-ML) for anticancer peptide\nprediction. Our Top-ML employs peptide topological features derived from its\nsequence \"connection\" information characterized by vector and spectral\ndescriptors. Our Top-ML model has been validated on two widely used AntiCP 2.0\nbenchmark datasets and has achieved state-of-the-art performance. Our results\nhighlight the potential of leveraging novel topology-based featurization to\naccelerate the identification of anticancer peptides.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/General Topology","Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ncar6hHL5yLWuquselyvP8_p7hnekQeECSwXuouR2T0","pdfSize":"2971213","objectId":"0x392f51f7fb4da3efb50e54072be8684d9ca17be52c6928144e953282456ea96d","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
