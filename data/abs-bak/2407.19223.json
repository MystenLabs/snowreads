This sum is a generalization of Watson's trigonometric sum, which has\nbeen extensively studied in a series of previous papers, and also may be\nregarded as the so-called Dowker sum of order one half. It occurs in various\nproblems in mathematics, physics and engineering, and plays an important role\nin some number-theoretic problems. In the paper, we obtain several integral and\nseries representations for the above-mentioned sum, investigate its properties,\nderive various, including asymptotic, expansions for it, and deduce very\naccurate upper and lower bounds for it (both bounds are asymptotically\nvanishing). In addition, we obtain two relatively simple approximate formulae\ncontaining only several terms, which are also very accurate and can be\nparticularly appreciated in applications. Finally, we also derive several\nadvanced summation formulae for the digamma functions, which relate the gamma\nand the digamma functions, the investigated sum, as well as the product of a\nsequence of cosecants $\\prod\\big(\\csc(\\pi l/n)\\big)^{\\csc(\\pi l/n)}$\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qxx6QoCQDPOIZcqsaoeVQKN5K5fgj2yM9_RjIJ98qSE","pdfSize":"568844","objectId":"0x45ae63738fda97584c5eb7779a742fe04c22542c8ccde958e3eda2fe60c77aee","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
