As a first attempt, we employ our previously\ndeveloped quantum electrodynamics model, which incorporates a wave-packet\ndescription of initial nuclei, to compute the cross section for\nproton-antiproton pair photoproduction. The effective vertex for the photon and\nproton interaction is chosen based on studies of two-photon exchange effects in\nhadron physics. We present the transverse momentum, invariant mass, and\nazimuthal angle distributions of proton-antiproton pairs at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$\nGeV in Au+Au ultraperipheral collisions. We observe a $\\cos(2\\phi)$ modulation\nand an almost negligible $\\cos(4\\phi)$ modulation in the azimuthal angle\ndistribution. Our studies helps us better understand the matter generated by\nlight.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"upr4Er1fJtd_J8lXCi3411qOuuX-WWDUD0HYCQgbXTo","pdfSize":"806607"}
