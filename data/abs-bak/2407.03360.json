Measurements conducted within a few days after sample\nsynthesis reveal previously undiscovered phenomena in structurally lubric\nsystems: rejuvenation, a drop in kinetic friction of an order of magnitude\nshortly after the onset of sliding; aging, a significant increase in kinetic\nfriction forces after a rest period of 30 minutes or more; switches,\nspontaneous jumps between distinct friction branches. These three effects are\ndrastically suppressed a few weeks later. Imaging of a contamination layer and\nsimulations provide a consistent picture of how single- and double-layer\ncontamination underneath the gold nanoislands as well as contamination\nsurrounding the nanoislands affect structural lubricity but not lead to its\nbreakdown.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bt2XbvE3y6kxMFvyOWhQSSFOKHo-Nz6muhngmAnHnKU","pdfSize":"1101429"}
