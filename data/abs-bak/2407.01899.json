While\nseq2seq models hold the state of the art on DRT parsing, their accuracy\ndegrades with the complexity of the sentence, and they sometimes struggle to\nproduce well-formed DRT representations. We introduce the AMS parser, a\ncompositional, neurosymbolic semantic parser for DRT. It rests on a novel\nmechanism for predicting quantifier scope. We show that the AMS parser reliably\nproduces well-formed outputs and performs well on DRT parsing, especially on\ncomplex sentences.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Et-6CkR6wnB0ACBnTNMITRk2iqh7cCM9sCQTPD7-4lM","pdfSize":"1536865","objectId":"0x9d92618f30386f8eb058a46b120100ad143fdb06977608102ccb7808266223d5","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
