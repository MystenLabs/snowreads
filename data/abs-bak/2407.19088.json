It explores how AI\ncan be ethically integrated into classrooms to enhance learning experiences,\nfoster intrinsic motivation, and support voluntary behavior change among\nstudents. By analyzing established ethical frameworks and educational theories\nsuch as deontological ethics, consequentialism, constructivist learning, and\nSelf-Determination Theory (SDT), the paper argues that GAI, when used\nresponsibly, can enhance digital literacy, encourage genuine knowledge\nconstruction, and uphold ethical standards in education. This research\nhighlights the potential of GAI to create enriching, personalized learning\nenvironments that prepare students to navigate the complexities of the modern\nworld ethically and effectively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"hbish7Y7LdulAjM2zqmcVJc_xCgS-dYN_fcbcOp31UM","pdfSize":"195102","objectId":"0xfdba819abad8cc0899cc3b308a1ca37a3b4a15278a9cc590d0f6715726db90d8","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
