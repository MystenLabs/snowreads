Augmented integrated photonic architectures that leverage phase-change\nand III-V materials for optical computing will be presented. A CMOS-compatible\nplatform will be discussed that integrates these materials to fabricate\nphotonic neuromorphic architectures, along with a gem5-based simulation\nplatform to model accelerator operation once it is interfaced with a RISC-V\nprocessor. This simulation platform enables accurate system-level accelerator\nmodeling and benchmarking in terms of key metrics such as speed, energy\nconsumption, and footprint.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IWX9xXsKDC0DNlHBbo4SbvVx2OU1TsvNg8jmZ4vjlZk","pdfSize":"832840"}
