Our framework encompasses a large class of stochastic linear\nVolterra and delay equations and in particular the fractional Brownian motion\nwith a Hurst index $H \\in (0, 1)$. Our expressions allow to disentangle an\ninfinite dimensional Markovian structure and open the door to straightforward\nand simple approximation schemes, that we illustrate numerically.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SO2k8khXXW96fqEoLlpynDFckGEgzgXxijHfiL-k83c","pdfSize":"2183063"}
