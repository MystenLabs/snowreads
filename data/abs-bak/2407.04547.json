However,\nprevalent audio-driven synthesis methods predominantly rely on pitch and\nloudness envelopes, effectively flattening timbral expression from the input.\nOur approach draws on the concept of timbre analogies and investigates how\ntimbral expression from an input signal can be mapped onto controls for a\nsynthesizer. Leveraging differentiable digital signal processing, our method\nfacilitates direct optimization of synthesizer parameters through a novel\nfeature difference loss. This loss function, designed to learn relative timbral\ndifferences between musical events, prioritizes the subtleties of graded timbre\nmodulations within phrases, allowing for meaningful translations in a timbre\nspace. Using snare drum performances as a case study, where timbral expression\nis central, we demonstrate real-time timbre remapping from acoustic snare drums\nto a differentiable synthesizer modeled after the Roland TR-808.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fo4hcUaWYMMBwiTJnXqHKi2T3youNRyoDxKsVivmvDI","pdfSize":"503516"}
