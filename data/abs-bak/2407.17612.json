Also, we define and investigate the\nconcepts of ideal quotient and annihilator of any subfamily of $2^X$, where\n$2^X$ is the power set of $X.$ We obtain some of their fundamental properties.\nIn addition, several relationships among the above notions have been discussed.\nMoreover, we get a new topology, called sharp topology via the sharp operator\ndefined in the scope of this study, finer than the old one. Furthermore, a\ndecomposition of the notion of open set has been obtained. Finally, we conclude\nour work with some interesting applications.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yeBgVoY3kSWEiFklu6fUQl4W-MzUM-5Ofn1OzsXWUwM","pdfSize":"193596","objectId":"0xc73ff61f291447f5801a4583f5998d8fe0f66911315c63e1c633ce53746af237","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
