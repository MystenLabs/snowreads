However, perovskite solar cells display\nsignificant kinetic phenomena that modify the performance at several time\nscales, due to hysteresis, internal capacitances, and related mechanisms. Here,\nwe develop a method to analyze the current-voltage curves by using large\namplitude sinusoids as the excitation waveforms, specifically addressed to\ndetermine the influence of cycling frequency on the performance parameters. We\nsolve a system of equations representative of charge collection and\nrecombination, that provide the frequency-dependent dynamical behavior of the\ninternal ion-controlled surface recombination processes that cause open-circuit\nvoltage variations often observed in high performance devices. We analyze\nseveral reported experimental data, and we feature the key parameters governing\nthe evolution of hysteresis phenomena as the scan speed is increased in\nrelation to Impedance Spectroscopy.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Mg8xENQlvMRAiipS5k9EKKELwLeJ1t0oZcJp8BRbYU0","pdfSize":"2076504","objectId":"0xeb0810a966dc70b869d08923ee6d77349b9f9cb7214d84f43964c5fc59a68415","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
