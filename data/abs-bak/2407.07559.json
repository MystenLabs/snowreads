The new proposal is based on the empirical version of\nthe opening operator from mathematical morphology combined with a preliminary\nestimator of density function. This results in an estimator that is\neasy-to-compute since it simply consists of a list of carefully selected\ncenters and a radius. The new estimator is shown to be consistent, and its\nconvergence rate in terms of the Hausdorff distance are provided. All\nconsistency results are established uniformly on the level of the set and for\nany Riemannian manifold M satisfying mild assumptions. The applicability of the\nprocedure is shown by means of some illustrative examples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yrXwKPGqPD0al3EzRFy52gwZdrGeoG7L44LKv6YNhto","pdfSize":"8199920","objectId":"0x9a6ca6bd1b468e280de49c2f1a18c600e00dc157205d8e8268420a34885ba782","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
