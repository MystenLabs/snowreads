The theory\nwe consider is the extended scalar-tensor-Gauss-Bonnet theory, which admits\nRicci-flat Taub-NUT black hole as a solution. An analysis of probe scalar field\nis carried out to identify the mass parameter and NUT parameter (m,n) where the\nhairy black holes start to emerge. Then, we use shooting method to construct\nthe scalarized Taub-NUT black hole numerically. Being different from the\nSchwarzschild case, there exists two branches of new hairy black holes which\nare smoothly connected to each other. We calculate the entropy of scalarized\nblack holes and compare it with the entropy of scalar-free Taub-NUT black\nholes, it turns out that the entropy of the new hairy black holes are larger\nthan that of scalar-free black holes. A novel phenomena emerges in this system\nthat the entropy of the black holes at the bifurcation point is constant for\npositive mass parameter. We then conjecture a maximal entropy bound for all the\nscalarized black hole whose mass parameter at the bifurcation point is greater\nthan zero.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ylkXt_yHZCJcB10X0eu98IIqiM6GtJc6_iT1FaQ1FPY","pdfSize":"777871","objectId":"0x7b29aada0040bee6277ced0aa07e3c376429a4c4fda6cd7b397446f3ce7d5fad","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
