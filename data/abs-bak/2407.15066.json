Despite these improvements, controllable image generation\nremains a challenge. Current methods, such as training, forward guidance, and\nbackward guidance, have notable limitations. The first two approaches either\ndemand substantial computational resources or produce subpar results. The third\napproach depends on phenomena specific to certain model architectures,\ncomplicating its application to large-scale image generation.To address these\nissues, we propose a novel controllable generation framework that offers a\ngeneralized interpretation of backward guidance without relying on specific\nassumptions. Leveraging this framework, we introduce LSReGen, a large-scale\nlayout-to-image method designed to generate high-quality, layout-compliant\nimages. Experimental results show that LSReGen outperforms existing methods in\nthe large-scale layout-to-image task, underscoring the effectiveness of our\nproposed framework. Our code and models will be open-sourced.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"R8gSa-hN0KFXo-7oMFOOQcIS2Ojmn5VmaBzn-_vRZ2w","pdfSize":"43070677","objectId":"0x9e97be4e66967093aa9a85582169a3f96260a0c81c152543fe4332fb5a432d26","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
