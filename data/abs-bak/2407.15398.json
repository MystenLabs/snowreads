BOCDR\nachieves spatial resolution through frequency modulation of the laser output,\nand this modulation frequency determines the measurement position,\nnecessitating accurate association of modulation frequencies with positions on\nthe FUT. However, a practical method to precisely correlate modulation\nfrequency values with FUT positions has not yet been proposed. This study\nintroduces a method leveraging the change in Rayleigh noise spectrum with\nmodulation frequency to accurately associate these frequencies with positions\non the FUT. The effectiveness of this method is proved through distributed\nstrain measurement.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"6LichmIQJt5NZ63vUPGuCAEnpIeHQEBTb5Qlubnvs0A","pdfSize":"999943","objectId":"0xcfe4ca8d9af206b323ea599757986f3eb55b5b0cf30b46dac7054d3a8b23a784","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
