Yet, as far as the author is\naware, there is no direct proof of this in the literature. This work shows that\nthe $sign$ of the $N$-fermion anti-symmetric free propagator is given by the\nproduct of all possible pairs of particle separations, or relative\ndisplacements. For a non-vanishing closed-loop product of such propagators, as\nrequired by PIMC, all relative displacements from adjacent propagators are\npaired into perfect squares, and therefore the loop product must be positive,\nbut only in one dimension. By comparison, permutation sampling, which does not\nevaluate the determinant of the anti-symmetric propagator exactly, remains\nplagued by a low-level sign problem, even in one dimension.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"W02NCn8S5h0a9n8QJ1mA85ZqJXKPvkF7osk09KvrGDE","pdfSize":"123588","objectId":"0x3f4a18dcd71434e4a147e3e96495befff4b8bbd330277eeb9b7a1481e55acfa9","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
