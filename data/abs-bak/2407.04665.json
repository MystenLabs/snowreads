The\nprimary objective of this paper is to study the topological properties of these\nlower spaces, encompassing lower separation axioms and compactness. We\ncharacterize lower spaces that exhibit sobriety. Introducing the concept of\nstrongly disconnected spaces, we establish a correlation between strongly\ndisconnected lower spaces and the presence of nontrivial idempotent elements in\nthe corresponding multiplicative lattices. Additionally, we provide a\nsufficient condition for a lower space to be connected. We prove that the lower\nspace of proper elements is a spectral space, and we further explore continuous\nmaps between lower spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sFYXO_-Uie-9gkOjWPCBX3kpvuG1nNqD0pfs6Gv9N3s","pdfSize":"139773"}
