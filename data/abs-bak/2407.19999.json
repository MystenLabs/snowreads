But\nwhat if those Ext-modules do not vanish? We study the annihilators of these\nExt-modules and formulate a generalisation of the Auslander-Reiten Conjecture.\nWe prove this general version for high syzygies of modules over several classes\nof rings including analytically unramified Arf rings, 2-dimensional local\nnormal domains with rational singularities, Gorenstein isolated singularities\nof Krull dimension at least 2 and more. We also prove results for the special\ncase of the canonical module of a Cohen-Macaulay local ring. These results both\ngeneralise and also provide evidence for a version of Tachikawa Conjecture that\nwas considered by Dao-Kobayashi-Takahashi.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AoBLRDgoKybm0-dk7oa5W0bTDsAaw3Gjskxqt0fC5lk","pdfSize":"267651","objectId":"0x381df9e9c966929d5090ac92e1a770a157bfa19ee411ae0e030fe86796719ec5","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
