Multiple formulations have been\nproposed to construct the graph, which share several intrinsic drawbacks: (1)\nThe internal structures of spans are neglected, thus only the boundary tokens\nof spans are used for relation prediction and span recognition, thus hindering\nthe model's expressiveness; (2) Long spans occupy a significant proportion in\nthe SSA datasets, which further exacerbates the problem of internal structure\nneglect. In this paper, we treat the SSA task as a dependency parsing task on\npartially-observed dependency trees, regarding flat spans without determined\ntree annotations as latent subtrees to consider internal structures of spans.\nWe propose a two-stage parsing method and leverage TreeCRFs with a novel\nconstrained inside algorithm to model latent structures explicitly, which also\ntakes advantages of joint scoring graph arcs and headed spans for global\noptimization and inference. Results of extensive experiments on five benchmark\ndatasets reveal that our method performs significantly better than all previous\nbi-lexical methods, achieving new state-of-the-art.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2l40ROCbmXWHvEZ7at7caz-3Y4Cbg5uSTUeop0o5qHA","pdfSize":"553743"}
