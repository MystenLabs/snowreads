In particular, we give sufficient conditions for\nexistence of a distinguished natural measure $\\nu$ such that the pushforwards\nof any absolutely continuous probability measure converge to $\\nu$. Moreover,\nwe obtain a distributional limit law for empirical measures. We also extend\nexisting results on the characterisation of the set of almost sure limit points\nfor empirical measures. Our results apply to various intermittent maps with\nmultiple neutral fixed points preserving an infinite $\\sigma$-finite absolutely\ncontinuous measure.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2gjInJT0SucEh4AghACplEBxCpq2qGxIrigd3I1HMfU","pdfSize":"384287"}
