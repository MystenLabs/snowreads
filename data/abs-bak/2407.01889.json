This is the first detection of spatially\nresolved CO emission from the host galaxy of an FRB at a cosmological distance.\nThe inferred molecular gas mass of the host galaxy is $(2.3\\pm0.4)\\times10^{10}\n\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$, indicating that it is gas-rich, as evidenced by the measured\nmolecular gas fraction $\\mu_\\mathrm{gas}=0.50\\pm0.22$. This molecular-gas mass\nand the star formation rate of the host, $\\mathrm{SFR}=8.06\\pm2.42\n\\mathrm{M_\\odot yr^{-1}}$, differ from those observed in the other FRB host\ngalaxies with the average $M_\\mathrm{gas}=9.6\\times10^8 \\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ and\n$\\mathrm{SFR}=0.90 \\mathrm{M_\\odot yr^{-1}}$. This lends further credibility to\nthe hypothesis that FRBs may originate from single or multiple progenitors\nacross a diverse range of galaxy environments. Based on the observed velocity\nfield modeling, we find that the molecular gas disk is dominated by an ordered\ncircular rotation, despite the fact that the host galaxy has a gas-rich\ncompanion galaxy with a projected separation of $\\sim 25 \\mathrm{kpc}$. The\nformation of the FRB's progenitor might not have been triggered by this\ninteraction. We derive the 3$\\sigma$ upper limit of the molecular gas column\ndensity at the FRB detection site to be $< 2.1\\times 10^{21} \\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$\nwith a 3$\\sigma$ upper limit.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DoAUB4IIEXCRUQOzIw6PXQV8SeNP-Uz_wTJL1Twe0lU","pdfSize":"1705960","objectId":"0x64532caf066ed602b4c97ef57900f25499ddb879d272c61c6fde673b8f12007a","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
