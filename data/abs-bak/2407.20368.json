Here, we address this long-standing issue by\ndevising a protocol for creating and manipulating highly-entangled\nsuperpositions of well-controlled states of light by using an on-chip photonic\nsystem that has recently been shown to implement three-dimensional, non-Abelian\nquantum holonomy. Our calculations indicate that a subset of such entangled\nsuperpositions are maximally-entangled, volume-law states, and that the\nunderlying entanglement can be distilled and purified for applications in\nquantum science. Specifically, we envisage that this entangling mechanism could\nbe utilized for realizing two-qubit, universal, entangling quantum gates with\nlinear photonic elements alone. Furthermore, this method should also--at least,\nin principle--be generalizable to systems of neutral atoms.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Er1ztQURutWo48O_9cc__60FXFONC-8dMbGX3RlDXAM","pdfSize":"1505800","objectId":"0x8553d0d9cf2b6c0a32f1e7dd8118725da1748753bfb7c18fa06839a68d42e0ea","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
