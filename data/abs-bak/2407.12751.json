Most, if not all of these topics (stochastic gradient\nMCMC, non-reversible MCMC, continuous time MCMC, and new techniques for\nconvergence assessment) have emerged as recently as the last decade, and have\ndriven substantial recent practical and theoretical advances in the field. A\nparticular focus is on methods that are scalable with respect to either the\namount of data, or the data dimension, motivated by the emerging high-priority\napplication areas in machine learning and AI.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Computation","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"an4ASghQwhRZxaa3NQu_P1JghqqnZxGjqTm4EAue3uk","pdfSize":"5544677","objectId":"0x3f977defd892456e61fbc8589726099acc90252a1667831d7ddcef8b5035b96a","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
