BO has been successfully applied to\nautomate the task of hyperparameter optimization (HPO) in machine learning (ML)\nmodels with the primary objective of optimizing predictive performance on\nheld-out data. In recent years, however, with ever-growing model sizes, the\nenergy cost associated with model training has become an important factor for\nML applications. Here we evaluate Constrained Bayesian Optimization (CBO) with\nthe primary objective of minimizing energy consumption and subject to the\nconstraint that the generalization performance is above some threshold. We\nevaluate our approach on regression and classification tasks and demonstrate\nthat CBO achieves lower energy consumption without compromising the predictive\nperformance of ML models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8b9wiwcWA6aeq4HqkESmNDgITv-qU6ky5ghnLTXzJdM","pdfSize":"2364582"}
