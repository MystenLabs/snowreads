The autoencoder-based system is able to\nefficiently detect anomalies, while maintaining a very low false discovery\nrate. The performance of the system is validated with anomalies found in 2018\nand 2022 LHC collision data. Additionally, the first results from deploying the\nautoencoder-based system in the CMS online Data Quality Monitoring workflow\nduring the beginning of Run 3 of the LHC are presented, showing its ability to\ndetect issues missed by the existing system.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Fe9zy-LA7H1PrVRCSY9MX3u6NGzEv2YHvRDmMmTerLw","pdfSize":"1561185","objectId":"0xda521e664f8e2e559787b2c0f19d70086e40c5e1377a4a06367506ec3c90081b","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
