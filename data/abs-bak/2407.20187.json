In this paper, we present polynomial-time algorithms which can\neliminate majority illusion in a network by altering as few connections as\npossible. Additionally, we prove that the more general problem of ensuring all\nneighbourhoods in the network are at least a $p$-fraction of the majority is\nNP-hard for most values of $p$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"O0C5iygrIjFD4XAKI0zNMNSqgktQeyhYOtF8mLMouRE","pdfSize":"302132","objectId":"0xae08c7afe774e1f4e315a4d5fdbe5d891168fcc501df1c39e4d2e1f9d80b3191","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
