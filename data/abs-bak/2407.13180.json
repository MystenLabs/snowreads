The survival probabilities\nare expressed in a compact mathematical form in terms of the $x_0$-generalized\nFibonacci-like numbers $G^{(x_0)}_t$. Interestingly, it is proved that, as\nopposed to the standard random walk model in which the survival probabilities\ndepend linearly on the initial distance $x_0$ of the walkers from the trap and\ndecay asymptotically as an inverse power of the time, in the Sisyphus random\nwalk model the asymptotic survival probabilities decay exponentially in time\nand are characterized by a non-trivial (non-linear) dependence on the initial\ngap $x_0$ from the absorbing trap. We use the analytically derived results in\norder to analyze the underlying dynamics of the `survival-game', a highly risky\ninvestment strategy in which non-absorbed agents receive a reward $P(t)$ which\ngradually increases in time.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Kw823e8MUN63OWtnA6AYWiyYQHVrDgZ15KAcdmfElTM","pdfSize":"127029","objectId":"0x43db5d277e1609d35446ba50745b8b7774c44d4823b64ce8ce3297d63b7f6493","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
