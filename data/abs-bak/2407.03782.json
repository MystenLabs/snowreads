The assigned challenge consisted in finding rigorous formulas for\nresidual entropies of all possible frustrations without exception and\nelucidating the influence of frustrations on the behavior of the thermodynamic\nfunctions of the system under discussion. The accomplished results turned out\nto be very rich and intricate, especially in comparison with the original\nundecorated square lattice, in which frustration properties are completely\nabsent. Such an abundance of properties is due to the multiparametric problem\nof decorated lattice with four exchange interactions $J_{x}$, $J_{y}$, $J_{dx}$\nand $J_{dy}$ taking on arbitrary continuous values and different signs:\npositive (ferromagnetic) and negative (antiferromagnetic), as well as with two\ndiscrete variables $d_{x}$ and $d_{y}$ (multiplicities of decorating spins in\nboth lattice directions), corresponding to infinite natural series of numbers.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Xg13TteKU5jmZ37xNtGZVhPJ5iOoMQTVtyCaMRUJIAw","pdfSize":"2417651"}
