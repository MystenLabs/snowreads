Whenever possible we will rely upon proofs in printed\nliterature, particularly the work of Karoubi, Wood, Schr\\\"oder, and more recent\nwork of Boersema and J. M. Rosenberg. In addition, we shall explain how\n$KO$-theory is related to the Ten-Fold Way in physics and point out how some\ndeeper features of $KO$-theory for operator algebras may provide powerful new\ntools there. Commutative real $C^*$-algebras NOT of the form $C^R(X)$ will play\na special role. We also will identify Atiyah's $KR^0(X, \\tau ))$ in terms of\n$KO_0$ of an associated real $C^*$-algebra.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras","Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"w7dgjHO-0EbFqbcAzMoTYTKL29EpSckSymoB_x4cpjY","pdfSize":"677586"}
