The state space, action space and reward\nfunction of a fMDP can be encoded compactly using a factored representation. In\nthis paper, we consider the setting where we have a set of potential sensors to\nselect for the fMDP (at design-time), where each sensor measures a certain\nstate variable and has a selection cost. We formulate the problem of selecting\nan optimal set of sensors for fMDPs (subject to certain budget constraints) to\nmaximize the expected infinite-horizon discounted return provided by the\noptimal control policy. We show the fundamental result that it is NP-hard to\napproximate this optimization problem to within any non-trivial factor. We then\nstudy the dual problem of budgeted actuator selection (at design-time) to\nmaximize the expected return under the optimal policy. Again, we show that it\nis NP-hard to approximate this optimization problem to within any non-trivial\nfactor. Furthermore, with explicit examples, we show the failure of greedy\nalgorithms for both the sensor and actuator selection problems and provide\ninsights into the factors that cause these problems to be challenging. Despite\nthe inapproximability results, through extensive simulations, we show that the\ngreedy algorithm may provide near-optimal performance for actuator and sensor\nselection in many real-world and randomly generated fMDP instances.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xinp5ShYyO8aOiJ0H4QNeaLGB3Qc4jJXYlJwdNSS1jA","pdfSize":"1237926"}
