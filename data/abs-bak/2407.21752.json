These effects are inherently absent from\ncalculations for a free electron at rest. Coulomb exchanges are enhanced by the\nlarge number of electrons in the atomic debris, and are unsuppressed by\nnon-relativistic velocities in the debris. We find that these exchanges can be\nresummed using operator methods, and cancel at the level of the cross section\nuntil at least $O(\\alpha^3)$. Furthermore, we argue that both final {\\it and}\ninitial state Coulomb exchanges (enhanced by the number of electrons in the\natom) do not affect the cross section until at least $O(\\alpha^3)$. Transverse\nphoton couplings to non relativistic electrons are proportional to their small\nvelocities, and rotational invariance suppresses their contribution to\n$O(\\alpha^3)$. Our results are relevant for precision experiments involving\nneutrinos, electrons, positrons, and muons scattering off of atomic electrons\nin a fixed target.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LVynz07SFHNpNlxHUoYVCbq254rEYPbZ0be4p6O6-xA","pdfSize":"736702","objectId":"0xc2670f70d6db3ec02a738f5b94b03f9a982deaf4e54969a0f87161c713696356","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
