The former generalises the Pramanik-Seeger argument used in the\nproof of decoupling for the light cone. The latter locates the degenerate part\nof a manifold and effectively reduces the decoupling problem to two extremes:\nnon-degenerate case and totally degenerate case. Both principles aim to provide\na new algebraic approach of reducing decoupling for new manifolds to decoupling\nfor known manifolds.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iaM8u-vXul8-yVZ01v6sXOK39G83vCLx8kcMhvz6P74","pdfSize":"337335","objectId":"0xfee313ce0bcac58468b7987f099d9cf10eb2703d22d76dd08115e77caad54095","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
