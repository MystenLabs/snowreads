We\npropose a realization of pNGB DM in the context of a left-right symmetric\nmodel, wherein the neutrinos are pseudo-Dirac in nature. The Dirac mass term\nfor neutrinos arises from two-loop quantum corrections, whereas the Majorana\nmass terms are generated from Planck-induced corrections. This class of model\nalso provides a parity solution to the strong CP problem without the need for\nan axion. We show an interesting correlation between the lifetime of the DM and\nthe mass-squared differences between active and sterile neutrinos while\nmaintaining a solution to the strong CP problem.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kLJKATH1RlcnxZCxLCfs0_hs18-KNJAkIMkTiogXIdk","pdfSize":"663963"}
