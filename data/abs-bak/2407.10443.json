Based on our latest quark\nmodel approach, we extend our search for other potentially stable\nconfigurations of doubly heavy tetraquarks using our nonrelativistic quark\nmodel described in Ref.~\\cite{Noh:2023zoq}. Our numerical calculations indicate\nthat the $\\bar{u}\\bar{s}cb$ configuration is deeply bound. However, the\n$\\bar{u}\\bar{d}cb$ configuration with the isospin symmetry in the light quark\nsector is relatively less bound. In this study, we emphasize a compulsory\naspect for requiring a complete set of three dimensional harmonic oscillator\nbases through the discussion of the $\\bar{u}\\bar{s}cb$ configuration and\ninvestigate the essential differences between the $\\bar{u}\\bar{s}cb$ and\n$\\bar{u}\\bar{d}cb$ configurations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"meA7saAL3SWV7G0xxL57FNXosCBAgX1QnDmM75l8UYY","pdfSize":"259698","objectId":"0x8bfa38a2550dd225eda98f1f1e3073a2cbbe027e1a03ce2154fc541266029a0b","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
