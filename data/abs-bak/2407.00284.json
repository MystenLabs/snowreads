The\nleading order geometric optics approximation admits a closed-form expression of\nsuch paths, and sets of source/receiver locations are quantified for a spectrum\nof black hole angular momenta. A conserved, conformal Yano-Killing scalar is\nthen exploited to determine the evolving polarization. Polarization holonomy,\nthe angle between outgoing and incoming polarizations, is quantified for the\nspectrum of admissible direct and retrograde trajectories.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ndFwtGd0asbmKft7KdE52OtlrXvKC36KUK6ZoKEOtos","pdfSize":"6218758","objectId":"0x1da94ec3617befe11d869d24df499f2ce0b8c035e59576e45c39ebaf54781dff","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
