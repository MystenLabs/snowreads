We improve the lower\nbound for diameter of such sets in the particular case when the characteristic\nof the set is of the form $4k+1$ or $4k+2$. To achieve that, we combine\nhyperbolae-based and grid-based toolsets.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"0bY86_m1zj1W75zmaLUGQplRGze8Bpk5jXDsiUyLdd4","pdfSize":"972150","objectId":"0x904e55b675fb793b143b8d18e3a2254338b8dffb510699dc5d7660858a350d0f","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
