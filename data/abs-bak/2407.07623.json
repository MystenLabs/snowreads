They are the last missing piece for a consistent\ndescription of observables with identified final-state hadrons at\nnext-to-next-to leading order accuracy in quantum chromodynamics. We present an\nanalytical form of the matching condition for light-flavour to hadron\nfragmentation function at next-to-next-to leading order. The derivation is\nperformed by extending the formalism employed in the extraction of the next-to\nleading order matching conditions to the subsequent order, making use of\n$e^+e^-$ annihilation cross sections. We obtain the first non-trivial\nheavy-quark effect in the light-quark fragmentation functions and provide\nresults in Mellin space.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GwY1u0TDJq8OLTru5jCcfGmV421OtD-XhgMnvkgZ5T0","pdfSize":"747494","objectId":"0x6d83bd345de8e4d6d65854536e5f2a7785732f4e1187e00e0ab713999290b59e","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
