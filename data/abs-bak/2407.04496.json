To simplify this optimization, we can reduce the search\nspace using problem symmetries and typical optimal parameters as initial points\nif they concentrate. In this article, we consider typical values of optimal\nparameters of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm for the MaxCut\nproblem with $d$-regular tree subgraphs and reuse them in different graph\ninstances. We prove symmetries in the optimization landscape of several kinds\nof weighted and unweighted graphs, which explains the existence of multiple\nsets of optimal parameters. However, we observe that not all optimal sets can\nbe successfully transferred between problem instances. We find specific\ntransferable domains in the search space and show how to translate an arbitrary\nset of optimal parameters into the adequate domain using the studied\nsymmetries.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"h5-z-ZJackYkvcHLffRWd8jGHDrjFJHwcXU8LEGq1u0","pdfSize":"845541"}
