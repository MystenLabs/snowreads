We present the first electron-spin resonance (ESR)\ncharacterization of CTs in certain defect-rich silica glasses, noting coherence\ntimes up to 16 $\\mu$s at the CTs. We find CT behavior at zero magnetic field in\nborosilicate and aluminosilicate glasses, but not in a variety of silica\nglasses lacking boron or aluminum. Annealing reduces or eliminates the\nzero-field signal. Since boron and aluminum have the same valence and are\nacceptors when substituted for silicon, we suggest the observed CT behavior\ncould be generated by a spin-1 boron vacancy center within the borosilicate\nglass, and similarly, an aluminum-vacancy center in the aluminosilicate glass.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"M51W-vUEDLG5Kn5wDDzKxbcMv4tLkGg7y8IjIcl7-ms","pdfSize":"4711421","objectId":"0x8587ad13d937587dee7572696be1653ce8144d6a5c1fb0a22be0411804e7636d","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
