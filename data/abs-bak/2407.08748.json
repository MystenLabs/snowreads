This inverse covariance\nmatrix also prescribes the hedge trades in which a stock is hedged by all the\nother stocks in the portfolio. In practice with finite samples, however,\nmulticollinearity gives rise to considerable estimation errors, making the\nhedge trades too unstable and unreliable for use. By adopting ideas from\ncurrent methodologies in the existing literature, we propose 2 new estimators\nof the inverse covariance matrix, one which relies only on the l2 norm while\nthe other utilizes both the l1 and l2 norms. These 2 new estimators are\nclassified as shrinkage estimators in the literature. Comparing favorably with\nother methods (sample-based estimation, equal-weighting, estimation based on\nPrincipal Component Analysis), a portfolio formed on the proposed estimators\nachieves substantial out-of-sample risk reduction and improves the\nout-of-sample risk-adjusted returns of the portfolio, particularly in\nhigh-dimensional settings. Furthermore, the proposed estimators can still be\ncomputed even in instances where the sample covariance matrix is\nill-conditioned or singular\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Portfolio Management","Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EF5DyoBoHooVYe1eqzFuvYgA6XL8GF7pqCqSEhKvwT4","pdfSize":"2447165","objectId":"0x7f77b697bbce4e87acb48aa5684cc25bdbef83cef856a04928283b11f7505904","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
