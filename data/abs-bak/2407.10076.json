We report a\ncomprehensive investigation of the ground state properties of\nSr$_3$CuTa$_2$O$_9$ that belongs to the above family, by employing\nmagnetization, specific heat, and muon spin relaxation ($\\mu$SR) experiments\ndown to the lowest temperature of 0.1~K. Analysis of the magnetic\nsusceptibility indicates that the spin-lattice is a nearly isotropic $S = 1/2$\ntriangular lattice. We illustrate the observation of a gapless QSL, in which\nconventional spin ordering or freezing effects are absent, even at temperatures\nmore than two orders of magnitude smaller than the exchange energy ($J_{\\rm\nCW}/k_{\\rm B} \\simeq -5.04$~K). Magnetic specific heat in zero-field follows a\npower law, $C_{\\rm m} \\sim T^\\eta$, below 1.2~K with $\\eta \\approx 2/3$, which\nis consistent with a theoretical proposal of the presence of spinon Fermi\nsurface. Below 1.2~K, the $\\mu$SR relaxation rate shows no temperature\ndependence, suggesting persistent spin dynamics as expected for a QSL state.\nDelving deeper, we also analyze longitudinal field $\\mu$SR spectra revealing\nstrong dynamical correlations in the spin-disordered ground state. All of these\nhighlight the characteristics of spin entanglement in the QSL state.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_0WIwe3BTGa_rw-yyQDa2zZuWI5WeeJ3QTX7oHZEh_o","pdfSize":"2088001","objectId":"0x4d381f996a4352a2747d49d7bb8801db9c4183cdbeec67014d9c440aaeb1a180","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
