The single photon\nemitters can be understood as single sulfur vacancies. The corresponding\nfar-field luminescence spectra reveal several photoluminescence lines below the\ndominating luminescence of the exciton in MoS2. These sub-bandgap emission\nlines were predicted by ab initio theory, but they have never been resolved in\nluminescence experiments because of their small amplitude. We reveal the lines\nby their dependence as a function of the photon energy and momentum as measured\nin the back focal plane of the optical circuitry. The agreement between theory\nand experiment suggests that the defect states interact strongly within the\nBrillouin zone.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YqqDypfuPo2kML9OJ1ZbvMFOho89DoVNtY6_cnuhLTc","pdfSize":"1627520","objectId":"0xf89afb02a40100d61e470182093809f7623302d9f25c935581d5460bf7c54c4b","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
