In our\nexperiments we have used these variants to measure their performance such as\nthroughput, delay (latency), and drop rate with respect to time and Constant\nBit Rate (CBR) - no congestion control, specified bandwidth and sends packets\nat a specified rate. We have used the NS2 network simulator to perform all our\nexperiments to analyze TCP performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mO7eF-JftyIoGBJWWzVGLthD4Kf9bkeJVWrHT0QrejY","pdfSize":"540714","objectId":"0x564580350b3e94f23a9faef598511d42ea87a7fbcc11f282ce63bdeab7994378","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
