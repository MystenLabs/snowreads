For\nexample, low-alpha lattices are commonly used to produce picosecond bunches for\nthe generation of coherent THz radiation and are the basis of a number of\nconceptual designs for EUV generation via steady-state microbunching (SSMB).\nAchieving ultra-low alpha requires not only a high-level of stability in the\nlinear optics but also flexible control of higher-order compaction terms.\nOperation with lower momentum-compaction lattices has recently been\ninvestigated at the IOTA storage ring at Fermilab. A procedure for lowering the\nring compaction using the linear optics along with compensations from the\nhigher-order magnets was developed with the aid of a model, and an experimental\ntechnique for measuring the momentum compaction was developed. The lowest\nmomentum compaction achieved during the available run-time was\n$3.4\\times10^{-4}$, around 15 times lower than previously operated. These\nfeasibility studies ensure an improved experimental understanding of the IOTA\noptics and potentially will enable new research programs at the facility.\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8htaHXJtof6_PMBti9-LxDAYlflPaidAvBHPGwkKXpA","pdfSize":"3220376","objectId":"0x81380c3114807262d6d1f6ae42f7997b26d9915a251b69be1a63c3dfe517faea","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
