Unlike quantum computing,\nwhich consists of a sequence of unitary transformations (gates) and projectors\n(measurements), symplectic computation involves a sequence of symplectic\ntransformations and measurements.\n  The proposal to explore symplectic computers is based on the following\nquantum-symplectic duality. The Schr\\\"odinger equation in its standard complex\nform describes the unitary evolution of a quantum system, while its real form\ndescribes the symplectic evolution of a classical mechanical system. This\nquantum-symplectic duality can be leveraged to enhance the capabilities of\nquantum and symplectic computers. In this symplectic approach, the role of a\nquantum bit (qubit) is taken by a symplectic bit (symbit).\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"uQerTnGaFVWwsH1OLFz7abukZqhBW7w6GAU9Rq8jahs","pdfSize":"276858","objectId":"0x81e9d516cc2ac71ad192efb0513e56bdaf918797e0d479d21e57d24eabbfe0ef","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
