Introducing self-interactions between\ndark matter particles claims to provide a solution to the small-scale issues in\nthe LambdaCDM simulations while being consistent with the observations at large\nscales. The existence of the energy region in which these self-interactions\nbetween dark matter particles come close to saturating the S-wave unitarity\nbound can result in the formation of dark matter bound states called darkonium.\nIn this scenario, all the low energy scattering properties are determined by a\nsingle parameter, the inverse scattering length gamma. In this work, we set\nbounds on gamma by studying the impact of darkonium on the observations at\ndirect detection experiments using data from CRESST-III and XENON1T. The\nexclusion limits on gamma are then subsequently converted to exclusion limits\non the self-interaction cross-section and compared with the constraints from\nastrophysics and N-body simulations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VtaMNRlG5_NBgFPLIgd6iWu9-3gTXV35Ttc_Jr_-sC4","pdfSize":"349385"}
