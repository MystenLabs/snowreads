To date, the underpinning processes resulting in the\nquasi-periodic oscillations remain unknown. In this paper, we report a unique\nevent that exhibits both the long-duration quasi-periodic intensity\noscillations of flare loops and the quasi-periodic slipping motion of ribbon\nsubstructures during a C9.1-class flare (SOL2015-03-15-T01:15), using the\nobservations from Solar Dynamics Observatory and Interface Region Imaging\nSpectrograph. The high-temperature flare loops rooted in the straight part of\nribbons display a \"bright-dim\" intensity oscillation, with a period of about\n4.5 minutes. The oscillation starts just after the flare onset and lasts over 3\nhours. Meanwhile, the substructures within the ribbon tip display the\nquasi-periodic slipping motion along the ribbon at 1400 \\AA images which has a\nsimilar periodicity to the stationary intensity oscillation of the flare loops\nin the straight part of the flare ribbons. We suggest that the quasi-periodic\npattern is probably related to the loop-top dynamics caused by the reconnection\noutflow impinging on the flare loops.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"wgP-je4FutxYVBwSgXYVSXxU_edgX5q9k7d2wsE3T48","pdfSize":"3384500"}
