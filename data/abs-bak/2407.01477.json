Despite the simple form, the suggested formula gives exciton energies\nwith high precision compared to the exact numerical solutions that accurately\ndescribe recent experimental data for a large class of TMDC materials,\nincluding WSe$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, MoS$_2$, and MoTe$_2$. To achieve these\nresults, we have developed a so-called regulated perturbation theory by\ncombining the conventional perturbation method with several elements of the\nFeranchuk-Komarov operator method, including the Levi-Civita transformation,\nthe algebraic calculation technique via the annihilation and creation\noperators, and the introduction of a free parameter to optimize the convergence\nrate of the perturbation series. This universal form of exciton energies could\nbe helpful in various physical analyses, including retrieval of the material\nparameters such as reduced exciton mass and screening length from the available\nmeasured exciton energies.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"BReAp4ljDEYt_aUZMxLs6JHdPTCyRM6j0nNtt5PI3qw","pdfSize":"801562","objectId":"0x356460718e1167c3d7ffd55bd8e6f0ce16cc93752f597df2f7bee55c8225c2ce","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
