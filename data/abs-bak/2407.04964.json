In this paper, we introduce a third advantage\nof very low-precision neural networks: improved fault-tolerance attribute. We\ninvestigate the impact of memory faults on state-of-the-art binary neural\nnetworks (BNNs) through comprehensive analysis. Despite the inclusion of\nfloating-point parameters in BNN architectures to improve accuracy, our\nfindings reveal that BNNs are highly sensitive to deviations in these\nparameters caused by memory faults. In light of this crucial finding, we\npropose a technique to improve BNN dependability by restricting the range of\nfloat parameters through a novel deliberately uniform quantization. The\nintroduced quantization technique results in a reduction in the proportion of\nfloating-point parameters utilized in the BNN, without incurring any additional\ncomputational overheads during the inference stage. The extensive experimental\nfault simulation on the proposed BNN architecture (i.e. ZOBNN) reveal a\nremarkable 5X enhancement in robustness compared to conventional floating-point\nDNN. Notably, this improvement is achieved without incurring any computational\noverhead. Crucially, this enhancement comes without computational overhead.\n\\ToolName~excels in critical edge applications characterized by limited\ncomputational resources, prioritizing both dependability and real-time\nperformance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bb_N8JCtCePhodM1FscGbLy4KnT2j3rbJA5OyUS1jWM","pdfSize":"347449"}
