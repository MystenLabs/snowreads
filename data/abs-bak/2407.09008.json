The\neigenenergies will become complex and all eigenstates are localized at the\nboundary, which is distinguished from the Hermitian topologies. In this work,\nwe theoretically study the dynamic behavior of the propagation of Gaussian\nwavepackets inside a non-Hermitian lattice and analyze the self-acceleration\nprocess of bulk state or Gaussian wavepackets toward the system's boundary. The\ninitial wavepackets will not only propagate toward the side where the\neigenstates are localized, but also their momentum will approach to a specific\nvalue where the imaginary parts of energy dispersion are the maximum. In\naddition, if the wavepackets cover this specific momentum, they will eventually\nexhibit exponentially increasing amplitudes with time evolution, maintaining\nthe dynamic protected condition for an extended period of time until they\napproach the boundary. We also take two widely used toy models as examples in\none and two dimensions to verify the correspondence of the non-Hermitian skin\neffect and the dynamic protected state.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ic0Ld_sgu0NiZYLIrdGWgQldPFngAUdkpJo3X4kzx4E","pdfSize":"1518684","objectId":"0x997e85149ba01a442ce03c826d17e2aa174a4bb17ee73f52e5cffd011d742577","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
