Here we study\nthe effect on primordial black holes, which are expected to form with one or\nmore cosmic strings attached. Although large primordial black holes are\npredicted to rapidly spin up due to accretion soon after forming, we argue that\ncosmic strings will spin them down again. We show that if there are cosmic\nstrings with tension greater than $10^{-20}$, the spins of large primordial\nblack holes of mass greater than $30 M_\\odot$ should consequently be observed\nto be near zero. We also investigate the effect on a supermassive black hole of\ncapturing a cosmic string and the possibility of observing the subsequent spin\ndown by its effect on a pulsar orbiting the black hole.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_JgKfaweb7ZiV4Eup-nTpp8L7wa1m9PTtY-VphQpuTU","pdfSize":"538539"}
