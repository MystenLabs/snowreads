The main objective is to develop a classifier\nthat accurately identifies the type of interaction received (Conversation,\nServices, or Document Translation) to direct requests to the appropriate\nchannel and provide a more specialized and efficient service. Various models\nare compared, including LLM-based classifiers, KNN using Titan and Cohere\nembeddings, SVM, and artificial neural networks. Results show that SVM and ANN\nmodels with Cohere embeddings achieve the best overall performance, with\nsuperior F1 scores and faster execution times compared to LLM-based approaches.\nThe study concludes that the SVM model with Cohere embeddings is the most\nsuitable option for classifying human interactions in the AIDA environment,\noffering an optimal balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GujciTgL1oC3txlyfjPN9psyqWvZvGzTYe0ilPNXJac","pdfSize":"994983","objectId":"0x80c8834c1522ef584bdda8d2f2c5cfc4f8579bf6928964c4c31202aa431e6d24","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
