This work examines the\ncomplexity of the evaluation and satisfiability problems for the data-free\nfragment of nfer. The evaluation problem asks whether a given interval is\ngenerated by applying rules to a known input, while the satisfiability problem\nasks if an input exists that will generate a given interval. By excluding data\nfrom the language, we obtain polynomial-time algorithms for the evaluation\nproblem and for satisfiability when only considering inclusive rules.\nFurthermore, we show decidability for the satisfiability problem for cycle-free\nspecifications and undecidability for satisfiability of full data-free nfer.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ghfbwrw6q-8bceyktjdy1RJa8kj4wJZyBm8-DL0rVUo","pdfSize":"335401"}
