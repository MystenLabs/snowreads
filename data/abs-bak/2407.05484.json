There are $m$ types of\nbuyers in the market, where buyers of the same type $i$ have the same valuation\ncurve $v_i:[N]\\rightarrow [0,1]$, where $v_i(n)$ is the value for having $n$\ndata points. \\textit{A priori}, the seller is unaware of the distribution of\nbuyers, but can repeat the market for $T$ rounds so as to learn the\nrevenue-optimal pricing curve $p:[N] \\rightarrow [0, 1]$. To solve this online\nlearning problem, we first develop novel discretization schemes to approximate\nany pricing curve. When compared to prior work, the size of our discretization\nschemes scales gracefully with the approximation parameter, which translates to\nbetter regret in online learning. Under assumptions like smoothness and\ndiminishing returns which are satisfied by data, the discretization size can be\nreduced further. We then turn to the online learning problem, both in the\nstochastic and adversarial settings. On each round, the seller chooses an\n\\emph{anonymous} pricing curve $p_t$. A new buyer appears and may choose to\npurchase some amount of data. She then reveals her type \\emph{only if} she\nmakes a purchase. Our online algorithms build on classical algorithms such as\nUCB and FTPL, but require novel ideas to account for the asymmetric nature of\nthis feedback and to deal with the vastness of the space of pricing curves.\nUsing the improved discretization schemes previously developed, we are able to\nachieve $\\tilde{O}\\left(m\\sqrt{T}\\right)$ regret in the stochastic setting and\n$\\tilde{O}\\left(m^{\\frac{3}{2}}\\sqrt{T}\\right)$ regret in the adversarial\nsetting.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eUNv8R4iR81HriFGWI9kg0zcn33Pp_RIlnh5FZhnvII","pdfSize":"458639"}
