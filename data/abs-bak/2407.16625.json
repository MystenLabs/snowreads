While many photonic devices are based on linear\noptics, nonlinear responses at low threshold power are of high interest for\noptical switching and computing. In the case of counterpropagating light,\nnonlinear interactions can be utilized for chip-based isolators and logic\ngates. In our work we find a symmetry breaking of the phases of\ncounterpropagating light waves in high-Q ring resonators. This abrupt change in\nthe phases can be used for optical switches and logic gates. In addition to our\nexperimental results, we provide theoretical models that describe the phase\nsymmetry breaking of counterpropagating light in ring resonators.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xL3raIxg9eSRhqfJT8fqhJ0TPoDvhA8f8bhtVmeoNYg","pdfSize":"5233420","objectId":"0x26386eb67a610cb2a4f51cb565696e9f7d61783ed24abe7d360638d07990c8cf","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
