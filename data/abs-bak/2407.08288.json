We\nshow that under these conditions, the initial monochromatic spin wave\nnonlinearly generates co-propagating spin waves with well-defined, discrete\nfrequencies. This process is characterized by a low energy threshold and can be\nobserved in a wide range of frequencies and excitation powers. Thanks to the\nengineered dispersion, the process allows the generation of waves with short\nwavelengths that cannot be excited directly by a linear excitation mechanism.\nThe nonlinearly generated short-wavelength spin waves continuously acquire the\nenergy from the initial pump wave during co-propagation, which results in\ncompensation of their propagation losses over significant distances. The\nobserved phenomena can be used to implement frequency- and\nwavelength-conversion operations in magnonic nanodevices and circuits.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"16qCv6oD8Bf207re9S4hDaH_4u3_Il90zCf4IQc35tY","pdfSize":"1702369","objectId":"0xce759d3ac2db4267f8d27bef6482b1dff560f9a0458a59cfebc04b993462f532","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
