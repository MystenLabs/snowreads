Motivated by recent results\nshowing that many natural graph classes are subgraphs of the strong product of\na graph with bounded treewidth and a path, this paper studies clustered\ncolouring of strong products of two bounded treewidth graphs, where none, one,\nor both graphs have bounded degree. For example, in the case of two colours, if\n$n$ is the number of vertices in the product, then we show that clustering\n$\\Theta(n^{2/3})$ is best possible, even if one of the graphs is a path.\nHowever, if both graphs have bounded degree, then clustering $\\Theta(n^{1/2})$\nis best possible. With three colours, if one of the graphs has bounded degree,\nthen we show that clustering $\\Theta(n^{3/7})$ is best possible. However, if\nneither graph has bounded degree, then clustering $\\Omega(n^{1/2})$ is\nnecessary. More general bounds for any given number of colours are also\npresented.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YYxKwLPMfBycEJA_dArEMpoxcU02sddiTmZAp66P-yQ","pdfSize":"803390","objectId":"0xe11d4e6f8496fc9dc190e9c2c3e50c6f10bd85d6e46e34f01e2adfc9fe613a6a","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
