The goal of the Svalbard Marginal Ice Zone 2024\nCampaign was to observe and better understand the complex interplay between\natmosphere, waves, and sea-ice in the winter Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ) in order\nto advance the predictive skill of coupled Arctic forecasting systems. The main\nobjective has been to set up a network of observations with a spatial\ndistribution that allows for a representative comparison between in situ\nobservations and gridded model data. The observed variables include air and\nsurface temperature, sea-ice drift, and wave energy spectra. With the support\nof the Norwegian Coast Guard, we participated in the research cruise with KV\nSvalbard from 4. April - 21.April 2024. In total 34 buoys were deployed in the\nMarginal Ice Zone north of the Svalbard Archipelago. The first part of the\nreport describes the instruments and their calibration (Section 2), and the\nsecond part briefly describes the weather, sea ice, and wave conditions during\nthe campaign.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics","Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8IdTeFuOrEzCxso12ms0dZTdzO2-xoKa2WhcoTOOwNA","pdfSize":"5916541","objectId":"0x67ba7cfcebed66a76697752fa916b3bef822ee0e97b577f46cad1154966fe40c","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
