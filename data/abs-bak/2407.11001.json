Recent developments in\nGenerative AI (GenAI) like Vision-Language Models (GPT-4V) and Gemini have\nshown great promise in using LLMs as multimodal systems. This new research line\nresults in building Generative AI systems, GenAISys for short, that are capable\nof multimodal processing and content creation, as well as decision-making.\nGenAISys use natural language as a communication means and modality encoders as\nI/O interfaces for processing various data sources. They are also equipped with\ndatabases and external specialized tools, communicating with the system through\na module for information retrieval and storage. This paper aims to explore and\nstate new research directions in Generative AI Systems, including how to design\nGenAISys (compositionality, reliability, verifiability), build and train them,\nand what can be learned from the system-based perspective. Cross-disciplinary\napproaches are needed to answer open questions about the inner workings of\nGenAI systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BQ11NPtaWZOVzWedxbNHDjv6UUB73k5ll5HAWEHHTC0","pdfSize":"901256","objectId":"0x08c0ad8bce8f65c5e550d85e5e0ce373cb226ed43248faef9187bb838899944b","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
