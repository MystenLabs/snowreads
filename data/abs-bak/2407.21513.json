The\noscillators synchronize and achieve phase coherence, and this process is not\nsignificantly affected by the level of connectivity of the network. If the\nprobability that two oscillators are coupled is around the network connectivity\nthreshold synchronization still occurs, although in a more attenuated way. If\nthe size of the network is sufficiently large the oscillators have a phase\ntransition.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"femYN3_2rMBNRCqv0JRhe-S5WPX7Klvuq8Y29qwCgoM","pdfSize":"645252","objectId":"0xc55daeb90b91d1dceabbf20c52ab5257205d6895c8b2241a53701bc45a1e79ea","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
