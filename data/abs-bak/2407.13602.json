Under some assumptions on the outer automorphism group of\nthe fundamental group of a closed connected aspherical manifold $M$, we prove\nthat the homeomorphism group of $M$ is Jordan, we bound the discrete degree of\nsymmetry of $M$ and obtain a rigidity result, and we study the number of\nstabilizers of finite group actions on $M$. Thereafter, we show that closed\nconnected aspherical locally homogeneous spaces $H\\setminus G/\\Gamma$ satisfy\nthe necessary hypothesis on the outer automorphism group of the fundamental\ngroup.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0WmBktpHozBP4eXbkg7f4V4DkI3e-2ml2a_N3xGoEX4","pdfSize":"359764","objectId":"0x61321580b93b1f5ace282f83c9bf0f7ed3214bd2a9d3cb743deeac1b3704c983","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
