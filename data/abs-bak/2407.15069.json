In this dipole\nmodel, we consider an ideal gas and we investigate the evolution of the\nphysical parameters. The tilt parameter is constrained by the nonlinear\nfunction $f(Q)$ through the non-diagonal equations of the field equations. We\nfind that the dynamics always reduce to the vacuum solutions of STEGR. This\nincludes the Kasner universe, when no cosmological term is introduced by the\n$f(Q)$ function, and the isotropic de Sitter universe, where $f\\left( Q\\right)\n$ plays the role of the cosmological constant. In the extreme tilt limit, the\nuniverse is consistently anisotropic and accelerated. However, the final\nsolution matches that of STEGR.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lP1RmWSvl24w5u7_3FyYLJ3qHhtW_BaHys9OX6tpYh8","pdfSize":"1720084","objectId":"0xfa314bfefb91a02170888238eb25468955e31b669f2d961eb6a1fa0ded05590d","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
