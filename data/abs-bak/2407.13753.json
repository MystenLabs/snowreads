Our study investigates the use of\nfacial action units (AUs) and emotions as biomarkers for depression. We\nanalyzed facial expressions from video data of participants classified with or\nwithout depression. Our methodology involved detailed feature extraction, mean\nintensity comparisons of key AUs, and the application of time series\nclassification models. Furthermore, we employed Principal Component Analysis\n(PCA) and various clustering algorithms to explore the variability in emotional\nexpression patterns. Results indicate significant differences in the\nintensities of AUs associated with sadness and happiness between the groups,\nhighlighting the potential of facial analysis in depression assessment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Yt733r6Baei18JstltTtbi6x0sEcxJVEHcum0dB_3fI","pdfSize":"1960750","objectId":"0x0dda6747edc886e776b95f15c46c89c9c67cb27e4050f65008fc89930f8f9bf2","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
