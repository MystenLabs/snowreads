We present new\nsense-annotated diachronic semantic change datasets for Finnish and Russian\nwhich were employed in the shared task, along with a surprise test-only German\ndataset borrowed from an existing source. The setup of AXOLOTL'24 is new to the\nsemantic change modeling field, and involves subtasks of identifying unknown\n(novel) senses and providing dictionary-like definitions to these senses. The\nmethods of the winning teams are described and compared, thus paving a path\ntowards explainability in computational approaches to historical change of\nmeaning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zGsjFQYnMLSyU1vC1rnRLxwNjLDI8bAMZ5zRF8kraAs","pdfSize":"653074"}
