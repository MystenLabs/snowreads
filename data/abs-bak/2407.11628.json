A block triangular reconditioning method is proposed based on\npermutations of the saddle point problem and approximations of the\ncorresponding Schur complement. The spectral properties of the preconditioned\nmatrix is analyzed. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed preconditioning method.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"a0IUBOA7czvzjQgjYkiVmLrGUcbrm3tX1jDogOe4yu8","pdfSize":"762646","objectId":"0x35561882673cfc11d47f7f37fcc4f145abdeb03822c2a6bc456400c82020d09e","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
