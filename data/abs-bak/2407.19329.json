The work reported here extends this by adding the\nShapiro-Wilk statistic and the two-parameter Box Cox transformation, all of\nwhich show severe bias. We also develop a recalibration to correct the bias in\nall four settings. The methodology was motivated by finding reference ranges in\nbiomarker studies where parametric analysis, possibly on a power-transformed\nmeasurand, can be much more informative than nonparametric. It is illustrated\nwith a data set on biomarkers.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"s8YnGV3Lquk6-RFsZUqAk5EsyNCRcfsxDcALsf6zETI","pdfSize":"422376","objectId":"0xf33454a33284bf4a0ff34bdae8d1565446451a5ac6c33b507e7ceff2d98bdec4","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
