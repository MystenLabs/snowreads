To address this, recent methodologies have sought\nto gauge the maximum range of net load uncertainty across all buses. In this\npaper, we consider the stochastic nature of the net load and introduce a\ndistributionally robust optimization framework that assesses system flexibility\nstochastically, accommodating a minimal extent of system violations. We verify\nthe proposed method by solving the flexibility of the real-time economic\ndispatch problem on four IEEE standard test systems. Compared to traditional\ndeterministic flexibility evaluations, our approach consistently yields less\nconservative flexibility outcomes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aGb-t6nUcR-P1Jr0ab_dTLajRAFai3SpF3kHxQywYH4","pdfSize":"1437914","objectId":"0xefc3025f42899d9971fd6c46fd4f993de739b9fe472803514f96b0c6699920ca","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
