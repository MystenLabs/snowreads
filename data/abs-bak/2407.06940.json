For limit ordinals, we\nshow that this upper bound is tight. This gives an explicit sequence of such\ngroups with arbitrarily high Scott complexity below $\\omega_1$. Along the way,\nwe give a largely algebraic characterization of the back-and-forth relations on\nreduced abelian $p$-groups, making progress on an open problem from the book by\nAsh and Knight.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Rxt5zJs63zMUN-zhmpDe6vhWQmA-ZX3LD3qZuc4LAJk","pdfSize":"224616"}
