We develop a multilingual end-to-end speech-to-text translation\nmodel combining two pre-trained language models, HuBERT and mBART. We trained\nthis model with two decoding policies, Local Agreement (LA) and AlignAtt. The\nsubmitted models employ the LA policy because it outperformed the AlignAtt\npolicy in previous models. Our speech-to-speech translation method is a cascade\nof the above speech-to-text model and an incremental text-to-speech (TTS)\nmodule that incorporates a phoneme estimation model, a parallel acoustic model,\nand a parallel WaveGAN vocoder. We improved our incremental TTS by applying the\nTransformer architecture with the AlignAtt policy for the estimation model. The\nresults show that our upgraded TTS module contributed to improving the system\nperformance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3rSV5738XYnXymeT0MGwTuCFshCZTBUT9fVmVnIjpW4","pdfSize":"1587618","objectId":"0x11dd7496093de29fa2ae2b8012d35031a7b1f69e4f5e42f3878cfa7c149f5452","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
