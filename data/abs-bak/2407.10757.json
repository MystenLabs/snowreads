Investigation\nof the amalgamation of these materials under mechanical strains reveals\nsignificant alterations in the electronic properties of the MoS$_2$/PO\ninterface. Tensile strain induces a reduction in the bandgap, while compressive\nstrain initially engenders an increase, followed by a subsequent decrease.\nNotably, MoS$_2$ undergoes a transition from a direct to an indirect bandgap\nunder both stretching and compression conditions. These alterations stem from\nshifts in the density of states and band structure adjustments resulting from\nlattice deformations induced by applied strain. Remarkably, under specific\ncompression conditions, the MoS$_2$/PO system manifests a transition between\ntype II and type I band alignments. The detailed analysis of a range of strain\nmagnitudes yields profound insights into the behavior of MoS$_2$ and MoS$_2$/PO\nsystems under mechanical strain, with potential implications for nano- and\noptoelectronics applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XmVNEUknPeBkhTMrFbPKfQ2c87t9_JpIIMtNGONlYDA","pdfSize":"12461745","objectId":"0x08bb6e54b48d5d56187fb1d8eb5c595c57fd06f97a9216b720d6db3f3cbe1fc4","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
