We explore the experimental feasibility of testing the violations of\nthese inequalities in both pure and mixed flavor states of $K^0$-, $D^0$-, and\n$B_s$- meson pairs. Using the Werner noise model, we demonstrate that\nviolations of time-dependent Wigner inequalities can be detected even when\nbackground processes constitute up to 50% of the system.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5TRzU_TMjbD11wACF4PcHwq9eQ7iC69KAQrE84WrwsU","pdfSize":"1833957","objectId":"0xffdceb1885f47b8b176e06f194f69e3c0f8ab5fde4e1ff0e7065928c88c8da0d","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
