An audio distortion recovery model not only\nimproves the clarity of the guitar sounds but also opens up new opportunities\nfor creative adjustments in mixing and mastering. While progress have been made\nin creating such models, previous efforts have largely focused on synthetic\ndistortions that may be too simplistic to accurately capture the complexities\nseen in real-world recordings.\n  In this paper, we tackle the task by using a dataset of guitar recordings\nrendered with commercial-grade audio effect VST plugins. Moreover, we introduce\na novel two-stage methodology for audio distortion recovery. The idea is to\nfirstly process the audio signal in the Mel-spectrogram domain in the first\nstage, and then use a neural vocoder to generate the pristine original guitar\nsound from the processed Mel-spectrogram in the second stage. We report a set\nof experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach over existing\nmethods, through both subjective and objective evaluation metrics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"N2p6YJgTIBA5HfFlTI8WMkK6gu-MN1xaVpVscutQTo8","pdfSize":"2494846","objectId":"0x4b5ab3e81a1b3931fcc914bb9436f78eb732938fe83180117c4c031345888e0a","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
