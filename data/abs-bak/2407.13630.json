If we utilize the\nenhancement factor from the ratio of the frequency, it is possible to reach\nfurther below the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound. It will be interesting\nif we can access the region to discover a footprint of new physics.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"27ImcXY28AGNjl2t62zufYzxEpDLWX1tvvu5ai5OlBg","pdfSize":"4980624","objectId":"0xa9845f97a9133cd23dd93437069a92963277e9efe5db739bf0a42ac4a2c9d3e4","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
