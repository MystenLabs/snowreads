The resulting estimates are equivalent to\nentropy subadditivity and generalized Brascamp-Lieb inequalities, and provide a\nsharp modified log-Sobolev inequality for the Gibbs sampler of several particle\nsystems in both continuous and discrete settings. The method allows us to\nobtain simple proofs of known results, as well as some new inequalities. We\nillustrate this through various applications, including discrete Gaussian free\nfields on arbitrary networks, the down-up walk on uniform $n$-sets, the uniform\nmeasure over permutations, and the uniform measure on the unit sphere in\n$\\R^n$. Our method also yields a simple, coupling-based proof of the celebrated\nlogarithmic Sobolev inequality for Langevin diffusions in a convex potential,\nwhich is one of the most emblematic applications of the Bakry-\\'Emery\ncriterion.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZKf2r82Bx0I0RuBON1YzsWngT17OEk94gkhtueF29y0","pdfSize":"359994","objectId":"0x910c82246100b03e838ada0055291c757b1f921d52d002233401ba20c7ed88b1","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
