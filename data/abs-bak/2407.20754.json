We consider weighted knowledge bases in\nwhich both axioms and assertions have (possibly infinite) weights, which are\nused to assign a cost to each interpretation based upon the axioms and\nassertions it violates. Two notions of certain and possible answer are defined\nby either considering interpretations whose cost does not exceed a given bound\nor restricting attention to optimal-cost interpretations. Our main contribution\nis a comprehensive analysis of the combined and data complexity of bounded cost\nsatisfiability and certain and possible answer recognition, for description\nlogics between ELbot and ALCO.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"V8ggSA9nUBYDmgVl9weJCRffe8JcPZ2S39b6Ixa634Y","pdfSize":"405206","objectId":"0xb3f144813c742572ec232aae13dadd1cea884f56672e07076a850468adc7ceff","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
