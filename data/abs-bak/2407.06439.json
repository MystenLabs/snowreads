Using simple zero dimensional power\nbalance and standard empirical scaling laws for confinement, we analyze the\nimpact of external heating on several different reactor-relevant devices (i.e.\nSPARC, MANTA, ITER and DEMO). We compare the nominal externally heated\nscenarios against equivalent negative tringularity cases without external\nheating. For most of these devices, the Ohmically heated negative triangularity\nversions achieve better performance, particularly for devices with high\nmagnetic field and/or high fusion gain.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4SLwZ5ebWKCFdHNQwwJO-zk5jeIQ5e9wRiZmRydiy5w","pdfSize":"660038"}
