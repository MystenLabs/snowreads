In\nthis work, we reveal the behavior of two-photon quantum states in non-Hermitian\nsystems across the exceptional point. We probe the lossy directional coupler\nwith an indistinguishable two-photon input state and observe distinct changes\nof the quantum correlations at the output as the system undergoes spontaneous\nbreaking of parity-time symmetry. Moreover, we demonstrate a switching in the\nquantum interference of photons directly at the exceptional point, where\nHong-Ou-Mandel dips are transformed into peaks by a change of basis. These\nresults show that quantum interference and exceptional points are linked in\ncurious ways that can now be further explored.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IcIh0N91pR0KEFPb0lYCmMYQ3kRunt0CbsHlVy8JCY8","pdfSize":"1684985","objectId":"0x3a01aa90285c66d3ce4d10cbff14b13446e68c96855414997de4a8d650673e68","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
