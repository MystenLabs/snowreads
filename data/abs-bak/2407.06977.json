This study proposes a novel correlator between the\nforward-backward asymmetry of spectator numbers and final-state multiplicities\nto quantify the contribution from preferential emission to the longitudinal\ndistribution of produced particles. Using the AMPT model, we demonstrate that\nthe correlator peaks at large $\\eta$, indicating an increased contribution of\npreferential emission to particle production towards forward pseudorapidities.\nThus, this correlator provides a direct constraint on the initial state sources\ngoverning rapidity-odd directed flow and flow decorrelation. The correlator\nexhibits sensitivity to string fragmentation parameters and spectator matter\ndynamics such as fragmentation and evaporation. Our findings motivate an\nexperimental measurement of this correlator to constrain initial-state sources\ndetermining the longitudinal evolution of the Quark-Gluon Plasma, including\ncomplex dynamics of spectators in heavy-ion collisions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xOS8c2w7DvM0nMsQb_12vgd7oKgPJclpO2_NA9D0S8I","pdfSize":"542056"}
