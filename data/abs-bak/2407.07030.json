The majority of research is based on international\ndata that does not apply to Pakistan's road conditions. We designed a complete\npipeline for mining trajectories from sensors data. On this data, we employed\nstate-of-the-art approaches, including a shallow artificial neural network, a\ndeep multi-layered perceptron, and a long-short-term memory, to explore the\nissue of travel time prediction on frequent routes. The experimental results\ndemonstrate an average prediction error ranging from 30 seconds to 1.2 minutes\non trips lasting 10 minutes to 60 minutes on six most frequent routes in\nregions of Islamabad, Pakistan.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"lqRbJL5joqGd5jUUEspt_ZKfiR1c2Wx4MsvlBT00znE","pdfSize":"7767879"}
