In this\nwork we consider EPPs that always yield an output fidelity no worse than each\nof the original noisy states, a property we call universality. We prove there\nis no $n$-to-1 EPP implementable by local operations and classical\ncommunication that is universal for all two-qubit entangled states, whereas\nsuch an EPP is possible using more general positive partial\ntranspose-preserving (PPT) operations. We also show that universality is not\npossible by bilocal Clifford EPPs even when restricted to states with\nfidelities above an arbitrarily high threshold.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"moTopbo3PqJNquzhHAYEd3-u5x2anLlgF8_NKaFet40","pdfSize":"846351","objectId":"0x18bc6914a3181a20e3cc97f5c077a11c3827fa7b9cf4a2e165b7a3e41765798f","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
