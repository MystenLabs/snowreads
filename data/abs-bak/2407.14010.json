This paradigm, known as minimal dark\nmatter, has primarily focused on spin-$0$ and spin-$1/2$ particles. We extend\nthis study to the spin-1 case using the 5-dimensional real representation. We\naddress unitarity concerns arising from the model's interactions with\nelectroweak and Higgs fields of the Standard Model, investigating implications\nfor dark matter relic density, direct and indirect detection, including\nnon-perturbative Sommerfeld enhancement for the latter. Collider signatures of\nthe proposed model are also examined. Our findings suggest that the model\nremains consistent with experimental constraints, particularly for dark matter\nmasses on the order of dozens of TeV, and could potentially be tested using\n$\\gamma$-ray observatories such as CTA.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0IjG9BNN6VDIaYBKcbCblOh6tKSuX0mLpYBUZSFrAyE","pdfSize":"3879665","objectId":"0x7e9fcc255bb4b436ec84ce1e3d29d4360e0538df1719e72c888bf97ef7c2c10d","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
