This follows from the validity of\nSoergel's conjecture and the existence of injective morphisms between Rouquier\ncomplexes in the mixed perverse Hecke category. The monotonicity property is\ngeneralised to parabolic Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"x74-hdVc9i9FpG1PrCxtxhUPeJ8UF-hpgLkjIwsz2M0","pdfSize":"181287","objectId":"0xcde5db2887c96f8e77df8bfafe31ce18a7e79c5c7c097731a996fec83ea148a3","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
