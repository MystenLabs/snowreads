The impact of various possible orientations of an emitter with\nrespect to the waveguide surface is studied through simulations and compared\nwith experimental demonstration. Quantum emitters are dip coated on waveguides\nand Purcell enhancement and a decrease in the lifetime of the emitter are\nobserved. This study serves as a proof of concept for the Purcell effect\noffered by waveguides and helps ineffectively estimate the efficiency of\nwaveguide-based evanescent sensors and quantum photonic applications\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"UihAcZMXHLNK1F37g6_QdV0C4_K43EdnnrpB0ZCTliE","pdfSize":"2573350"}
