Mapping the beam of a low frequency radio array\npresents a unique challenge and science cases such as the observation of the\n21\\,cm line at high redshift have demanding requirements. Drone-based systems\noffer the unique potential for a measurement which is entirely under\nexperimenter control, but progress has been paced by practical implementation\nchallenges. Previously, a prototype drone system, called the External\nCalibrator for Hydrogen Observatories (ECHO), demonstrated good performance in\nmaking a complete hemispherical beam measurement. This paper reports updates to\nthe system focusing on performance of a new drone platform, minimizing\ninterference from the drone, and a new transmitter.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"KbMylN2AhHiGXV9-DGbYOV-gvFwUfcC88f7wyrJVKl8","pdfSize":"14217714"}
