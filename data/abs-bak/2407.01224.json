We derive a large-deviation\nprinciple with logarithmic speed: the rare event that the largest component\ncontains linearly more vertices than expected is caused by the presence of\nconstantly many vertices with linear degree. Conditionally on this rare event,\nwe prove distributional limits of the weight distribution and component-size\ndistribution.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"oFgSVCV7IktMAi3uuMARmv1rCEcaSxi_iUdxKWnh1S4","pdfSize":"559773","objectId":"0x1faee7c8b699f7817c9edf564feacb9747fbef9e9b61ad8e02170cee6f8ace3c","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
