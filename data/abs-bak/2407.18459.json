The basis is derived by solving in-plane and out-of-plane\nnormal modes of an unforced parallelogram elastic plate. We show that a\ncombination of only a few basis terms successfully captures the relaxed TBG\nstructure with and without an underlying substrate computed using atomistic\nsimulations. The results are validated by comparison with electron diffraction\nexperiments. A code for extracting the elastic plate basis coefficients from an\nexperimental electron diffraction image accompanies this paper. TBG dynamics\nare also studied by computing the phonon band structure from atomistic\nsimulations. Low-energy phonons at the $\\Gamma$ point are examined in terms of\nthe mode shape and frequency. These modes are captured by simple elastic plate\nmodels with uniformly distributed springs for inter-layer and substrate\ninteractions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"ZtmD_IwMIqvJpT7kXNI6Ab6MW3PmLeOqm-v8ycUzJjw","pdfSize":"17492793","objectId":"0x653e369beda562a76bf062977e9d2057ae043e2ccda1d0894e773d82884f534c","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
