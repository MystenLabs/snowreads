Each year, this competition fosters the development of\ninnovative and effective methodologies by its participants. In this paper, we\nintroduce an advanced ensemble technique that we developed, achieving a score\nof 0.153449 on the private leaderboard and securing the 160th position out of\nover 1,000 participants. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive review of\nexisting methods and techniques employed by top-performing teams in the\ncompetition. Our solution, alongside the insights gathered from other leading\napproaches, contributes to the ongoing advancement in the field of 3D image\nreconstruction. This research provides valuable knowledge for future\nparticipants and researchers aiming to excel in similar image matching and\nreconstruction challenges.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QGtmEs3owk5lLZJT6evg4nBUKrTqNYZc7byIrMza73Q","pdfSize":"14054245"}
