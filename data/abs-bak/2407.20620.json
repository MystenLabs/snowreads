When the objective function is given\nby the sum of a quadratic and a nonsmooth term, we establish accelerated\nsublinear and exponential convergence rates for convex and strongly convex\nproblems, respectively. Moreover, for FB splitting dynamics, we demonstrate\nthat accelerated exponential convergence rate carries over to general strongly\nconvex problems. In our Lyapunov-based analysis we exploit the variable-metric\ngradient interpretations of FB and DR splittings to obtain smooth Lyapunov\nfunctions that allow us to establish accelerated convergence rates. We provide\ncomputational experiments to demonstrate the merits and the effectiveness of\nour analysis.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yELJW6ZvOT3_tC_86gUCn4TiVDMjDW-VBaW16NsOmHo","pdfSize":"810569","objectId":"0x337ba8861ba4c6093c58984aa7bd5bd9dd401af5abcaad34d2ad835b1a928b5b","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
