This provides\ncounterexamples to a conjecture of Schoen. In fact, there are such examples of\narbitrarily high dimension with only single point singularities. We also\ndiscuss related phenomena on exotic spheres and tori. In addition, we provide\nexamples of $\\mathrm{L}^\\infty$-metrics on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ for certain $n \\geq\n8$ which are smooth and have psc outside the origin, but cannot be smoothly\napproximated away from the origin by everywhere smooth Riemannian metrics of\nnon-negative scalar curvature. This stands in precise contrast to established\nsmoothing results via Ricci-DeTurck flow for singular metrics with stronger\nregularity assumptions. Finally, as a positive result, we describe a\n$\\mathrm{KO}$-theoretic condition which obstructs the existence of\n$\\mathrm{L}^\\infty$-metrics that are smooth and of psc outside a finite subset.\nThis shows that closed enlargeable spin manifolds do not carry such metrics.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Y4rGbOl03NEMCVOyHKhmqMWEME8Spf369--EwNBfG2I","pdfSize":"703590","objectId":"0x76809399e1575aafbca77e6f168dcc65d49a99386d24d5301a64c5af3244c2e1","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
