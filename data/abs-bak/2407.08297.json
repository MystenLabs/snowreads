In this paper, we\nestablish the connection between this measure and several other ETH measures in\na more natural way. We first demonstrate a universal trade-off relation between\nthe diagonal and off-diagonal elements of the measure. We then extend this\ndiscussion to eigenstate typicality and the average observable. This trade-off\nrelationship reveals that the exponential growth of off-diagonal elements\ndirectly suppresses their own values, as well as indirectly suppressing the\ndiagonal elements. This provides a new perspective on the physical mechanisms\nunderlying ETH. Finally, through numerical calculations on a one-dimensional\nIsing spin chain, we explore various trade-off relationships and examine strong\nand weak ETH.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Fv27Zk9yUhqhZ-Q3F-Qthn5C8KxuZndCkKMvE500lKk","pdfSize":"1570804","objectId":"0x24659204fe2fc264c999d80d6d2f16862b0b4551a71324943d482cf6768c8562","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
