We\nassume that infection is driven by interactions within mixing events\n(gatherings of two or more individuals). Once an infective is diagnosed, each\nindividual who was infected at the same event as the diagnosed individual is\ncontact traced with some given probability. Assuming few initial infectives in\na large population, the early phase of the epidemic is approximated by a\nbranching process with sibling dependencies. To address the challenges given by\nthe dependencies, we consider sibling groups (individuals who become infected\nat the same event) as macro-individuals and define a macro-branching process.\nThis allows us to derive an expression for the effective macro-reproduction\nnumber which corresponds to the effective individual reproduction number and\nrepresents a threshold for the behaviour of the epidemic. Through numerical\nillustrations, we show how the reproduction number varies with the mean size of\nmixing events, the rate of diagnosis and the tracing probability.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4ZaEr33mKrAtfzLht0raorasZiQPYGugaO9TUbmqk2A","pdfSize":"440330","objectId":"0x85a451dc8cf145c2d672413abbb2b81f30ca3c6ee1545075fed3563e86850873","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
