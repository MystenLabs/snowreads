We present conditions, some necessary and some sufficient,\nfor a reflexive digraph to be Slupecki. We prove that all digraphs that\ntriangulate a 1-sphere are Slupecki, as are all the ordinal sums $m \\oplus n$\n($m,n \\geq 2$). We prove that the posets $P = m \\oplus n \\oplus k$ are not\n3-Slupecki for $m,n,k \\geq 2$, and prove there is a bound $B(m,k)$ such that\n$P$ is 2-Slupecki if and only if $n > B(m,k)+1$; in particular there exist\nposets that are 2-Slupecki but not 3-Slupecki.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"12Tw35-05_3JgnAPvEmmgf4pwtwsC8hxCuWs35UKvlI","pdfSize":"516905","objectId":"0xcc64e9beb4c9e60efab7acd697b95343b73f95279f826e0b511d31295f694eb3","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
