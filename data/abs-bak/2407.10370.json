We develop\nmachinery, including {\\em forbidding nested sequences} which implies a tight\nupper bound on Borel complexity, and {\\em admitting cross-cutting absolutely\nindiscernible sets} which in our context implies Borel completeness. In the\nAppendix we classify the reducts of theories of refining equivalence relations,\npossibly with infinite splitting.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IslD9OBEzBq0xng0zaKAdzz98TuSnn1ctR0mAZ0pyXM","pdfSize":"401657","objectId":"0x06b14dae5825434a6e08fb644842ae0c87533a3380bf134f558b7e7525f7ed34","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
