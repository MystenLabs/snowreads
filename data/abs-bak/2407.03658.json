Through\ncarefully designed annotation rounds, we find that GPT-4 performs comparably to\njunior translators in terms of total errors made but lags behind medium and\nsenior translators. We also observe the imbalanced performance across different\nlanguages and domains, with GPT-4's translation capability gradually weakening\nfrom resource-rich to resource-poor directions. In addition, we qualitatively\nstudy the translation given by GPT-4 and human translators, and find that GPT-4\ntranslator suffers from literal translations, but human translators sometimes\noverthink the background information. To our knowledge, this study is the first\nto evaluate LLMs against human translators and analyze the systematic\ndifferences between their outputs, providing valuable insights into the current\nstate of LLM-based translation and its potential limitations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TE5i_Sm7xTbKcrAXQ3k9Kb9C1Ebt3hrDOKq_YwiYgVk","pdfSize":"1349248"}
