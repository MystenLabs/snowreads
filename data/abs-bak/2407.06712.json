In this paper, we present a new geometric\ninterpretation of MDP, which is useful for analyzing the dynamics of main MDP\nalgorithms. Based on this interpretation, we demonstrate that MDPs can be split\ninto equivalence classes with indistinguishable algorithm dynamics. The related\nnormalization procedure allows for the design of a new class of MDP-solving\nalgorithms that find optimal policies without computing policy values.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VsEmRGYR1_fTcN9cQKiGQ40rRrocHkPIXhcjS5-73hg","pdfSize":"593631"}
