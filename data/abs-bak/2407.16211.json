From this we deduce several regularity and\nstructural properties of the corresponding free boundaries at those\ndistinguished points with finite order of contact with the obstacle. In\nparticular, we prove the rectifiability {and the local finiteness of the\nMinkowski content} of the whole free boundary in the case of Lipschitz\ncoefficients.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Z1n30C2ChJKnOZ4PeB-GbXFT_QRig_bD6iS_xMnKI0E","pdfSize":"492180","objectId":"0x4a32867fadf49b26878d9b5121fb31cc426205f3bcf542232b5a17470d25d43f","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
