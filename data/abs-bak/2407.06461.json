To this end, we\nemploy an algebraic model based upon the coupled formalism of Schwinger-Dyson\nand Bethe-Salpeter equations. Within this approach, the dressed quark\npropagator and the relevant Bethe-Salpeter amplitude encode the internal\nstructure of the corresponding meson. Electromagnetic properties of the meson\nare probed via the quark-photon interaction. The algebraic model employed by us\nunifies the treatment of all ground-state pseudoscalar mesons. Its parameters\nare carefully fitted performing a global analysis of existing experimental data\nincluding the knowledge of the charge radii of the mesons studied. We then\ncompute and predict electromagnetic and two-photon transition form factors for\na wide range of probing photon momentum-squared which is of direct relevance to\nthe experimental observations carried out thus far or planned at different\nhadron physics facilities such as the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator\nFacility (JLab) and the forthcoming Electron-Ion Collider. We also present\ncomparisons with other theoretical models and approaches and lattice quantum\nchromodynamics.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GN6RYblJsZfUCMb-etxnxjOMzgUTeLacIiC6yG3HrEE","pdfSize":"1984458"}
