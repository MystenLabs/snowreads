Most ultrathin broadband absorbers use parasitic plasmonic\nstructures that maximize absorption using surface plasmons and/or Fabry-Perot\ncavities, which limits the weight efficiency of the device. Here, we show the\ntheoretical and experimental realization of an unpatterned/planar semiconductor\nthin-film absorber based on monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs).\nWe experimentally demonstrate an average total absorption in the visible range\n(450 nm - 700 nm) of > 70% using > 4 nm of semiconductor absorbing materials\nscalable over large areas with vapor phase growth techniques. Our analysis\nsuggests that a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.54% and a specific\npower > 300 W g^-1 may be achieved in a photovoltaic cell based on this\nmetamaterial absorber.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-7-uf51ocVg5O3bteQQoAaXE-hdgjD_1NecKoFp8KsA","pdfSize":"2979238"}
