Using methods of geometric control theory and differential\ngeometry, it was possible to construct an orthonormal frame, calculate extremal\ntrajectories, describe the reachable set, construct an optimal synthesis, and\ndescribe the Lorentzian distance.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Yt7yoMlzLKuqP_uic9CZrwA2bviW7qhugVjLPOAgmjM","pdfSize":"1031854"}
