For this, we propose to combine a\ntwo-step procedure with data truncation, which is easy to implement and does\nnot require iteratively searching for a numerical solution. Departing away from\nthe light-tail assumptions often adopted in the time series factor modelling\nliterature, we derive the theoretical properties of the proposed estimators\nwhile only assuming the existence of the $(2 + 2\\eps)$-th moment for some $\\eps\n\\in (0, 1)$, fully characterising the effect of heavy tails on the rates of\nestimation as well as the level of truncation. Numerical experiments on\nsimulated datasets demonstrate the good performance of the proposed estimator,\nwhich is further supported by applications to two macroeconomic datasets.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"JG-CDzmumhpt7_oI-lOuOdexnZnLuy_3sqVfhUh48Ko","pdfSize":"1431402","objectId":"0x6f162fb8978d387bc4dd1313645c22389dabdd6e94c6c5c52d9c0d6959b6baa7","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
