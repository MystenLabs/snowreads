For those that require more than one copy of $S^2 \\times S^2$, we\nprove that the diffeomorphism can be isotoped to one that is supported in a\nsubmanifold homotopy equivalent to a wedge of 2-spheres, with null-homotopic\ninclusion map. We investigate the implications of these results by applying\nthem to known exotic diffeomorphisms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dhDXIsdWaX-C77-XdgEq0SSIemGyRIVIMEA5RPexxgc","pdfSize":"737425"}
