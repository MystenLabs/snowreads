The local tunneling conductance\naround a spin vacancy or localized vison reveals unique features associated\nwith fractionalized Majorana fermions, chargons, and visons. In certain\nparameter regimes, the single-spinon density of states and momentum dispersion\ncan both be directly extracted from the tunneling conductance. Our results\nsuggest that QPI is a promising tool for identifying the Kitaev QSL and its\nfractionalized excitations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lK9e5YsbvKIBcvet5IfgyEZnD_U5F4zVdjDRgaHc9tI","pdfSize":"1312574"}
