This review offers a comprehensive overview of lateral\nlipid diffusion in model biomembrane systems explored through the lens of\nneutron scattering techniques. We examine diverse models of lateral diffusion\nand explore the various factors influencing this fundamental process in\nmembrane dynamics. Additionally, we offer a thorough summary of how different\nmembrane-active compounds, including drugs, antioxidants, stimulants, and\nmembrane proteins, affect lipid lateral diffusion. Our analysis unveils the\nintricate interplay between these additives and membranes, shedding light on\ntheir dynamic interactions. We elucidate that this interaction is governed by a\ncomplex combination of multiple factors including the physical state and charge\nof the membrane, the concentration of additives, the molecular architecture of\nthe compounds, and their spatial distribution within the membrane. In\nconclusion, we briefly discuss the future directions and areas requiring\nfurther investigation in the realm of lateral lipid diffusion, highlighting the\nneed to study more realistic membrane systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"-BVZzHuKXBGE--q6VD7xzU7E2JTu4kQKyMqv0dS2_n8","pdfSize":"2254898"}
