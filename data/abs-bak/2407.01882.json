To search its existence is a\nhot topic in the ongoing and future high-energy nuclear experiments and the\ndevelopments of nuclear theory. In this study, we found a positive sign of $3N$\nSRC in nuclei, by analyzing the correlation between the per-nucleon nuclear\nmass and the probability of a nucleon in $2N$ SRC state, with the current\nexperimental measurements of $^2$H, $^3$He, $^4$He, $^9$Be, $^{12}$C,\n$^{27}$Al, $^{56}$Fe, Cu, $^{197}$Au and $^{208}$Pb from SLAC, CLAS, and JLab\nHall C collaborations. The effective masses of the nucleons in $2N$ SRC and\n$3N$ SRC are also extracted from the analysis, which provide some references\nfor the nuclear medium effect study. The probability of $3N$ SRC is much\nsmaller than that of $2N$ SRC, thus requiring high-luminosity experiments to\nconfirm its existence.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"haj8wOxt8cbsww5MwxIFTgKAnx7756Qzm09FdzWb1Nw","pdfSize":"450670","objectId":"0xca389b3a11b408deb57184fb7b522fb00335d73dcd248f2ec4c2210af35e1f45","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
