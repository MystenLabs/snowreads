Distinguishing between contributions from fluctuations\nin the size of the nuclear overlap area (geometrical component) and other\nsources at fixed size (intrinsic component) presents a challenge. Here, these\ntwo components are distinguished by measuring the mean, variance, and skewness\nof $P([p_{\\mathrm{T}}])$ in $^{208}$Pb+$^{208}$Pb and $^{129}$Xe+$^{129}$Xe\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{{\\mathrm{NN}}}} = 5.02$ and 5.44 TeV, respectively,\nusing the ATLAS detector at the LHC. All observables show distinct changes in\nbehavior in ultra-central collisions, where the geometrical variations are\nsuppressed as the overlap area reaches its maximum. These results demonstrate a\nnew technique to disentangle geometrical and intrinsic fluctuations, enabling\nconstraints on initial condition and properties of the quark-gluon plasma, such\nas the speed of sound.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4Tv4Ex_gMoIqoWjchnb8_UmDaZfjCHj6XtfiitXWAeo","pdfSize":"2108098"}
