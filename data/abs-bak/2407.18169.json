Source code refactoring is a well-established approach to improving\nsource code quality without compromising its external behavior. Motivation. The\nliterature described the benefits of refactoring, yet its application in\npractice is threatened by the high cost of time, resource allocation, and\neffort required to perform it continuously. Providing refactoring\nrecommendations closer to what developers perceive as relevant may support the\nbroader application of refactoring in practice and drive prioritization\nefforts. Aim. In this paper, we aim to foster the design of a developer-based\nrefactoring recommender, proposing an empirical study into the metrics that\nstudy the developer's willingness to apply refactoring operations. We build\nupon previous work describing the developer's motivations for refactoring and\ninvestigate how product and process metrics may grasp those motivations.\nExpected Results. We will quantify the value of product and process metrics in\ngrasping developers' motivations to perform refactoring, thus providing a\ncatalog of metrics for developer-based refactoring recommenders to use.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_DgdByfc0QNfGMrZ0y2zmugrGKiU6q7orFiH9KvWWPg","pdfSize":"908559","objectId":"0x8f8a6b4b67acf120074f163cc4a11b0100f1de118f677978dd925958c4fcfb8d","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
