The system is based on the idea that the FL collaborators upload\nthe (ciphered) model parameters on the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) and\ninteract with a dedicated smart contract to track their behavior. Thank to this\nsmart contract, the phases of parameter updates are managed efficiently,\nthereby strengthening data security. We have carried out an experimental study\nthat exploits two different methods of weight aggregation, i.e., a classic\naveraging scheme and a federated proximal aggregation. The results confirm the\nfeasibility of the proposal.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WiLf-6E3A7KSFxhXbgXHpIUKtWmboZwXkrnkoOeUz6s","pdfSize":"592472"}
