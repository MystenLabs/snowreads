While the classical method for ocean wave measurement is based on\nthe second-order ocean Doppler spectrum, this alternative approach makes use of\nthe dominant first-order Bragg echo in the radar signal, which has a larger\nsignal-to-noise ratio and allows for a farther spatial coverage. We apply this\nmethod to a yearly set of HF radar data in the vicinity of Toulon\n(Mediterranean coast of France) and compare it with the classical second-order\nmethod, where we use a nearby buoy record as ground truth. The Doppler\nspectrum-based method is slightly more accurate in estimating the significant\nwave height and the mean period at a short distance but the temporal approach\nallows for a significant increase in range and better captures the variability\nof wave parameters over time.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-hbVBFotl9eH_KF5B9nnvOEyH3iArlmlNoWlaxZhFes","pdfSize":"9818941","objectId":"0xc1df079c462799dc53070fe0eebdf124789fc62a89a52b5e6fa055acaecd708f","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
