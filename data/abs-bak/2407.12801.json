We\nemployed a novel persona-based approach to compare the educational background\npredictions of GPT-3.5, Gemini, and Claude 3 Sonnet with actual data from\nLinkedIn. The study focused on various roles at Microsoft, Meta, and Google,\nincluding VP Product, Director of Engineering, and Software Engineer. We\ngenerated 432 personas across the three LLMs and analyzed the frequency of\nelite universities (Stanford, MIT, UC Berkeley, and Harvard) in these personas\ncompared to LinkedIn data. Results showed that LLMs significantly\noverrepresented elite universities, featuring these universities 72.45% of the\ntime, compared to only 8.56% in the actual LinkedIn data. ChatGPT 3.5 exhibited\nthe highest bias, followed by Claude Sonnet 3, while Gemini performed best.\nThis research highlights the need to address educational bias in LLMs and\nsuggests strategies for mitigating such biases in AI-driven recruitment\nprocesses.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NmzNq0m1EOCtSKEtt5nBzRfh6bZqFsFKCdfSTKXtGOE","pdfSize":"391057","objectId":"0xe89aab9b61c176fb5b4b29150812f4121949b2a0e07b6d296b1b77acb30ee442","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
