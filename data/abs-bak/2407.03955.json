The excessive volume of retrieved content, the possible\ndispersion of its parts, or their out of focus range may happen nevertheless to\neventually have a detrimental rather than an incremental effect. To mitigate\nthis issue and improve retrieval-augmented generation, we propose a method to\nrefine the retrieved content before it is included in the prompt by resorting\nto meta-prompting optimization. Put to empirical test with the demanding\nmulti-hop question answering task from the StrategyQA dataset, the evaluation\nresults indicate that this method outperforms a similar retrieval-augmented\nsystem but without this method by over 30%.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"W_4RRbzMnjH4lXO0IdcM15UJbNMVOYmfIPvirzJbx80","pdfSize":"184958"}
