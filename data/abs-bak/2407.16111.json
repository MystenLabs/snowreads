Yet\nthe precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains elusive. Using the\nWSe$_2$@hBN heterostructure as an example, we study the origin of the\ninterlayer exciton-phonon coupling and its signature in resonant Raman\nscattering through first-principles calculations. Our study emphasizes the\ncentral role of crystal symmetries in the interlayer exciton-phonon scattering\nprocesses, which are responsible for the anomalous resonant Raman intensities\nof the in-plane and the out-of-plane hBN phonon modes. We find that the\ndeformation potential induced by the hBN phonon interacts with the hybridized\nhole density of WSe$_2$ excitons near the hBN interface, leading to interlayer\nexciton-phonon coupling.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"j_dAnFHLdV7C_CmYJprhEorxO3pSYMREOXb-eIys65w","pdfSize":"2131624","objectId":"0xe5a6d7c94f20dc38ea63c44410ba8d491136905252bfefff13c61c4bc364ffec","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
