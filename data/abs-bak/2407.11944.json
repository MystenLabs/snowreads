We present ionization yields and momentum\ndistributions. The results are consistent with experimental and semi-classical\ndata available in the literature, thus complementing them with a quantum\nmechanical description.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"1AGbbvLw-dndx7iNpr9oPG48LXBx4tpgSjZRn9fwfcE","pdfSize":"554340","objectId":"0x167923c2d05ed2b20ed9420d652a15e876161dfe5d853524c939e3d5ec53b857","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
