We obtain a\nsignificant dependence of the running coupling constant $\\alpha$ on chemical\npotential, temperature and magnetic field. We use the boundary condition that\nensures the agreement with lattice calculations of string tension between\nquarks at zero chemical potential. The location of the 1-st order phase\ntransitions in $(\\mu, T)$-plane does not depend on the dilaton boundary\nconditions. We observe that running coupling $\\alpha$ decreases with increasing\nmagnetic field for the fixed values of chemical potential and temperature. At\nthe 1-st order phase transitions the functions $\\alpha$ undergo jumps depending\non temperature, chemical potential and magnetic field.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"oYJT5MFZOqsxr2JyPv07IunP0nnJg82xsr3uIHUDfOA","pdfSize":"1514047","objectId":"0xdd3e001d60b1fb626ffcaa129048f76a1b3dfde43dc076364134b01aa0b3aa65","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
