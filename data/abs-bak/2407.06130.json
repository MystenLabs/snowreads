A decision is made when the domain wall chooses\na particular path through the bifurcation. Recently, it was shown that a\nstructure like a nanomagnetic Galton Board, which is essentially an array of\ninterconnected Y-shaped junctions, produces outcomes that are stochastic and\ntherefore relevant to artificial neural networks. However, the exact mechanism\nleading to the robust nature of randomness is unknown. Here, we directly image\nthe decision-making process in nanomagnetic Galton Boards using Lorentz\ntransmission electron microscopy. We identify that the stochasticity in\nnanomagnetic Galton Boards arises as a culmination of: (1) topology of the\ninjected domain wall, (2) local disorder, and (3) strength of the applied\nfield. Our results pave the way to a detailed understanding of stochasticity in\nnanomagnetic networks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"geIvVRIlgAacHOsjeKby-sCKRMz5XY1aY_xgBrs_taA","pdfSize":"810632"}
