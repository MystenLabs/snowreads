Furthermore, by combining this result with\nEuclidean geometry, we derive an upper bound on the number of zeros of such a\npolynomial within a region resembling a gear wheel. Additionally, we obtain a\nsharp upper bound on the annular discrepancy of such zeros near the unit\ncircle. Our approach builds upon a modified version of the method described in\n\\cite{BE1}, combined with the refined version of the best-known upper bound for\nangular discrepancy of zeros of polynomials.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gXj4QcROP8BF4bx7YKNV9l1Lvb3jBgm3oAEtK58iv5o","pdfSize":"492133","objectId":"0x6346314c7e41a4277db89f54cc4cfd6380aa93ae023e75760103dec61892029a","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
