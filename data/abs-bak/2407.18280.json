We estimate\nthe masses of the $\\lambda$-excited states and the $\\rho$-excited states. The\nresults are in agreement with other theoretical predictions. Both the\n$\\lambda$-trajectories and the $\\rho$-trajectories are discussed. Moreover, the\nbehaviors of the $\\lambda$- and $\\rho$-trajectories for various baryons are\ndiscussed. It is shown that both the $\\lambda$-trajectories and the\n$\\rho$-trajectories for baryons are concave downwards in the $(M^2,\\,x)$ plane.\nThe Regge trajectories for the light baryons are approximately linear and\nbecome concave as the masses of the light constituents are considered.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fDd-stoH7IyjfntlyrWdcswJ8uNbqw6wuvzGXpomcpI","pdfSize":"197296","objectId":"0x5bcfd9b1dc4524d4cf3abea3e9a1af8c1a0eedb846102d8911f8f3ecb0b35258","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
