Here we report on over 20 yr of pulsar timing observations of\nfive millisecond radio pulsars in the core of the core-collapse GC NGC 6752\nwith the Parkes (Murriyang) and MeerKAT radio telescopes, which have allowed us\nto measure the proper motions, positions, and first and second time derivatives\nof the pulsars. The pulsar timing parameters indicate that all the pulsars in\nthe core experience accelerations and jerks that can be explained only if an\namount of nonluminous mass of at least 2.56x10^3 M_SUN is present in the core\nof NGC 6752. On the other hand, our studies highly disfavor the presence of an\nintermediate-mass black hole at the center of the cluster, with a mass equal to\nor greater than ~3000M_SUN.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AjuhbmMmZkT0b4untipsQo_R1rC_EdpI8uY8IV2cjSg","pdfSize":"1588105"}
