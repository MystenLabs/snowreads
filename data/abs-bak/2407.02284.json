Contrary to the\nfew existing tools, Renard can extract dynamic networks, as well as the more\ncommon static networks. Renard pipelines are modular: users can choose the\nimplementation of each NLP subtask needed to extract a character network. This\nallows users to specialize pipelines to particular types of texts and to study\nthe impact of each subtask on the extracted network.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"VG667ntUjLOIWoVe74NJSIR3lizh7IHmLkR_yuaYu6k","pdfSize":"360582","objectId":"0x5d6ed57a95ea02ac11c4b14ea759fb719fffdb273b6a5b194f285003e9038551","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
