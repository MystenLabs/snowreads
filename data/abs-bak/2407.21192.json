We demonstrate the effectiveness of the SupeRFIVe methodology by\napplying it to verify the functional correctness of a RISC-V dual-issue\nsuperscalar CPU, leveraging the state-of-the-art RISC-V instruction set\nsimulator Spike and executing a set of benchmark applications from the open\nliterature.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rxP5UPoitcCAKiIndmxjwfG6y8khZzQIzABm5Jovxqw","pdfSize":"260802","objectId":"0x02bf4cc79f35f772dd9cc7e8be0900435fd550f1ca1b72fbfd5e157896e4aaf1","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
