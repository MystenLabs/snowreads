We then use these generalised orbit rigidity matrices to provide\nnecessary conditions for infinitesimal rigidity for frameworks that are\nsymmetric with a cyclic group that acts freely or non-freely on the vertices.\nMoreover, for the reflection, the half-turn, and the three-fold rotational\ngroup in the plane, we establish complete combinatorial characterisations of\nsymmetry-generic infinitesimally rigid frameworks. This extends well-known\ncharacterisations for these groups to the case when the group action is not\nnecessarily free on the vertices. The presence of vertices that are fixed by\nnon-trivial group elements requires the introduction of generalised versions of\ngroup-labelled quotient graphs leads to more refined types of combinatorial\nsparsity counts for characterising symmetry-generic infinitesimal rigidity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OvPlYQ9ZicY3C4zsaq6WNainq2CiFPqSYptemHSrkW8","pdfSize":"490755","objectId":"0xac32a452df3587e46c0d77d390b6a272f78727ab574625f64046733a47a967bd","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
