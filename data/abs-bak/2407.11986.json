Employing evolutionary algorithms, this approach optimizes node\nplacement for internet access and symbiotic energy distribution. This model,\ngrounded in community collaboration, demonstrates a balance between\ntechnological advancement and environmental stewardship, offering a blueprint\nfor sustainable infrastructure in similar rural settings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mJd8TT7f0KJ5jqHMOX4TNuQuCBeRzLCauJMZ-lA6vvw","pdfSize":"716379","objectId":"0x779d1133c780c10c716af7226503d7f2098f86ec76149b596d884493966b4622","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
