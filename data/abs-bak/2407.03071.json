I determine the universal scaling\nexponents characterizing such systems exactly, finding that the dynamical\nexponent $z=3/2$, the \"anisotropy\" exponent $\\zeta=3/4$, and the \"roughness\"\nexponent $\\chi=-1/2$. I also give the scaling laws implied by these exponents.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BKSm1y237goYfqdSEtxmtHbcGNLWgRl6a3ksFv4lsCg","pdfSize":"149911"}
