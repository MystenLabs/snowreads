On the basis of new challenging scenarios we show that\nstate-of-the-art video predictors struggle in complex dynamical settings, and\nhighlight that the introduction of prior process knowledge makes their learning\nproblem feasible. Our approach results in the learning of a symbolically\naddressable interface between data-driven aspects in the model and our\ndedicated procedural knowledge module, which we utilize in downstream control\ntasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5R3tncol8C7tszR0rOhkdfNBMcD6fY4e_RW97xCE8uQ","pdfSize":"6987078","objectId":"0xb618fae76d59863d0a7f3d8e3ee586b8a3ff983ff60a88faae2f28bcb8e8c419","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
