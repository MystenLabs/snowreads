In\nparticular, we collect results related to Gr\\\"unbaum's inequality and the\nBusemann-Petty centroid inequality, describe classifications of convex bodies\nbased on equilibrium points, and investigate the location and structure of\nequilibrium points, their number with respect to a general reference point as\nwell as the static equilibrium properties of convex polyhedra.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JR9W8Rr_9nKNL3nsXpymm5mZWcIQSzv7LRX0kDqt654","pdfSize":"1482626","objectId":"0x4357a806c47a1af3c266f39ede6686afaa3c6c09391962bf079c1f0666f2dcea","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
