We assume the antenna to originate from an\nunpolarized gluon state, and consider both massless and massive final states.\nThe medium anisotropy is captured by allowing the jet quenching coefficient to\ntake different magnitudes in orthogonal directions with respect to the jet\naxis. We find that the final particle distribution is sensitive to the medium\nanisotropy, and more importantly, that this effect couples directly to the\nhelicity/spin of the final states. We propose to look into these effects by\nperforming a Fourier decomposition of the particle distribution inside the jet.\nIn our medium model, we find that the spin independent terms contribute to the\neven harmonics of the cosine series. The helicity/spin dependence enters only\nthrough the sine Fourier series. We further explore the spin dependence by\nexamining the degree of polarization of the final states in different\ndirections. Our results indicate that the anisotropies present in the QCD\nmatter produced in heavy ion collisions can be probed by studying azimuthal and\nspin observables inside jets.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7K2yweBTVHfIUA2EWWzODotpRo7sxleOA2nPctHEmGA","pdfSize":"1670851"}
