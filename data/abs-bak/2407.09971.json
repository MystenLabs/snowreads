We explore the complex interplay of Kondo physics\nand anisotropy in a minimal impurity model using numerical renormalization\ngroup. While anisotropy suppresses Kondo physics, Kondo physics enhances the\nanisotropy. Importantly, we find distinct renormalization of the magnetic\nanisotropy measured via dynamical spin response (inelastic neutron scattering)\nversus electronic excitations in the impurity spectral function (resonant\ninelastic x-rays and scanning tunneling spectroscopy). The two measurement\ntypes have different responses and dependences on the temperature and Kondo\nscales.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VLYojWOeOvk7Aa0onOS3yVD6hAS1jUlaFlHkTE_Vrx0","pdfSize":"5640982","objectId":"0xed5e93084c27687fff8010bb8d388378f0222d8370cef6c4daa9542dc16ee04d","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
