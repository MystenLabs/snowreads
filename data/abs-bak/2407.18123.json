For all integers $m,n,d\\geq 1$\nwith $m,n$ relatively prime, the $(d,mnd+1)$-cable of the torus knot $T(m,n)$\nappears as a special case. It is known that these knots are algebraic, and as a\nresult we obtain a proof of the $q=1$ specialization of the\nOblomkov-Rasmussen-Shende conjecture for these knots. Finally, we show that our\nSchr\\\"oder polynomial computes the hook components in the Schur expansion of\nthe symmetric function appearing in the shuffle theorem under any line, thus\nproving a triangular version of the $(q,t)$-Schr\\\"oder theorem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0LPqCv78Ps_NgqnGeY-E1Ow-s77G4a2nNL6Sp4Iw8ng","pdfSize":"1635422","objectId":"0x1d0b427bdcc7c41c485aa6d814c0bcdbe27073c2a53d2618be024d3970a0df45","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
