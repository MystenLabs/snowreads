Our explainer is based on\nthe observation that a graph often consists of a causal underlying subgraph.\n{\\name} includes three main steps: 1) It builds causal structure and the\ncorresponding structural causal model (SCM) for a graph, which enables the\ncause-effect calculation among nodes. 2) Directly calculating the cause-effect\nin real-world graphs is computationally challenging. It is then enlightened by\nthe recent neural causal model (NCM), a special type of SCM that is trainable,\nand design customized NCMs for GNNs. By training these GNN NCMs, the\ncause-effect can be easily calculated. 3) It uncovers the subgraph that\ncausally explains the GNN predictions via the optimized GNN-NCMs. Evaluation\nresults on multiple synthetic and real-world graphs validate that {\\name}\nsignificantly outperforms existing GNN explainers in exact groundtruth\nexplanation identification\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tlo2NasLGKDmatERAp7hTtJieYOhOranDburLy2sHF8","pdfSize":"6781720","objectId":"0xc16d2c2fbf573b076efd5b18ce2349c487fc029ed5ec8772e60bf665c17c9bca","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
