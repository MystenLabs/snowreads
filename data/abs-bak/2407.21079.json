It contains a\ndiscussion of the relevant background material for this subject. Furthermore,\nit introduces the problem of extending the Hitchin-Thorpe inequality to\ngradient shrinking Ricci soliton metrics and explores the limitations of\ncurrent results in that direction. At last, the topic of compact Kaehler\ngradient shrinking Ricci solitons is introduced and the classification of these\nspaces is outlined in literature-study fashion.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PYEN51Gf5_gQrCnVtB6YBDV9-eDA9bN2Hu-fqU_RRjA","pdfSize":"199756","objectId":"0x5168400aee2f059473248c2f57a6889a5c5eeade77887cf43253d1cbdd49e012","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
