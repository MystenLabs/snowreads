The presence of NSI\ncan invert the energy levels of neutrino matter eigenstates and even induce a\nnew resonance in the inner parts close to the proto-neutron star. We\ndemonstrate how DUNE can use these new configurations of energy levels to have\nsensitivity to NSIs down to $\\mathcal{O}(0.1)$. We also elucidate how the\neffect may result in a puzzling confusion of normal and inverted mass orderings\nby highlighting the emergence or vanishing of the neutronization peak, which\ndistinguishes between the two mass orderings. Potential implications are\nanalyzed thoroughly.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nKkxv_aaCY6IXz2eQTw5eirlKs5jtz3Ky6lUyFpZQz0","pdfSize":"1308110"}
