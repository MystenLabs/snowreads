New capabilities in AM\nceramics, silicon carbide infiltrated with silicon and fused silica, offer the\npossibility to combine the design benefits of AM with a material suitable for\nvisible, ultraviolet and X-ray applications. This paper will introduce the\nprinting methods and post-processing steps to convert AM ceramic samples into\nreflective mirrors. Surface roughness measurements after abrasive polishing of\nthe AM ceramics will be presented.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Pmiz1kUIbIt_-CPTrOFxkOzzVim_PWyIiPJE0A58KyQ","pdfSize":"9941608"}
