For a\nsemi-concave cost function bounded by $c_{\\infty}$ and a regularization\nparameter $\\lambda > 0$, we obtain exponential convergence guarantees on the\ndual sub-optimality gap with contraction rate polynomial in\n$\\lambda/c_{\\infty}$. This represents an exponential improvement over the known\ncontraction rate $1 - \\Theta(\\exp(-c_{\\infty}/\\lambda))$ achievable via\nHilbert's projective metric. Specifically, we prove a contraction rate value of\n$1-\\Theta(\\lambda^2/c_\\infty^2)$ when $\\mu$ has a bounded log-density. In some\ncases, such as when $\\mu$ is log-concave and the cost function is\n$c(x,y)=-\\langle x, y \\rangle$, this rate improves to\n$1-\\Theta(\\lambda/c_\\infty)$. The latter rate matches the one that we derive\nfor the transport between isotropic Gaussian measures, indicating tightness in\nthe dependency in $\\lambda/c_\\infty$. Our results are fully non-asymptotic and\nexplicit in all the parameters of the problem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"xaWVqitPqBoPNuvKowI5JAU4X5j5OHwqWyi9ADJwxCI","pdfSize":"438719","objectId":"0x140f5e1f52a5967f257060c05ace8bad40e353d38192736bb6a6c89853330590","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
