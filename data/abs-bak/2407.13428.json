Many ensuing applications rely on the fact that complicated\nspin models can be transformed to simpler ones. What is the structure of such\ntransformations? Here, we provide a framework to study and construct emulations\nbetween spin models. A spin model is a set of spin systems, and emulations are\nefficiently computable simulations with arbitrary energy cut-off, where a\nsource spin system simulates a target system if, below the cut-off, the target\nHamiltonian is encoded in the source Hamiltonian. We prove that emulations\npreserve important properties, as they induce reductions between computational\nproblems such as computing ground states, approximating partition functions and\napproximate sampling from Boltzmann distributions. Emulations are modular (they\ncan be added, scaled and composed), and allow for universality, i.e. certain\nspin models have maximal reach. We prove that a spin model is universal if and\nonly if it is scalable, closed and functional complete. Because the\ncharacterization is constructive, it provides a step-by-step guide to construct\nemulations. We prove that the 2d Ising model with fields is universal, for\nwhich we also provide two new crossing gadgets. Finally, we show that\nsimulations can be computed by linear programs. While some ideas of this work\nare contained in [1], we provide new definitions and theorems. This framework\nprovides a toolbox for applications involving emulations of spin models.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8TDLe52nd_6m-Z2hym24zPPQZ1ic67ss9Oxus2770dQ","pdfSize":"1902540","objectId":"0x144b1bda8e15820a7f14cb8f864c68e05134552ee11c1a986c33a71fdf8bbaef","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
