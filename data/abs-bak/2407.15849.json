Our approach distinguishes itself from\nexisting imitation learning methods by demanding fewer expert examples and\neliminating the need for information about the actions taken during the\ndemonstration. This is accomplished by introducing a new reward function and\nemploying a knowledge expansion technique. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nWayEx, our waypoint exploration strategy, across six diverse tasks, showcasing\nits applicability in various environments. Notably, our method significantly\nreduces training time by 50% as compared to traditional reinforcement learning\nmethods. WayEx obtains a higher reward than existing imitation learning methods\ngiven only a single demonstration. Furthermore, we demonstrate its success in\ntackling complex environments where standard approaches fall short.
