Under the same assumption, we deduce the\nHasse principle for quartic del Pezzo surfaces with trivial Brauer group and\nirreducible or completely split characteristic polynomial, hence the Hasse\nprinciple for smooth complete intersections of two quadrics in the projective\nspace of dimension at least 5.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jsgMHVg4FIZVtp-2dr0lTbSP1ctXSRvHb__q59vUeDg","pdfSize":"421294","objectId":"0x53ac55de119b8339be24814f40320f4c4252e9e3eaf0d045587ffe7e8d7eda00","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
