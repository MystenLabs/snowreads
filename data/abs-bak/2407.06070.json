Among others, we\nobtain a family of models indexed by a couple $(m,n)$, where $m$ and $n$ are\nnatural numbers constrained by hypergeometric behaviors and certain physical\nrequirements. Using the falsification scenario, we confront the derived models\nwith the Planck observational data for such a stringy rescaled gravity. Then,\nwe approach the associated swampland conjectures. For certain models of\nphenomenological interest, we find that the swampland criteria are satisfied\nfor small values of the slow-roll parameters in such a modified gravity.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"ZddFMybNiuz9WQMR4yHJURPrslo_QPLQXF4Kq1lp8ME","pdfSize":"1114221"}
