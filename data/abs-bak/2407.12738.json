In particular, light mediators coupling to the active neutrinos will\ninduce new decay modes of the Standard Model mesons (e.g., $\\pi^\\pm, K^\\pm \\to\n\\ell^\\pm + \\nu + \\phi$), charged leptons (e.g., $\\tau^\\pm \\to \\pi^\\pm + \\nu +\n\\phi$), and gauge bosons (e.g., $Z \\to \\nu + \\bar{\\nu} + \\phi$). A common lore\nis that these decays suffer from infrared divergences in the limit of the\nvanishing mediator mass, i.e., $m_\\phi \\to 0$. Here, we show for the first time\nthat including the 1-loop contributions of these mediators to the standard\n2-body decays (e.g., $\\pi^\\pm,\\,K^\\pm \\to \\ell^\\pm + \\nu$, etc.), the infrared\ndivergence from the 3-body decay cancels out exactly by virtue of the\nKinoshita-Lee-Nauenberg theorem. Including these cancellation effects, we then\nupdate the existing laboratory constraints on neutrinophilic scalar mediators,\nthereby extending the limits far beyond the decaying parent particle mass and\nexcluding a wider range of parameter space. These new \"physical\" limits derived\nhere have significant implications for the future detection prospects of\nnonstandard neutrino (self-)interactions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"y-C1Femik32fmR6i7WQxYvc7f_G1Z2GuAN8_1i2X7QM","pdfSize":"723793","objectId":"0xc858947a92d735feed676dc72afd8ce75d6378129ec374497f624b1e525b8383","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
