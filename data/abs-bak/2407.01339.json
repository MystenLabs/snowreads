However,\nwhether $\\chi^{(2)}$ is enhanced or reduced by tensile strain is a subject of\nconflicting reports. Here, we grow high-quality MoSe$_2$ monolayers under\ncontrolled biaxial strain created by two different substrates, and study their\nlinear and non-linear optical responses with a combination of experimental and\ntheoretical approaches. A 15-fold overall enhancement in second harmonic\ngeneration (SHG) intensity is observed on MoSe$_2$ monolayers grown on SiO$_2$\nwhen compared to its value when on a Si$_3$N$_4$ substrate. A seven-fold\nenhancement was ascertained to substrate interference, and a factor of two to\nthe enhancement of $\\chi^{(2)}$ arising from biaxial strain: substrate\ninterference and strain are independent handles to engineer the SHG strength of\nnon-centrosymmetric 2D materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Jj7aF1NUykasYRTgjYxHUs8RNKDJDUca3AoGZjJwo5Q","pdfSize":"15115063","objectId":"0x5b08095d8c1add1acee91733549ff40e3284edf294ba9e54c552ffd6fc29e004","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
