We calculate analytic\nscaling relationships as a function of gravitational-wave frequency for the\nstatistical variance, skewness, and kurtosis of a stochastic gravitational-wave\nsignal over population realizations due to finite source effects. If the time\nderivative of the binary orbital frequency can be expressed as a power-law in\nfrequency, we find that these moment quantities also take the form of power-law\nrelationships. We also develop a numerical population synthesis framework\nagainst which we compare our analytic results, finding excellent agreement.\nThese new scaling relationships provide physical context to understanding\nspectral fluctuations in a gravitational-wave background signal and may provide\nadditional information that can aid in explaining the origin of the\nnanohertz-frequency signal observed by pulsar timing array campaigns.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"i_dK9m7chopxDJroV9GTXmapOuNK9wnxvOgkfJSWj6E","pdfSize":"1061648"}
