Fully fine-tuning\ngeneral-purpose pre-trained models for REC yields impressive performance but\nbecomes increasingly costly. Parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL)\nmethods have shown strong performance with fewer tunable parameters. However,\napplying PETL to REC faces two challenges: (1) insufficient interaction between\npre-trained vision and language encoders, and (2) high GPU memory usage due to\ngradients passing through both heavy encoders. To address these issues, we\npresent M$^2$IST: Multi-Modal Interactive Side-Tuning with M$^3$ISAs: Mixture\nof Multi-Modal Interactive Side-Adapters. During fine-tuning, we keep the\npre-trained vision and language encoders fixed and update M$^3$ISAs on side\nnetworks to establish connections between them, thereby achieving parameter-\nand memory-efficient tuning for REC. Empirical results on three benchmarks show\nM$^2$IST achieves the best performance-parameter-memory trade-off compared to\nfull fine-tuning and other PETL methods, with only 3.14M tunable parameters\n(2.11% of full fine-tuning) and 15.44GB GPU memory usage (39.61% of full\nfine-tuning). Source code will soon be publicly available.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bNLLIXpi806gj32rEsSR4_BwT1MKYuEJ3J6gyFrY-fE","pdfSize":"1778479","objectId":"0x8fcee002252788ed7a0c9680a38caabde3b9f20d9c7c06fa9ae6b68047b1f097","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
