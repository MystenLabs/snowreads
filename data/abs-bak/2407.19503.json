However, due to its vector form, its signal spectrum is not as clear\nas that of the conventional OFDM. In this paper, we study the discrete spectrum\nof discrete VOFDM signals. We obtain a linear relationship between a vector of\ninformation symbols and a vector of the same size of components evenly\ndistributed in the discrete VOFDM signal spectrum, and show that if a vector of\ninformation symbols is set to 0, then a corresponding vector of the same size\nof the discrete VOFDM signal spectrum is 0 as well, where the components of the\n0 vector are not together but evenly distributed in the spectrum. With the\nlinear relationship, the information symbol vectors can be locally precoded so\nthat any of the discrete spectrum of VOFDM signals can be set to 0, similar to\nthat of the conventional OFDM signals. These results are verified by\nsimulations.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xx2W7tpSZoAEEp-RUzy2O9rgYgEL_ro6cal6-Vr1y3k","pdfSize":"130928","objectId":"0x5de743292b7bc12cb8bed419d206ef8be0b0f7691fa0bdb813f1fa59f96f6d87","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
