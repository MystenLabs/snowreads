Our\nmethod is based on splitting a matrix nearness problem into two nested\noptimization problems, of which the inner one can be solved either exactly or\ncheaply, while the outer one can be recast as an unconstrained optimization\ntask over a smooth real Riemannian manifold. We observe that this paradigm\napplies to many matrix nearness problems of practical interest appearing in the\nliterature, thus revealing that they are equivalent in this sense to a\nRiemannian optimization problem. We also show that the objective function to be\nminimized on the Riemannian manifold can be discontinuous, thus requiring\nregularization techniques, and we give conditions for this to happen. Finally,\nwe demonstrate the practical applicability of our method by implementing it for\na number of matrix nearness problems that are relevant for applications and are\ncurrently considered very demanding in practice. Extensive numerical\nexperiments demonstrate that our method often greatly outperforms its\npredecessors, including algorithms specifically designed for those particular\nproblems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"W9a2P5Lvqi-IPvrYifaOUuZAD6raRioZg8fd-VftJig","pdfSize":"502241"}
