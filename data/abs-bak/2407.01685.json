We image 1.4 GHz (L-band) and 3 GHz\n(S-band) continuum using the VLA and 1.2 mm (band 6) continuum with ALMA, in\naddition to the CO(7-6) and CI(${\\rm ^3P_2\\rightarrow ^3\\!P_1}$) lines, all at\n$\\lesssim1.^{\\prime\\prime}7$ resolution. Based on the VLA integrated flux\ndensities, we decompose the radio spectrum into its free-free (FF) and\nnon-thermal components. The infrared-radio correlation (IRRC) parameter $q_{\\rm\nTIR}=2.65_{-0.31}^{+0.24}$ is consistent with expectations for star forming\ngalaxies. We obtain radio continuum-derived SFRs that are free of dust\nextinction, finding $\\rm {620}_{-220}^{+280}\\,M_\\odot\\,yr^{-1}$, $\\rm\n{230}_{-160}^{+570}\\,M_\\odot\\,yr^{-1}$, and $\\rm\n{280}_{-120}^{+460}\\,M_\\odot\\,yr^{-1}$ from the FF emission, non-thermal\nemission, and when accounting for both emission processes, respectively, in\nagreement with previous results. We estimate the gas mass from the CI(${\\rm\n^3P_2\\rightarrow ^3\\!P_1}$) line as $M_{\\rm\ngas}=(1.2\\pm0.2)\\times10^{11}\\,M_\\odot$, which is consistent with prior\nCO(1-0)-derived gas masses. Using our new IR and radio continuum data to map\nthe SFR, we assess the dependence of the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation on choices\nof SFR and gas tracer for $\\sim{\\rm kpc}$ scales. The different SFR tracers\nyield different slopes, with the IR being the steepest, potentially due to\nhighly obscured star formation in J0901. The radio continuum maps have the\nlowest slopes and overall fidelity for mapping the SFR, despite producing\nconsistent total SFRs. We also find that the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation slope\nis flattest when using CO(7-6) or CI(${\\rm ^3P_2\\rightarrow ^3\\!P_1}$) to trace\ngas mass, suggesting that those transitions are not suitable for tracing the\nbulk molecular gas in galaxies like J0901.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lvunoXQXth-LpAlaeSrdQzdR2hFDXwleLivVR_wHJGE","pdfSize":"40915625","objectId":"0x84ddfacfac978423b10016731d865837106c3f89ec6ddc58b2e23708683ec3e3","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
