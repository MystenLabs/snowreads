The OCP is solved numerically using the Pseudospectral\ncollocation method. Our approach leverages a path identified through Lazy\nTheta* and incorporates known constraints and a model of the UAV's behavior for\nthe initial guess. Our findings indicate that a suitable initial guess has a\nbeneficial influence on the planned trajectory. They also suggest promising\ndirections for future research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"6eeIs6jqVU7gubEzO-42BGLVq7IaHSUKAHWU6kBkfyI","pdfSize":"1999249","objectId":"0xdd2b87c1334b13dc79791349218ad5d433ff7fc6b52aa4e56ebb413b6694cd4c","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
