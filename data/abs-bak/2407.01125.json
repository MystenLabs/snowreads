We consider the LLBar and the regularised\nLLBloch equations in a unified manner, thus allowing us to treat the numerical\napproximations for both problems at once. In this paper, we propose a\nsemi-discrete mixed finite element scheme and two fully discrete mixed finite\nelement schemes based on a semi-implicit Euler method and a semi-implicit\nCrank--Nicolson method to solve the problems. These numerical schemes provide\naccurate approximations to both the magnetisation vector and the effective\nmagnetic field. Moreover, they are proven to be unconditionally energy-stable\nand preserve energy dissipativity of the system at the discrete level. Error\nanalysis is performed which shows optimal rates of convergence in\n$\\mathbb{L}^2$, $\\mathbb{L}^\\infty$, and $\\mathbb{H}^1$ norms. These\ntheoretical results are further corroborated by several numerical experiments.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6EemuwxpkrIGalWrQnbCZrQvSgD5jQD8CsmQ1s7OD_w","pdfSize":"2658159","objectId":"0xfa5b702c6cb7e2553321db009e55f63062ba2052063d94a956854cf2a07eb1c6","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
