The theory is formulated as\nan initial value problem (IVP) for an associated Frobenius integrability\ncondition on a Lie algebra. It is showed that this IVP has a formal solution\nand within the framewrok of two particular subalgebras of the hereditary Lie\nalgebra the explicit forms of this formal solution are presented. Finally, this\nformalism is applied to Korteveg-de Vries, dispersive water waves and\nAblowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur soliton hierarchies.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mggI6ZfAPcP57TLIX0RAgLo-nv0wy3y6fVaZrTDgwjo","pdfSize":"348069","objectId":"0xc813a472e2c2255d609ed7b62a61e6c745740304b39baa3537cbb0865cd83275","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
