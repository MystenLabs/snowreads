To expand language\nrepresentation, we synthesize code-switching data by replacing intonation units\ndetected through PSST, a speech segmentation model fine-tuned from OpenAI's\nWhisper, using a speech-to-text translation dataset, CoVoST 2. With our\ndataset, CoVoSwitch, spanning 13 languages, we evaluate the code-switching\ntranslation performance of two multilingual translation models, M2M-100 418M\nand NLLB-200 600M. We reveal that the inclusion of code-switching units results\nin higher translation performance than monolingual settings and that models are\nbetter at code-switching translation into English than non-English. Further,\nlow-resource languages gain most from integration of code-switched units when\ntranslating into English but much less when translating into non-English.\nTranslations into low-resource languages also perform worse than even raw\ncode-switched inputs. We find that systems excel at copying English tokens but\nstruggle with non-English tokens, that the off-target problem in monolingual\nsettings is also relevant in code-switching settings, and that models\nhallucinate in code-switching translation by introducing words absent in both\nof the original source sentences.
