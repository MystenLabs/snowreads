Given the many ongoing and planned future developments,\nthe time is ripe to review and reflect on the state of AI in social care. We do\nso by conducting semi-structured interviews with UK-based social work\nprofessionals about their experiences and opinions of past and current AI\nsystems. Our aim is to understand what systems would practitioners like to see\ndeveloped and how. We find that all our interviewees had overwhelmingly\nnegative past experiences of technology in social care, unanimous aversion to\nalgorithmic decision systems in particular, but also strong interest in AI\napplications that could allow them to spend less time on administrative tasks.\nIn response to our findings, we offer a series of concrete recommendations,\nwhich include commitment to participatory design, as well as the necessity of\nregaining practitioner trust.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AQcwm2hlL_wRFi0e9iCtb7Wz2Xo5e3_D7QdavWcbku4","pdfSize":"267826","objectId":"0x9244be13b0aa8e61626975c2df07c558908ca3e29c620e02aa3c2d60a1ee2dbf","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
