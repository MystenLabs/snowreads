While a control\nAlN thin film exhibits standard capacitive behavior, distinct ferroelectric\nswitching is observed in the AlBN films with increasing Boron mole fraction.\nThe measured remnant polarization Pr of 15 uC/cm2 and coercive field Ec of 1.45\nMV/cm in these films are smaller than those recently reported on films\ndeposited by sputtering, due to incomplete wake-up, limited by current leakage.\nBecause AlBN preserves the ultrawide energy bandgap of AlN compared to other\nnitride hi-K dielectrics and ferroelectrics, and it can be epitaxially\nintegrated with GaN and AlN semiconductors, its development will enable several\nopportunities for unique electronic, photonic, and memory devices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"S6Xgy205Utwltt3Um10NO7eHG8EN8-oits1vWdg8Ch4","pdfSize":"2443279","objectId":"0xcfaec0ce2eefdb0a010b68eafff6115d30d9833cea4cc2d33423fea0fcec09c5","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
