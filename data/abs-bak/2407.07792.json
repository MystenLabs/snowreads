This\ntheory is a healthy extension of GR which displays the feature of massive\ntensor modes, without additional polarizations, strong-coupling issues nor\nrequiring screening mechanisms. We proceed by implementing a newly developed\ntechnique that, instead of considering a second-order Schr\\\"odinger-like\nreformulation of perturbation equations, relies on a first-order formulation\nand solves it asymptotically, before numerically deriving the quasi-normal\nmodes. We find that the black holes of MTMG are stable, and that their\nquasi-normal modes smoothly differ from the GR ones, for non-vanishing values\nof the graviton mass. This work hence confirms the fact that GR is a smooth\nlimit of MTMG, and opens the exciting possibility of a clean test, performed\nfor instance by the LISA detector.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9z7gACmmvOdSn6BnNrxaRU1QdvjOHjJIo2AK4RTh3II","pdfSize":"679392","objectId":"0xa0808554d20f2f63c590e7602af67032acbdde0f70aafbcee908fd1dbf5d06e3","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
