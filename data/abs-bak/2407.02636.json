The available prior art has\npredominantly focused on XR applications with constrained user mobility and\nlimited impact on mmWave channels. We have performed dedicated experiments to\nextend the characterisation of relevant future XR use cases featuring a high\ndegree of user mobility. To this end, we have carried out a tailor-made\nmeasurement campaign and conducted a characterisation of the collected tracking\ndata, including the approximation of the data using statistical distributions.\nMoreover, we have provided an interpretation of the possible impact of the\nrecorded mobility on mmWave technology. The dataset is made publicly accessible\nto provide a testing ground for wireless system design and to enable further XR\nmobility modelling.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"knFpENx009x4sQlnu4zrweukAc3C_03twXd74OisxKk","pdfSize":"1300994","objectId":"0x1369f5c2989dc5bd015221cc3109abf03de2dda4c58109aed86b881417ac8dd3","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
