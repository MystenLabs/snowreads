The B.\nand F. Delyon norm $\\|\\cdot\\|_{\\mathrm{bfd}}$ on the space $\\mathrm{Hol}(E)$ of\nholomorphic functions on $E$ is defined by $$ \\|f\\|_{\\mathrm{bfd}}\n\\stackrel{\\rm def}{=} \\sup_{T\\in \\mathcal{F}_{\\mathrm {bfd}}(E)}\\|f(T)\\|, $$\nwhere $\\mathcal{F}_{\\mathrm {bfd}}(E)$ is the class of operators $T$ such that\nthe closure of the numerical range of $T$ is contained in $E$. The name of the\nnorm recognizes a celebrated theorem of the brothers Delyon, which implies that\n$\\|\\cdot\\|_{\\mathrm{bfd}}$ is equivalent to the supremum norm\n$\\|\\cdot\\|_\\infty$ on $\\mathrm{Hol}(E)$.\n  The purpose of this paper is to develop the theory of holomorphic functions\nof bfd-norm less than or equal to one on $E$. To do so we shall employ a\nremarkable connection between the bfd norm on $\\mathrm{Hol}(E)$ and the\nsupremum norm $\\|\\cdot\\|_\\infty$ on the space $\\mathrm{H}^\\infty(G)$ of bounded\nholomorphic functions on the symmetrized bidisc, the domain $G$ in\n$\\mathbb{C}^2$ defined by \\begin{align*} G & \\stackrel{\\rm def}{=} \\{(z+w,zw):\n|z|<1, |w|<1\\}. \\end{align*} It transpires that there exists a holomorphic\nembedding $\\tau:E \\to G$ having the property that, for any bounded holomorphic\nfunction $f$ on $E$, \\[ \\|f\\|_{\\mathrm{bfd}} = \\inf\\{\\|F\\|_\\infty: F \\in\n{\\mathrm H}^\\infty(G), F\\circ\\tau=f\\}, \\] and moreover, the infimum is attained\nat some $F \\in \\mathrm{H}^\\infty(G)$. This result allows us to derive, for\nholomorphic functions of bfd-norm at most one on $E$, analogs of the well-known\nmodel and realization formulae for Schur-class functions. We also give a second\nderivation of these models and realizations, which exploits the Zhukovskii\nmapping from an annulus onto $E$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"y365KK4fr0csop6GO4wtbvgyFRJIXTgBctTTIejHdYk","pdfSize":"257244"}
