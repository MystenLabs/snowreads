It allows for an entirely\ngeometrical description of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem and v-representability.\nThe phenomena receive exemplification by an Anderson impurity model and other\nsmall-lattice examples. The case of adiabatic change and the time-dependent\nsetting are examined as well.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KZM-3_e8XOSb-4krcmgqPiYmkQoZCRq0SWa3Xm8Nx28","pdfSize":"1556636","objectId":"0x7e1cc6464823bdbe1a3c00cbe8666d0bd763129e48fbd2556c6ab433fe994a93","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
