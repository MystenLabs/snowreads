Combining results of\nSchauenburg and Negron, it is shown that every quasi-split finite-dimensional\nHopf algebra satisfies the finite generation cohomology conjecture of Etingof\nand Ostrik. This is applied to a family of pointed Hopf algebras in odd\ncharacteristic introduced by Angiono, Heckenberger and the first author,\nproving that they satisfy the aforementioned conjecture.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XhL7lixiBbErw37Y-57HDtTjPxPrLdMpiQk-9pq1JVU","pdfSize":"422222"}
