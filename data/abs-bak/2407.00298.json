The higher-rank\ngraphs we consider arise from double-covers of cube complexes. By considering\nthe real and complex $K$-theory together, we are able to carry these\ncomputations much further than might be possible considering complex $K$-theory\nalone. As these algebras are classified by $K$-theory, we are able to\ncharacterize the isomorphism classes of the graph algebras in terms of the\ncombinatorial and number-theoretic properties of the construction ingredients.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gQe2e-KKGrKn7wSMbZKzHpq8mtRQhNpdnxvXc458sx8","pdfSize":"483576","objectId":"0xefda80e2f11dbf006c9f12822177f667d0822faec1cf63a392795d26854de185","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
