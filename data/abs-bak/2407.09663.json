The solutions obtained\nhere have the important property that the associated closed time-like curves\nare always restricted to a compact domain of space-time. We compare this\nproperty with those of analogous solutions in General Relativity (GR).\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"l_QdQIq7yasYX-aRuCU4zxc9eLIY3je4KMZGRfutOvg","pdfSize":"89678","objectId":"0x06c89d294ebcccbec6f6bed0758d808bfbe9ea3a62ba5dc1160a7c7b1e1ab8dd","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
