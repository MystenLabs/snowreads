In\nthis opportunity, we present our project to study three edge-on galaxies,\ncandidates to show extraplanar emission at radio wavelengths. We will describe\nthe criteria followed in selecting the sample and the software developed to\ndetect the presence of the wind. Besides, we will discuss the next steps of\nthis project.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nkYFHfIGo0XC0U2Yg6ts_qwd1Ho4s1uRXbyMzElr3YM","pdfSize":"533262","objectId":"0xe0ece8895b9461fd3c34333296645ffb25043ff1174a70badb2bb363c982d676","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
