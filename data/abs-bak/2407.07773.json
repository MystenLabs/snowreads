However, it seems that the complexity of computing capacity-achieving\ncodes has not been investigated until now. We study this question for the\nsimplest non-trivial Gaussian channels, i.e., the additive colored Gaussian\nnoise channel. To assess the computational complexity, we consider the classes\n$\\mathrm{FP}_1$ and $\\#\\mathrm{P}_1$. $\\mathrm{FP}_1$ includes functions\ncomputable by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time, whereas\n$\\#\\mathrm{P}_1$ encompasses functions that count the number of solutions\nverifiable in polynomial time. It is widely assumed that\n$\\mathrm{FP}_1\\neq\\#\\mathrm{P}_1$. It is of interest to determine the\nconditions under which, for a given $M \\in \\mathbb{N}$, where $M$ describes the\nprecision of the deviation of $C(P,N)$, for a certain blocklength $n_M$ and a\ndecoding error $\\epsilon > 0$ with $\\epsilon\\in\\mathbb{Q}$, the following\nholds: $R_{n_M}(\\epsilon)>C(P,N)-\\frac{1}{2^M}$. It is shown that there is a\npolynomial-time computable $N_*$ such that for sufficiently large\n$P_*\\in\\mathbb{Q}$, the sequences $\\{R_{n_M}(\\epsilon)\\}_{{n_M}\\in\\mathbb{N}}$,\nwhere each $R_{n_M}(\\epsilon)$ satisfies the previous condition, cannot be\ncomputed in polynomial time if $\\mathrm{FP}_1\\neq\\#\\mathrm{P}_1$. Hence, the\ncomplexity of computing the sequence $\\{R_{n_M}(\\epsilon)\\}_{n_M\\in\\mathbb{N}}$\ngrows faster than any polynomial as $M$ increases. Consequently, it is shown\nthat either the sequence of achievable rates\n$\\{R_{n_M}(\\epsilon)\\}_{n_M\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ as a function of the blocklength, or\nthe sequence of blocklengths $\\{n_M\\}_{M\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ corresponding to the\nachievable rates, is not a polynomial-time computable sequence.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"dH0hjvkkkEGESyd7anrv4tg5HkI-N0TWOjPWacbjtSo","pdfSize":"3239231","objectId":"0x652cc0768d379b0cf68ed1e2a6b3cc26d05191e482be26e92783a388639f7068","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
