In two spatial dimensions this is illustrated by the Chern-Simons\nflux-attachment mechanism, but such a mechanism is not possible in lower\ndimensions. Here, we study a one-dimensional interacting Bose gas in the\npresence of a gauge field. This model can be explicitly mapped into an\ninteracting anyonic system by a large gauge transformation, indicating a\nstatistical transmutation analogous to that of Chern-Simons. The Bogoliubov\nspectrum in the weakly-interacting limit reveals the presence of a roton\nminimum arising from the statistical interaction. At a mean-field level chiral\nsolitons are recovered. Should these be understood as quantum bound states, it\nis natural to interpret them as corresponding to localised anyonic\nquasiparticles. Hydrodynamic arguments highlight the presence of dispersive\nchiral shock waves in the propagation of a wavepacket due to a Riemann-Hopf\nnonlinearity. Numerical calculations show the presence of both chiral soliton\ntrains and shock waves.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WA_gw_rmiMG7RWpZfWQviPW8jnudEGYlM7gTD6jRrTo","pdfSize":"1351773"}
