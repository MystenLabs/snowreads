While large language\nmodel (LLM)-based fMRI encoding has shown promise, existing studies\npredominantly focus on healthy, young adults, overlooking older NCD populations\nand cognitive level correlations. This paper explores language-related\nfunctional changes in older NCD adults using LLM-based fMRI encoding and brain\nscores, addressing current limitations. We analyze the correlation between\nbrain scores and cognitive scores at both whole-brain and language-related ROI\nlevels. Our findings reveal that higher cognitive abilities correspond to\nbetter brain scores, with correlations peaking in the middle temporal gyrus.\nThis study highlights the potential of fMRI encoding models and brain scores\nfor detecting early functional changes in NCD patients.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1Eqm1ofLOYXylV7nJQSlkhZ1uTmuk3dhEqM7rKQ-Uwc","pdfSize":"705005","objectId":"0x05c7a66194edfaec935f4dde56bacc7feaf2c3f29cc2083086cf36de2097b7ee","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
