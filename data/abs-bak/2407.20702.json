The state constraint is given by an\nL2 functional in space, which is required to fulfill a pointwise bound in time.\nThe discretization scheme for the Stokes equations consists of inf-sup stable\nfinite elements in space and a discontinuous Galerkin method in time, for which\nwe have recently established best approximation type error estimates. Using\nthese error estimates, for the discrete control problem we establish error\nestimates and as a by-product we show an improved regularity for the optimal\ncontrol. We complement our theoretical analysis with numerical results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ex7H5DPSolVsFTFTKzbZCumzj3qTtpUF3j2Wi0YiQRs","pdfSize":"581514","objectId":"0xa2d61f1f1a992c29c28f970e9de8bc7c1b441144a605d300939842e6bfbcea1e","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
