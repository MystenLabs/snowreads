This\nsystem has long been suspected to belong to the emerging class of massive\nrecycled pulsar-ONeMg white dwarf systems such as PSR J2222$-$0137, PSR\nJ1528$-$3146 and J1439$-$5501. Here we present an updated emission and timing\nanalysis with more than 11 years of combined Parkes and MeerKAT data, including\n19 hours of high-frequency data from the newly installed MeerKAT S-band\nreceivers. We measure a scattering timescale of 1.22 ms at 1 GHz with a flat\nscattering index 3.33<$\\beta$<3.62, and a mean flux density of 0.53-0.62 mJy at\n1 GHz with a steep spectral index 2.06<$\\alpha$<2.35. Around 15% of the\nemission is linearly and circularly polarised, but the polarisation angle does\nnot follow the rotating vector model. Thanks to the sensitivity of MeerKAT, we\nsuccessfully measure a rate of periastron advance of 0.0171(11) deg/yr, and a\nShapiro delay with an orthometric amplitude of 3.6$\\pm$0.5 $\\mu$s and an\northometric shape of 0.85$\\pm$0.05. The main source of uncertainty in our\ntiming analysis is chromatic correlated dispersion measure noise, which we\nmodel as a power law in the Fourier space thanks to the large frequency\ncoverage provided by the Parkes UWL receiver. Assuming general relativity and\naccounting for the measurements across all the implemented timing noise models,\nthe total mass, companion mass, pulsar mass and inclination angle are\nconstrained at 2.3<Mt/$M_\\odot$<3.2, 1.21<Mc/$M_\\odot$<1.47,\n1.16<Mp/$M_\\odot$<1.69 and 77.5<i/deg<80.3. We also constrain the longitude of\nascending node to either 266$\\pm$78 deg or 86$\\pm$78 deg. We argue against a\nneutron star nature of the companion based on the very low orbital eccentric of\nthe system (e=1.15e-3), and instead classify the companion of PSR J1227-6208 as\na rare, massive ONeMg white dwarf close to the Chandrasekhar limit.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wnQycYOGNgNMd72qFcbeNQZNtCIGe8bHHocgD5qG0jY","pdfSize":"1676314","objectId":"0x03a17ddc037b5c114c22681bfd4de6a08b66cf8335774e1fa6ca251d428cb0a0","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
