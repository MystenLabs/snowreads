With respect to srs-C8 characterized by trigonal C(sp$^2$),\nyne-C$_{16}$ is identified with original C -- C triple bond-like units and\ndistorted tetrahedra. The new allotrope is qualified with unknown topology. At\nthe elementary building unit, C$_{16}$ looks like a pyramidal molecule such as\n:PCl3, with \":\" symbolizing the phosphorous lone pair. With this\nconceptualization C$_{16}$ has three bond pairs (SIGMA-like) making the pyramid\nbase and the C(triple-bond)C with large PI character resembling phosphorous\nelectron lone pair (:) at the apex of the pyramid. The new allotrope was found\ncohesive and stable both mechanically (positive elastic constants) as well as\ndynamically (phonons band structure). C$_{16}$ is characterized with a weakly\nmetallic character.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ScI926uYwsKiHQbjEFsUV-K4NuJ-SVgs5h7kyRAFPLU","pdfSize":"669076","objectId":"0x204fa3d244afb8a7780d506de5a26f437bd61511779bdafda496fbfcdd7102a8","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
