Compounded by the scarcity of legal\nexperts, there's an urgent need to enhance the efficiency of traditional legal\nworkflows. Recent advances in deep learning, especially Large Language Models\n(LLMs), offer promising solutions to this challenge. Leveraging LLMs'\nmathematical reasoning capabilities, we propose a novel approach integrating\nLLM-based methodologies with specially designed prompts to address precision\nrequirements in legal Artificial Intelligence (LegalAI) applications. The\nproposed work seeks to bridge the gap between traditional legal practices and\nmodern technological advancements, paving the way for a more accessible,\nefficient, and equitable legal system. To validate this method, we introduce a\ncurated dataset tailored to precision-oriented LegalAI tasks, serving as a\nbenchmark for evaluating LLM-based approaches. Extensive experimentation\nconfirms the efficacy of our methodology in generating accurate numerical\nestimates within the legal domain, emphasizing the role of LLMs in streamlining\nlegal processes and meeting the evolving demands of LegalAI.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"W59cbqDn5X_Du0Kgwq77ecJUQCn7H8-3N-j-YmG67qU","pdfSize":"3478083","objectId":"0xda0efe899fe34073124437a835358c7c1d990b545755c5b4afce41e33adb5752","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
