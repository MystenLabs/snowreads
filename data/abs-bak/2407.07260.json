For all objects, we obtained the period\nspectra and performed a seismological analysis using full evolutionary models\nto estimate the structural parameters, such as effective temperature, stellar\nmass, and hydrogen envelope mass. The median stellar mass for the pulsators\nfrom asteroseismology is 0.609 Msun, in agreement with the median value from\nphotometric and spectroscopic determinations, 0.602 Msun, excluding the low and\nextremely-low mass objects. Finally, we found rotational-splitting multiplets\nfor 9 stars, which led to rotation periods between 4 h and 1 d.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aLtyWWtbvTnN0jfx6XI4LzTigtHZYnXzRNdfT6YEefw","pdfSize":"1120519"}
