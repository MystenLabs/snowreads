We propose a variational autoencoder\n(VAE)-based alignment model in which a probable path is searched using encoded\nacoustic and linguistic embeddings in an unsupervised manner. Our proposed\nmodel is based on one TTS alignment (OTA) and extended to obtain phoneme\nboundaries. Specifically, we incorporate a VAE architecture to maintain\nconsistency between the embedding and input, apply gradient annealing to avoid\nlocal optimum during training, and introduce a self-supervised learning\n(SSL)-based acoustic-feature input and state-level linguistic unit to utilize\nrich and detailed information. Experimental results show that the proposed\nmodel generated phoneme boundaries closer to annotated ones compared with the\nconventional OTA model, the CTC-based segmentation model, and the widely-used\ntool MFA.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Sound"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"7DJ6sU0mZaRJ4QkrrmGWG06FbDFD_cBlPExfjJSVAzQ","pdfSize":"240640","objectId":"0xb10ddb15724ca1837328bd458656fdafbb68a1a72515c5ff115334d6da56c7f7","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
