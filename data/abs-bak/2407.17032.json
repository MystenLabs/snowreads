Its main contribution is a central abstraction for wide\ninteroperability between benchmark environments and training algorithms.\nGymnasium comes with various built-in environments and utilities to simplify\nresearchers' work along with being supported by most training libraries. This\npaper outlines the main design decisions for Gymnasium, its key features, and\nthe differences to alternative APIs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HQv4gqo519BbM5qCmQH7tT_urIeoEHQO7CqD-vZaLPM","pdfSize":"563540","objectId":"0x29a60f87bf0dd5e2ef1c71bdb544b4fc0944e2e57c978d2d57ebf8ac80ff9268","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
