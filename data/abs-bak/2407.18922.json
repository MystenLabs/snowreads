One of the most important fields is neuron dynamics, as\nsynchronization in certain regions of the brain is related to some of the most\ncommon mental illnesses. In this work, we study synchronization in a\nsmall-world network of non-identical Chialvo neurons that are electrically\ncoupled. We introduce a mismatch in one of the model parameters to construct\nnon-identical neurons. Our study examines the effects of this parameter\nmismatch, the noise intensity in the stochastic model, and the coupling\nstrength between neurons on synchronization and firing frequency. We have\nidentified critical values of noise intensity, parameter mismatch, and rewiring\nprobability that facilitate effective synchronization within the network.\nFurthermore, we observe that the balance between excitatory and inhibitory\nconnections plays a crucial role in achieving global synchronization. Our\nfindings offer insights into the mechanisms driving synchronization dynamics in\ncomplex neuron networks.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7tSV-7dzPSVRVkwCHRAg6WktCcf_YyY2vVT1magXjlo","pdfSize":"2783369","objectId":"0x002c061acdd940e10383e7e9d2978815d628892f0f2420c28fef0f0ce49ae30f","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
