However, the\nlocalization method using external measurement devices has limitations in urban\nenvironments. Furthermore, if the sensor mount exhibits changes due to\nenvironmental influences, they cannot be corrected when the measurement is\nperformed only during the installation. In this paper, we propose\nself-localization of roadside radar data using Extended Object Tracking (EOT).\nThe method analyses both the tracked trajectories of the vehicles observed by\nthe sensor and the aerial laser scan of city streets, assigns labels of driving\nbehaviors such as \"straight ahead\", \"left turn\", \"right turn\" to trajectory\nsections and road segments, and performs Semantic Iterative Closest Points\n(SICP) algorithm to register the point cloud. The method exploits the result\nfrom a down stream task -- object tracking -- for localization. We demonstrate\nhigh accuracy in the sub-meter range along with very low orientation error. The\nmethod also shows good data efficiency. The evaluation is done in both\nsimulation and real-world tests.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"BOweJyxwSIlhUlG-CoB5q-NtSW8XC50S9FOasDOwQVE","pdfSize":"3025362"}
