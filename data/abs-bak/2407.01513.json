Here, we show that this\nspin splitting can induce pair density wave states even in the absence of\nexternal magnetic fields. Focusing on BCS-type attractive interactions, we find\nthe stabilization of symmetrically distinct pair density wave states depending\non the chemical potential. These states include Fulde-Ferrell and\nFulde-Ferrell* states, both of which break inversion symmetry. We investigate\nthe supercurrent properties and discover non-reciprocal supercurrents for both\nthe Fulde-Ferrell and Fulde-Ferrell* states with distinct spatial dependencies.\nWe propose that the supercurrent diode effect can serve as an experimental tool\nfor distinguishing between different pair density waves in metallic\naltermagnets and discuss the relation to material candidates.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aTtUDK5bRDmspi1gWnvZcR2MYi0b_HSAi615tj_H4cM","pdfSize":"1687208","objectId":"0x485d9632b28a4c323da75dd16c6193bce18be198b4c0bbd2d5395daee5194a46","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
