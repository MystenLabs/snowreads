The approach uses a two-layer mixture of\nfinite mixtures model where the cluster distributions are approximated using\nlatent class analysis models. A careful specification of priors with suitable\nhyperparameter values is crucial to identify the two-layer structure and obtain\na parsimonious cluster solution. We outline the Bayesian estimation based on\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo sampling with the telescoping sampler and describe how\nto obtain an identified clustering model by resolving the label switching\nissue. Empirical demonstrations in a simulation study using artificial data as\nwell as a data set on low back pain indicate the good clustering performance of\nthe proposed approach, provided hyperparameters are selected which induce\nsufficient shrinkage.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QV6CxVVYQORUhtFvTYvHoJGF7MfOmR1MWUh3fb-oxGQ","pdfSize":"1351099"}
