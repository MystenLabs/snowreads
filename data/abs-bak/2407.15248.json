Driven by increasing\ninterest from AI and business sectors, we highlight the need for transparency\nin LLMs. We examine the dual paths in current LLM research and eXplainable\nArtificial Intelligence (XAI): enhancing performance through XAI and the\nemerging focus on model interpretability. Our paper advocates for a balanced\napproach that values interpretability equally with functional advancements.\nRecognizing the rapid development in LLM research, our survey includes both\npeer-reviewed and preprint (arXiv) papers, offering a comprehensive overview of\nXAI's role in LLM research. We conclude by urging the research community to\nadvance both LLM and XAI fields together.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iYzroqdkujdwdPnSCqCd_jCz0fbzRbYx4Sm0TlW5bC8","pdfSize":"565391","objectId":"0x99df6e7352c2ad844418ab319d928c08cb3b37183d2811692667f723074e45fb","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
