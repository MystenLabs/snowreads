However, non-negligible\nnoise present in the CEUS images can make localising MBs challenging. To\nenhance the MB localisation performance, we propose a Multi-Frame Deconvolution\n(MF-Decon) framework that can exploit the spatiotemporal coherence inherent in\nthe CEUS data, with new spatial and temporal regularisers designed based on\ntotal variation (TV) and regularisation by denoising (RED). Based on the\nMF-Decon framework, we introduce two novel methods: MF-Decon with spatial and\ntemporal TVs (MF-Decon+3DTV) and MF-Decon with spatial RED and temporal TV\n(MF-Decon+RED+TV). Results from in silico simulations indicate that our methods\noutperform two widely used methods using deconvolution or normalised\ncross-correlation across all evaluation metrics, including precision, recall,\n$F_1$ score, mean and standard localisation errors. In particular, our methods\nimprove MB localisation precision by up to 39% and recall by up to 12%.\nSuper-resolution microvasculature maps generated with our methods on a publicly\navailable in vivo rat brain dataset show less noise, better contrast, higher\nresolution and more vessel structures.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"2kM1n0PvlXtCGg1uKlZFKwXlv-zUPdZh6loJLCD9-Ss","pdfSize":"45263125"}
