This new model extends the classic stochastic\nblock model with vector-valued nodal information, and finds applications in\nreal-world networks whose nodal information could be functional curves.\nExamples include international trade data in which a network vertex (country)\nis associated with the annual or quarterly GDP over certain time period, and\nMyFitnessPal data in which a network vertex (MyFitnessPal user) is associated\nwith daily calorie information measured over certain time period. Two\nstatistical tasks will be jointly executed. First, we will detect community\nstructures of the network vertices assisted by the functional nodal\ninformation. Second, we propose computationally efficient variational test to\nexamine the significance of the functional nodal information. We show that the\ncommunity detection algorithms achieve weak and strong consistency, and the\nvariational test is asymptotically chi-square with diverging degrees of\nfreedom. As a byproduct, we propose pointwise confidence intervals for the slop\nfunction of the functional nodal information. Our methods are examined through\nboth simulated and real datasets.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"6VqIqhW0vH-bSGpBC4gUFFIOrIeFl7A1PGG9aud3Au0","pdfSize":"699792","objectId":"0xd621a05ffe87cc3c0d15b96bbd1314c5e880170d9c74fa0a9d96041ebf65cf88","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
