The primary motivation for using\n3D-rendered facial images lies in their ability to circumvent the challenges\nassociated with collecting large real face datasets for training FR systems.\nThese images are generated entirely by 3D rendering engines, facilitating the\ngeneration of synthetic identities. However, it has been observed that FR\nsystems trained on such synthetic datasets underperform when compared to those\ntrained on real datasets, on various FR benchmarks. In this work, we\ndemonstrate that by transferring the realism to 3D-rendered images (i.e.,\nmaking the 3D-rendered images look more real), we can boost the performance of\nFR systems trained on these more photorealistic images. This improvement is\nevident when these systems are evaluated against FR benchmarks utilizing\nreal-world data, thereby paving new pathways for employing synthetic data in\nreal-world applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xol-izbMWvnfKfy-MxlwLjsF0Syr8uoMXT1eng6SnsU","pdfSize":"2455400","objectId":"0x42890354930144b0eea6d807e937edfe5c6a48fda2dc3b5fe682df826a96a8a1","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
