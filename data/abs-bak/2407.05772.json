Constructing and using\nthese quasi-interpolants, we consider wavelet and compression-type\napproximations from their linear spaces and provide convergence estimates. The\nresults include an error estimate for nonlinear approximation by\nquasi-interpolation, results about compression in the space of continuous\nfunctions and a pointwise convergence estimate for approximands of low\nsmoothness.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0vbZ-nx0fyHtDxwUqDupmegAn54pB-QHvJC_dd7OA7s","pdfSize":"267803"}
