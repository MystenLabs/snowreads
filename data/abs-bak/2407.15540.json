This achieves high compression\nbut leads to performance drop due to information loss. To address the memory\nperformance trade-off, we train a light-weight scene-specific auto-encoder\nnetwork that performs descriptor quantization-dequantization in an end-to-end\ndifferentiable manner updating both product quantization centroids and network\nparameters through back-propagation. In addition to optimizing the network for\ndescriptor reconstruction, we encourage it to preserve the descriptor-matching\nperformance with margin-based metric loss functions. Results show that for a\nlocal descriptor memory of only 1MB, the synergistic combination of the\nproposed network and map compression achieves the best performance on the\nAachen Day-Night compared to existing compression methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Hu5QQ9vr_nmhqClnasFulLB4kjbje5yzXfN-RkzmudA","pdfSize":"28538256","objectId":"0x0a63ad9e199608127402919fffccedd0eb36898b2362f609b131b4145ec8ac13","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
