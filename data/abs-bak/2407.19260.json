These fluxes induce a diverse set of superpotential\ncouplings leading to scalar potentials with a very rich structure, which may\npossibly result in a vast landscape of physical vacua. However such scalar\npotentials typically consist of a huge number of terms and in order to make any\nattempt for phenomenological model building with some analytic\nunderstanding/control it is necessary to formulate them in some compact and\nconcise form. Along these lines we review various equivalent methods of\nderiving the same scalar potential through a set of master formulae, which may\nopen up a new avenue for model building using non-geometric fluxes.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"t-jHnqCwQSD7D_69N10hx5pMTF34FnSSXjvcSyd_YDo","pdfSize":"339023","objectId":"0x209f4fff72c45425189217eecee7621669070302a7ab349430bd7eb920abeb3a","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
