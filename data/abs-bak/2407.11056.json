It\ndrives the attention toward the Point of Incipient Failure, which is the moment\nin time when the anomalous behavior is first observed, and where the root cause\nis assumed to be found before the issue propagates. The paper presents the\nelementary but essential concepts of the solution and illustrates them\nexperimentally on a simulated setting. Finally, it discusses avenues of\nimprovement for the maturity of the causal technology to meet the robustness\nchallenges of increasingly complex environments in the industry.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ia2BF2h44h-ks0IMCyv-uWySnGwA54fBIaWCxRpAWaU","pdfSize":"303437","objectId":"0x13f014983ba65209ffee0411f66a038a5e7d15cfe0d5d369d4b1b015aa1251dc","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
