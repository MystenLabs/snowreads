In this problem, the two main challenges are the strong\nhierarchical restriction and the number of candidates for the main effects and\ninteractions. If $n$ is a few hundred and $p$ is ten thousand, then the memory\nneeded for the augmented matrix of the full model is more than $100{\\rm GB}$ in\nsize, beyond the memory capacity of a personal computer. This issue can be\nsolved by our proposed method but not by our competitors. Two advantages are\nthat the proposed method can include important interactions even if the related\nmain effects are weak or absent, and it can be combined with an arbitrary\nvariable selection method for interactions. The research addresses the main\nconcern for variable selection of interactions because it makes previous\nmethods applicable to the case when $p$ is extremely large.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"Klix05AQIdxR3f8vqNOj3Hu1plpmW36yYoT3VNQX8eI","pdfSize":"279002"}
