Non-terrestrial SOOP\nanalysis employs modified Cram\\`er-Rao lower bound (MCRLB) to establish a\nrelationship between SOOP characteristics and the accuracy of ranging\ninformation. This approach evaluates hybrid navigation module performance\nwithout direct signal simulation. The MCRLB is computed for ranging accuracy,\nconsidering factors like propagation delay, frequency offset, phase offset, and\nangle-of-arrival (AOA), across diverse non-terrestrial SOOP candidates.\nAdditionally, Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP) and low earth orbit (LEO)\nSOOP availability are assessed. Validation involves comparing MCRLB predictions\nwith actual ranging measurements obtained in a realistic simulated scenario.\nFurthermore, a qualitative evaluation examines terrestrial SOOP, considering\nsignal availability, accuracy attainability, and infrastructure demands.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lpDRQTn0mOF57PP8g6dDC2JI4xugu8hXiD8NRKykLCU","pdfSize":"1682805","objectId":"0x85aff068bc5355ef953bca275dee91bf6fdd17e769779bde0e5a849db7431890","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
