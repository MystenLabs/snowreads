The architecture is\nadjusted to manage a variety of crucial factors, such as permeability and\nporosity heterogeneity. The study extendes MgNO to time-dependent porous media\nflow problems and validate its accuracy in predicting essential aspects of\nmultiphase flows. Furthermore, the research provides a detailed comparison\nbetween MgNO and Fourier Neural Opeartor (FNO), which is one of the most\npopular neural operator methods, on their performance regarding prediction\nerror accumulation over time. This aspect provides valuable insights into the\nmodels' long-term predictive stability and reliability. The study demonstrates\nMgNO's capability to effectively simulate multiphase flow problems, offering\nconsiderable time savings compared to traditional simulation methods, marking\nan advancement in integrating data-driven methodologies in geoscience\napplications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vsLdStPTwMwoWUzvO9flavdgX67sR55QCC5dXPAd38Y","pdfSize":"2852245","objectId":"0xd02bea6fb379869ec7205fffffd98d7e1e004b430c98eb389af638f09cd81d9c","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
