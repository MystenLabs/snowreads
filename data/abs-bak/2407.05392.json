In that\nwork, the tasks were investigated within the \"single-shot\" regime, where a\nsingle implementation of the given measurement devices is available. In this\nwork, we explore these tasks for non-binary observables as well as within the\nmultiple-shot scenario, where we have access to finitely many implementations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JlofYXFSO9GIQKrRDYa0Tdjjk9HXaTaFP6CTXD-MyCw","pdfSize":"827500"}
