The resulting model _mocks_ the original program: Given an input,\nthe model predicts the output that would have been produced by the program.\nHowever, the model is also _reversible_ - that is, the model can predict the\ninput that would have produced a given output. Finally, the model is\n_differentiable_ and can be efficiently restricted to predict only a certain\naspect of the program behavior.\n  Modelizer uses _grammars_ to synthesize inputs and to parse the resulting\noutputs, allowing it to learn sequence-to-sequence associations between token\nstreams. Other than input and output grammars, Modelizer only requires the\nability to execute the program.\n  The resulting models are _small_, requiring fewer than 6.3 million parameters\nfor languages such as Markdown or HTML; and they are _accurate_, achieving up\nto 95.4% accuracy and a BLEU score of 0.98 with standard error 0.04 in mocking\nreal-world applications. We foresee several _applications_ of these models,\nespecially as the output of the program can be any aspect of program behavior.\nBesides mocking and predicting program behavior, the model can also synthesize\ninputs that are likely to produce a particular behavior, such as failures or\ncoverage.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dVtktO9hJpUPE4vs5rYlg-d-0EEnPLePywVPn4TjAmU","pdfSize":"1213208","objectId":"0xab4c24f395472ad906e09aa206566312c9f44b97e09a97133c58669da19992b0","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
