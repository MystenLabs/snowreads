We model distinct conformal defects using\ninterface branes that differ in tensions and are connected by a corner.\nEmploying the relationship between CFT scaling dimensions and Euclidean gravity\nactions, we outline a general procedure for calculating the anomalous\ndimensions of defect changing operators at nontrivial cusps. Several analytical\nresults are obtained, including the cusp anomalous dimensions at big and small\nangles. While $1/\\phi$ universal divergence appears for small cusp angles due\nto the fusion of two defects, more interestingly, we uncover a bubble phase\nrendered by a near zero angle cusp, in which the divergence is absent.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rTrp02wbC3xdHZlaLJ8zNSMqC3aupGQ425vdU-sA1KQ","pdfSize":"2124343","objectId":"0x648fffa032c66afdfd719ba12b063ac0f4c557baeda99bf3af13ca173d7ba915","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
