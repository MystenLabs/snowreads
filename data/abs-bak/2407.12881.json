However, the state-of-the-art for this task\nrecommends a different model class depending on the availability of gold\nalignment training data for a particular language pair. We propose BinaryAlign,\na novel word alignment technique based on binary sequence labeling that\noutperforms existing approaches in both scenarios, offering a unifying approach\nto the task. Additionally, we vary the specific choice of multilingual\nfoundation model, perform stratified error analysis over alignment error type,\nand explore the performance of BinaryAlign on non-English language pairs. We\nmake our source code publicly available.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"mk2KUu4O0dDTTebmLutwMEr1uvsVPLr4QCXZJ85Q8_w","pdfSize":"379025","objectId":"0xd6228db4f0fa564835ea3fde54936da4ccdcf5ef2ce8d3f23f96c66166887f77","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
