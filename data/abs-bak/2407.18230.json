One of\nthe most popular approaches is the Harmonic Balance Method (HBM), which\nexpresses the cycle as a sum of Fourier modes and analyses its stability using\nthe Hill's method. A drawback of Hill's method is that the relevant Floquet\nexponents have to be chosen from all the computed exponents. To overcome this\nproblem the current work discusses the application of Chebyshev polynomials to\nthe description of the time dependence of the periodic dynamics. The stability\ncharacteristics of the periodic orbit are directly extracted from the\nlinearisation around the periodic orbit. The method is compared with the HBM\nwith examples from Lorenz and Langford systems. The main advantage of the\npresent method is that, unlike HBM, it allows for an unambiguous determination\nof the Floquet exponents. The method is applied to natural convection in a\ndifferentially heated cavity which demonstrates its potential for large scale\nproblems arising from the discretisation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes\nequations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nRMfCUQ_Gs_gth5VZ1Kn13NK0dczzm6BqkAVwGQef1c","pdfSize":"1249619","objectId":"0x8eab12fdc66ee9881ac52e5e4b64da30b27e04eaa66b3b41c11888e34f2dbea9","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
