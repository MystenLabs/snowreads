By devising a novel\nquantum measurement approach along with meticulous analysis, our investigation\ndemonstrates that, in the limit as $M \\rightarrow \\infty$, the maximally\nentangled $M$ mode Bell state achieves optimal performance, matching the\ntwo-mode squeezed vacuum in a high-noise regime and exceeding it in low-noise.\nThis result challenges the dominance of continuous variable states in photonic\nsensing applications and extends the novelty of QI to regimes where no quantum\nadvantage was believed to exist. A closer analysis reveals that this advantage\nstems from retained entanglement in the transmitted Bell state, a\nparadigm-shifting discovery since interaction with the environment in optical\nsystems is believed to break entanglement. The complete mathematical analysis\nof this work provides granular insights into the interaction between photonic\nsystems and environmental noise, motivating further research into discrete\nvariable quantum sensing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"058iMup8tvx4dZSU-Iy1mSZXGwXFcpHM48hSiPruyos","pdfSize":"644918","objectId":"0xc2b70f8fb298064735c908d1b50de786791dea3fdc4866a5ad49febc78ab2bed","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
