This analysis is motivated by current and future\nmeasurements at COMPASS, JLab (Hall D), and the BESIII measurement of\nsingle-virtual photon-fusion reactions in the space-like region, offering\ninsight into generalized pion polarizabilities. To improve predictions within\nan unsubtracted dispersion formalism with only the pion left-hand cut, one\nneeds to consider the influence of heavier left-hand cuts. We parametrize the\nlatter using an expansion in a suitably constructed conformal variable,\ncapturing the analytical structure of the left-hand cuts. The coefficients in\nthis expansion are determined from the matching with the Lagrangian-based\napproach, the Adler zero constraint for $\\gamma\\gamma \\to \\pi^0\\pi^0$, and a\nfit to the cross-section data. The extension to the single-virtual case is also\ndiscussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jrgy6nJP3_g_29Yqe3TmGR8SaSJwiwW-DDhbAzvZqNI","pdfSize":"185842","objectId":"0x0f8e4cb19fcd365e90c3442619e6afc4f2b35d9d12896fac2e4efcd2e3f119e2","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
