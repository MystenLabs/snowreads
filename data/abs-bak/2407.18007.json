In this paper, we use the Cosmicflows-4\n(CF4) sample of galaxies from the Extragalactic Distance Database to constrain\nthis metric tensor. We obtain an approximation to the local matter distribution\nand geometry. We numerically solve for null geodesics for randomly distributed\nmock sources and compare this model with the Lemaitre-Hubble constant inferred\nfrom the observations under the assumption of perfect isotropy and homogeneity.\nWe conclude on effects of realistic inhomogeneities on the luminosity distance\nin the context of the Hubble tension and discuss limitations of our approach.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4niJu_6RKd7yDZJXKI8Pi9LH74n09kV612mqqye5SjE","pdfSize":"662745","objectId":"0x800215dd30d96b391b9c88c29c17f006a1a48fca464a37c82b4576e8fe05f052","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
