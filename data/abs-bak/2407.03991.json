It is achieved by realizing that the usual\nconstruction of the Hamiltonian equations can be performed without the use of\nthe so called Hamiltonian section, whose existence is problematic when general\nvariational problems are considered. The developed formalism is applied to\nobtain an unified problem and a Hamiltonian field theory for the vakonomic\nHerglotz variational problem.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"_4Nt9TgAla4nvy5VEW01WSXpViGFdssYMz4gNJi4vLE","pdfSize":"317120"}
