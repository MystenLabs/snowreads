Additionally, for the system identification problem, it has been\ndemonstrated that the gradient and Hessian of a cost function can be\nanalytically constructed using the same matrix and tensor metrics. A general\ngradientbased optimization problem is then posed to identify unknown system\nparameters and unknown initial conditions. Here, the analytical gradient and\nHessian of the cost function are derived using these state and parameter\ntransition matrices. The more robust performance of the proposed method for\nidentifying unknown system parameters and unknown initial conditions over an\nexisting conventional quasi-Newton method-based system identification toolbox\n(available in MATLAB) is demonstrated by using two widely used benchmark\ndatasets from real dynamic systems. In the existing toolbox, gradient and\nHessian information, which are derived using a finite difference method, are\nmore susceptible to numerical errors compared to the analytical approach\npresented.\n  Keywords: Gradient-based Optimization, Transition matrix and tensors,\nGradient and Hessian, System identification.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3wDa10ST-KRo0vvQtTp9lTdofIAwZmVqZl5Imbqxoas","pdfSize":"1734549"}
