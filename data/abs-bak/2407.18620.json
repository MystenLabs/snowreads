We define a plateau-$k$-rollercoaster as a word\nconsisting of an alternating sequence of (weakly) increasing and decreasing\n\\emph{runs}, with each run containing at least $k$ \\emph{distinct} elements,\nallowing the run to contain multiple copies of the same symbol consecutively.\nThis differs from previous work, where runs within rollercoasters have been\ndefined only as sequences of distinct values. Here, we are concerned with\nrollercoasters of \\emph{maximum} length embedded in a given word $w$, that is,\nthe longest rollercoasters that are a subsequence of $w$.\n  We present algorithms allowing us to determine the longest\nplateau-$k$-roller\\-coasters appearing as a subsequence in any given word $w$\nof length $n$ over an alphabet of size $\\sigma$ in $O(n \\sigma k)$ time, to\ncount the number of plateau-$k$-rollercoasters in $w$ of maximum length in $O(n\n\\sigma k)$ time, and to output all of them with $O(n)$ delay after $O(n \\sigma\nk)$ preprocessing. Furthermore, we present an algorithm to determine the\nlongest common plateau-$k$-rollercoaster within a set of words in $O(N k\n\\sigma)$ where $N$ is the product of all word lengths within the set.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"3habjo8fY_F-qghCTZFlNpThIp1XrS4RJ5-ZfnyUtVQ","pdfSize":"286940","objectId":"0xb285d4cbd44665ed18e49d6700357f76334a58442e33a7c505cde0ddf3a117f2","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
