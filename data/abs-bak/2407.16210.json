However, reproducing the\nselection and use of diverse motor skills in dynamic environments to solve\ncomplex tasks, as humans do, still remains a challenge. We present a strategy\nand skill learning approach for physics-based table tennis animation. Our\nmethod addresses the issue of mode collapse, where the characters do not fully\nutilize the motor skills they need to perform to execute complex tasks. More\nspecifically, we demonstrate a hierarchical control system for diversified\nskill learning and a strategy learning framework for effective decision-making.\nWe showcase the efficacy of our method through comparative analysis with\nstate-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its capabilities in executing various\nskills for table tennis. Our strategy learning framework is validated through\nboth agent-agent interaction and human-agent interaction in Virtual Reality,\nhandling both competitive and cooperative tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Graphics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0RkcTp1qD0h1WnyHRosHsXEjEOPJXf___vjrZzHxqTw","pdfSize":"7322682","objectId":"0x794f4f1c41546053c6d1cab52c6a9654f0ff0cc709d61ca12a682b9e532a7343","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
