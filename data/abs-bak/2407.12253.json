In 1945, Dyson generalized Mann's theorem and obtained a lower bound\nfor the Shnirel'man density of rank $r$ sumsets. His proof introduced the Dyson\ntransform, an important tool in additive number theory. This paper explains the\nbackground of Dyson's work, gives Dyson's proof of his theorem, and includes\nseveral applications of the Dyson transform, such as Kneser's inequality for\nsums of finite subsets of an arbitrary additive abelian group.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EYQHaNIqHXZQjVaU7t5l69XzcK6Av1cMvHI2d9qDzdA","pdfSize":"227451","objectId":"0x33b5258e3ab591e11c7c9f006415e762dd6bef9c4efa62949ed06160de111ae4","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
