The observational signature of such an event\nwould be a relatively small amount of matter that is gravitationally bound.\nThis binding may actually be provided by invisible dark matter forming the Bose\nstar. We may expect a relative excess of heavier atoms, molecules, and solid\ndust compared to the content of giant cold molecular clouds since the velocity\nof heavy particles at a given temperature is lower and it may be small compared\nto the escape velocity, $v_\\mathrm{rms} = \\sqrt{3k_\\mathrm{B} T/m_\\mathrm{gas}}\n\\ll v_\\mathrm{esc}=\\sqrt{2GM/R}$. Finally, the velocity of this captured matter\ncloud may correlate with the expected velocity of free dark matter particles\n(e.g. expected axion wind velocity relative to Earth).\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jvJL-ZTyJCsU24aBq8BQxK65JLd37Hry8D9fQWBSvEk","pdfSize":"455262","objectId":"0xf081ca0be15e67e8c86cd8c0f623ebf7c6f7272c186fc7690eb1eeacc58000e5","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
