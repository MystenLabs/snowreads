Src\nkinase is a signalling enzyme regulating many cellular processes including\nadhesion and motility and its deregulated activation has been associated to\naggressiveness of different cancers. Here, we take advantage of optogenetics to\nprecisely control Src activation in time to study the effect of its over\nactivation on collective rotation of confined monolayers. We show that Src\nactivation slows down collective rotation of epithelial cells confined into\ncircular adhesive patches. We interpret velocity, force and stress data during\nperiod of non-activation and period of activation of Src thanks to an\nhydrodynamic description of the cell assembly as a polar active fluid. Src\nactivation leads to a 2-fold decrease in the ratio of polar angle to friction,\nwhich could result from increased adhesive bonds at the cell-substrate\ninterface. Our work reveals the importance of fine-tuning the level of Src\nactivity for coordinated collective behaviors.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Tissues and Organs","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2PtD8NwgGLkzzQnzkExoNuOzs9ws2iQ0UHUXCxclxJc","pdfSize":"24023756"}
