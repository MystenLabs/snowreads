Phys. Rev. A 108, 042211 (2023)]. In this work, for\ntwo-qubit states, we study the relationships between the quantification of\none-sided semi-device-independent steerability and information-theoretic\nquantification of simultaneous correlations in mutually unbiased bases [Wu et\nal. Scientific Reports 4, 4036 (2014)]. For two-qubit states that belong to\nBell-diagonal states, quantifying one-sided semi-device-independent\nsteerability provides an operational characterization of information-theoretic\nquantification of simultaneous correlations in mutually unbiased bases. For\nanother class of two-qubit states, we show that quantifying one-sided\nsemi-device-independent steerability provides operational quantification of\nsimultaneous correlations in mutually unbiased bases going beyond the above\ninformation-theoretic quantification. We invoke quantum steering ellipsoid\nformalism to shed intuitions on our operational characterization of\nsimultaneous correlations in complementary bases of two-qubit states that we\nconsider.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"z4R3Yk_aFIHD6qHxiGbJ8XYSJro-FsjZAfOrLtqlfL8","pdfSize":"266522","objectId":"0x6a031b9311fe9c82483b517af7e4556c6fe14e8e249a4dfa1cfa67b2a665d5d1","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
