We explore the characterization of ${\\rm Aut_{\\delta}}(R)$ for\nquantum Weyl algebras and we prove that in the case of the Jordanian plane it\nis always a finite cyclic group. Furthermore, we obtain an arithmetic\ncharacterization that allows us to trivially demonstrate that these algebras\nare not isomorphic.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0a-ZhJpULiEO6CMX9mut3PL_Yk8YSbpQtbsWD6kEFoM","pdfSize":"166000"}
