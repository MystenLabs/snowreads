Moreover, energy barrier, diffusion coefficient,\nand open circuit voltage (OCV) calculations show rapid Li atom diffusion on the\nTPDH-gr surface, stable intercalation of lithium atoms, and good performance\nduring the charge and discharge cycles of the LIB. These findings, combined\nwith the intrinsic metallic nature of TPDH-gr, indicate that this new 2D carbon\nallotrope is a promising candidate for use as an anodic LIB material.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tx30eY4Uq1oMZH_r58arT8lJMaAYJLJhu9OQgqYoUU8","pdfSize":"2092292"}
