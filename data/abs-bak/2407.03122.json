We propose a navigation system architecture called\nIntentionNet that employs a monolithic neural network as the low-level\nplanner/controller, and uses a general interface that we call intentions to\nsteer the controller. The paper proposes two types of intentions, Local Path\nand Environment (LPE) and Discretised Local Move (DLM), and shows that DLM is\nrobust to significant metric positioning and mapping errors. The paper also\npresents Kilo-IntentionNet, an instance of the IntentionNet system using the\nDLM intention that is deployed on a Boston Dynamics Spot robot, and which\nsuccessfully navigates through complex indoor and outdoor environments over\ndistances of up to a kilometre with only noisy odometry.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"53sXSJEFZC1KDbPtHqs_KzMbYxKNsD6aGfltbymvN9M","pdfSize":"58303383"}
