In this contribution we present resummed and matched\npredictions for the groomed invariant-mass event shape in neutral-current DIS\nincluding the effect of grooming the hadronic final state using the soft-drop\ntechnique. Non-perturbative corrections from hadronisation are taken into\naccount through parton-to-hadron level transfer matrices extracted from\ndedicated Monte Carlo simulations with SHERPA, including uncertainties\nextracted from replica tunes to data from the HERA experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"wZ78z06rgt8yRNPQYlfVSj-3HTH4-K6B7CyF05iHE8w","pdfSize":"456213","objectId":"0x6f68efa0beb9b7bb1bb14ad0e015ff394d91f1dfb1b001508aaa061a77871ba2","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
