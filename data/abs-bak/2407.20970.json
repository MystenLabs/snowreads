On the other hand, Large Language\nModels (LLMs) can understand and generate human-like text, based on extensive\ntraining on diverse datasets with billions of parameters. Considering the\nrecent near-source computational technologies like Edge, in this article, we\ngive an overview of a framework along with its modules, where LLMs can be used\nunder the umbrella of semantic communication at the network edge for efficient\ncommunication in IoT networks. Finally, we discuss a few applications and\nanalyze the challenges and opportunities to develop such systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DAk8CPDGBp4yUw8d444gnN-dwm4sEfC5F9RYN2FwvbE","pdfSize":"604417","objectId":"0x80d4d5799bde8c27eb8b8590d84376dca03547d2e44ff61f0852af4415c5caeb","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
