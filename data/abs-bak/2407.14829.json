We organize two tracks to handle the argumentative generation\ntasks in different scenarios, namely, Counter-Argument Generation (Track 1) and\nClaim-based Argument Generation (Track 2). Each track is equipped with its\ndistinct dataset and baseline model respectively. In total, 32 competing teams\nregister for the challenge, from which we received 11 successful submissions.\nIn this paper, we will present the results of the challenge and a summary of\nthe systems, highlighting commonalities and innovations among participating\nsystems. Datasets and baseline models of the AI-Debater 2023 Challenge have\nbeen already released and can be accessed through the official website of the\nchallenge.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JZDf7TBCNAiCC-v5b-OhqAItjQDydu4VMfylCIKD7Ck","pdfSize":"1525376","objectId":"0xebade69aedcdc0506176780f2a1a6356db2722a8ab1e58d0d1ef2a0f691d4295","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
