We prove\nthat the sum of $N>1$ consecutive Pell numbers is a fixed integer multiple of\nanother Pell number if and only if $4\\mid N$. We consider the generalized Pell\n$(k,i)$-numbers defined by $p(n) :=\\ 2p(n-1)+p(n-k-1) $ for $n\\geq k+1$, with\n$p(0)=p(1)=\\cdots =p(i)=0$ and $p(i+1)=\\cdots = p(k)=1$ for $0\\leq i\\leq k-1$,\nand prove that the sum of $N=2k+2$ consecutive terms is a fixed integer\nmultiple of another term in the sequence. We also prove that for the\ngeneralized Pell $(k,k-1)$-numbers such a relation does not exist when $N$ and\n$k$ are odd. We give analogous results for the Fibonacci and other related\nsecond-order recursive sequences.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WnNWmREDamtFYmDsJ7Hm7Cshi79DzTXKQRQA3223fSk","pdfSize":"273573","objectId":"0x6e07ce1ef9b2c70dd9fed4ae1debc04695dbcb0fd1ace01657d89943d835e196","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
