However, propriety alone does not\nensure an informative characterization of predictive performance and it is\nrecommended to compare forecasts using multiple scoring rules. With that in\nmind, interpretable scoring rules providing complementary information are\nnecessary. We formalize a framework based on aggregation and transformation to\nbuild interpretable multivariate proper scoring rules.\nAggregation-and-transformation-based scoring rules are able to target specific\nfeatures of the probabilistic forecasts; which improves the characterization of\nthe predictive performance. This framework is illustrated through examples\ntaken from the literature and studied using numerical experiments showcasing\nits benefits. In particular, it is shown that it can help bridge the gap\nbetween proper scoring rules and spatial verification tools.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UjGdOaYf1Ys5ceuGtiJY-34XhM9DP4sw6Y414MUuy8E","pdfSize":"1932487","objectId":"0x2447f81867628d14e62abaa5ede45b5736716dacc3d526b829f721546775b71d","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
