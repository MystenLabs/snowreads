The study is based on\nHasselmann's kinetic equation, which significantly simplifies for the quasi 1-D\nturbulence. The goal of the paper is to compare the theoretical predictions\nwith experimental observations. The paper starts with new derivation of the\nquasi 1-D approximation of Hasselmann's equation. The present work does not\nsupport the imposition of boundary conditions. Instead, the family of\ntheoretical spectra is compared with P-M (Pierson-Moskowitz) and JONSWAP (Joint\nNorth Sea Wave Project) spectra. First, a simple solution (first approximation)\nof the quasi 1-D equation is obtained and compared with the P-M spectrum. Then\nself-similar solutions are considered; they are shown to satisfy the second\norder ordinary differential equation. The solutions of this equation have many\nfeatures of the JONSWAP spectra.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"W7a4bpYNSu5yf2y-NaTWYWeWhaUP7WMi_T2lM3zuln0","pdfSize":"291863"}
