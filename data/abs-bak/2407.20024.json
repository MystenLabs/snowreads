Ensuring\n`fair' representations is essential, due to the societal implications and the\nuse of sensitive personal data. In this paper, we demonstrate how the\nparametrization of the \\emph{CrossWalk} algorithm influences the ability to\ninfer a sensitive attributes from node embeddings. By fine-tuning\nhyperparameters, we show that it is possible to either significantly enhance or\nobscure the detectability of these attributes. This functionality offers a\nvaluable tool for improving the fairness of ML systems utilizing graph\nembeddings, making them adaptable to different fairness paradigms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"GVIbaQLULUTGzBaVuuwhRJOeBEfmOPDjCFbCK9JgQ-0","pdfSize":"16366238","objectId":"0x137ea2b5cc083a745e2c5432b6c14103a4f06ada13f2386488e3b6192c58c9f1","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
