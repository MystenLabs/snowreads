Here, we enquire whether can one detect the\npresence of a quantum resource in some operational task or equivalently does\nevery quantum resource provides an advantage over its free counterpart in some\nblack box scenario where one does not have much information about the devices.\nWe introduce the framework for detecting quantum resources semi-device\nindependently by considering the prepare-and-operation scenario with the\nrestriction on the dimension of the quantum channel connecting the preparation\nbox with the operation box. For any dimension $d$, we show that for any\nresource theory with less than $d^2$ number of linearly independent free states\nor free operations, there exist correlations that can detect the presence of a\nquantum resource. For the particular case when the quantum channel is\nconstrained to transmit only qubits, we explicitly construct witnesses to\nobserve the presence of various quantum resources.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PvhhtjsN5VYMYBiDi1v2_0PomNnBsxFxDWQlDNMuMiE","pdfSize":"298666","objectId":"0x5b86d174e1b5d1389a8d2430e66e1139be48cef207432a4ab85aabbacd1cbec3","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
