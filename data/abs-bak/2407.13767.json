Here, we formulate\nthree different general approaches to construct real space Hamiltonian on a\nfractal lattice starting from the Bloch Hamiltonian on the parent crystal,\nfostering for example strong and crystalline topological insulators resulting\nfrom the interplay between the nontrivial geometry of the underlying electronic\nwavefunctions and the crystal symmetries. As a demonstrative example, we\nconsider a generalized square lattice Chern insulator model, and within the\nframework of all three methods we successfully showcase incarnations of strong\nand crystalline Chern insulators on the Sierpi\\'nski carpet fractal lattices.\nThe proposed theoretical framework thus lays a generic foundation to build a\ntower of topological phases on the landscape of fractal lattices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zBSUTpw-zvI-I6TrMODta8ytQM83-EtgNWiNHABhzhQ","pdfSize":"2047627","objectId":"0x9e3798895cbad2a200a030ec08cd7a07a1cf92a944830f4ef09f7cdf56eff688","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
