However, these models are too large for practical daily use.\nWe propose a lightweight zero-shot TTS method using a mixture of adapters\n(MoA). Our proposed method incorporates MoA modules into the decoder and the\nvariance adapter of a non-autoregressive TTS model. These modules enhance the\nability to adapt a wide variety of speakers in a zero-shot manner by selecting\nappropriate adapters associated with speaker characteristics on the basis of\nspeaker embeddings. Our method achieves high-quality speech synthesis with\nminimal additional parameters. Through objective and subjective evaluations, we\nconfirmed that our method achieves better performance than the baseline with\nless than 40\\% of parameters at 1.9 times faster inference speed.
