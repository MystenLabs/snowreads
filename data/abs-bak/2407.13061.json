CatBoost emerged as the superior model and achieved the\nhighest scores across accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score at 91 percent,\nwhile XGBoost and GBM followed closely with 89 percent and 88 percent\nrespectively. Additionally, the research examined the computational efficiency\nof these models to analyze the balance between training time, testing speed,\nand model size factors crucial for real-world applications. Despite its longer\ntraining duration, CatBoost demonstrated high testing efficiency. These results\nindicate that machine learning can aid in poverty prediction and in the\ndevelopment of targeted policy interventions. Future studies should focus on\nincorporating a wider variety of data to enhance the predictive accuracy and\npolicy utility of these models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"w7b2Yl4RJtrFkVUsEOTRbNOTkl7xWHT5dbV-U05I-O8","pdfSize":"456419","objectId":"0x5066950bb92a768bac2788081d76ee678eea4c503d211cc81051a18356cfef3c","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
