The primary aim is to\nfacilitate developers in transitioning their applications to Cloud or Edge\nplatforms utilizing Docker or Kubernetes. This paper presents a tool called\nConverter, designed to interpret a TOSCA extension called CEAML and convert the\ndescriptions into Kubernetes or Kubevirt definition files. Converter is\navailable as a Python package and is recommended for use by orchestrators as an\nauxiliary tool for implementing CEAML.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TAzjYrmhHRb-zzu28mDx04JJVCdYb3zj7wzXJtrSZQk","pdfSize":"271041","objectId":"0x2f870fcdbc02b7e040e08de265295d6a539615c0bc689a565b25bf26e8cd932f","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
