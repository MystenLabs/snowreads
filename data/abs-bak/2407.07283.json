In recent years, several studies have established the existence of\na relationship between chemical clocks and stellar ages. The [Y/Mg] clock is a\npromising technique, but there are still several open questions, such as its\nvalidity for metal-poor stars and differences between the thin and thick disk\npopulations. Our aim is to study the behaviour of the [Y/Mg] chemical clock\nwith stellar ages and the effect of metallicity and population on this chemical\nclock for a sample of solar-type disk stars. We have derived the precise\nstellar atmospheric parameters as well as the elemental abundances of Mg and Y\nthrough line-by-line differential spectroscopic analysis for a sample of 48\nmetal-poor solar-type stars based on high-quality, high-resolution ESO/HARPS\nspectra. From the high-precision Gaia astrometric data, stellar masses and ages\nwere estimated through isochrone-fitting. A joint analysis of our sample,\ntogether with a sample of 185 solar-twins and analogues from our previous\nworks, is performed to calibrate the [Y/Mg] chemical clock in the Galactic disk\nfor $-$0.71 $\\leq$ [Fe/H] $<$ +0.34. Open clusters and stars with asteroseismic\nages have been used to validate our relations. Two different populations could\nbe clearly seen in the [Mg/Fe] - [Fe/H] plane - the thick and thin disks. We\nfound a metallicity-dependent, strong anti-correlation between the [Y/Mg] ratio\nand stellar ages of our sample. For the first time in the literature, we report\nsimilar correlations for the thin and thick disk stars. The [Y/Mg] relation(s)\nfound here for solar-type stars is compatible with the literature using\nsolar-twins. Our relation provides higher accuracy and precision of 0.45 and\n0.99 Gyr, respectively, comparable with the best accuracy achieved for the\nsolar-twins till date.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZLom8cTtrFHxb2dRD89fR0exYUSIMuv25TduLxiRsXQ","pdfSize":"1089363"}
