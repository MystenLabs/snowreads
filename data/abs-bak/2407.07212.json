One kind of invariant is based on the mutual curvature of the\nsubspaces and another is similar to Chen's $\\delta$-invariants. We compare the\nmutual curvature invariants with Chen-type invariants and prove geometric\ninequalities with intermediate mean curvature squared for CR-submanifolds in\nalmost Hermitian spaces. In the case of a set of complex planes, we introduce\nand study curvature invariants based on the concept of holomorphic bisectional\ncurvature. As applications, we give consequences of the absence of some\n$D$-minimal CR-submanifolds in almost Hermitian manifolds.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"D8Kf6fo8-ldVwDJFhDMtMR3zU-JwYbI1vNH6eIZ9T5c","pdfSize":"157014"}
