In certain partial differential equations\nthese waves are modeled by rational solutions. In this work we discuss\napproximating rogue wave solutions in a basis of orthogonal functions known as\nthe Malmquist-Takenaka (MT) functions. This family of rational functions can be\ndirectly mapped to a modified Fourier series, allowing the fast Fourier\ntransform computation of the spectral MT coefficients. Spectral differentiation\nmatrices are derived. The approximation of the various rogue wave solutions in\nthe nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation is explored. The unstable nature of\nthe NLS equation on a constant background and its effect on destabilizing and\ngenerating rogue waves is studied. Perturbing the constant solution with\ncertain localized functions is found to generate rogue wave-like structures.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"E1S561zSyPCzmKOh4QP6INhNKrSxD_4aV7UelznNvqs","pdfSize":"941960"}
