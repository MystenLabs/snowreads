As an application, the local well-posedness is\nproved for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with Dirichlet condition.\nDanchin and Tolksdorf have studied the same problem in a bounded domains. Since\nthey used Da-Prato and Grisvard theory directly, they need the assumption that\nthe domain is compact. We imvestigate a new method to obtain $L_1$ maximal\nregularity which is based on real interpolation theories and thanks to this\nmethod, we can remove the compactness assumptions in the study due to Danchin\nand Torksdorf. Our method can be applied to obtain $L_1$ in time maximal\nregularity theorem for the initial boundary value problem of the system of\nparabolic or hyperbolic-parabolic equations with non-homogeneous boundary\nconditions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"-9r0rNwPj44O2Cznu52P7JlVmQvK5OYOoLCF0wPErHE","pdfSize":"457570","objectId":"0x71f7e23197c2ba740d1139997a1a96fe39c73313363967206f21483d622de39c","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
