In this paper, we introduce a novel method that\nsimultaneously learns coefficients and prototypes. Employing an overcomplete\nsampling strategy, our method produces an overcomplete set of instance\npredictions, from which the optimal ones are selected through a Non-Maximum\nSuppression (NMS) algorithm during inference. The obtained prototypes are\nvisualizable and interpretable. Our method demonstrates superior performance on\nS3DIS-blocks, consistently outperforming existing methods in mRec and mPrec.\nMoreover, it operates 32.9% faster than the state-of-the-art. Notably, with\nonly 0.8% of the total inference time, our method exhibits an over 20-fold\nreduction in the variance of inference time compared to existing methods. These\nattributes render our method well-suited for practical applications requiring\nboth rapid inference and high reliability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"jQBGm_ZE2WlcIt_BjsU8JtB_nxg2phch6QFY5Wqou4g","pdfSize":"3105563"}
