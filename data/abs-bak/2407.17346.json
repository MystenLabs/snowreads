While a great deal of\nresearch has been done in this area, our systematic literature analysis\nattempts to give readers a thorough grasp of penetration testing's role in\nreducing insider risks. We aim to arrange and integrate the body of knowledge\non insider threat prevention by using a grounded theory approach for a thorough\nliterature review. This analysis classifies and evaluates the approaches used\nin penetration testing today, including how well they uncover and mitigate\ninsider threats and how well they work in tandem with other security\nprocedures. Additionally, we look at how penetration testing is used in\ndifferent industries, present case studies with real-world implementations, and\ndiscuss the obstacles and constraints that businesses must overcome. This study\naims to improve the knowledge of penetration testing as a critical part of\ninsider threat defense, helping to create more comprehensive and successful\nsecurity policies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uJIG7fXPbGP0NjWnpc2Lxea4DoJEn3jP1QPamP5dW0Y","pdfSize":"247181","objectId":"0x61972ec1529ed85e0adfa26a0c6827a8471f6d9d0e474f9aa2b126b57f5560b0","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
