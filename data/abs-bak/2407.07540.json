Tissue growth is disordered due to\ncell-to-cell variability, but the effects of this variability on buckling are\nunknown. Here, we analyse what is perhaps the simplest setup of this problem:\nthe buckling of an elastic rod with fixed ends driven by spatially varying\ngrowth. Combining analytical calculations for simple growth fields and\nnumerical sampling of random growth fields, we show that variability can\nincrease as well as decrease the growth threshold for buckling, even when\ngrowth variability does not cause any residual stresses. For random growth, we\nfind that the shift of the buckling threshold correlates with spatial moments\nof the growth field. Our results imply that biological systems can either\ntrigger or avoid buckling by exploiting the spatial arrangement of growth\nvariability.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YS64kfUvO5mngWPJTG4gBKIZFtSuqM7-hjVIv9p5dOc","pdfSize":"3555616","objectId":"0x022060f6d27606f0d08491e4c32775a3d1920f7a373ee32e64389c691a31d916","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
