The intensities are shown to approximately solve\nmodified rate equations, from which their polynomial decay can be deduced. The\nsystem illustrates that the underlying diffusion and reaction rates can\ninfluence the exact polynomial decay rates, despite the system evolving in a\nsupercritical dimension.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Qbi7fvlivLqHuyDz-ZRzw0CMEY70wy2pznXELoS52Lo","pdfSize":"322452","objectId":"0x6c8a87aefc150701ece1395b200b95975eee31a41ba23fac4d9663f03fcfcef4","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
