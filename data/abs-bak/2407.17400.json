At each level of the\ncutoff, a Haar measure, a BF measure and heat kernel measures can be defined.\n  - The topological charge of generalized connections on closed manifolds $Q=\n\\int Tr(F)$ in 2d, $Q= \\int Tr(F \\wedge F)$ in 4d, etc, is defined.\n  - On a subdivided manifold, it can be calculated in terms of the spaces of\ngeneralized connections associated to its pieces. Thus, spaces of boundary\nconnections can be computed from spaces associated to faces.\n  - The soul of our generalized connections is a notion of higher homotopy\nparallel transport defined for smooth connections. We recover standard\ngeneralized connections by forgetting its higher levels.\n  - The kth level of our higher gauge fields is trivial if and only if\n$\\pi_{k-1} G$ is trivial. Then $\\bar{\\cal A}^H_\\Sigma \\neq \\bar{\\cal A}_\\Sigma$\nif the gauge group is not simply connected and $d \\geq 2$. For $G=SL(2,\n{\\mathbb C})$ or $G=SU(2)$ and $\\dim \\Sigma = 3$, however, we get $\\bar{\\cal\nA}^H_\\Sigma = \\bar{\\cal A}_\\Sigma$: Boundary data for loop quantum gravity is\nconsistent with our space of generalized connections, but a path integral for\nquantum gravity would be sensitive to homotopy data.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EQdisg9_wQtJKaZFOiShip3s5djcRFoljCSrMbgVrMc","pdfSize":"2236116","objectId":"0x54f1a6aac3b4ee80645c5000c32dcb9e70c55ee298b49568c36feb8a49d11cf0","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
