Each\ncase involves a little pig, who submitted for consideration a theoretical plan\nfor a house to be constructed presently, in a faraway land. An anonymous big\nbad wolf was assigned by the journal to assess the merit of these manuscripts.\nThe pigs proposed three distinct construction frameworks, which varied in\nphysical and mathematical sophistication. The first little pig submitted a\nmodel of straw, based on the numerical method of toe-counting. His design\nincluded odd features, such as spilled millet and cloven-hoofprints on the\nwindow sill -- possibly a ploy to distract the wolf from the manuscript's\nfacile mathematical foundation. The second little pig used a more advanced\napproach, employing Newton's classical laws of motion, to propose a house of\nsticks. This pig included in her manuscript copious citations by a specific\nwolf, possibly aiming to ensure acceptance by flattering the wolf whom she\nanticipated would be the referee. The third little pig described an\nostentatious house of bricks based on an elaborate dynamical systems and\nstability analysis, possibly scheming to dazzle and impress. The big bad wolf\ndid not appear moved by any of the pigs' tactics. His recommendations were, for\nstraw: the minor revision of water-proofing; for sticks: the major revision of\nfire-proofing, given concerns surrounding climate change; for bricks:\nunequivocal rejection, accompanied by multiple derogatory comments regarding\n\"high-and-mighty theorists.\" I describe each case in detail, and suggest that\nthe wolf's reports might be driven as much by self interest as the manuscripts\nthemselves -- namely, that at the time the wolf wrote the reviews, he was\nrather hungry. Finally, I examine morals learned, if any.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/Popular Physics","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","pdfSize":"3954639","blobId":"M1AMbgC7R98sJJynwZ5RNG9KqWmAVB6g2RH6enRifnU","objectId":"0x2957046fbb4e1500c501c11d63a19b8b8fe669f979e2ea86b61c712351ab2d63","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
