Recent literature builds neural models\nfor generating rule sets, however, preliminary experiments show that they\nstruggle with maintaining high coverage. In this work, we suggest three simple\naugmentations to existing rule sets: (1) transforming rules to their abductive\nforms, (2) generating equivalent rules that use inverse forms of constituent\nrelations and (3) random walks that propose new rules. Finally, we prune\npotentially low quality rules. Experiments over four datasets and five\nruleset-baseline settings suggest that these simple augmentations consistently\nimprove results, and obtain up to 7.1 pt MRR and 8.5 pt Hits@1 gains over using\nrules without augmentations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"ps2UPGGCfsn13X5MfUPN7LYcKOjy3zsRLiYzZhtqpVI","pdfSize":"334856","objectId":"0x27383cf022f6b19f2f581f9bfb199c7cdd8093597d56be91b898228722c1a871","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
