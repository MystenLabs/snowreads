In these applications, probability distributions may be\ndiscretized into a few bins, measurement statistics can be high, and instrument\nperformance can be well understood. In such circumstances, it is essential to\nunderstand the deblurring first without any explicit noise considerations. We\nemploy singular value decomposition for the blurring matrix in a low-count\npixel system. A strong blurring may yield a null space for the blurring matrix.\nYet, a nonnegativity constraint for images built into the deblurring may help\nrestore null-space content in a high-contrast image with zero or low intensity\nfor a sufficient number of pixels. For low-contrast images, the control over\nnull-space content may be gained through regularization. When the\nregularization is applied, the blurred image is, in practice, restored to an\nimage that is still blurred but less than the starting one.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-IB22nL__9LZ1DXLJ_gHl_Xg6KghxPNLIp21t3uIlAA","pdfSize":"3713133"}
