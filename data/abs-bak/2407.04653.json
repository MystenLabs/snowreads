The calculation\nof the corresponding four-scale, two-loop amplitude is carried out retaining\nthe exact symbolic dependence on all masses and scales during the reduction to\nmaster integrals. The resulting integrals are then evaluated at high precision\nusing both the series expansion of the differential equations and sector\ndecomposition. Differential cross sections for the di-Higgs invariant mass and\nthe transverse momentum of a Higgs boson are shown, where we find that the\ncorrections are most pronounced at low invariant mass and transverse momentum.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"egA4GjyletzSF9jE6hE3iDuVi0hLjMb4hPGEHQg_Hcw","pdfSize":"4751228"}
