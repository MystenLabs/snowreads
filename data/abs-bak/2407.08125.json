We focus on real time push notification scenario, which requires a\nsystem monitors the stream of sampled tweets and returns the tweets relevant\nand novel to given interest profiles. Dirichlet score with and with very little\nsmoothing (baseline) are employed to classify whether a tweet is relevant to a\ngiven interest profile. Using metrics including Mean Average Precision (MAP,\ncumulative gain (CG) and discount cumulative gain (DCG), the experiment\nindicates that our approach has a good performance. It is also desired to\nremove the redundant tweets from the pushing queue. Due to the precision limit,\nwe only describe the algorithm in this paper.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"P5K2nOe3ZAq8icXePrTnC4KMfcvL7V7YDtcFVhaZPpc","pdfSize":"136791","objectId":"0xd7707d10a05982144854244ec8fb14d4d9d87f271fa7c60997d4fc2ed1355f49","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
