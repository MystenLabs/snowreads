In this work, we propose Raply, a fine-tuned\nGPT-2 model capable of producing meaningful rhyming text in the style of rap.\nIn addition to its rhyming capabilities, the model is able to generate less\noffensive content. It was achieved through the fine-tuning the model on a new\ndataset Mitislurs, a profanity-mitigated corpus. We evaluate the output of the\nmodel on two criteria: 1) rhyming based on the rhyme density metric; 2)\nprofanity content, using the list of profanities for the English language. To\nour knowledge, this is the first attempt at profanity mitigation for rap lyrics\ngeneration.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"n0y20XIFl26DHJW9HqlO2Cfw8ez6D-v0aJ1apoQLvAM","pdfSize":"378195"}
