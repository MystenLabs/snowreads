In this new vision we have not to define a\ntrochoid as a path that is swept by an attached point to a pure rolling circle\nalong a straight line or another circle. Instead, a trochoid can be defined as\na path that is swept by a definite point on the circumference of a rolling and\nsliding circle along a straight line or another circle! In this article we\npresent two different methods for implement a definite combination of sliding\nand rolling motions for a circle along another one in order to make a simple\nexperimental simulation to create centered trochoids and co-centered ellipses.\nIn our novel mathematical vision not only, the physical concepts are playing\nbasic role but also one can deduce the parametric equations of trochoids and\nellipses on the bases of rolling and sliding motions. In this perspective, an\nellipse can be visualized as a closed plane curve that can be generated through\na definite combination of rolling and sliding motions due to two co-polarized\nrotational motions with different commensurable angular frequencies! Centered\ntrochoids and ellipses can be implemented with the help of Virtual Rotating\nCircles Technique (VRCT) by an innovative device that we have named it\nMechanical Oscilloscope (MO) and other trochoids by a Virtual Sliding Simulator\n(VSS). Although the functions of our devices are independent from other\nelectronic equipment, but we can create trochoids on the bases of functional\noperation of (VSS) and (MO) with the help of computer.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0yYYoARt56YBUuw3X5UUvG-u5GbPL2flKIsFCW34dHg","pdfSize":"2177156"}
