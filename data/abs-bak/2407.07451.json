The calculation of the modified equation\nrelies on tedious calculations and there is no expression of the modified\nvector field, in opposition to the deterministic setting. We uncover in this\npaper the Hopf algebra structures associated to the laws of composition and\nsubstitution of exotic aromatic S-series, relying on the new idea of clumping.\nWe use these algebraic structures to provide the algebraic foundations of\nstochastic numerical analysis with S-series, as well as an explicit expression\nof the modified vector field as an exotic aromatic B-series.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wF3vzLNs5sVoE80giTq3YHnTPXhv2U1ATrpoN_RR5o0","pdfSize":"790251","objectId":"0xa22b108f9e6e7f6e4ccc8e0b641b0dd803c8af6e1b0b6f6c3fd50905ad2e9d5e","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
