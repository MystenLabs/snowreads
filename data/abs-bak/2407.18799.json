The\nKelvin-Voigt rheology or also, in the deviatoric part, the Jeffreys rheology\nare considered. Both a linearized convective model at large displacements with\na convex stored energy and the fully nonlinear large strain variant with a\n(possibly generalized) polyconvex stored energy are considered. The\ntime-discrete suitably regularized schemes are devised for both cases. The\nnumerical stability and, considering the multipolar 2nd-grade viscosity, also\nconvergence towards weak solutions are proved, exploiting the convexity of the\nkinetic energy when written in terms of linear momentum instead of velocity. In\nthe fully nonlinear case, the examples of neo-Hookean and Mooney-Rivlin\nmaterials are presented. A comparison with models of viscoelastic barotropic\nfluids is also made.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"8sDxa-XUSM05sWC-hDK7dTq5D6ZW8Q2HhEgkz9Dpue8","pdfSize":"882241","objectId":"0x158cc629ba60dc02ed61c2c37f525b17a75f7c33601d21c947635cbc599b72b1","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
