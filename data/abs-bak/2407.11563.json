This study addresses the intricate\nchallenge of energy efficient (EE) resource allocation that services both\nenhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low-latency communications\n(URLLC) users. We propose a novel distributed learning framework leveraging\non-policy and off-policy transfer learning strategies within a deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL)--based model to facilitate online resource\nallocation decisions under different channel conditions. The simulation results\nexplain the efficacy of the proposed method, which rapidly adapts to dynamic\nnetwork states, thereby achieving a green resource allocation.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qaGxcMo4_4QZoQWLhUyrdeK3Xe08klB61JQIL7hLRAE","pdfSize":"2140227","objectId":"0x6d1d2c6438350b8b5f12ba925fa00d73eb109380d0dbab23c48660f8d78cc1e3","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
