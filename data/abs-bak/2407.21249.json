While recent work has developed a theory for\ncircuits with Abelian symmetries, revealing important distinctions between\nAbelian and non-Abelian cases, a comprehensive framework for non-Abelian\nsymmetries has been lacking. In this work, we develop novel techniques and a\npowerful framework that is particularly useful for understanding circuits with\nnon-Abelian symmetries. Using this framework we settle an open question on\nquantum circuits with SU(d) symmetry. We show that 3-qudit SU(d)-invariant\ngates are semi-universal, i.e., generate all SU(d)-invariant unitaries, up to\ncertain constraints on the relative phases between sectors with inequivalent\nrepresentation of symmetry. Furthermore, we prove that these gates achieve full\nuniversality when supplemented with 3 ancilla qudits. Interestingly, we find\nthat studying circuits with 3-qudit gates is also useful for a better\nunderstanding of circuits with 2-qudit gates. In particular, we establish that\neven though 2-qudit SU(d)-invariant gates are not themselves semi-universal,\nthey become universal with at most 11 ancilla qudits. Additionally, we\ninvestigate the statistical properties of circuits composed of random\nSU(d)-invariant gates. Our findings reveal that while circuits with 2-qudit\ngates do not form a 2-design for the Haar measure over SU(d)-invariant\nunitaries, circuits with 3-qudit gates generate a t-design, with t that is\nquadratic in the number of qudits.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iF7ZrgMNAKX0lFqr-7SLox6epzNq8K3ljWqQsKHLPFc","pdfSize":"1472000","objectId":"0x997715ea24649310e4ad7dfdb508d8d3ca48cc0ced342b4ebc0e21a9fecdb632","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
