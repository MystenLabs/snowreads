It is shown that if the field is non-minimally\ncoupled to curvature, its asymptotic value under certain conditions may be\nshifted from the minimum of its potential. This means that due to influence of\nextra dimensions a scalar field with $\\lambda \\phi^4$ potential can stabilise\naway from $\\phi=0$ stable point which means an effective symmetry breaking\noccurs in such a system.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zL5aACxaqqhGcb-M9GCwBpK99nqJiyNCahSGPCqbuLc","pdfSize":"232155","objectId":"0xecb56f99998c71d9d0891c738c8d427623f7f2a2fec2f9b8245c0a44fc948bb3","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
