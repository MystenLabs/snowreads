This classifier allows for the\ndiscrimination between structures from different minima of a potential energy\nsurface, making it a useful tool for sorting through large datasets of atomic\nsystems. We incorporate the classifier as a filtering method in the Global\nOptimization with First-principles Energy Expressions (GOFEE) algorithm. Here\nit is used to filter out structures from exploited regions of the potential\nenergy landscape, whereby the risk of stagnation during the searches is\nlowered. We demonstrate the usefulness of the classifier by solving the global\noptimization problem of 2-dimensional pyroxene, 3-dimensional olivine, Au12,\nand Lennard-Jones LJ55 and LJ75 nanoparticles.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7UTGyFMYXzuB_f8R1EhgsYLUzWobCRybDcCUH4Qg-FI","pdfSize":"910265","objectId":"0x47cd505119eab78e15fb69d87a727c6e4f402021c3a98476fa258f2c4264e6f2","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
