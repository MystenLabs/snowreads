We used functional\nprincipal component analysis of normalised velocity data for 500m and 1000m\nraces to quantify pacing. The first four principal components explained 90.77%\nof the variation over 500m and 78.80% over 1000m. These principal components\nwere then associated with unique pacing characteristics with the first\ncomponent defined as a dropoff in velocity and the second component defined as\na kick. We then applied a Hidden Markov model to categorise each profile over\nan athlete's career, using the PC scores, into different types of race\nprofiles. This model included age and event type and we identified a trend for\na higher dropoff in development pathway athletes. Using the four different race\nprofile types, four athletes had all their race profiles throughout their\ncareers analysed. It was identified that an athlete's pacing profile can and\ndoes change throughout their career as an athlete matures. This information\nprovides coaches, practitioners and athletes with expectations as to how pacing\nprofiles can be expected to change across the course of an athlete's career.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"C7qGuGvSdQpsxd6td19Jm9h5VTDduaWgMnA82rEFJ08","pdfSize":"1590057"}
