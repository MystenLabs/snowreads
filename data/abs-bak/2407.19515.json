First, we establish the null controllability of\nthe ODE-heat with distributed control using Carleman estimates. Then, we\nconclude by the strategy of space domain extension. Finally, we illustrate the\nanalysis with some numerical experiments.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"x_hGnjZ7Q-hMlq804LZriUgPznhXHkCtr9Px319gGmg","pdfSize":"2620142","objectId":"0xfca1860548c5407d7ba2d1cdacab42e8c7dfce6d5f466c9fd4e1b38db54f47cf","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
