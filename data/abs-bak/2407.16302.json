Instead of\nrelying on fixed trial-and-error based image processing pipelines, we propose a\ntwo-level sequential planning approach for automated image distortion\nclassification and rectification. At the higher level it detects the class of\ncorruptions present in the input image, if any. The lower level selects a\nspecific algorithm to be applied, from a set of externally provided candidate\nalgorithms. The entire two-level setup runs in the form of a single forward\npass during inference and it is to be queried iteratively until the retrieval\nof the original image. We demonstrate improvements compared to three baselines\non the object detection task on COCO image dataset with rich set of\ndistortions. The advantage of our approach is its dynamic reconfiguration,\nconditioned on the input image and generalisability to unseen candidate\nalgorithms at inference time, since it relies only on the comparison of their\noutput of the image embeddings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BWHnlZb8mZYuhnoNxnk8KwHgeq7VP7FSiydEe0GW7FA","pdfSize":"292292","objectId":"0xe5a9fbe2411ada2d8a3bdeae6474b8dbee3ddda1b4df604873177ab516bfe17d","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
