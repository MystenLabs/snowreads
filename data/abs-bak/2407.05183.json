This paper introduces the FlowLearn dataset, a resource\ntailored to enhance the understanding of flowcharts. FlowLearn contains complex\nscientific flowcharts and simulated flowcharts. The scientific subset contains\n3,858 flowcharts sourced from scientific literature and the simulated subset\ncontains 10,000 flowcharts created using a customizable script. The dataset is\nenriched with annotations for visual components, OCR, Mermaid code\nrepresentation, and VQA question-answer pairs. Despite the proven capabilities\nof Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in various visual understanding tasks,\ntheir effectiveness in decoding flowcharts - a crucial element of scientific\ncommunication - has yet to be thoroughly investigated. The FlowLearn test set\nis crafted to assess the performance of LVLMs in flowchart comprehension. Our\nstudy thoroughly evaluates state-of-the-art LVLMs, identifying existing\nlimitations and establishing a foundation for future enhancements in this\nrelatively underexplored domain. For instance, in tasks involving simulated\nflowcharts, GPT-4V achieved the highest accuracy (58%) in counting the number\nof nodes, while Claude recorded the highest accuracy (83%) in OCR tasks.\nNotably, no single model excels in all tasks within the FlowLearn framework,\nhighlighting significant opportunities for further development.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uPCBRnLcuh-oKw5TLekGr-YPEQBDiVKHYwi3o29LbZk","pdfSize":"1514885"}
