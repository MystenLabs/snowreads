The Differential Equations (DEs)\ndescribing transformer transients are relatively complex, requiring the use of\nnumerical DE solvers with small time steps. This implies that replicating\ntransformers with HIL DTs requires a continuous flow of accurate measurement\nsamples with a high sampling rate. The proposed method utilizes the Adaptive\nExtended Kalman Filter to estimate the parameters of transformer currents which\ncan be non-sinusoidal during transients such as transformer energization. Then,\nafter evaluating the validity of estimations, the proposed method utilizes the\nestimated parameters to reconstruct noiseless measurements with desirable\nsampling rates. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using\nEMTP-RV for simulating transformers and Matlab for executing the proposed\nmethod. The simulation results demonstrate that the method is able to\naccurately estimate and closely track the current measurements.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7BeAnTJNHToGgCB_14bB9GZkTZCHiZywUzORCc0rWRs","pdfSize":"942901","objectId":"0xf95deb1317c8e5a1bc8fdde38e242bdc33b4d065ae451ffc51f64c80dc01cb7d","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
