While this may enhance\nsecurity, it comes with a lower level of usability and another factor to be\nforgotten. A smartphone is an important device in daily life. With the growing\nnumber of sensors and features in a smartphone, keystroke dynamics may provide\nan easy-to-use method. In this paper, we introduce requirements for biometric\nauthentication and keystroke dynamics. This results in an evaluation scheme,\nwhich is applied to three selected approaches. Based on the comparison,\nkeystroke dynamics and the evaluation scheme are discussed. The obtained\nresults indicate that keystroke dynamics can be used as another authentication\nmethod but can be bypassed by stronger adversaries. For further research, a\ncommon data set would improve the comparability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CDXv_s5acvP79clACi6cLIsD2R51TKjX2mXB7JS56yg","pdfSize":"261838","objectId":"0xe28afc937d6fbae50687f59e2ada71204faabe99ca0ced4f45a379aeb3bb1e74","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
