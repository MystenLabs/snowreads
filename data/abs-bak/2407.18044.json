However, these chatbots risk providing unverified and\ninaccurate information because LLMs generate responses based on patterns\nlearned from diverse internet data. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) can\nhelp mitigate hallucinations and inaccuracies in LLM responses by grounding it\non reliable content. However, efficiently and accurately retrieving most\nrelevant set of content for real-time user questions remains a challenge. In\nthis work, we introduce Query-Based Retrieval Augmented Generation (QB-RAG), a\nnovel approach that pre-computes a database of potential queries from a content\nbase using LLMs. For an incoming patient question, QB-RAG efficiently matches\nit against this pre-generated query database using vector search, improving\nalignment between user questions and the content. We establish a theoretical\nfoundation for QB-RAG and provide a comparative analysis of existing retrieval\nenhancement techniques for RAG systems. Finally, our empirical evaluation\ndemonstrates that QB-RAG significantly improves the accuracy of healthcare\nquestion answering, paving the way for robust and trustworthy LLM applications\nin digital health.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7vIX51dtiEp-Pm8vDmQ-PtDwCvXa7tbFpdWWnS18UGU","pdfSize":"1044834","objectId":"0x94ab37249efa74f4ee6d34b03efda39cc330074d44629b9fdd91460203b43338","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
