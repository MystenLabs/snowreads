In this study, we outline a\nprocedure to derive theoretical constraints on the upper bound of the kinetic\nmixing parameter $\\epsilon^2(M_U)$ using dilepton data from heavy-ion from SIS\nto RHIC energies. The analysis is based on the microscopic Parton-Hadron-String\nDynamics (PHSD) transport model, which successfully reproduces the measured\ndilepton spectra in $p+p$, $p+A$, and $A+A$ collisions. Besides the dilepton\nchannels resulting from interactions and decays of Standard Model particles\n(such as mesons and baryons), we extend the PHSD approach to include the decay\nof hypothetical $U$-bosons into dileptons, $U \\to e^+ e^-$. The production of\nthese $U$-bosons occurs via Dalitz decays of pions, $\\eta$-mesons,\n$\\omega$-mesons, Delta resonances, as well as from the decays of vector mesons\nand $K^+$ mesons. This analysis provides an upper limit on $\\epsilon^2(M_U)$\nand offers insights into the accuracy required for future experimental searches\nfor dark photons through dilepton experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"B1s8c5rozKWfXakIKjMlEitLLhSCOD_BmzI7_NEXWkU","pdfSize":"772527"}
