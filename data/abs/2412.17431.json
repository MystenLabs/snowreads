Under this scale-invariance\nassumption, the effective diffusivity of a 2D turbulent flow is dimensionally\ncontrolled by the energy flux and the friction coefficient only. Surprisingly,\nhowever, we show that such scaling predictions are invalidated by numerical\nsolutions of the 2D Navier-Stokes equation forced at intermediate wave number\nand damped by weak linear or quadratic drag. We derive alternate scaling-laws\nfor the effective diffusivity based on the emergence of intense, isolated\nvortices causing spatially inhomogeneous frictional dissipation localized\nwithin the small vortex cores. The predictions quantitatively match DNS data.\nThis study points to a universal large-scale organization of 2D turbulent flows\nin physical space, bridging standard 2D Navier-Stokes turbulence with\nlarge-scale geophysical turbulence.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qjbA_bmRGCq6G1RI7qLQ8Va49rsks5Qq_BBYaneEPVk","pdfSize":"17490969"}
