Our focus is the structure\nof the exceptional point manifolds in the parameter space which we describe in\nall analytic details. In particular, we characterize the manifold of\nbifurcation points corresponding to largest dissipation, and describe the\nrelative effective quantum Zeno dynamics in the bifurcation-free regime, which\nmay occur at relatively small dissipation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"OwEYhGwKOAneWKkeiCUmAHlVElFSUy59T6MzSIAZlNw","pdfSize":"1663898"}
