Here, we illustrate a first small\nstep towards AI-assisted analyses and a glimpse of the potential of MAS to\nautomate and optimize scientific workflows in Cosmology. The system\narchitecture of our example package, that builds upon the autogen/ag2\nframework, can be applied to MAS in any area of quantitative scientific\nresearch. The particular task we apply our methods to is the cosmological\nparameter analysis of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope lensing power spectrum\nlikelihood using Monte Carlo Markov Chains.
