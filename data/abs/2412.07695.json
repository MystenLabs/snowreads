  "abstract": "  Various phenomenological consequences of seesaw theories for the generation\nof the fermion mass hierarchy of the Standard Model have been analyzed, with an\nemphasis on models in which the light-active neutrino masses are derived from\nlow-scale seesaw mechanisms. In particular, fermion masses and lepton\nflavor-violating decay processes, the flavor-changing neutral current, have\nbeen studied, and the implications of these theories for the observed dark\nmatter relic density in the Universe have been determined. From the analysis of\nthese phenomenological aspects, it was possible to determine the allowed\nparameter spaces of these theories and to obtain a parameter fit consistent\nwith the currently measured experimental values. In this way, correlations\nbetween the different observables of the fermionic sector could be obtained,\nwhere all values were within the experimental ranges at $3\\sigma$. Predictions\nfor new physics consistent with cosmological limits were also obtained.\n",
