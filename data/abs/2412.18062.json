  "abstract": "  We consider the problem of solvability of linear differential equations over\na differential field~$K$. We introduce a class of special differential field\nextensions, which widely generalizes the classical class of extensions of\ndifferential fields by integrals and by exponentials of integrals and which has\nsimilar properties. We announce the following result: if a linear differential\nequation over $K$ can not be solved by generalized quadratures, then no special\nextension can help solve it. In the paper we prove a weaker version of this\nresult in which we consider only pure transcendental extensions of $K$. Our\npaper is self-contained and understandable for beginners. It demonstrates the\npower of Liouville's original approach to problems of solvability of equations\nin finite terms.\n",
