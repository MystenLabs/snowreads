  "abstract": "  Quantum technologies offer ways to solve certain tasks more quickly,\nefficiently, and with greater sensitivity than their classical counterparts.\nYet substantial challenges remain in the construction of sufficiently\nerror-free and scaleable quantum platforms that are needed to unlock any real\nbenefits to society. Acknowledging that this hardware can take vastly different\nforms, our review here focuses on so-called spintronic\n(\\textit{i.e.}~spin-electronic) materials that use electronic or nuclear spins\nto embody qubits. Towards helping the reader to spot trends and pick winners,\nwe have surveyed the various families of optically addressable spin qubits and\nattempted to benchmark and identify the most promising ones in each group. We\nreveal further trends that demonstrate how qubit lifetimes depend on the\nmaterial's synthesis, the concentration/distribution of its embedded qubits,\nand the experimental conditions.\n",
