  "abstract": "  In this work, we introduce several approximations of the Iterative\nStockholder Analysis (ISA) method based on exponential basis functions. These\napproximations are categorized into linear and non-linear models, referred to\nas LISA and NLIS, respectively. By particular choices of hyperparameters in the\nNLIS model, both LISA and the Minimal-Basis Iterative Stockholder (MBIS) method\ncan be reproduced. Four LISA variants are constructed using systematically\ngenerated exponential basis functions derived from the NLIS model applied to\natomic systems. The performance of these LISA variants and NLIS models is\nbenchmarked on 15 small molecules, including neutral, anionic, and cationic\nspecies. To facilitate comparison, we propose several metrics designed to\nhighlight differences between the methods. Our results demonstrate that LISA,\nemploying Gaussian basis functions derived from the NLIS model on isolated\natomic systems, achieves an optimal balance of computational accuracy,\nrobustness, and efficiency, particularly in minimizing the objective function.\n",
