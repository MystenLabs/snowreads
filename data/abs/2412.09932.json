Although electrical circuits have proven to be\na versatile platform for realizing various types of topological insulators,\nobserving edge solitons and their phase transition in circuit lattices remains\nchallenging. Here, we realize quench dynamics in nonlinear electrical circuits\nand experimentally demonstrate the existence of both topological and\nnontopological edge solitons in a trimer circuit lattice, as well as the phase\ntransition between these two types of edge solitons. Under weak nonlinearity,\nwe observe antisymmetric and symmetric edge solitons bifurcating from their\nrespective linear topological edge states. In contrast, under strong\nnonlinearity, nontopological edge solitons with antisymmetric, symmetric, and\nasymmetric internal structures are discovered. Our work paves the way for\nexploring exotic nonlinear states and novel phase diagrams in nonlinear\ntopological systems.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"ed2DbqbwjdvFiswspVMohbwMqDddC_C5ix5R7u2q1Fw","pdfSize":"3055743"}
