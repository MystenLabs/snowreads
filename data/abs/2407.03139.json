This\nmanuscript discusses how the Born rule might be explained by Schrodinger\nequation dynamics, if a measurement comprises a system responding to random\nfluctuations until it is within an arbitrarily small tolerance of a measurement\neigenstate. We describe the random walk dynamics that produce this behavior in\nterms of a class of time-dependent, stochastic unitary matrices U(t). We also\ndiscuss the class of stochastic potential energies in the Schrodinger equation\nthat is equivalent to this class of unitary matrices.\n  This analysis raises some questions worth considering, including how to\ndetermine if any measurements actually follow the predicted random walk\nmechanism and whether a reliable measurement apparatus could be designed that\ndeviates from Born rule probabilities. Interestingly, if any measurements do\nfollow this random walk mechanism, then exposing a quantum system to stochastic\n'noise' is an intrinsic part of such a measurement, not merely an unwanted side\neffect. This characteristic would have implications for reducing noise in\nquantum sensing and quantum computing.\n  This is a draft of a work in progress. Questions and suggestions are welcome.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IvFzOu1-p9YxsEs-NwJIfpM5DZxR7iSDn5qC0FJHL3I","pdfSize":"663021"}
