A $k$-tuple of partitions $(\\xi_1, \\xi_2, \\ldots,\n\\xi_k)$ is said to be $\\ell$-regular if all the $\\xi_i$'s are $\\ell$-regular.\nWe study the cases $(\\ell, k)=(2,3), (4,3), (\\ell, p)$, where $p$ is a prime,\nand even the general case when both $\\ell$ and $k$ are unrestricted. Using\nelementary means as well as the theory of modular forms we prove several\ninfinite family of congruences and density results for these family of\npartitions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"jOdXV1SOWdtHon36IsbTzFrIaxKgKZIU68G4fRqem0o","pdfSize":"271392"}
