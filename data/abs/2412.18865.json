In\nthis paper, we attempt to employ Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to solve the\nproblem of 4WIS4WID mobile robot navigation in a structured, automated\nagricultural field. This paper consists of three sections: parameterization of\nfour-wheel steering configurations, crop row tracking using DRL, and autonomous\nnavigation of 4WIS4WID mobile robot using DRL through multiple crop rows. We\nshow how to parametrize various configurations of four-wheel steering to two\nvariables. This includes symmetric four-wheel steering, zero-turn, and an\nadditional steering configuration that allows the 4WIS4WID mobile robot to move\nlaterally. Using DRL, we also followed an irregularly shaped crop row with\nsymmetric four-wheel steering. In the multiple crop row simulation environment,\nwith the help of waypoints, we effectively performed point-to-point navigation.\nFinally, a comparative analysis of various DRL algorithms that use continuous\nactions was carried out.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0DlaqS2Qg8FsnxGkHOs3zK_2aghVkpbFA0zN8_3X9bo","pdfSize":"4841920"}
