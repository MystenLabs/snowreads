There are several types of\nrobots that are present in the daily life, some of them are fully controlled by\nhumans while others are programmed to be self-controlled. In addition there are\nself-control robots with partial human control. Robots can be classified into\nthree major kinds: industry robots, autonomous robots and mobile robots.\nIndustry robots are used in industries and factories to perform mankind tasks\nin the easier and faster way which will help in developing products. Typically\nindustrial robots perform difficult and dangerous tasks, as they lift heavy\nobjects, handle chemicals, paint and assembly work and so on. They are working\nall the time hour after hour, day by day with the same precision and they do\nnot get tired which means that they do not make errors due to fatigue. Indeed,\nthey are ideally suited to complete repetitive tasks.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Robotics","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zF-kGXEGlUUd0T2fsDIEeHjqiV5NoXtnjyotHiz4wQo","pdfSize":"233769"}
