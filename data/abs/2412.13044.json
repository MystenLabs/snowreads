  "abstract": "  This work extends the adjoint-deep learning framework for runaway electron\n(RE) evolution developed in Ref. [C. McDevitt et al., A physics-constrained\ndeep learning treatment of runaway electron dynamics, Submitted to Physics of\nPlasmas (2024)] to account for large-angle collisions. By incorporating\nlarge-angle collisions the framework allows the avalanche of REs to be\ncaptured, an essential component to RE dynamics. This extension is accomplished\nby using a Rosenbluth-Putvinski approximation to estimate the distribution of\nsecondary electrons generated by large-angle collisions. By evolving both the\nprimary and multiple generations of secondary electrons, the present\nformulation is able to capture both the detailed temporal evolution of a RE\npopulation beginning from an arbitrary initial momentum space distribution,\nalong with providing approximations to the saturated growth and decay rates of\nthe RE population. Predictions of the adjoint-deep learning framework are\nverified against a traditional RE solver, with good agreement present across a\nbroad range of parameters.\n",
