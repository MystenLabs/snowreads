In this study, we have\nconsidered a Bumblebee field under vacuum expectation value condition (VEV)\nwith BI metric and studied the cosmological parameters along with observational\ndata. Further, we have studied the effect of anisotropy and the Bumblebee field\nin cosmic evolution. We have also studied the effect of both anisotropy and\nBumblebee field while considering the Universe as a dynamical system. We have\nfound that there are some prominent roles of both anisotropy and the Bumblebee\nfield in cosmic evolutions. We have also observed an elongated matter-dominated\nphase as compared to standard cosmology. Moreover, while studying the dynamical\nsystem analysis, we have also observed the shift of critical points from\nstandard $\\Lambda$CDM results showing the anisotropy and the Bumblebee field\neffect.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GTvnORYRa0sstYXXI5xqXBVp-Jhb5pV-aZWvYK5lbIQ","pdfSize":"2032530","objectId":"0x8dec47b0a461785be41792cf4f61c241fcf1d97ed045e4f8fb5ded44ed9a152d","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
