  "abstract": "  In earlier work, we characterized the class of matroids with no $M(C_4)$ as\nan induced minor and the class of matroids with no member of\n$\\{M(C_4),M(K_4)\\}$ as an induced minor. In this paper, for every two matroids\nin $\\{M(C_4),M(K_4\\backslash e),M(K_4),F_7\\}$, we determine the class of\nmatroids that have neither of the chosen pair as an induced minor.\nAdditionally, we prove structural lemmas toward characterizing the class of\nmatroids that do not contain $M(K_4)$ as an induced minor.\n",
