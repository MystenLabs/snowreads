In this work, we carefully investigate the evolution of\nthis system numerically with multiple superradiant modes. Simple formulas are\nobtained to estimate important timescales, maximum masses of different modes,\nas well as the BH mass and spin at various times. Due to the coexistence of\nmodes with small frequency differences, the BH-condensate system emits\ngravitational waves with a unique beat signature, which could be directly\nobserved by current and projected interferometers. Besides, the current BH\nspin-mass data from the binary BH merger events already excludes the vector\nmass in the range $5\\times 10^{-15}\\ \\mathrm{eV} <\\mu< 9\\times 10^{-12}\\\n\\mathrm{eV}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Uc8EZ2jnThFxmToy14MknfmkxuktJ5eJkXtC_MkNJJo","pdfSize":"5364732"}
