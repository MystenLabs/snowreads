In this work, we\ntherefore focus upon the dynamic nature of the inner horizon in the course of\nmass inflation. We model this phenomenon with a massive chargeless scalar field\nminimally coupled with the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om spacetime. Employing the\nEinstein-Maxwell field equation coupled with the Klein-Gordon equation, we\nobtain a nonlinear dynamical equation for the inner horizon coupled with the\ndynamics of the mass function and the scalar field. In the S-wave\napproximation, we develop a perturbative solution about the dynamic inner\nhorizon and obtain an analytical solution as a polynomial of twelfth degree.\nOur detailed analysis shows that the inner horizon moves inward in the course\nof mass inflation. Higher the mass of the scalar field, faster are the\nshrinking rate of the inner horizon and the rate of mass inflation. Our\nsolution for dynamic shrinking of the inner horizon suggests that a\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om spacetime tends towards a Schwarzschild-like geometry, in\nthe infinite advanced time limit.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-h7MC5Rxk1i3szQsXCrSYFL54y70YHOMoeqFEc8zYCA","pdfSize":"208899"}
