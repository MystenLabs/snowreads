CITO formulates a mathematical program with\ncomplementarity constraints (MPCC) that enforces that contact forces must be\nzero when points are not in contact. However, MPCC solve times increase steeply\nwith the number of allowable points of contact, which limits CITO's\napplicability to problems in which only a few, simple geometries are allowed to\nmake contact. This paper introduces simultaneous trajectory optimization and\ncontact selection (STOCS), as an extension of CITO that overcomes this\nlimitation. The innovation of STOCS is to identify salient contact points and\ntimes inside the iterative trajectory optimization process. This effectively\nreduces the number of variables and constraints in each MPCC invocation. The\nSTOCS framework, instantiated with key contact identification subroutines,\nrenders the optimization of manipulation trajectories computationally tractable\neven for high-fidelity geometries consisting of tens of thousands of vertices.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LmfGES54iAySMTKEqMtcVK7MiHsRlOTBFNIbpVB8SZU","pdfSize":"5731200"}
