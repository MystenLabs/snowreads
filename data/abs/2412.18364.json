In this paper, we describe a number of Natural Language Understanding\nmodels that extract explicit symbolic triples from social conversation. Triple\nextraction has mostly been developed and tested for Knowledge Base Completion\nusing Wikipedia text and data for training and testing. However, social\nconversation is very different as a genre in which interlocutors exchange\ninformation in sequences of utterances that involve statements, questions, and\nanswers. Phenomena such as co-reference, ellipsis, coordination, and implicit\nand explicit negation or confirmation are more prominent in conversation than\nin Wikipedia text. We therefore describe an attempt to fill this gap by\nreleasing data sets for training and testing triple extraction from social\nconversation. We also created five triple extraction models and tested them in\nour evaluation data. The highest precision is 51.14 for complete triples and\n69.32 for triple elements when tested on single utterances. However, scores for\nconversational triples that span multiple turns are much lower, showing that\nextracting knowledge from true conversational data is much more challenging.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dPMTjE4Gd5XKLAQBqgRrgBeyavvuCWUsXZJ46Lj4R4M","pdfSize":"176567"}
