Given the lack of available labeled data\nto train such systems and the unbalanced nature of publicly available datasets,\nwe argue that the reliability of deep learning models is limited, even if they\ncan be shown to obtain perfect classification accuracy on the test data. One\nway of evaluating the reliability of such systems is to ensure that models use\nthe same regions of input images for predictions as medical experts would. In\nthis paper, we show that pre-training a deep neural network on a large-scale\nproxy task, as well as using mixed objective optimization network (MOON), a\ntechnique to balance different classes during pre-training and fine-tuning, can\nimprove the alignment of decision foundations between models and experts, as\ncompared to a model directly trained on the target dataset. At the same time,\nthese approaches keep perfect classification accuracy according to the area\nunder the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) on the test set, and\nimprove generalization on an independent, unseen dataset. For the purpose of\nreproducibility, our source code is made available online.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"07_pxdXO-OMqwsP9S3qIvLTL9eQRWTNpAHHV3P698t8","pdfSize":"2831464"}
