We propose a novel deep\nlearning-based approach to design the encoder and decoder functions that aim to\nmaximize the sumrate of the interference channel for discrete constellations.\nWe first consider the MaxSINR algorithm, a state-of-the-art linear scheme for\nGaussian inputs, as the baseline and then propose a modified version of the\nalgorithm for discrete inputs. We then propose a neural network-based approach\nthat learns a constellation mapping with the objective of maximizing the\nsumrate. We provide numerical results to show that the constellations learned\nby the neural network-based approach provide enhanced alignments, not just in\nbeamforming directions but also in terms of the effective constellation at the\nreceiver, thereby leading to improved sum-rate performance.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QOmbPE-R1BGAF0nv7LTEpdujG9PZYOCcQeWDB0rwmdM","pdfSize":"2531540","objectId":"0x68e89f19813d0cc27ec23345089fe47ba47aa363226b2c66a8a42725dea0931b","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
