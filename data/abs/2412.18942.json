We consider the physical origin of improper\nferroelectricity in Mott insulating materials. Beyond the well-known\nKatsura-Nagaosa-Balatsky's inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya mechanism for the\nnoncollinearly ordered magnets, we point out the induction of the electric\npolarizations in the multipolar ordered Mott insulators. Using the multiflavor\nrepresentation for the multipolar magnetic moments, we can show the crossover\nor transition from the pure inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya mechanism to the pure\nmultipolar origin for the ferroelectricity, and also incorporate the\nintermediate regime with the mixture of both origins. We expect our results to\ninspire the reexamination of the ferroelectricity among the multipolar-ordered\nmagnets.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HG0RD_M7AAV-IXp6SByK6VItUuFNiuVPCsdoIZOIIyE","pdfSize":"583078"}
