VLM classification can be\nimproved with descriptions generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). However,\nit is difficult to determine the contribution of actual description semantics,\nas the performance gain may also stem from a semantic-agnostic ensembling\neffect, where multiple modified text prompts act as a noisy test-time\naugmentation for the original one. We propose an alternative evaluation\nscenario to decide if a performance boost of LLM-generated descriptions is\ncaused by such a noise augmentation effect or rather by genuine description\nsemantics. The proposed scenario avoids noisy test-time augmentation and\nensures that genuine, distinctive descriptions cause the performance boost.\nFurthermore, we propose a training-free method for selecting discriminative\ndescriptions that work independently of classname-ensembling effects. Our\napproach identifies descriptions that effectively differentiate classes within\na local CLIP label neighborhood, improving classification accuracy across seven\ndatasets. Additionally, we provide insights into the explainability of\ndescription-based image classification with VLMs.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8uztJVveKfwJCLxcc3w1jt3larm3Ot7vjukR892noOE","pdfSize":"2578808"}
