  "abstract": "  We consider graphs where edges and their signs are added independently at\nrandom from among all pairs of nodes. We establish strong concentration\ninequalities for adjacency and Laplacian matrices obtained from this family of\nrandom graph models. Then, we apply our results to study graphs sampled from\nthe signed stochastic block model. Namely, we take a two-community setting\nwhere edges within the communities have positive signs and edges between the\ncommunities have negative signs and apply a random sign perturbation with\nprobability $0< s <1/2$. In this setting, our findings include: first, the\nspectral gap of the corresponding signed Laplacian matrix concentrates near\n$2s$ with high probability; and second, the sign of the first eigenvector of\nthe Laplacian matrix defines a weakly consistent estimator for the balanced\ncommunity detection problem, or equivalently, the $\\pm 1$ synchronization\nproblem. We supplement our theoretical contributions with experimental data\nobtained from the models under consideration.\n",
