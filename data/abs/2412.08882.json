Presumably, the chiral phase\ntransition is of second order for two-flavor QCD in the chiral limit. Near the\ntransition temperature, we apply the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism and construct\na low energy effective field theory (EFT) for the system, in which fluctuations\nand dissipations are systematically captured. Dynamical variables involve\nchiral charge densities and order parameter. The EFT action is further\nconfirmed within a modified AdS/QCD model using the holographic\nSchwinger-Keldysh technique. With suitable higher terms neglected, the\nstochastic equations derived from the EFT resemble those of model F in the\nHohenberg-Halperin classification. Within the EFT, we briefly discuss\nspontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry and the Goldstone modes.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3rPNTJW51PAcuZggFepGd7VsIYYjMfe1wurEEiTKdsc","pdfSize":"595751"}
