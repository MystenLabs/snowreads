  "abstract": "  We study the gamma-ray emission from millisecond pulsars within the Milky\nWay's globular cluster system in order to measure the luminosity function of\nthis source population. We find that these pulsars have a mean luminosity of\n$\\langle L_{\\gamma}\\rangle \\sim (1-8)\\times 10^{33}\\, {\\rm erg/s}$ (integrated\nbetween 0.1 and 100 GeV) and a log-normal width of $\\sigma_L \\sim 1.4-2.8$. If\nthe Galactic Center Gamma-Ray Excess were produced by pulsars with similar\ncharacteristics, Fermi would have already detected $N \\sim 17-37$ of these\nsources, whereas only three such pulsar candidates have been identified. We\nconclude that the excess gamma-ray emission can originate from pulsars only if\nthey are significantly less bright, on average, than those observed within\nglobular clusters or in the Galactic Plane. This poses a serious challenge for\npulsar interpretation of the Galactic Center Gamma-Ray Excess.\n",
