This limits transport, delivery, and effectiveness of chemicals used as\nreactants, nutrients, pesticides, or for waste remediation. This work develops\nmagnetically responsive microrollers that navigate the complex interstitial\nnetwork of porous matter. Rather than arresting on the upward facing surfaces\nof the pores, particles can roll and fall further, increasing transport by\norders of magnitude. This work directly investigates Janus microrollers,\nactivated by a rotating magnetic field, rolling and sedimenting though an\nindex-matched porous medium. The mechanism of enhanced transport is determined,\nand the material flux is primarily a function of microroller concentration,\nrotation rate, and magnetic field strength. This mechanism is most efficient\nusing a minimum number of rotations spaced out periodically in time to reduce\nthe required energy input to greatly enhance transport. This general mechanism\nof transport enhancement can be broadly applied in numerous applications\nbecause the particles delivered within the porous matrix may be comprised of a\nwide variety of functional materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"L-YX0nmvEiT-4upGSNzYBv6CCRs61Jt8yuFdVcEmxBY","pdfSize":"1873742"}
