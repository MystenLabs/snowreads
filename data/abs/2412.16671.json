This is\nan application of the relative Poincar\\'e-Birkhoff theorem for Lagrangians in\nLiouville domains, as proven by the authors in arXiv:2408.06919.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"C8UsQfYFAL380s7DspCPMhhnN2SAuwaIZrwtxx2bKIU","pdfSize":"455775"}
