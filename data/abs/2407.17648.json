This connection is integral to the concept of twist structures,\nwhose origins can be traced back to the work of Kalman. In this paper, we\nobtain an expansion of the Fidel-Vakarelov construction, applying it to monadic\nGodel algebras (or monadic prelinear Heyting algebras). This extension leads to\nthe emergence of a new variety, which we aptly term monadic prelinear Nelson\nalgebras.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AE40X2WUE4zKQINC0Ukw6hE0r7mivAvEbvkerFatdho","pdfSize":"164729"}
