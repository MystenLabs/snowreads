  "abstract": "  Cryptographic libraries, an essential part of cybersecurity, are shown to be\nsusceptible to different types of attacks, including side-channel and\nmemory-corruption attacks. In this article, we examine popular cryptographic\nlibraries in terms of the security measures they implement, pinpoint security\nvulnerabilities, and suggest security improvements in their development\nprocess.\n",
