  "abstract": "  For locally convex spaces, we systematize several known equivalent\ndefinitions of Fr\\'echet (G\\^ ateaux) Differentiability Spaces and Asplund\n(Weak Asplund) Spaces.\n  As an application, we extend the classical Mazur's theorem as follows: Let\n$E$ be a separable Baire locally convex space and let $Y$ be the product\n$\\prod_{\\alpha\\in A} E_{\\alpha}$ of any family of separable Fr\\'echet spaces;\nthen the product $E \\times Y$ is Weak Asplund. Also, we prove that the product\n$Y$ of any family of Banach spaces $(E_{\\alpha})$ is an Asplund locally convex\nspace if and only if each $E_{\\alpha}$ is Asplund.\n  Analogues of both results are valid under the same assumptions, if $Y$ is the\n$\\Sigma$-product of any family $(E_{\\alpha})$.\n",
