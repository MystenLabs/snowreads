  "abstract": "  The set of all virtual or classical braid diagrams forms a monoid and gives a\nnatural monoid action on a direct product of ${\\mathbb Z}$ called the up-down\naction. In this paper, we determine the orbit of every tuple of ${\\mathbb Z}$\nunder the up-down action of virtual or classical braid diagrams. Moreover, we\ndetermine the orbit for irreducible braid diagrams. We also consider the\nisotropy submonoid and give a condition for a braid diagram to admit an up-down\ncoloring to its closure.\n",
