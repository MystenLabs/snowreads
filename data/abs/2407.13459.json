We propose a fully\ndiscrete iterative scheme for solving this model. This scheme decoupled the\nflow and mechanics equations and extends the fixed-stress splitting scheme for\nthe Biot equations. We use finite elements in space and a backward Euler\ndiscretization in time. We show that the fixed stress split scheme is a\ncontraction.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DPYXmFsjzeYJ2q1UPMnl99OTnKo3B_ILYF8Ry_YOLv0","pdfSize":"133442","objectId":"0x4611a9b3d2a5efea9b05ac10ed5067828f3d269e1c5699bb46cf11758a68f198","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
