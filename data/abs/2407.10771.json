{"id":"2407.10771","title":"Growth of Science: How long will the United States uphold its position?","authors":"Dipak Patra","authorsParsed":[["Patra","Dipak",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2024 14:51:43 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-16","timestamp":1721055103000,"abstract":"  Policymakers often assess the growth of science in a country and compare it\nwith that of other countries to set future planning for scientific research\nfocusing on the sustainable development and economic growth of the country.\nHere, we study the growth of science for the period of 1996-2020 corresponding\nto the top fifty countries with the highest publications in 2020. It is found\nthat the annual growth rates of scientific and technical journal publications\nexhibit Taylor's power law behavior indicating the dependence of the variance\non the mean growth rate and the distributions of annual growth rates follow\nskew-symmetric distributions. Furthermore, we have computed the entropy based\non annual publication numbers among the countries to assess the spatial\ndisparity in the system. The entropy is found to increase mostly linear with\ntime reducing the disparity among the countries. By performing the linear\nregression analysis, we predict that around the year 2046, all the countries\nexcluding China may equally contribute towards the growth of science. We have\nalso assessed the stability of the current USA ranking by computing the entropy\nbetween the USA and other countries. Based on the regression analysis, it is\nestimated that three potential countries such as Indonesia, India, and Iran may\ntake the ranks ahead of the USA around the years 2024, 2029, and 2041\nrespectively.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"L36JC2NxCj1nnsHEOETmVw0ydiwz5HeZe7UFIPzvbB4","pdfSize":"5851566"}
