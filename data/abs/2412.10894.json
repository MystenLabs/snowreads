  "abstract": "  The response of the magnetosphere to interplanetary drivers depends on their\ntype. The reliability of their identification affects the conclusions of the\nanalysis of connections between the solar wind and the magnetosphere. In this\nwork, we analyze the list of moderate and strong geomagnetic storms and their\ninterplanetary sources for the period 2009 - 2019, presented in the work of Qiu\net al. It is shown that some of the events in this list were identified\nincorrectly, and their interpretation differs in ~20% of cases from our catalog\nby Yermolaev et al. (http://www.iki.rssi.ru/pub/omni/) for types of solar wind\nSheath, ICME and CIR, and in ~28% of cases from the Richardson and Cane catalog\nfor ICME. Using the unadjusted list of Qiu et al. may lead to incorrect\nidentification of interplanetary drivers of magnetic storms and erroneous\nconclusions. It is recommended to use the classification of interplanetary\nevents from catalogs of events accepted by the scientific community as\nreference ones.\n",
