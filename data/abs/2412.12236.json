  "abstract": "  The paper entitled \"Sustainability Strategy for the Cool Copper Collider\" by\nM. Breidenbach et al. defines a metric to weigh the electricity consumption and\nthe carbon footprint of future Higgs factory concepts. We show that this metric\nis flawed in many respects and gives an incorrect representation of reality. We\nalso demonstrates that, irrespective of the drawbacks of this particular\nestimator, the strategy consisting in using a metric as a multiplicative\ncoefficient of the electricity consumption or the carbon footprint of an\nensemble of colliders is fragile at best, and valueless when it comes to\narguing in favour of or against such or such future Higgs Factory concept.\n",
