However, sustainability is a comprehensive process for improvement in\nsustainable development that can be structured with the influence of\ninclusivity of empowered people. We define sustainability value, which measures\nthe merit of the process to contribute to sustainable development.\nSustainability is interrelated with the well-being and dignity of people; we\npropose a formula for dignified well-being to evaluate the benefit of dignity\nand well-being in an inclusive product lifecycle. This study uses the framework\nfor assessing inclusivity and empowerment to correlate the influence of\ninclusivity of empowered people on sustainability value and dignified\nwell-being. Based on the strength of the correlation, we can support the\nhypothesis that the inclusivity of empowered people can influence the\nsustainability value of the process and the dignified well-being of\nstakeholders. Due to the integration of qualitative methods in our approaches,\nwe tested it with an intercoder reliability test with three coders. Results\nshow high coder agreement and the generalisability of the framework.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4y93nBPB0OkDS1K-nypQZj0UJCCCh7NHnAjsz5QYLx0","pdfSize":"1910071"}
