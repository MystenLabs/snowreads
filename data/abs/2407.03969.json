However, they usually lack the\nflexibility required for analyzing specific characteristics of RL methods often\nrelevant to research. This paper presents Craftium, a novel framework for\nexploring and creating rich 3D visual RL environments that builds upon the\nMinetest game engine and the popular Gymnasium API. Minetest is built to be\nextended and can be used to easily create voxel-based 3D environments (often\nsimilar to Minecraft), while Gymnasium offers a simple and common interface for\nRL research. Craftium provides a platform that allows practitioners to create\nfully customized environments to suit their specific research requirements,\nranging from simple visual tasks to infinite and procedurally generated worlds.\nWe also provide five ready-to-use environments for benchmarking and as examples\nof how to develop new ones.
