Generalizing work of Balm,\nFriedl, Kalfagianni and Powell, and of Lidman and Moore, we give an Alexander\npolynomial condition that obstructs cosmetic crossing changes for knots with\n$L$-space branched double covers, a family that includes all alternating knots.\nAs an application, we prove the cosmetic crossing conjecture for a\nfive-parameter infinite family of pretzel knots. We also discuss the state of\nthe conjecture for alternating knots with eleven crossings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BzJExAOykk-Y-ZA9ndNO3p1YPcXpCk0pzWcoLzzMIMQ","pdfSize":"408942","objectId":"0xb53387db3d65918c4f47f758b93bf072941d825647e714ec87c1dca15dbd6c80","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
