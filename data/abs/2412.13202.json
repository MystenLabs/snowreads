  "abstract": "  This report investigates the modular organisation of the Central region in\nthe Drosophila connectome. We identify groups of neurones amongst which\ninformation circulates rapidly before spreading to the rest of the network\nusing Infomap. We find that information flows along pathways linking distant\nneurones, forming modules that span across the brain. Remarkably, these\nmodules, derived solely from neuronal connectivity patterns, exhibit a striking\nleft-right symmetry in their spatial distribution as well as in their\nconnections. We also identify a hierarchical structure at the coarse-grained\nscale of these modules, demonstrating the directional nature of information\nflow in the system.\n",
