In these\nsystems, norms emerge as a fundamental component to regulate the behaviour of\nagents, promoting cooperation, coordination and conflict resolution. This\narticle presents a systematic review, following the PRISMA method, on the\nemergence of norms in MAS, exploring the main mechanisms and factors that\ninfluence this process. Sociological, structural, emotional and cognitive\naspects that facilitate the creation, propagation and reinforcement of norms\nare addressed. The findings highlight the crucial role of social network\ntopology, as well as the importance of emotions and shared values in the\nadoption and maintenance of norms. Furthermore, opportunities are identified\nfor future research that more explicitly integrates emotional and ethical\ndynamics in the design of adaptive normative systems. This work provides a\ncomprehensive overview of the current state of research on norm emergence in\nMAS, serving as a basis for advancing the development of more efficient and\nflexible systems in artificial and real-world contexts.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"qGqBWfJdy7_2TXDd_S0Yd_QHWwK4-2woM9UWIrA56wA","pdfSize":"1138761"}
