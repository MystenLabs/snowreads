It will conduct\nUV-visible and near-infrared follow-up observations of astrophysical\ntransients, drawing from a broad pool of targets accessible through the\nstreaming services of wide-field telescopes, both current and future, as well\nas high-energy satellites. The instrument will cater to various scientific\nobjectives within the astrophysical community, each entailing specific\nrequirements for observation planning. SOXS will operate at the European\nSouthern Observatory (ESO) in La Silla, without the presence of astronomers on\nthe mountain. This poses a unique challenge for the scheduling process,\ndemanding a fully automated algorithm that is autonomously interacting with the\nappropriate databases and the La Silla Weather API, and is capable of\npresenting the operator not only with an ordered list of optimal targets (in\nterms of observing constraints) but also with optimal backups in the event of\nchanging weather conditions. This imposes the necessity for a scheduler with\nrapid-response capabilities without compromising the optimization process,\nensuring the high quality of observations and best use of the time at the\ntelescope. We thus developed a new highly available and scalable architecture,\nimplementing API Restful applications like Docker Containers, API Gateway, and\nPython-based Flask frameworks. We provide an overview of the current state of\nthe scheduler, which is now ready for the approaching on-site testing during\nCommissioning phase, along with insights into its web interface and preliminary\nperformance tests.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Y4qlMJOVrtcWeoTtk0huBfU-vX-qKs8nxF-N3S8QaqY","pdfSize":"665384"}
