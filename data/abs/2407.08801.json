While\nrecent studies use Domain Generalization (DG) techniques to mitigate this by\nlearning domain-invariant features, most are designed for a single task and\nneglect the potential of testing data. Despite In-Context Learning (ICL)\nshowcasing multi-task learning capability, it usually relies on high-quality\ncontext-rich data and considers a single dataset, and has rarely been studied\nin point cloud understanding. In this paper, we introduce a novel, practical,\nmulti-domain multi-task setting, handling multiple domains and multiple tasks\nwithin one unified model for domain generalized point cloud understanding. To\nthis end, we propose Domain Generalized Point-In-Context Learning (DG-PIC) that\nboosts the generalizability across various tasks and domains at testing time.\nIn particular, we develop dual-level source prototype estimation that considers\nboth global-level shape contextual and local-level geometrical structures for\nrepresenting source domains and a dual-level test-time feature shifting\nmechanism that leverages both macro-level domain semantic information and\nmicro-level patch positional relationships to pull the target data closer to\nthe source ones during the testing. Our DG-PIC does not require any model\nupdates during the testing and can handle unseen domains and multiple tasks,\n\\textit{i.e.,} point cloud reconstruction, denoising, and registration, within\none unified model. We also introduce a benchmark for this new setting.\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate that DG-PIC outperforms state-of-the-art\ntechniques significantly.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_2xnPAEtqyJ4IGU6YSyX4m47D8od5SdblzCEdwlsbfw","pdfSize":"3079919"}
