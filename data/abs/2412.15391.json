In\n2020, by considering knot mosaics on $n \\times n$ polygons with boundary edge\nidentification, Ganzell and Henrich extended the study of mosaic knots to\ninclude virtual knots - knots embedded in thickened surfaces. They also\nprovided a set of virtual mosaic moves preserving knot and link type. In this\npaper, we introduce rectangular mosaics for virtual knots, defined to be $m\n\\times n$ arrays of classical knot mosaic tiles, along with an edge\nidentification of the boundary of the mosaic, whose closures produce virtual\nknots. We modify Ganzell and Henrich's mosaic moves to the rectangular setting,\nprovide several invariants of virtual rectangular mosaics, and give algorithms\nfor computations of common virtual knot invariants.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4yf9oSWOhMO7N0Hk3FZDWne0Nw5ccEP8ATChQLVyPx0","pdfSize":"634205"}
