We demonstrate that the\npath-integral formulation of this HK-GFT provides a completion of a\ncorresponding spinfoam model developed earlier; we also show that the HK-GFT\nadmits a unique Fock representation that describes the quantum three-geometries\nof the HK model. These results provide a link to the canonical quantization of\nthe HK model and demonstrate how GFTs can bridge distinct quantization schemes.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SO52ksoI9u_bY_0eYUYVbbPBP1sEq3XkT8twkDDAqEg","pdfSize":"569156"}
