These complexities include slower\nconvergence and mismatched model allocation due to hierarchical model\naggregation and client selection. The proposed framework features a two-phase\nclient selection and a two-level model aggregation scheme. It ensures fairness\nand effective participation using greedy and round-robin methods. Our approach\nsignificantly enhances convergence speed, reduces training time, and decreases\nenergy consumption by up to 60%, ensuring clients receive models tailored to\ntheir specific data needs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IOo6EJuQSj1ZSTV7rEFyzsx3TA9YnHbxGVVlWLBXxQk","pdfSize":"6666210"}
