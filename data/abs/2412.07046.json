  "abstract": "  The Euclidean Steiner Tree Problem (EST) seeks a minimum-cost tree\ninterconnecting a given set of terminal points in the Euclidean plane, allowing\nthe use of additional intersection points. In this paper, we consider two\nvariants that include an additional straight line $\\gamma$ with zero cost,\nwhich must be incorporated into the tree. In the Euclidean Steiner fixed Line\nProblem (ESfL), this line is given as input and can be treated as a terminal.\nIn contrast, the Euclidean Steiner Line Problem (ESL) requires determining the\noptimal location of $\\gamma$. Despite recent advances, including heuristics and\na 1.214-approximation algorithm for both problems, a formal proof of\nNP-hardness has remained open. In this work, we close this gap by proving that\nboth the ESL and ESfL are NP-hard. Additionally, we prove that both problems\nadmit a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS), by demonstrating that\napproximation algorithms for the EST can be adapted to the ESL and ESfL with\nappropriate modifications. Specifically, we show ESfL$\\leq_{\\text{PTAS}}$EST\nand ESL$\\leq_{\\text{PTAS}}$EST, i.e., provide a PTAS reduction to the EST.\n",
