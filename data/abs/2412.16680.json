  "abstract": "  In this paper, we present PDFxTMD, a novel library for parton distribution\nfunctions (PDFs) which integrates both collinear PDFs (cPDFs) and transverse\nmomentum-dependent PDFs (TMDs). Designed with modern C++ principles, including\nthe Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP) and type erasure, PDFxTMD\nachieves high performance while ensuring extensibility. The library offers\nwell-defined interfaces for reading PDF grid files, as well as for\ninterpolation and extrapolation, enabling users to implement tailored solutions\nfor their specific needs. PDFxTMD supports standard file formats from LHAPDF\nand TMDLib, while also allowing for adaptability to non-standard formats\nthrough its extensible architecture. By providing a unified and efficient\nframework for PDF computations, PDFxTMD aims to enhance the toolkit available\nto the high-energy physics community for cross-section calculations in both\ncollinear and $k_t$-factorization frameworks.\n",
