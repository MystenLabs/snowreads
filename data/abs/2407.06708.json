However, the electron diffraction intensities are in general\nextremely sensitive to the excitation errors (i.e., deviation from the Bragg\ncondition) and the dynamical effects, which had prevented us from\nquantitatively discussing the crystal structure dynamics. Here, we develop a\nfour-dimensional precession electron diffraction (4D-PED) system by which time\n($t$) and electron-incident-angle ($\\phi$) dependences of electron diffraction\npatterns ($q_x,q_y$) are recorded. Nonequilibrium crystal structure refinement\non VTe$_{2}$ demonstrates that the ultrafast change in the crystal structure\ncan be quantitatively determined from 4D-PED. We further perform the analysis\nof the $\\phi$ dependence, from which we can qualitatively estimate the change\nin the reciprocal lattice vector parallel to the optical axis. These results\nshow the capability of the 4D-PED method for the quantitative investigation of\nultrafast crystal structural dynamics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"OaMwt2tud-5Cq5ZITPUeksIYwBdx4Qc4toAKxBwdvnk","pdfSize":"3142639"}
