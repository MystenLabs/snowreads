The past decade has seen important results\nrelated to both the limits of state transformation and the limits to their\nefficiency -- the quantum versions of the third and second law of\nthermodynamics. The limiting cases always involve an infinite resource cost,\ntypically machine complexity or time. Realistic state preparation takes into\naccount both a finite size of the machine and constraints on the operations we\ncan perform. In this work, we determine in full generality the optimal\noperation for a predominant quantum paradigm: state transformation under a\nsingle unitary operation upon a finite system, in the case where the\nobservables corresponding to the target (such as ground state probability) and\ncost (such as dissipation) commute. We then extend this result to the case of\nhaving a third, commuting, globally conserved quantity (such as total energy).\nThe results are demonstrated with the paradigmatic example of ground state\ncooling, for both arbitrary and energy-preserving unitary operations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hg6yUDYvgu9fxOK0j-AJbOhod8ADAq-hFXoUigFWxjQ","pdfSize":"1721283"}
