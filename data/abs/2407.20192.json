This paper explores a comprehensive approach to\ndemand forecasting at the origin-destination (O\\&D) level, focusing on the\ndevelopment and implementation of machine learning models in decision-making\nfor the air cargo industry. We leverage a mixture of experts framework,\ncombining statistical and advanced deep learning models to provide reliable\nforecasts for cargo demand over a six-month horizon. The results demonstrate\nthat our approach outperforms industry benchmarks, offering actionable insights\nfor cargo capacity allocation and strategic decision-making in the air cargo\nindustry. While this work is applied in the airline industry, the methodology\nis broadly applicable to any field where forecast-based decision-making in a\nvolatile environment is crucial.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lvmUZXNTK79ym7_Fe3WWrvUkZPyTs_YAHBoPLC7xq60","pdfSize":"553207","objectId":"0xc8e4b16e41745503fb0fcafee4c4291f7e5c34158572f6d671f1c1a096bca7a6","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
