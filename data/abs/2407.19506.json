However, superlenses\nare easily affected by weak intrinsic losses and hyperlenses cannot achieve\nperfect imaging, significantly constraining their practical utility. To address\nthese challenges, here we propose a perfect hyperlens based on the\ntransformation optics. Importantly, perfect hyperlens is capable of\nself-focusing in geometrical optics while supporting propagating waves with\nexceptionally large wavenumbers, which endows it with key advantages such as\nultra-high resolution, no aberration and strong robustness. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate the hyperbolic focusing performance in naturally in-plane\nhyperbolic polaritons of {\\alpha}-MoO3 films numerically, which can be achieved\nby gradient thickness. The results greatly innovate the design principles of\ntraditional imaging lens, providing many potentially significant applications\nfor super-resolution real-time imaging, lithography, and sensing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vfNlkLOd8_qE-5GMthAhJje5nZoAgJk8h76ivqbKwNQ","pdfSize":"4222287","objectId":"0x532634bc00820e5a392c0d18139a68d5ae0efa71473ac13e3e70e7d2133764a0","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
