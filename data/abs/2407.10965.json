To test the accordance\nof cosmological and laboratory constraints in the absence of such priors, we\nintroduce an effective neutrino mass parameter that extends consistently to\nnegative values. For the $\\Lambda$CDM model, we analyze data from Planck, ACT,\nand DESI and find a $2.8-3.3\\sigma$ tension with the constraints from\noscillation experiments. Motivated by recent hints of evolving dark energy, we\nanalyze the $w_0w_a$ and mirage dark energy models, showing that they favour\nlarger masses consistent with laboratory data, respectively $\\sum\nm_{\\nu,\\mathrm{eff}} = 0.06_{-0.10}^{+0.15}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and $\\sum\nm_{\\nu,\\mathrm{eff}} = 0.04_{-0.11}^{+0.15}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ (both at 68\\%).\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_IICxIzxPt5c6xFQVgcksyePJUrE62Cm_xNW9_00Skc","pdfSize":"693611"}
