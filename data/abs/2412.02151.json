We consider a class of latent space\nmodels that decompose latent vectors into shared and network-specific\ncomponents across networks. We develop a novel procedure that first identifies\nthe shared latent vectors and further refines estimates through efficient score\nequations to achieve statistical efficiency. Oracle error rates for estimating\nthe shared and heterogeneous latent vectors are established simultaneously. The\nanalysis framework offers remarkable flexibility, accommodating various types\nof edge weights under exponential family distributions.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NwgY6QgrpAYXxlbtmM1mekFayJAV_Q0nJuqRKYROrAU","pdfSize":"655854"}
