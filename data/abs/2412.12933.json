  "abstract": "  Community structures are critical for understanding the mesoscopic\norganization of networks, bridging local and global patterns. While methods\nsuch as DeepWalk and node2vec capture local positional information through\nrandom walks, they fail to preserve community structures. Other approaches like\nmodularized nonnegative matrix factorization and evolutionary algorithms\naddress this gap but are computationally expensive and unsuitable for\nlarge-scale networks. To overcome these limitations, we propose Two Layer Walk\n(TLWalk), a novel graph embedding algorithm that incorporates hierarchical\ncommunity structures. TLWalk balances intra- and inter-community relationships\nthrough a community-aware random walk mechanism without requiring additional\nparameters. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that TLWalk effectively mitigates\nlocality bias. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that TLWalk outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 3.2% accuracy gains for link\nprediction tasks. By encoding dense local and sparse global structures, TLWalk\nproves robust and scalable across diverse networks, offering an efficient\nsolution for network analysis.\n",
