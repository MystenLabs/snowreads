Therefore, recent research on spectrum\nprediction has focused on the use of these tools. However, spectrum prediction,\nwhich involves forecasting wireless spectrum availability, is an older field\nwhere many \"classical\" tools were considered around the 2010s, such as Markov\nmodels. This work revisits high-order Markov models for spectrum prediction in\ndynamic wireless environments. We introduce a framework to address mismatches\nbetween sensing length and model order as well as state-space complexity\narising with large order. Furthermore, we extend this Markov framework by\nenabling fine-tuning of the probability transition matrix through\ngradient-based supervised learning, offering a hybrid approach that bridges\nprobabilistic modeling and modern machine learning. Simulations on real-world\nWi-Fi traffic demonstrate the competitive performance of high-order Markov\nmodels compared to deep learning methods, particularly in scenarios with\nconstrained datasets containing outliers.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ukh-SGdXw1uK1B5r7XiUrZ6lXnXiD2eIpZkctgrNAro","pdfSize":"1821525"}
