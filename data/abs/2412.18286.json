By employing a particular boundary condition and\nthe regularization prescription proposed earlier for the Einstein gravity, we\ndemonstrate the existence of two centrally extended Virasoro algebras. The\ncentral charges evaluated within this framework are in agreement with their\ncorresponding expressions evaluated at the spatial infinity. We also discuss\nthe robustness of the regularization procedure by relating asymptotic and\nnear-horizon geometries.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"ZuyRUuNvkLyTGLjqk9ishWktMUT81yyjhj24F_GQwUU","pdfSize":"197438"}
