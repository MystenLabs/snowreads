A recent\npaper by Fernandes et al. [C. Fernandes, R. Wagner, L. Novo, and E. F.\nGalv\\~ao, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 190201 (2024) ] showed how to use the Bargmann\ninvariant to witness the imaginarity of a set of quantum states. In this work,\nwe delve into the structure of Bargmann invariants and their quantum\nrealization in qubit systems. First, we present a characterization of special\nsets of Bargmann invariants (also studied by Fernandes et al. for a set of four\nstates) for a general set of $n$ quantum states. Then, we study the properties\nof the relevant Bargmann invariant set $\\mathcal{B}_n$ and its quantum\nrealization in qubit systems. Our results provide new insights into the\nstructure of Bargmann invariants, contributing to the advancement of quantum\ninformation techniques, particularly within qubit systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"azSOwpROr4yu6DiZPWP1iCtVtD89jeVI0xTDTas2tho","pdfSize":"1835276"}
