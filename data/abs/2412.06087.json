  "abstract": "  Ethnography (social scientific methods that illuminate how people understand,\nnavigate and shape the real world contexts in which they live their lives) and\nmachine learning (computational techniques that use big data and statistical\nlearning models to perform quantifiable tasks) are each core to contemporary\nsocial science. Yet these tools have remained largely separate in practice.\nThis chapter draws on a growing body of scholarship that argues that\nethnography and machine learning can be usefully combined, particularly for\nlarge comparative studies. Specifically, this paper (a) explains the value (and\nchallenges) of using machine learning alongside qualitative field research for\ncertain types of projects, (b) discusses recent methodological trends to this\neffect, (c) provides examples that illustrate workflow drawn from several large\nprojects, and (d) concludes with a roadmap for enabling productive coevolution\nof field methods and machine learning.\n",
