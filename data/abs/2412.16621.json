  "abstract": "  The study of Fourier transforms of probability measures on fractal sets plays\nan important role in recent research. Faster decay rates are known to yield\nenhanced results in areas such as metric number theory. This paper focuses on\nself-similar probability measures defined on self-similar sets. Explicit upper\nbounds are derived for their decay rates, improving upon prior research. These\nfindings are illustrated with an application to sets of numbers whose digits in\ntheir L\\\"uroth representations are restricted to a finite set.\n",
