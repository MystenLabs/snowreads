We recently demonstrated a\nthree-element Boersch phase shifter device [Thakkar et al., J. Appl. Phys. 128\n(2020), 134502], which was fabricated by electron beam lithography and is\ncompatible with up-scaling. However, it suffers from parasitic beam deflection\nand resulting cross-talk. Here, we report a five-layer phase shifter device,\nwhich is based on a metal-insulator-metal-insulator-metal structure (as\noriginally envisioned by Boersch) that reduces cross-talk. We demonstrate a\nthree-element Boersch phase shifter that shows minimal beam deflection of\nvoltage-controlled three-electron-beam interference patterns in a transmission\nelectron microscope operated at 200 keV. The feasibility of using such\nmulti-element phase shifter arrays is discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eRiY6e0qh8xZu1P8zXCkuvyxYLXKVtqfBornz1LZEsI","pdfSize":"762233"}
