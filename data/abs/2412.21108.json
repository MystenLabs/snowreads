Such matrix integrals in the case of\nthree-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories on lens space can be expressed\nin terms of hyperbolic hypergeometric integrals. By studying partition\nfunctions of supersymmetric dual theories, one can obtain new complicated\nidentities for this type of special function. We derive new ordinary\nhypergeometric identities from the reduction of certain hyperbolic\nhypergeometric integral identities obtained via supersymmetric infrared\ndualities.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gwChKIz2xWvQYkuy4FOBeWfiJ4C0WRRcFaEkpHJxE9g","pdfSize":"153694"}
