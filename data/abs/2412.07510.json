  "abstract": "  For a graph $G= (V, E)$, a Roman dominating function is a map $f : V\n\\rightarrow \\{0, 1, 2\\}$ satisfies the property that if $f(v) = 0$, then $v$\nmust have adjacent to at least one vertex $u$ such that $f(u)= 2$. The weight\nof a Roman dominating function $f$ is the value $f(V)= \\Sigma_{u \\in V} f(u)$,\nand the minimum weight of a Roman dominating function on $G$ is called the\nRoman domination number of $G$, denoted by $\\gamma_R(G)$. The main focus of\nthis paper is to study the Roman domination number of zero-divisor graph\n$\\Gamma(R)$ and find the bounds of the Roman domination number of\n$T(\\Gamma(R))$.\n",
