Leveraging large language models (LLMs) via a\ncarefully designed prompt-based protocol, CATER expands beyond traditional\nreference-bound metrics, offering a multidimensional, reference-independent\nevaluation that addresses linguistic accuracy, semantic fidelity, contextual\ncoherence, stylistic appropriateness, and information completeness. CATER's\nunique advantage lies in its immediate implementability: by providing the\nsource and target texts along with a standardized prompt, an LLM can rapidly\nidentify errors, quantify edit effort, and produce category-level and overall\nscores. This approach eliminates the need for pre-computed references or\ndomain-specific resources, enabling instant adaptation to diverse languages,\ngenres, and user priorities through adjustable weights and prompt\nmodifications. CATER's LLM-enabled strategy supports more nuanced assessments,\ncapturing phenomena such as subtle omissions, hallucinations, and\ndiscourse-level shifts that increasingly challenge contemporary MT systems. By\nuniting the conceptual rigor of frameworks like MQM and DQF with the\nscalability and flexibility of LLM-based evaluation, CATER emerges as a\nvaluable tool for researchers, developers, and professional translators\nworldwide. The framework and example prompts are openly available, encouraging\ncommunity-driven refinement and further empirical validation.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oSZtzIAFl1D1CZ3kSQFSw50-96rXR_dV28_8nZi2UTk","pdfSize":"668561"}
