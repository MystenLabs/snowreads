In the double scaling limit, SYK is\ncompletely solvable by chord diagrams, whose generating functional is a bilocal\nLiouville theory. At low temperatures a set of modes in this description\nbecomes soft. We interpret them as reparametrization of some twisted time\ncoordinates, and show explicitly that they lead to the nonlinear Schwarzian\ntheory. We further consider deformations of the theory in the double scaling\nlimit, giving rise to diagrams with multiple species of chords, and show that\nthe generating functional is now a Liouville theory with multiple fields. These\ndeformations can be tracked to the IR and we discuss how they affect the\nSchwarzian.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2ir6Azx5Y49QBI88Gwhpa6VfxWpPJHRqXdNce2fa4SY","pdfSize":"1332046"}
