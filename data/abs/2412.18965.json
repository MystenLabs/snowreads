The key ingredient of this construction is the identification of\nCompact Localised States (CLSs), which appear naturally by demanding\n$\\textit{supertranslation}$ invariance of the system. We use CLS basis states,\nwith inherent $\\textit{ultra-local}$ correlations, to write down an interacting\ntheory which shows a non-trivial phase structure and an emergent Carroll\nconformal symmetry at the gapless points. We analyze this theory in detail for\nboth zero and finite chemical potential.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"lE_lNzr2RJVpneXVEvzQlUMLyezpDFbEDs976hb3oSM","pdfSize":"2755362"}
