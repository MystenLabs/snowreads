  "abstract": "  For a matroid of rank $r$ and a non-negative integer $k$, an element is\ncalled $k$-loose if every circuit containing it has size greater than $r-k$.\nZaslavsky and the author characterized all binary matroids with a $1$-loose\nelement. In this paper, we establish a sharp linear bound on the size of a\nbinary matroid, in terms of its rank, that contains a $k$-loose element. A\nmatroid is called $k$-paving if all its elements are $k$-loose. Rajpal showed\nthat for a prime power $q$, the rank of a $GF(q)$-matroid that is $k$-paving is\nbounded. We provide a bound on the rank of $GF(q)$-matroids that are cosimple\nand have two $k$-loose elements. Consequently, we deduce a bound on the rank of\n$GF(q)$-matroids that are $k$-paving. Additionally, we provide a bound on the\nsize of binary matroids that are $k$-paving.\n",
