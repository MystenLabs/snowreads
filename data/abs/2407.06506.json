Our study indicates a considerable rise in the number of\nusers posting more than one question during the pandemic. Those asking\nrecurring questions demonstrate more active involvement in communication,\nsuggesting a continuous pursuit of knowledge. Furthermore, the thematic focus\nhas shifted from questions about jobs before COVID-19 to concerns about\nfinances, school preparations, and taxes during COVID-19. These findings carry\nimplications for support policymaking, highlighting the importance of\ndelivering timely and relevant information to meet the evolving needs of\ninternational students. To enhance international students' understanding and\nnavigation of this dynamic environment, future research in this field is\nnecessary.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qaOdO10LeS_AirZCzyI7IBIcqIu8ZdnBbc0BWErv6f8","pdfSize":"2491445"}
