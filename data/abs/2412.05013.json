If so,\nwhat could such an application scenario look like and what skills would the\nrobot need to have when interacting with human customers? What are requirements\nfor this kind of interactions? We have devised an application scenario for such\na case, determined the necessary or desirable capabilities of the robot,\ndeveloped a corresponding robot application and carried out initial tests and\nevaluations in a project together with the Kiel City Council. One of the most\nimportant insights gained in the project was that a humanoid robot with natural\nlanguage processing capabilities based on large language models as well as\nhuman-like gestures and posture changes (animations) proved to be much more\npreferred by users compared to standard browser-based solutions on tablets for\nan information system in the City Council. Furthermore, we propose a connection\nof the ACT-R cognitive architecture with the robot, where an ACT-R model is\nused in interaction with the robot application to cognitively process and\nenhance a dialogue between human and robot.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Robotics","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ecEPnr9yTD42hZMX93zvR0G0QyRaEUN0UxPnrqEfdZw","pdfSize":"249992"}
