Traditional\nmethods use standing waves from opposing sound sources, which limits\nmanipulation to enclosed spaces. Single-sided levitation with twin traps has\nlimited reach near phased array of transducers (\\textless 66.7 mm). Herein, we\nintroduce a new levitation mode and demonstrate stable levitation and\ntranslation between 141 and 397 mm from a phased array of transducers using a\nBessel beam. The non-diffractive propagation characteristics of the Bessel\nbeam, combined with its high central acoustic pressure, enable particles to be\nstably entrapped and manipulated within the high-pressure region of the beam.\nThis work extends the reach of acoustic manipulation using a single-sided\nlevitator.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"370oD6rMo16kpPGrIyK5cFwnLB0OaihnBk-uQo-DKZU","pdfSize":"1798204"}
