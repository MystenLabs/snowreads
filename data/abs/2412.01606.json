The mass of the hot X-ray emitting gas in a cluster of\ngalaxies has more mass than the galaxies in the cluster. With the launch of the\nXRISM microcalorimeter mission, space-based X-ray observations will achieve a\nrecord spectral resolving power of $R\\equiv E/\\Delta E \\sim 1200$. With this\nresolving power, emission features associated with fine-structure energy levels\nof some species will be resolved, sometimes for the first time. The plasma\ncode, CLOUDY, was not originally designed for high-resolution X-ray\nspectroscopy and throughout its history did not resolve fine-structure\ncomponents of Lyman lines. Here we expand CLOUDY to resolve these\nfine-structure energy levels and obtain predicted X-ray spectra that match the\nresolution of new microcalorimeter observations. We show how the Lyman lines\ncan be used as column density indicators and examine their sensitivity to\nexternal radiation fields and turbulence.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"AtQPavzgpvuRhE8sMVC0BYAc-TA5CgmKIY1AuH9GULc","pdfSize":"1498060"}
