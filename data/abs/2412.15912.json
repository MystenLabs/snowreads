  "abstract": "  We study the emergence of complexity in deep random $N$-qubit $T$-gate doped\nClifford circuits, as reflected in their spectral properties and in magic\ngeneration, characterized by the stabilizer R\\'enyi entropy distribution and\nthe non-stabilizing power of the circuit. For pure (undoped) Clifford circuits,\na unique periodic orbit structure in the space of Pauli strings implies\npeculiar spectral correlations and level statistics with large degeneracies.\n$T$-gate doping induces an exponentially fast transition to chaotic behavior,\ndescribed by random matrix theory. We compare these complexity indicators with\nmagic generation properties of the Clifford+$T$ ensemble, and determine the\ndistribution of magic, as well as the average non-stabilizing power of the\nquantum circuit ensemble. In the dilute limit, $N_T \\ll N$, magic generation is\ngoverned by single-qubit behavior. Magic is generated in approximate quanta,\nincreases approximately linearly with the number of $T$-gates, $N_T$, and\ndisplays a discrete distribution for small $N_T$. At $N_T\\approx N$, the\ndistribution becomes quasi-continuous, and for $N_T\\gg N$ it converges to that\nof Haar-random unitaries, and averages to a finite magic density, $m_2$,\n$\\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\langle m_2 \\rangle_\\text{Haar} = 1$. This is in contrast to\nthe spectral transition, where ${\\cal O} (1)$ $T$-gates suffice to remove\nspectral degeneracies and to induce a transition to chaotic behavior in the\nthermodynamic limit. Magic is therefore a more sensitive indicator of\ncomplexity.\n",
