Primarily, these coresets have been studied\nfor a limited range of machine learning models. In this paper, we introduce a\nunified framework for constructing accurate coresets. Using this framework, we\npresent accurate coreset construction algorithms for general problems,\nincluding a wide range of latent variable model problems and\n$\\ell_p$-regularized $\\ell_p$-regression. For latent variable models, our\ncoreset size is $O\\left(\\mathrm{poly}(k)\\right)$, where $k$ is the number of\nlatent variables. For $\\ell_p$-regularized $\\ell_p$-regression, our algorithm\ncaptures the reduction of model complexity due to regularization, resulting in\na coreset whose size is always smaller than $d^{p}$ for a regularization\nparameter $\\lambda > 0$. Here, $d$ is the dimension of the input points. This\ninherently improves the size of the accurate coreset for ridge regression. We\nsubstantiate our theoretical findings with extensive experimental evaluations\non real datasets.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"NWFrMYF2bfiNcEwKZiKJtLoTS4oHajeW0dYTb2QduUs","pdfSize":"622798"}
