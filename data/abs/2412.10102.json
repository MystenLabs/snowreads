{"id":"2412.10102","title":"Indirect Adaptive Control Using a Static Update Law","authors":"Tom Kaufmann, Johann Reger","authorsParsed":[["Kaufmann","Tom",""],["Reger","Johann",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2024 12:41:29 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-16","timestamp":1734093689000,"abstract":"  The update law in the indirect adaptive control scheme can be extended to\ninclude feedthrough of an error term. This reduces undesired oscillations of\nthe calculated weights. When the {\\sigma}-modification is used for achieving\nrobustness against unstructured uncertainties, the gain of the feedthrough in\nthe update law cannot be chosen arbitrarily. Compared to our previous result,\nwe show stability of the closed loop for a larger parameter-range for the gain\nof the feedthrough in the update law. This parameter-range includes a\nconfiguration for which the influence of the integration in the update law\ndiminishes over time, i.e. for which the adaptation for large times is governed\nsolely by the feedthrough in the update law. By initializing at zero, this\nallows for removing the integration from the update law, resulting in a static\nupdate law. For the purely linear case, the adaptation acts like a disturbance\nobserver. Frequency-domain analysis of the closed loop with a second order\nplant shows that removing the integration from the update law with\n{\\sigma}-modification and feedthrough affects how precisely disturbances in the\nlow-frequency band are observed. If the damping injected into the adaptation\nprocess by the {\\sigma}-modification exceeds certain bounds, then the precision\nis increased by using the static update law.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computer Science/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"1sENtyUY-n_jFx51HkZOslzNVgHNTnccnMj6leZC22A","pdfSize":"658286"}
