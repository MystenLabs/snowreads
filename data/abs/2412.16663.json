Using Dicke's\nframework, we demonstrate that entangled states in a gas at thermal equilibrium\ncan lead to subradiance, trapping energy in dark quantum states and reducing\nradiation intensity. Applying this to the 21 cm line in dark matter halos, we\nfind that quantum coherence renders the gas effectively dark. Moreover,\nentanglement results in a vanishing collision cross-section, consistent with\nthe collisionless nature of dark matter observed in systems like the bullet\ncluster. We also show that absorption of incident radiation can exceed levels\npredicted by Beer's law, which holds only in the absence of coherence. These\nfindings suggest that quantum entanglement and coherence may explain the\nnon-luminous behavior of matter in dark matter halos, offering a novel\nperspective on dark matter and advancing the understanding of astrophysical\nradiative processes.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2L__RUl_JFVhp68p34VJwCGsvZACuN6Z7uuuZRyq8S4","pdfSize":"1319159"}
