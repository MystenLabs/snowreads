When trained on data\nfrom multiple SNOTEL sites, the parameterization predicts daily snow depth with\nunder 9% median error and Nash Sutcliffe Efficiencies over 0.94 across a wide\nvariety of snow climates. The parameterization also generalizes to new sites\nnot seen during training, which is not often true for calibrated snow models.\nRequiring the parameterization to predict snow water equivalent in addition to\nsnow depth only increases error to ~12%. The structure of the approach\nguarantees the satisfaction of physical constraints, enables these constraints\nduring model training, and allows modeling at different temporal resolutions\nwithout additional retraining of the parameterization. These benefits hold\npotential in climate modeling, and could extend to other dynamical systems with\nphysical constraints.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vtrU8pIoHL-oGWrVWXvnluR64vq4Khq-SPiX0YE4dso","pdfSize":"4869968"}
