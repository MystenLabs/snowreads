However, building and\nmaintaining large, high-quality datasets is an enormous task. This is\nespecially true for biomedical data and for meta-sets that are compiled from\nsmaller ones, as variations in image quality, labeling, reports, and archiving\ncan lead to errors, inconsistencies, and repeated samples. Here, we show that\nthe uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) algorithm can find\nthese anomalies essentially by forming independent clusters that are distinct\nfrom the main (good) data but similar to other points with the same error type.\nAs a representative example, we apply UMAP to discover outliers in the publicly\navailable ChestX-ray14, CheXpert, and MURA datasets. While the results are\narchival and retrospective and focus on radiological images, the graph-based\nmethods work for any data type and will prove equally beneficial for curation\nat the time of dataset creation.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7n7mMGMHxSzvbAXpKCm_-XASYjgT4iJHL5ic-sLPD1s","pdfSize":"15964457","objectId":"0xea03625de36a8183a4a1ce53ad4ec188638c773ea52ba77858a5c6cb4b1bd113","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
