This is done by\nusing a scalar lump solution, which has an $\\text{AdS}_4$ spacetime in the\ncore, allows for $\\text{dS}_4$ vacua and was found to be plagued by tachyonic\ninstabilities. Using the Euclidean action formalism, we compute and compare the\nprobability amplitudes and the free energies of the lump and the $\\text{dS}_4$\nvacua. Our results show that the former is generally less favored than the\nlatter, with the most preferred state being a $\\text{dS}_4$ vacuum. The lump,\nthus, describes a metastable state which eventually decays into the true\n$\\text{dS}_4$ vacuum. This nucleation mechanism of dS spacetime may provide\ninsights into the short-distance behavior of gravity, in particular for the\ncharacterization of string-theory vacua, cosmological inflation and the\nblack-hole singularity problem.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xIFPK46AhLSdByQH2EWpQLDgMVMmqxkyiFWQG6iRw5w","pdfSize":"452766"}
