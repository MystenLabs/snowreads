  "abstract": "  Cryptic crosswords are puzzles that rely on general knowledge and the\nsolver's ability to manipulate language on different levels, dealing with\nvarious types of wordplay. Previous research suggests that solving such puzzles\nis challenging even for modern NLP models, including Large Language Models\n(LLMs). However, there is little to no research on the reasons for their poor\nperformance on this task. In this paper, we establish the benchmark results for\nthree popular LLMs: Gemma2, LLaMA3 and ChatGPT, showing that their performance\non this task is still significantly below that of humans. We also investigate\nwhy these models struggle to achieve superior performance. We release our code\nand introduced datasets at\nhttps://github.com/bodasadallah/decrypting-crosswords.\n",
