Advancements in X-ray instrumentation and the\navailability of deep, wide-area optical surveys now enable us to explore XINSs\nat fainter X-ray fluxes and greater distances. In this study, we investigated\ncandidates selected from the 4XMM-DR9 catalogue using XMM-Newton, focusing on\nlong-term flux stability, spectral characterisation, and astrometry. By\nleveraging resources from the XMM2ATHENA project -- including updated\ncatalogues, multiwavelength characterisation and machine learning\nclassification -- we refined our understanding of this sample of soft X-ray\nemitters. Our findings enhance the characterisation of XINS candidates, laying\nthe groundwork for more targeted investigations and future catalogue searches.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"QzUguh2a2DN2QjFtvfG_8ye_5qDQhNhwK1Y_XOXrb14","pdfSize":"524349"}
