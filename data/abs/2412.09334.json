The sceptical\np-value was recently presented as an alternative method for the statistical\nassessment of the replicability of study results. Methods: We compare the\nstatistical properties of the sceptical p-value and the two-trials rule. We\nillustrate the performance of the different methods using real-world evidence\nemulations of randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) conducted within the RCT\nDUPLICATE initiative. Results: The sceptical p-value depends not only on the\ntwo p-values, but also on sample size and effect size of the two studies. It\ncan be calibrated to have the same Type-I error rate as the two-trials rule,\nbut has larger power to detect an existing effect. In the application to the\nresults from the RCT DUPLICATE initiative, the sceptical p-value leads to\nqualitatively similar results than the two-trials rule, but tends to show more\nevidence for treatment effects compared to the two-trials rule. Conclusion: The\nsceptical p-value represents a valid statistical measure to assess the\nreplicability of study results and is especially useful in the context of\nreal-world evidence emulations.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LY3q0AQl6lb2F8IxiBpt4EmZqarj00T2xPhKKwgGc5k","pdfSize":"579721"}
