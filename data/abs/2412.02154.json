  "abstract": "  Estimating the probability of failure is a critical step in developing\nsafety-critical autonomous systems. Direct estimation methods such as Monte\nCarlo sampling are often impractical due to the rarity of failures in these\nsystems. Existing importance sampling approaches do not scale to sequential\ndecision-making systems with large state spaces and long horizons. We propose\nan adaptive importance sampling algorithm to address these limitations. Our\nmethod minimizes the forward Kullback-Leibler divergence between a\nstate-dependent proposal distribution and a relaxed form of the optimal\nimportance sampling distribution. Our method uses Markov score ascent methods\nto estimate this objective. We evaluate our approach on four sequential systems\nand show that it provides more accurate failure probability estimates than\nbaseline Monte Carlo and importance sampling techniques. This work is open\nsourced.\n",
