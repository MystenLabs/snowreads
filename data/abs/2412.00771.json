  "abstract": "  Living cells presumably employ optimized information transfer methods,\nenabling efficient communication even in noisy environments. As expected, the\nefficiency of chemical communications between cells depends on the properties\nof the molecular messenger. Evidence suggests that proteins from narrow ranges\nof molecular masses have been naturally selected to mediate cellular\ncommunications, yet the underlying communication design principles are not\nunderstood. Using a simple physical model that considers the cost of chemical\nsynthesis, diffusion, molecular binding, and degradation, we show that optimal\nmass values exist that ensure efficient communication of various types of\nsignals. Our findings provide insights into the design principles of biological\ncommunications and can be used to engineer chemically communicating biomimetic\nsystems.\n",
