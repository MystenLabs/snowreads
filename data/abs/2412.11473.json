  "abstract": "  After a review of the reproducing kernel Banach space framework and\nsemi-inner products, we apply the techniques to the setting of Hardy spaces\n$H^p$ and Bergman spaces $A^p$, $1<p<\\infty$, on the unit ball in\n$\\mathbb{C}^n$, as well as the Hardy space on the polydisk and half-space. In\nparticular, we show how the framework leads to a procedure to find a minimal\nnorm element $f$ satisfying interpolation conditions $f(z_j)=w_j$, $j=1,\\ldots\n, n$. We also explain the techniques in the setting of $\\ell^p$ spaces where\nthe norm is defined via a change of variables and provide numerical examples.\n",
