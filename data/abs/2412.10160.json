  "abstract": "  We present first algorithmic ideas for a practical and lightweight adaption\nof the DCX suffix array construction algorithm [Sanders et al., 2003] to the\ndistributed-memory setting. Our approach relies on a bucketing technique which\nenables a lightweight implementation which uses less than half of the memory\nrequired by the currently fastest distributed-memory suffix array algorithm\nPSAC [Flick and Aluru, 2015] while being competitive or even faster in terms of\nrunning time.\n",
