  "abstract": "  This paper investigates the identifiability of a spatial mathematical model\nof the spread of fast-moving epidemics based on the law of acting masses and\ndiffusion processes. The research algorithm is based on global methods of Sobol\nsensitivity analysis and Bayesian approach, which together allowed to reduce\nthe variation boundaries of unknown parameters for further solving the problem\nof parameter identification by measurements of the number of detected cases,\ncritical and dead. It is shown that for identification of diffusion\ncoefficients responsible for the rate of movement of individuals in space, it\nis necessary to use additional information about the process.\n",
