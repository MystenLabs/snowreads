Using the Thermal-FIST package, thermal parameters\nextracted from fits to various sets of hadron yields, including and excluding\nlight nuclei, are used to calculate the ratios of the yields of light nuclei,\nnamely, $d/p$, $\\bar{d}/\\bar{p}$, $t/p$, and $t/d$. A comparison with data from\nthe STAR and ALICE collaborations shows that a sequential freeze-out scenario\nprovides a better description of light nuclei yield ratios than the traditional\nsingle freeze-out approach. These results suggest the flavour-dependent\nchemical freeze-out for final state light-nuclei production persists in\nheavy-ion collisions at both RHIC and LHC energies.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7xMsXsLJYkP8EkCxu6qc_b0ZE2iMKH-vJgLtEsoiXv0","pdfSize":"330098"}
