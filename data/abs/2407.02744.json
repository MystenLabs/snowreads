The\nposterior sampling of diffusion models based on the real measurement data holds\nsignificant promise of improved reconstruction accuracy. However, traditional\nposterior sampling methods often lack effective data consistency guidance,\nleading to inaccurate and unstable reconstructions. Implicit neural\nrepresentation (INR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving inverse\nproblems by modeling a signal's attributes as a continuous function of spatial\ncoordinates. In this study, we present a novel posterior sampler for diffusion\nmodels using INR, named DiffINR. The INR-based component incorporates both the\ndiffusion prior distribution and the MRI physical model to ensure high data\nfidelity. DiffINR demonstrates superior performance on experimental datasets\nwith remarkable accuracy, even under high acceleration factors (up to R=12 in\nsingle-channel reconstruction). Notably, our proposed framework can be a\ngeneralizable framework to solve inverse problems in other medical imaging\ntasks.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"evc1uWwLT34N7G1G5Hjac6HDUZFe39-uMFQUB7nEQvI","pdfSize":"54692661"}
