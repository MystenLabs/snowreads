Specifically, we use the behavioral\napproach for LPV systems to develop a data-driven representation of the\nfinite-horizon behavior of an LPV system that can be represented by a kernel\nrepresentation with shifted-affine scheduling dependence. Moreover, we provide\na necessary and sufficient rank-based test on the available data that concludes\nwhether the data-driven representation fully represents the finite-horizon\nbehavior. The results in this paper allow for direct data-driven analysis and\ncontrol of LPV systems with stability and performance guarantees. We\ndemonstrate this by also solving the LPV data-driven simulation problem.\nMoreover, through the use of LPV systems as surrogates for nonlinear systems,\nour results may serve as a stepping stone towards direct data-driven analysis\nand control of nonlinear systems.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computer Science/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"0VTlVmCNarfnUgyuLWgTreDcWbNL6KXfebKVqW_aK2I","pdfSize":"1073283"}
