In this study, we demonstrate that individual\ntemporal data, in the form of inter-event times distribution, constitutes an\nindividual temporal fingerprint, allowing for matching profiles across\ndifferent domains back to their associated real-world entity. We evaluate our\nmethodology on encrypted digital trading platforms within the Ethereum\nBlockchain and present impressing results in matching identities across these\nprivacy-preserving domains, while outperforming previously suggested models.\nOur findings indicate that simply knowing when an individual is active, even if\ninformation about who they talk to and what they discuss is lacking, poses\nrisks to users' privacy, highlighting the inherent challenges in preserving\nprivacy in today's digital landscape.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"U-U3PImbUN2pUlHr_Qyi5Jjftn8hA6gHTzxXjo5zq50","pdfSize":"7495558"}
