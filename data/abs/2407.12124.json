Here we\nfind that the emergence of a nematic liquid crystal phase occurs in cells\nduring gastrulation in the development of embryos of fish, frogs, and fruit\nflies. Moreover, the spatial correlations in all three organisms are\nlong-ranged and follow a similar power-law decay (y~$x^{-\\alpha}$ ) with\n$\\alpha$ less than unity for the nematic order parameter, suggesting a common\nunderlying physical mechanism unifies events in these distantly related\nspecies. All three species exhibit similar propagation of the nematic phase,\nreminiscent of nucleation and growth phenomena. Finally, we use a theoretical\nmodel along with disruptions of cell adhesion and cell specification to\ncharacterize the minimal features required for formation of the nematic phase.\nOur results provide a framework for understanding a potentially universal\nfeatures of metazoan embryogenesis and shed light on the advent of ordered\nstructures during animal development.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Biological Physics","Quantitative Biology/Tissues and Organs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"I3z61Mzn5qIrJH1QanIFVo_NzA5MZVxcARiWb4-oaFA","pdfSize":"16153538"}
