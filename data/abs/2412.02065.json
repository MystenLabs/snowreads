Recent breakthroughs in\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to democratize data access by\nautomating data collection from unstructured sources. We develop and evaluate a\nnovel methodology using GPT-4o-mini within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) framework to collect data from corporate disclosures. Our approach\nachieves human-level accuracy in collecting CEO pay ratios from approximately\n10,000 proxy statements and Critical Audit Matters (CAMs) from more than 12,000\n10-K filings, with LLM processing times of 9 and 40 minutes respectively, each\nat a cost under $10. This stands in stark contrast to the hundreds of hours\nneeded for manual collection or the thousands of dollars required for\ncommercial database subscriptions. To foster a more inclusive research\ncommunity by empowering researchers with limited resources to explore new\navenues of inquiry, we share our methodology and the resulting datasets.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/General Finance","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computer Science/Machine Learning","Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"XbuyAfa81O5E2lYADN7uzuWIbJnmqT6vbBD35DbRMd4","pdfSize":"1710806"}
