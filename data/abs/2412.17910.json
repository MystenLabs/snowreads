Often,\nthis decision involves tradeoffs between nutritious choices (e.g., salt and\nsugar levels, nutrition content) and convenience (e.g., cost and accessibility,\ncuisine type, food source type). We present a data-driven solution for meal\nrecommendations that considers customizable meal configurations and time\nhorizons. This solution balances user preferences while accounting for food\nconstituents and cooking processes. Our contributions include introducing\ngoodness measures, a recipe conversion method from text to the recently\nintroduced multimodal rich recipe representation (R3) format, learning methods\nusing contextual bandits that show promising preliminary results, and the\nprototype, usage-inspired, BEACON system.\"\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6FKS775dAWFKSmThoe2FHIEuchWuiVVP3Jmn5PqtH1o","pdfSize":"2032759"}
