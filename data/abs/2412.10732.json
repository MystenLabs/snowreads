  "abstract": "  We propose a new method to calculate perturbatively the isospectral Hermitian\ntheory for the $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric $i\\phi^3$ quantum field theory in $d$\ndimensions, whose result is local. The result of the new method in $1$\ndimension reproduces our previous result in the $ix^3$ quantum mechanics, and\nthe new method can be seen as a generalization of our previous method to\nquantum field theory. We also find the isospectral local Hermitian theory has\nthe same form in all dimensions and differs in coefficients only, and our\nprevious results in quantum mechanics can be used directly to determine the\nform of the isospectral local Hermitian quantum field theory.\n",
