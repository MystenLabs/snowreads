In this work, we demonstrate the promise of topological\nexcitonic insulators for identification due to their unique bulk-edge\ncorrespondence, as illustrated by the LiFe$X$ ($X$ = S, Se, and Te) family.\nFirst-principles Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations reveal excitonic\ninstabilities in these spin-orbit coupling quantum anomalous Hall insulators.\nEffective Hamiltonian analyses indicate that spontaneous exciton condensation\ndoes not disrupt the gapless edge state but reconstructs the bulk-gap to be\nalmost independent of the spin-orbit coupling strength. This change in the\nbulk-edge correspondence can be experimentally inspected by angle-resolved\nphotoelectron spectroscopy or electron compressibility measurements, providing\nobservational evidence for the identification of topological excitonic\ninsulators. Moreover, exciton condensation raises the critical temperature of\nthe topological nontrivial phase above room temperature.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9IOj0IdAieMuFdEjRi-KUIKmdtjkxF6kKTvc8a2jZwI","pdfSize":"4440307"}
