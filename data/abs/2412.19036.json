The factor graph is partitioned\ninto a BP region and an MF region so that the messages in each region are\nupdated according to the corresponding region rules. The BP region exploits the\ntree-reweighted BP, which offers improved convergence than the standard BP for\ngraphs with massive cycles, to resolve data association. The MF region\napproximates the posterior densities of the measurement rate, kinematic state\nand extent. For linear Gaussian target models and gamma Gaussian inverse\nWishart distributed state density, the unified approach provides a closed-form\nrecursion for the state density. Hence, the proposed algorithm is more\nefficient than particle-based BP algorithms for extended target tracking. This\nmethod also avoids measurement clustering and gating since it solves the data\nassociation problem in a probabilistic fashion. We compare the proposed\napproach with algorithms such as the Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture filter and\nthe BP-based Poisson multi-Bernoulli filter. Simulation results demonstrate\nthat the proposed algorithm achieves enhanced tracking performance.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LLhhBFfXYZC8HKczt9dMBvGRYpUftv0M6l4_S7rAV9M","pdfSize":"850142"}
