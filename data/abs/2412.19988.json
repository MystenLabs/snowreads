The calculation is done at three\nlattice spacings $a=(0.098, 0.085, 0.064)$ fm and pion masses $\\sim350$ MeV,\nwith pion momenta up to $1.8$ GeV. The matrix elements are renormalized in a\nstate-of-the-art scheme and extrapolated to the continuum and infinite momentum\nlimit. We have implemented the perturbative matching up to the\nnext-to-next-to-leading order and carried out a renormalization-group\nresummation. Our results provide valuable input for phenomenological analyses\nof the Boer-Mulders single-spin asymmetry.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2Lrg5HDLFKzj-6oZSDy4j4yeuDNGCCONy2kEsbfG4JQ","pdfSize":"3758380"}
