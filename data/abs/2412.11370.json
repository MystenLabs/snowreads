In\nparticular, inverse engineering STA provides much more freedom for the\noptimization of shortcut, which alleviates the complexity for experimental\nrealization. Here, we implement a STA technique, known as invariant-based\ninverse engineering, to speed up the adiabatic control of the electron triplet\nground state of a single nitrogen-vacancy~(NV) center. The microwave pulses to\ndrive inversely engineered STA are obtained with space curve quantum control,\nwhere the evolution of spin transition is mapped to a three-dimensional closed\nspace curve and the design of shortcut is obtained by optimization over the\nspace curve. We demonstrate the fast and high-fidelity drive of\ndipole-forbidden transition between two spin sublevels of the ground state.\nMoreover, we demonstrate the robustness of the spin transition by introducing\nthe detuning of driving microwave field. The acceleration and robustness is\nfurther confirmed by the comparison with two traditional Raman control schemes.\nOur results suggest invariant-based inverse engineering is powerful for fast\nand robust manipulation of NV system, and thus benefits quantum sensing and\nquantum computation based on the NV platform.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"l0X_oxW-jomO5aoDNprP5DC5qrRe9IMoayF49i3bYFw","pdfSize":"1541246"}
