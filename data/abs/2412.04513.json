  "abstract": "  This paper aims to explore the quasinormal modes (QNMs) and effective\npotential profiles of massless and rotating BTZ black holes within the\nframeworks of $f(\\mathcal{R})$ and Ricci-Inverse ($\\mathcal{RI}$) modified\ngravity theories, which, while producing similar space-time structures, exhibit\nvariations due to distinct cosmological constants, $\\Lambda_m$. We derive wave\nequations for these black hole perturbations and analyze the behavior of the\neffective potential $V_{\\text{eff}}(r)$ under different values of mass $m$,\ncosmological constant $\\Lambda_m$, and modified gravity parameters $\\alpha_1$,\n$\\alpha_2$, $\\beta_1$, $\\beta_2$, and $\\gamma$. The findings indicate that\nincreasing mass and parameter values results in a raised potential barrier,\nimplying stronger confinement of perturbations and impacting black hole\nstability. Incorporating the generalized uncertainty principle, we also study\nits effect on the thermodynamics of rotating BTZ black holes, demonstrating how\nGUP modifies black hole radiation, potentially observable in QNM decay rates.\nAdditionally, we investigate the motion of particles through null and timelike\ngeodesics in static BTZ space-time, observing asymptotic behaviors for null\ngeodesics and parameter-dependent shifts in potential for timelike paths. The\nstudy concludes that modified gravity parameters significantly influence QNM\nfrequencies and effective potential profiles, offering insights into black hole\nstability and suggesting that these theoretical predictions may be tested\nthrough gravitational wave observations.\n",
