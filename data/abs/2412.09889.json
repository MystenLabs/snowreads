It highlights the need to identify\nessential properties of these activations to improve their effectiveness in\nspecific domains. To this end, the study comprehensively analyzes properties,\nsuch as bounded, monotonic, nonlinearity, and periodicity, for activation in\ntime series neural networks. We propose a new activation that maximizes the\ncoverage of these properties, called LeakySineLU. We empirically evaluate the\nLeakySineLU against commonly used activations in the literature using 112\nbenchmark datasets for time series classification, obtaining the best average\nranking in all comparative scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"gZKqSr8Ys0fj7dbdwWx79DqY2hdLM7QjjUEubTsWFYU","pdfSize":"781984"}
