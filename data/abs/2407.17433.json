Nonzero chirality can emerge in the absence of\nany spin-dependent interactions, even when the ground state remains\nspin-unpolarized. The chirality effect is derived diagrammatically and\nillustrated for Haldane model and the topological superconductivity problem.\nChirality in the carrier band results in a chiral three-spin RKKY interaction\nbetween localized spins coupled to carriers by s-d Hamiltonian, an effect that\ncan be detected by local probes such as spin-sensitive STM. In systems where\ndetecting TRS breaking by conventional means is challenging, such as\ntopological superconductors, local detection of spin chirality can serve as a\nreliable diagnostic of superconducting topological phases.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8MycSgXDNGOyT-D9iMrI4bDBzTzRj0wZ5AKS-jnQltY","pdfSize":"671139","objectId":"0x86aa2d37b9873f4084bb512761c7a8f56590ce08d8850f2df521563d8ca773bb","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
