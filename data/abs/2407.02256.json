We also prove that Drew's approach to motivic Hodge modules gives\nan $\\infty$-category that embeds fully faithfully in mixed Hodge modules, and\nwe identify the image as mixed Hodge modules of geometric origin.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yPS9wuRhhh0jDPnfR8v7PNV5T3mQbeMf3d-JZ6se3y0","pdfSize":"348986"}
