  "abstract": "  A comprehensive diagnostics of new-generation dispersive elements based on\nBragg structures was completed. The influence of inscription parameters on the\nproperties of samples was studied and a threshold inscription intensity of ~\n6.38 TW/cm2 at which the linear absorption coefficient as well as the phase and\npolarization stresses sharply increase was found. When inscription is made with\nan average intensity below the threshold, the linear absorption in dry silica\nsamples remains at a level of 10-5 cm-1, which is approximately two orders of\nmagnitude lower than that of currently available commercial samples. The\nmeasured values of the dispersion characteristics using a white light\ninterferometer coincided are in a good agreement with the calculated values\nprovided by the manufacturer. The results of the diagnostics show that the\nnew-generation dispersive elements are promising for compressing kilowatt-level\nradiation of average power.\n",
