Specifically, we introduce a block matrix presentation of\nthe differential maps. These block matrices are then used to identify a wide\nfamily of higher-rank graph $C^*$-algebras with trivial K-theory. Additionally,\nin the specialized case where the higher-rank graph consists of one vertex, we\nare able to use the K\\\"unneth theorem to explicitly compute the homology groups\nof the Evans chain complex.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_hvezXfERKmPJvDdxDg7jh9gvpwS9oAGqNjEuvan7XM","pdfSize":"177714"}
