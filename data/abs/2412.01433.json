With 15 UK choirs, we explore opportunities for bottom-up\ndata governance of a jointly created Choral AI Dataset. Guided by a survey of\nchorister attitudes towards generative AI models trained using their data, we\nexplore opportunities to create empowering governance structures that go beyond\nopt in and opt out. We test the development of novel mechanisms such as a\nTrusted Data Intermediary (TDI) to enable governance of the dataset amongst the\nchoirs and AI developers. We hope our findings can contribute to growing\nefforts to advance collective data governance practices and shape a more\ncreative, empowering future for arts communities in the generative AI\necosystem.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rwG-TDrBdrb0dNElRZM9yTguLHg_sUmfdGyB8vaO-DQ","pdfSize":"3270279"}
