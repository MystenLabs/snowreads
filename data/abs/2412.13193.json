In this paper, we introduce\nGaussTR, a novel Gaussian Transformer that leverages alignment with foundation\nmodels to advance self-supervised 3D spatial understanding. GaussTR adopts a\nTransformer architecture to predict sparse sets of 3D Gaussians that represent\nscenes in a feed-forward manner. Through aligning rendered Gaussian features\nwith diverse knowledge from pre-trained foundation models, GaussTR facilitates\nthe learning of versatile 3D representations and enables open-vocabulary\noccupancy prediction without explicit annotations. Empirical evaluations on the\nOcc3D-nuScenes dataset showcase GaussTR's state-of-the-art zero-shot\nperformance, achieving 11.70 mIoU while reducing training duration by\napproximately 50%. These experimental results highlight the significant\npotential of GaussTR for scalable and holistic 3D spatial understanding, with\npromising implications for autonomous driving and embodied agents.
