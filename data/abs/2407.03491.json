Recently we performed\ncomplex Langevin simulations by adding a Lorentz invariant mass term as an IR\nregulator and found a (1+1)-dimensional expanding spacetime with a Lorentzian\nsignature emerging dynamically at late times when the fermionic contribution is\nomitted. Here we find that this is merely an artifact of the Lorentz boosts by\nshowing that the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry is eliminated if\none chooses a Lorentz frame appropriately. On the other hand, when we include\nthe fermionic contribution, we find some evidence suggesting the emergence of a\nsmooth (3+1)-dimensional expanding Lorentzian spacetime.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"eMXLLn26UbUGsbm2JJ2DAmKG2ox82FpTbZxiAH41XX0","pdfSize":"637172"}
