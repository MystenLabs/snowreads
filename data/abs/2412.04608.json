  "abstract": "  In this paper, we develop the Oka theory for maps from families of open\nRiemann surfaces to any Oka manifold. Along the way, we prove Runge and\nMergelyan approximation theorems and Weierstrass interpolation theorem for\nfamilies of complex structures on a smooth open surface, with continuous or\nsmooth dependence of the data and the approximating functions on the complex\nstructure. This implies global solvability of the $\\overline\\partial$-equation\non such families. We also obtain an Oka principle for complex line bundles on\nfamilies of open Riemann surfaces, and we show that the canonical bundles of\nopen Riemann surfaces are holomorphically trivial in families. We include\napplications to directed holomorphic immersions and conformal minimal\nimmersions.\n",
