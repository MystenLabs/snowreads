  "abstract": "  We posit that $d_n^2 < 2p_{n+1}$ holds for every $n\\geq 1$, where $p_n$\nrepresents the $n$th prime and $d_n$ stands for the $n$th prime gap i.e. $d_n\n:= p_{n+1} - p_n$. Then, the presence of a prime between successive perfect\nsquares, as well as the validity of $\\sqrt{p_{n+1}} - \\sqrt{p_n} < 1$ are\nderived. Next, $\\pi(x)$ being the number of primes $p$ up to $x$, we deduce\n$\\pi(n^2-n) < \\pi(n^2) < \\pi(n^2+n)$ $(n\\geq 2)$. In addition, a proof of\n$\\pi((n+1)^k) - \\pi(n^k) \\geq \\pi(2^k)$ \\ $(k\\geq 2, n\\geq 1)$ is worked out.\nFinally, we put forward the conjecture that any rational number $r$ $(0\\leq r\n\\leq 1)$ represents an accumulation point for the sequence\n$\\left(\\{\\sqrt{p_n}\\}\\right)_{n\\geq 1}$.\n",
