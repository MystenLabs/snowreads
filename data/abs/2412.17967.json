The transition from 4G to 5G\nhas substantial implications for AI in consolidating a network predominantly\ngeared towards business verticals. In this context, 3GPP has specified and\nintroduced the Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) entity at the network's\ncore to provide insights based on AI algorithms to benefit network\norchestration. This paper proposes a framework for evolving NWDAF that presents\nthe interfaces necessary to further empower the core network with AI\ncapabilities B5G and 6G. In addition, we identify a set of research directions\nfor realizing a distributed e-NWDAF.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1ETJzdSQC6-2f9yVp0F7E07LwzTzqco7fqNHqRUDp9s","pdfSize":"527627"}
