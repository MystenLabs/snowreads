Each behavior\nis described in detail, along with experimental setups for simulated and\nreal-world environments. Odometry utilizes wheel encoder data for precise\nnavigation along predefined paths, validated through experiments with a Pioneer\nrobot. Target Tracking employs vision-based techniques for pursuing designated\ntargets while avoiding obstacles, demonstrated on the same platform. Obstacle\nAvoidance utilizes ultrasonic sensors to navigate cluttered environments\nsafely, validated in both simulated and real-world scenarios. Additionally, the\npaper extends the project to include an Elegoo robot car, leveraging its\nfeatures for enhanced experimentation. Through advanced algorithms and\nexperimental validations, this study provides insights into developing robust\nnavigation systems for autonomous robots.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EWKvgu7X5Oi9SRDAeOnm197mcv4dJUj2Pc-XwBuQGXU","pdfSize":"882349"}
