This study compares the\nperformance of a traditional econometric model, Mixed Data Sampling regression,\nwith one of the newest developments from the field of Artificial Intelligence,\na foundational time series forecasting model based on a Long short-term memory\nneural network called Lag-Llama, in their ability to nowcast the Harmonized\nIndex of Consumer Prices in the Euro area. Two models were compared and\nassessed whether the Lag-Llama can outperform the MIDAS regression, ensuring\nthat the MIDAS regression is evaluated under the best-case scenario using a\ndataset spanning from 2010 to 2022. The following metrics were used to evaluate\nthe models: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE),\nMean Squared Error (MSE), correlation with the target, R-squared and adjusted\nR-squared. The results show better performance of the pre-trained Lag-Llama\nacross all metrics.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"chfoDWta19UZWyNeDpEjyw3n-y_TgyN-dJrm1gCibB0","pdfSize":"521026"}
