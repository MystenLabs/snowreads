In many cases, text sentences may contain segments in different\nlanguages, a phenomenon known as code-switching. This is particularly common in\nIndonesia, especially between Indonesian and English. Despite its significance,\nno research has yet developed a multilingual TTS system capable of handling\ncode-switching between these two languages. This study addresses\nIndonesian-English code-switching in STEN-TTS. Key modifications include adding\na language identification component to the text-to-phoneme conversion using\nfinetuned BERT for per-word language identification, as well as removing\nlanguage embedding from the base model. Experimental results demonstrate that\nthe code-switching model achieves superior naturalness and improved speech\nintelligibility compared to the Indonesian and English baseline STEN-TTS\nmodels.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"J3N7pnIwToQIjNHbwogA14u4_cpN2Y8RSqOEPntjN8I","pdfSize":"866953"}
