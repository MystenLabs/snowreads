  "abstract": "  Deep learning solutions are instrumental in cybersecurity, harnessing their\nability to analyze vast datasets, identify complex patterns, and detect\nanomalies. However, malevolent actors can exploit these capabilities to\norchestrate sophisticated attacks, posing significant challenges to defenders\nand traditional security measures. Adversarial attacks, particularly those\ntargeting vulnerabilities in deep learning models, present a nuanced and\nsubstantial threat to cybersecurity. Our study delves into adversarial learning\nthreats such as Data Poisoning, Test Time Evasion, and Reverse Engineering,\nspecifically impacting Network Intrusion Detection Systems. Our research\nexplores the intricacies and countermeasures of attacks to deepen understanding\nof network security challenges amidst adversarial threats. In our study, we\npresent insights into the dynamic realm of adversarial learning and its\nimplications for network intrusion. The intersection of adversarial attacks and\ndefenses within network traffic data, coupled with advances in machine learning\nand deep learning techniques, represents a relatively underexplored domain. Our\nresearch lays the groundwork for strengthening defense mechanisms to address\nthe potential breaches in network security and privacy posed by adversarial\nattacks. Through our in-depth analysis, we identify domain-specific research\ngaps, such as the scarcity of real-life attack data and the evaluation of\nAI-based solutions for network traffic. Our focus on these challenges aims to\nstimulate future research efforts toward the development of resilient network\ndefense strategies.\n",
