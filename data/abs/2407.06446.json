The\nreceiver (Bob) decodes it correctly whenever there is at most a small constant\nfraction of adversarial error in the transmitted codeword. This work\ninvestigates the setting where Bob is computationally bounded. Specifically,\nBob receives the message as a stream and must process it and write $x$ in order\nto a write-only tape while using low (say polylogarithmic) space. We show three\nbasic results about this setting, which are informally as follows:\n  (1) There is a stream decodable code of near-quadratic length.\n  (2) There is no stream decodable code of sub-quadratic length.\n  (3) If Bob need only compute a private linear function of the input bits,\ninstead of writing them all to the output tape, there is a stream decodable\ncode of near-linear length.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"x8zr6oKvoFXBzNLpYeBoTWnrDoUof8UxR92awJYi-g0","pdfSize":"449234"}
