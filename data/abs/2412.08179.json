Traditional generation of these reports\nrequires extensive financial expertise and is time-consuming. With the\nimpressive progress in Large Language Models (LLMs), a wide variety of\nfinancially focused LLMs has emerged, addressing tasks like sentiment analysis\nand entity recognition in the financial domain. This paper presents a novel\nchallenge: developing an LLM specifically for automating the generation of\nearnings reports analysis. Our methodology involves an in-depth analysis of\nexisting earnings reports followed by a unique approach to fine-tune an LLM for\nthis purpose. This approach combines retrieval augmentation and the generation\nof instruction-based data, specifically tailored for the financial sector, to\nenhance the LLM's performance. With extensive financial documents, we construct\nfinancial instruction data, enabling the refined adaptation of our LLM to\nfinancial contexts. Preliminary results indicate that our augmented LLM\noutperforms general open-source models and rivals commercial counterparts like\nGPT-3.5 in financial applications. Our research paves the way for streamlined\nand insightful automation in financial report generation, marking a significant\nstride in the field of financial analysis.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"7YI_JExZ_XMH7KHjcy19KFvdC7QO-wrZExb5oQWNaYI","pdfSize":"258862"}
