We analyse experimental data obtained with\nneutral flavoured meson mixing and place bounds on the scale of such phenomena.\nThe constraints on the CPT-violating parameter $z$ are derived by\nreinterpreting the LHCb measurement of the time-dependent asymmetry in the\nCabbibo-favoured $D^0 \\rightarrow K^{-}\\pi^{+}$ and $\\bar{D}^0 \\rightarrow\nK^{+}\\pi^{-}$ decay rates. The bounds provided in this paper are two orders of\nmagnitude stricter compared to the results obtained by the FOCUS Collaboration.\nAmong other constraints, we report bounds on the difference in the decay widths\nand masses of the neutral D meson flavour states at a 95 % confidence level.\nThe decay width difference is bounded by $(-4.7<\\delta\\Gamma_D<2.1)\\times\n10^{-16}$GeV. The mass difference lies within~$(-2.0<\\delta m_D<2.0)\\times\n10^{-15}$GeV for 95% of $\\text{arg}(z)$ values. The paper includes an\nassessment of the influence of CP violation on the results and a discussion of\nthe future prospects.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9LERi6YDeJP5BC-C4rFBX61z08tnl8_-2DNFxFvc-Yk","pdfSize":"625641"}
