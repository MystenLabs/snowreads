We show that when prescribing the\nRicci curvature, or finding solutions to the Einstein and soliton equations,\nthere exist solutions near the singular orbit, unique up to a finite number of\nconstants. In part I we make a special assumption that significantly simplifies\nthe proof, and will solve the general case in Part II.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ryWEym5HmMNNB7wTKWyFrhvhsq3PVBefzQbiPXVWNss","pdfSize":"268180"}
