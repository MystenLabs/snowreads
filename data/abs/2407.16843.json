In this work,\nwe reverse this construction and use methods from a paper of the second named\nauthor, \"Uniqueness among scalar-flat K\\\"ahler metrics on non-compact toric\n4-manifolds\", to show that all conformally K\\\"ahler, Ricci-flat, toric metrics\non the complement of toric divisors, under some mild assumptions on the\nassociated moment polytope, are among the families above. In particular all\nsuch metrics are ALF.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CPR20GkKN9yQPMbqJx_AGC_o3KyJvF-xbOkIyTovli8","pdfSize":"494910"}
