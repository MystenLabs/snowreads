As a demonstration of\nthe capability and wide applicability of the method, we use it to develop a\ngeometry that leads to a repulsive Casimir-Polder force on a ground-state atom.\nThe results turn out to be reminiscent of the ring-like geometries previously\nused to induce repulsion, but with some new features and -- importantly --\ndiscovered completely independently of any input from the user. This represents\na powerful new paradigm in the study of atom-surface forces -- instead of the\nuser testing various geometries against a desired figure of merit, the goal can\nbe specified and then an appropriate geometry created automatically.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nluZQXLBM9u9744kcyeKGJf9SL0yVjOa-NRPegWIcZo","pdfSize":"7426502"}
