However, its rendering\nspeed and model size still present bottlenecks, especially in\nresource-constrained settings. In this paper, we identify and address two key\ninefficiencies in 3D-GS, achieving substantial improvements in rendering speed,\nmodel size, and training time. First, we optimize the rendering pipeline to\nprecisely localize Gaussians in the scene, boosting rendering speed without\naltering visual fidelity. Second, we introduce a novel pruning technique and\nintegrate it into the training pipeline, significantly reducing model size and\ntraining time while further raising rendering speed. Our Speedy-Splat approach\ncombines these techniques to accelerate average rendering speed by a drastic\n$6.71\\times$ across scenes from the Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks & Temples, and Deep\nBlending datasets with $10.6\\times$ fewer primitives than 3D-GS.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SVtikheOthCAhzxCvY2PBt89iDrpsjm_tdnkkHGc4dE","pdfSize":"3584481"}
