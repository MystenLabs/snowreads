One of the approaches to study them is, firstly, to find formal\nsolutions (that is, series whose terms are described and ordered in some way\nbut which do not converge apriori) and, secondly, to study the convergence or\nsummability of these formal solutions (the existence and uniqueness of actual\nsolutions with the given asymptotic expansion in a certain domain). In this\npaper we deal only with the convergence of formal functional series having the\nform of an infinite sum of power functions with (complex, in general) power\nexponents and satisfying analytical functional equations of the following three\ntypes: a differential, $q$-difference or Mahler equation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"JFNn70IZzKsdVUzqnJtt7R5wrwnn8UxNQ4x-LLtDJag","pdfSize":"668841"}
