This paper\nintroduces an augmented Lagrangian dual formulation for FWI, rooted in the\nviewpoint that Lagrange multipliers serve as fundamental unknowns for the\naccurate linearization of the FWI problem. Once these multipliers are\nestimated, the determination of model parameters becomes simple. Therefore,\nunlike traditional primal algorithms, the proposed dual method circumvents\ndirect engagement with model parameters or wavefields, instead tackling the\nestimation of Lagrange multipliers through a gradient ascent iteration. This\napproach yields two significant advantages: i) the background model remains\nfixed, requiring only one LU matrix factorization for each frequency inversion.\nii) Convergence of the algorithm can be improved by leveraging techniques like\nquasi-Newton l-BFGS methods and Anderson acceleration. Numerical examples from\nelastic and acoustic FWI utilizing different benchmark models are provided,\nshowing that the dual algorithm converges quickly and requires fewer\ncomputations than the standard primal algorithm.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eSKUvdBSRjmQTOAzZVTs8C6eeuzEz10OhCat5OJKwxU","pdfSize":"8146643"}
