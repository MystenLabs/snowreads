The emphasis is laid on a solution to the integral Chapman-Kolmogorov\nequation by a deterministic-integration-rule-based point-mass method. A novel\nconcept of reliable data-augmented, i.e., mathematics- and data-informed,\nintegration rule is developed to enhance the point-mass state predictor, where\nthe trained neural network (representing data contribution) is used for the\nselection of the best integration rule from a set of available rules\n(representing mathematics contribution). The proposed approach combining the\nbest properties of the standard mathematics-informed and novel data-informed\nrules is thoroughly discussed.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"_yjZKfG-YjbRWdbOO5YX2RWCZGYanNEwOxcD5lTPzlQ","pdfSize":"912240"}
