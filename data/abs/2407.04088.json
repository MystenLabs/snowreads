We examine how AI agents using\nQ-learning engage in tacit collusion in two-sided markets. Our experiments\nreveal that AI-driven platforms achieve higher collusion levels compared to\nBertrand competition. Increased network externalities significantly enhance\ncollusion, suggesting AI algorithms exploit them to maximize profits. Higher\nuser heterogeneity or greater utility from outside options generally reduce\ncollusion, while higher discount rates increase it. Tacit collusion remains\nfeasible even at low discount rates. To mitigate collusive behavior and inform\npotential regulatory measures, we propose incorporating a penalty term in the\nQ-learning algorithm.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KCl7PHnKOQAiSH4QtVIrmDhZdlvi6uQRX5v3Lu3mQbk","pdfSize":"8486828"}
