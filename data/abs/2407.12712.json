We apply Droniou's approach for non-coercive linear\nelliptic problems to obtain the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the\npenalized problem, and we derive a boundary layer approach to establish the\nconvergence of the penalization method. The developed boundary layer approach\nis adapted from the one used for Dirichlet boundary conditions, but in contrast\nto the latter where coercivity enables a straightforward estimate of the\nremainders, we reduce the convergence of the penalization method to the\nexistence of suitable supersolutions of a dual problem. These supersolutions\nare then constructed as approximate solutions of the dual problem using an\nadditional formal boundary layer approach. The proposed approach results in an\nadvection-dominated problem, requiring the use of appropriate numerical methods\nsuitable for singular perturbation problems. Numerical experiments, using\nupwind finite differences, validate both the convergence rate and the boundary\nlayer thickness, illuminating the theoretical results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Qpn_xYrAewSsCOcgzQJyC_TPEEUxxAgxnCIW6R_MQH0","pdfSize":"1317454"}
