  "abstract": "  Here we generalize a well-known computation showing Wilson lines exhibit\nCoulomb scaling laws in AdS/CFT at zero temperature. The area difference\nbetween a surface that returns to the boundary, and one that plunges into the\nbulk, determines the potential between two quarks. This result is naturally\nextended to Wilson surfaces associated to general p-form symmetries in boundary\nconformal field theories (BCFTs) by embedding a Karch-Randall (KR) brane in the\ngeometry. We find (generalized) Coulomb law scaling in subregion size $\\Gamma$\nis recovered only above the critical angle for the brane, $\\theta_{c,p}$. The\npotential between the two quarks (or defect operators) vanishes precisely when\nthe surface connecting them ceases to exist at $\\theta_{c,p}$. This screening\neffect, where the operators are fully screened below the critical angle, is a\nphase transition from Coulomb law to perimeter law with the brane angle\n$\\theta_p$ acting as an order parameter. This effect is also explored at finite\ntemperature, where we introduce a new regularization procedure to obtain\nclosed-form results.\n",
