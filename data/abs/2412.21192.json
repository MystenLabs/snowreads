A L\\'evy area between Brownian\nmotion and rough paths with applications to robust nonlinear filtering and\nrough partial differential equations]. Applying this construction to the case\nwhere $\\mathbf{X}$ is the canonical lift of a one-dimensional fractional\nBrownian motion (possibly correlated with $W$) completes the partial rough path\nof [Fukasawa and Takano (2024). A partial rough path space for rough\nvolatility]. We use this to model rough volatility with the versatile toolkit\nof rough differential equations (RDEs), namely by taking the price and\nvolatility processes to be the solution to a single RDE. We argue that our\nframework is already interesting when $W$ and $X$ are independent, as\ncorrelation between the price and volatility can be introduced in the dynamics.\nThe lead-lag scheme of [Flint, Hambly, and Lyons (2016). Discretely sampled\nsignals and the rough Hoff process] is extended to our fractional setting as an\napproximation theory for the rough path in the correlated case. Continuity of\nthe solution map transforms this into a numerical scheme for RDEs. We\nnumerically test this framework and use it to calibrate a simple new rough\nvolatility model to market data.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"q8v-_b1dXS4XNcVv3cJYu3jRYwpn29x-Uw2fzGqM8p4","pdfSize":"3371657"}
