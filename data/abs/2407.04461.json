However, these methods\nignore the modal gap between the 2D diffusion model and 3D objects, which\nprimarily render 3D objects into 2D images and texture each image separately.\nIn this paper, we revisit the texture synthesis and propose a Variance\nalignment based 3D-2D Collaborative Denoising framework, dubbed VCD-Texture, to\naddress these issues. Formally, we first unify both 2D and 3D latent feature\nlearning in diffusion self-attention modules with re-projected 3D attention\nreceptive fields. Subsequently, the denoised multi-view 2D latent features are\naggregated into 3D space and then rasterized back to formulate more consistent\n2D predictions. However, the rasterization process suffers from an intractable\nvariance bias, which is theoretically addressed by the proposed variance\nalignment, achieving high-fidelity texture synthesis. Moreover, we present an\ninpainting refinement to further improve the details with conflicting regions.\nNotably, there is not a publicly available benchmark to evaluate texture\nsynthesis, which hinders its development. Thus we construct a new evaluation\nset built upon three open-source 3D datasets and propose to use four metrics to\nthoroughly validate the texturing performance. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate that VCD-Texture achieves superior performance against other\ncounterparts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EDvcZzqdDSoOnhA-1s9pU64VxoUSBQNZDdap3PyQteU","pdfSize":"4539109"}
