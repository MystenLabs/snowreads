A possible quantum critical point is\nsuggested to exist in the vicinity of to x of 0.96, at which the suppression of\nferromagnetic order is concomitant with the emergence of superconductivity.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KYxa8rb2YleFTHsZH6p7ipksOoq82sUVCMhkDTm5Uyc","pdfSize":"6088549"}
