  "abstract": "  In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) gain considerable attention for\ntheir potential to enhance personalized experiences in virtual assistants and\nchatbots. A key area of interest is the integration of personas into LLMs to\nimprove dialogue naturalness and user engagement. This study addresses the\nchallenge of persona classification, a crucial component in dialogue\nunderstanding, by proposing a framework that combines text embeddings with\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) for effective persona classification. Given the\nabsence of dedicated persona classification datasets, we create a manually\nannotated dataset to facilitate model training and evaluation. Our method\ninvolves extracting semantic features from persona statements using text\nembeddings and constructing a graph where nodes represent personas and edges\ncapture their similarities. The GNN component uses this graph structure to\npropagate relevant information, thereby improving classification performance.\nExperimental results show that our approach, in particular the integration of\nGNNs, significantly improves classification performance, especially with\nlimited data. Our contributions include the development of a persona\nclassification framework and the creation of a dataset.\n",
