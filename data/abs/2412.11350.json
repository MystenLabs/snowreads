These methods in principle, should\nacquire more information about the observed field as data grows. Gaussian\nprocesses (GPs) are candidate model choices for interpolation. However, due to\ntheir poor scalability, they usually rely on inducing points for inference,\nwhich restricts their expressivity. Moreover, commonly imposed assumptions such\nas stationarity prevents them from capturing complex patterns in the data.\nWhile deep GPs can overcome this issue, training and making inference with them\nare difficult, again requiring crude approximations via inducing points. In\nthis work, we instead approach the problem through Bayesian deep learning,\nwhere spatiotemporal fields are represented by deep neural networks, whose\nlayers share the inductive bias of stationary GPs on the plane/sphere via\nrandom feature expansions. This allows one to (1) capture high frequency\npatterns in the data, and (2) use mini-batched gradient descent for large scale\ntraining. We experiment on various remote sensing data at local/global scales,\nshowing that our approach produce competitive or superior results to existing\nmethods, with well-calibrated uncertainties.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cdu-yTGNpmoPyjqjpNNehsieaC_mB9VTTApbC1quQNI","pdfSize":"42354077"}
