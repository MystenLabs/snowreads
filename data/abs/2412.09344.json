  "abstract": "  We explore the collider phenomenology of the fat-brane realization of the\nMinimal Universal Extra Dimension (mUED) model, where Standard Model (SM)\nfields propagate in a small extra dimension while gravity accesses additional\nlarge extra dimensions. This configuration allows for gravity-mediated decay\n(GMD) of Kaluza-Klein (KK) particles, resulting in unique final states with\nhard photons, jets, massive SM bosons, and large missing transverse energy due\nto invisible KK gravitons. We derive updated constraints on the model's\nparameter space by recasting ATLAS mono-photon, di-photon, and multi-jet search\nresults using 139 inverse femtobern of integrated luminosity data. Recognizing\nthat current LHC search strategies are tailored for supersymmetric scenarios\nand may not fully capture the distinct signatures, we propose optimized\nstrategies using machine learning algorithms to tag boosted SM bosons and\nenhance signal discrimination against SM backgrounds. These methods improve\nsensitivity to fat-brane mUED signatures and offer promising prospects for\nprobing this model in future LHC runs.\n",
