As a key\nresult, we extend the invariant cone concept, originally established for\nhomogeneous piecewise linear systems, to a class of inhomogeneous continuous\npiecewise linear systems. The inhomogeneous terms can be constant and/or\ntime-dependent, modeling nonsmooth mechanical systems with a clearance gap and\nexternal harmonic forcing, respectively. Using an augmented state vector, a\nmodified invariant cone problem is formulated and solved to compute the\nnonlinear normal modes, understood as periodic solutions of the underlying\nconservative dynamics. An important contribution is that invariant cones of the\nunderlying homogeneous system can be regarded as a singularity in the theory of\nnonlinear normal modes of continuous piecewise linear systems. In addition, we\nuse a similar methodology to take external harmonic forcing into account. We\nillustrate our approach using numerical examples of mechanical oscillators with\na unilateral elastic contact. The resulting backbone curves and frequency\nresponse diagrams are compared to the results obtained using the shooting\nmethod and brute force time integration.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dLbvv7i9_nsmv8_8czvsHgV3dX6p4yNWKZ_7HtThlFA","pdfSize":"5345173"}
