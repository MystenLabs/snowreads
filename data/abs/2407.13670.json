The source of this excited\ndynamical state is unknown. In this work we demonstrate that a past close\nencounter with Earth could have provided the necessary perturbation to allow\nthe natural internal dynamics, characterized by spin-orbit coupling, to evolve\nthe system into its current dynamical state. In this hypothesis, the secondary\nof 1991VH was previously in a classical 1:1 spin-orbit resonance with an orbit\nperiod likely between 28-35 hours before being perturbed by an Earth encounter\nwithin $\\sim80,000$ km. We find if the energy dissipation within the secondary\nis relatively inefficient, this excited dynamical state could persist to today\nand produce the observed ground-based measurements. Coupled with the orbital\nhistory of 1991VH, we can then place a constraint on the tidal dissipation\nparameters of the secondary.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"j6by0d5v-1EAdmddr8VOyptRMg5-vPvWIapG-Ev7hHM","pdfSize":"4515179"}
