  "abstract": "  We introduce a novel structure for Feynman integrals, reformulating them as\nintegrals over a small set of parameters with a fully controllable integrand.\nThe integrand closely resembles one-loop Feynman integrals, and they are very\neasy to handle. Remarkably, the number of remaining integration parameters is\nindependent of the number of external legs and small -- at most 2 for two-loop\nintegrals and 5 for three-loop integrals -- facilitating the application of a\nwide range of established methods, both specific to Feynman integrals and more\ngeneral techniques. This approach is expected to mitigate the computational\nchallenges of multi-loop, multi-leg Feynman integrals. As a proof of concept,\nwe successfully computed two-loop non-planar Feynman integrals with six\nexternal legs, demonstrating high efficiency.\n",
