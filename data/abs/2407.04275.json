Truncation schemes maintaining the intragroup orbital rotation\ninvariance, as well as equations of motion of CC amplitudes and orbitals, are\nderived. Present methods are compact CC-parameterization alternatives to the\ntime-dependent multiconfiguration self-consistent-field method for systems\nconsisting of arbitrarily different kinds and numbers of interacting fermions.\nTheoretical analysis of applications of present methods to various chemical\nsystems are reported.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zfc2QxR8RJJhdsQ2ejdFeGRDCYWKVCCi9b5A4Zf8Xd4","pdfSize":"567472"}
