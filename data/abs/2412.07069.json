However,\nobtaining sufficient experimental training data is often prohibitively\nexpensive and time-consuming, and models trained solely on synthetic data can\nstruggle to generalize to the unpredictable range of real-world operating\nscenarios. In this work, we pretrain a model using physically derived synthetic\ndata and subsequently leverage transfer learning techniques to fine-tune the\nmodel for a specific target domain. This paradigm enables us to embed physical\nprinciples during the pretraining step, thus requiring less data from the\ntarget domain compared to classical machine learning methods. Results of this\nanalysis indicate that fine-tuned models significantly outperform those trained\nexclusively on synthetic data or solely on target-domain data, particularly in\nthe intermediate data regime (${\\approx} 10^4$ training samples). This\nconclusion is consistent across four different machine learning architectures\n(MLP, CNN, Transformer, and LSTM) considered in this study. This research\nserves as proof of concept for applying transfer learning techniques to\napplication scenarios where access to experimental data is limited.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EGOZ6QUBnDhcfEGCLLtwGcVGMeeI0dOVBAIuUC4_M0M","pdfSize":"449729"}
