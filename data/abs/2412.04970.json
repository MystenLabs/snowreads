  "abstract": "  We show that given a graph G we can CMSO-transduce its modular decomposition,\nits split decomposition and its bi-join decomposition. This improves results by\nCourcelle [Logical Methods in Computer Science, 2006] who gave such\ntransductions using order-invariant MSO, a strictly more expressive logic than\nCMSO. Our methods more generally yield C2MSO-transductions of the canonical\ndecomposition of weakly-partitive set systems and weakly-bipartitive systems of\nbipartitions.\n",
