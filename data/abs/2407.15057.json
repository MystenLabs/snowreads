We then study\nthe curvature properties of this metric structure and use it to establish\nequivalent formulations of the $(\\kappa, \\mu)$-nullity condition in terms of\nthe metric symplectization. We also prove that isomorphisms of the metric\nsymplectizations of $(\\kappa, \\mu)$-manifolds determine $(\\kappa,\n\\mu)$-manifolds up to D-homothetic transformations. These classification\nresults show that the metric symplectization provides a unified framework to\nclassify Sasakian manifolds, K-contact manifolds and $(\\kappa, \\mu)$-manifolds\nin terms of their symplectizations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EQ6H7jIBFjPM6jnmJAVLu6f3nwCtRZYBsW4-be9CpMs","pdfSize":"230629"}
