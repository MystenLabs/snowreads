Computing the minimal WL of a placement\nrequires finding rectilinear Steiner minimum trees (RSMTs), an NP-hard problem.\nWe propose NeuroSteiner, a neural model that distills GeoSteiner, an optimal\nRSMT solver, to navigate the cost--accuracy frontier of WL estimation.\nNeuroSteiner is trained on synthesized nets labeled by GeoSteiner, alleviating\nthe need to train on real chip designs. Moreover, NeuroSteiner's\ndifferentiability allows to place by minimizing WL through gradient descent. On\nISPD 2005 and 2019, NeuroSteiner can obtain 0.3% WL error while being 60%\nfaster than GeoSteiner, or 0.2% and 30%.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"67x_Gw0Dmg7kDRgBBEtrPo9Ad8Vomj54DV7C_Ue7Q_A","pdfSize":"1038843"}
