After\nproper calibration, such a formulation can exactly reproduce two given branches\nof the dispersion curve (acoustic and optical), even in cases with a band gap.\nThe calibration process exploits Fourier images of the unknown weight\nfunctions, which are analytically deduced from the dispersion relation of the\nmaterial of interest. The weight functions are then reconstructed in the\nspatial domain by numerical evaluation of the inverse Fourier transform. The\npresented approach is validated on several examples, including a discrete\nmass-spring chain with two alternating masses, for which the dispersion\nrelation has an explicit analytical form and the optical and acoustic branches\nare separated by a band gap.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sGXd1ZMfTdH5gyIheDloxT98DQ7Jcv727YddN4Ktdi0","pdfSize":"1787476","objectId":"0x6d4e4c14bff9537fb81ce3e4112c1d758b66b2587c9152602e02522bd4fc2cb3","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
