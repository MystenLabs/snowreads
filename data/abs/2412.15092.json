  "abstract": "  We consider the effects of quartic self-interactions on the dynamics of a\nbinary system due to a (nearly) massless scalar field conformally coupled to\nmatter. We investigate the deviations from General Relativity at the\nconservative level and put a bound on the self-coupling $ \\lambda \\lesssim\n(\\beta^2 G_N M_\\odot^2)^{-1}$ where $\\beta$ is the conformal coupling of the\nscalar to matter. We also consider the radiative sector where we use the\nSchwinger-Keldysh formalism to find the tail interactions which couple the\nmultipoles of the binary system and induce a small advance of the periastron.\n",
