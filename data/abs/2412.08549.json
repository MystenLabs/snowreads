While these\nmodels represent a major technical breakthrough, they gain their generative\ncapabilities from being trained on enormous amounts of human-generated content,\nwhich often includes copyrighted material. In this work, we investigate whether\naudio watermarking techniques can be used to detect an unauthorized usage of\ncontent to train a music generation model. We compare outputs generated by a\nmodel trained on watermarked data to a model trained on non-watermarked data.\nWe study factors that impact the model's generation behaviour: the watermarking\ntechnique, the proportion of watermarked samples in the training set, and the\nrobustness of the watermarking technique against the model's tokenizer. Our\nresults show that audio watermarking techniques, including some that are\nimperceptible to humans, can lead to noticeable shifts in the model's outputs.\nWe also study the robustness of a state-of-the-art watermarking technique to\nremoval techniques.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PsU0UER-lvyxQQcmhAc4cKW4ygA0BuC54Ga8e7WfmmM","pdfSize":"834556"}
