  "abstract": "  The quasi-two-dimensional material Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ is a paradigmatic example of\na correlated system that exhibits unconventional superconductivity and\nintriguing magnetic properties. The interplay between these two effects and the\nresulting strength and nature of spin fluctuations and their role for the\nproperties of the compound have sparked significant debates. Here, elaborating\na theory that self-consistently incorporates spatial magnetic fluctuations into\na realistic many-body description, we show that these fluctuations\nsignificantly reduce many-body correlations in the system, thereby preventing\nmagnetic ordering in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, in agreement with experimental\nobservations. Our conclusion is supported by a theoretical calculation of the\nspin susceptibility that closely matches the experimental results. We obtain\nfinite peaks at the incommensurate wave vectors, a broad dome-shaped structure\ncentered around the $\\Gamma$ point and a diminished magnetic response at the\nedges of the BZ. We identify the orbital character of the unusual dome\nstructure as resulting predominantly from the 2D-like $xy$-orbital, which is\nbelieved to be responsible for the superconductivity.\n",
