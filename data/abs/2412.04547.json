By incorporating the\nsuperlattice potential (SL) induced by patterning into the Schrodinger\nequation, we develop a methodology for obtaining exact analytical solutions.\nThese solutions enable us to construct a comprehensive phase diagram\nillustrating the emergence of narrow bands and pseudo-Landau levels driven by\nthe SL potential. To complement the analytical approach, we employ a standard\nplane-wave formalism to track the evolution of the band structure as the SL\nstrength increases. Furthermore, we introduce a self-consistent Hartree\nscreening to account for the interplay between the SL potential and electronic\ninteractions. Our findings not only reveal a competition between SL strength\nand electron-electron interactions, leading to a reduction in the effective\npotential, but also highlight the value of exact analytical solutions for\nunderstanding and engineering electronic phases in patterned 2DEG systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bPQPjdZy5AkrtIvdcHvkaEztNPQ1PBrzbIe_CfTWqis","pdfSize":"5225879"}
