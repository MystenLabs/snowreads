  "abstract": "  The harvesting of quantum resources from the vacuum state of a quantum field\nis a central topic in relativistic quantum information. While several proposals\nfor the harvesting of entanglement from the quantum vacuum exist, less\nattention has been paid to other quantum resources, such as non-stabilizerness,\ncommonly dubbed {\\em magic} and quantified by the Stabilizer R\\'enyi Entropy\n(SRE) \\cite{Leone_2022_SRE}. In this work, we show how to harvest SRE from the\nvacuum state of a massless field, using accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detectors in\nMinkowski spacetime. In particular, one can harvest a particular non-local form\nof SRE that cannot be erased by local unitary operations. This non-local SRE is\na fundamental quantity to study the interplay between entanglement and\nnon-stabilizer resources. We conclude our work with an analysis of the CHSH\ninequalities: one cannot extract a violation from the quantum field even when\none can harvest the necessary resources for it.\n",
