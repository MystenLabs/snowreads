While most studies focus on treatment effect estimation on\nindividual targets, in specific contexts, there is a necessity to comprehend\nthe treatment effect on a group of targets, especially those that have\nrelationships represented as a graph structure between them. In such cases, the\nfocus of treatment assignment is prone to depend on a particular node of the\ngraph, such as the one with the highest degree, thus resulting in an\nobservational bias from a small part of the entire graph. Whereas a bias tends\nto be caused by the small part, straightforward extensions of previous studies\ncannot provide efficient bias mitigation owing to the use of the entire graph\ninformation. In this study, we propose Graph-target Treatment Effect Estimation\n(GraphTEE), a framework designed to estimate treatment effects specifically on\ngraph-structured targets. GraphTEE aims to mitigate observational bias by\nfocusing on confounding variable sets and consider a new regularization\nframework. Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis on how GraphTEE\nperforms better in terms of bias mitigation. Experiments on synthetic and\nsemi-synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LZ-UZkLE6kApKtaXruMrUjj1FqAQ-tnFk_ydSklY5sg","pdfSize":"930647"}
