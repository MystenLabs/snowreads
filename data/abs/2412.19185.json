{"id":"2412.19185","title":"New comments on six-dimensional orientifold vacua with reduced rank and\n  unitarity constraints","authors":"Giorgio Leone","authorsParsed":[["Leone","Giorgio",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Dec 2024 11:46:31 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-30","timestamp":1735213591000,"abstract":"  We revisit and extend the construction of six-dimensional orientifolds built\nupon the $T^4/\\mathbb{Z}_N$ orbifolds with a non-vanishing Kalb-Ramond\nbackground, both in the presence of $\\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ supersymmetry and Brane\nSupersymmetry Breaking, thus amending some statements present in the\nliterature. In the $N=2$ case, we show how the gauge groups on unoriented D9\nand D5 (anti-)branes do not need to be correlated, but can be independently\nchosen complex or real. For $N>2$ we find that the Diophantine tadpole\nconditions severely constrain the vacua. Indeed, only the $N=4$ orbifold with a\nrank-two Kalb-Ramond background may admit integer solutions for the Chan-Paton\nmultiplicities, if the $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ fixed points support $\\text{O}5_-$\nplanes, both with and without supersymmetry. All other cases would involve a\nfractional number of branes, which is clearly unacceptable. We check the\nconsistency of the new $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ vacua by verifying the\nunitarity constraints for string defects coupled to Ramond-Ramond two-forms\nentering the Green-Schwarz-Sagnotti mechanism.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dahLbuha5KU29EQeaJD4Tm24M7pfHhiJkuZxhvMKa5M","pdfSize":"417913"}
