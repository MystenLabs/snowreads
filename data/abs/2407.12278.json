This includes maximum likelihood estimation, empirical risk\nminimization, and so on. In many cases, the resulting estimators can be written\nas solutions to estimating equations, sometimes referred to as $Z$-estimators.\nAsymptotic normality for $Z$-estimators is a well-known result albeit when the\ndimension of the parameter is asymptotically smaller than the square root of\nthe sample size. This hinders statistical inference when the dimension is\n\"large.\" In this paper, we propose a self-normalization-based confidence set\nbypassing the asymptotic normality results. The proposed method is valid in the\nfull range of dimensions growing smaller than the sample size (ignoring\nlogarithmic factors) and asymptotically matches the asymptotic normality based\nconfidence sets when asymptotic normality holds. Our proposal represents the\nfirst such general construction of confidence sets in the full range of\nconsistency of $Z$-estimators.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"W1KrgcqsdiFN_dJqrcJM6G6F1BawF-C7oSAzLQgYDHY","pdfSize":"847370","objectId":"0x30d71201ca7872550a7baa2e6af6fe04f30e61a0cfda43be75ad1abf0fe5ad56","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
