Therefore, populations that reach low density tend to\nremain in this state and can increase only due to rare sequences of favorable\nyears. This stickiness can affect the composition of a community, as many\nspecies become trapped in an almost permanent state of rarity. Here, we present\na solution for the species abundance distribution in scenarios where\nenvironmental stochasticity is the dominant mechanism. We show that in the\nabsence of processes that impose a lower bound on abundances (such as\nimmigration), the community is dominated, at equilibrium, by a single species.\nIn the presence of immigration, the community undergoes a transition from an\negalitarian state, under weak stochasticity, to a very skewed abundance\ndistribution when stochasticity is strong.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution","Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dFdQl9Vf5agHYuEgOowxp_ZCkUo_uKPABSOFbRuOIfE","pdfSize":"955686"}
