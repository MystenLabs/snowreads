  "abstract": "  Building safe Large Language Models (LLMs) across multiple languages is\nessential in ensuring both safe access and linguistic diversity. To this end,\nwe introduce M-ALERT, a multilingual benchmark that evaluates the safety of\nLLMs in five languages: English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. M-ALERT\nincludes 15k high-quality prompts per language, totaling 75k, following the\ndetailed ALERT taxonomy. Our extensive experiments on 10 state-of-the-art LLMs\nhighlight the importance of language-specific safety analysis, revealing that\nmodels often exhibit significant inconsistencies in safety across languages and\ncategories. For instance, Llama3.2 shows high unsafety in the category\ncrime_tax for Italian but remains safe in other languages. Similar differences\ncan be observed across all models. In contrast, certain categories, such as\nsubstance_cannabis and crime_propaganda, consistently trigger unsafe responses\nacross models and languages. These findings underscore the need for robust\nmultilingual safety practices in LLMs to ensure safe and responsible usage\nacross diverse user communities.\n",
