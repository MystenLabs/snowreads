Spin\npolarization at the sample edges may occur as the response of systems with\nstrong SO-coupling to an external transport current, an effect known as spin\nHall effect. Here, we show that in a 2DEG with Rashba SO-coupling, spin\npolarization near the sample edge can develop kinematically for low electron\ndensities. We also discuss the effect in quantum wires where lateral\nconfinement plays an important role.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"lKOGZwLnjOWEQcNzVO_zbIIUQrOiyIXwif3LPwYnnXE","pdfSize":"726072"}
