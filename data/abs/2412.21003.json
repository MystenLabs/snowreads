However, finding such\nmaterials remains a formidable challenge. Here, we report high-resolution\ninelastic neutron scattering measurements performed on VI3, a van der Waals\nferromagnetic Mott insulator, covering a wide range of reciprocal space. Our\nmeasurements unveil highly anisotropic magnetic excitations in momentum space.\nThrough a comprehensive comparative analysis of various models that incorporate\ndiverse symmetry-allowed magnetic interactions, we find the observed\nexcitations are well captured by a model with a large bond-dependent Kitaev\ninteraction. These results not only help to understand the intriguing\nproperties of VI3, such as the pronounced anomalous thermal Hall effects and\nstrong pressure/structure dependence of magnetism, but also open a new avenue\nfor exploring Kitaev physics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"R8izpEIoXHNmv3OquwBMe6stPGS92BtBjBgGRu9wAq8","pdfSize":"5560535"}
