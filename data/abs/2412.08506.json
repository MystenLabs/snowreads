  "abstract": "  Human-object interaction (HOI) detectors with popular query-transformer\narchitecture have achieved promising performance. However, accurately\nidentifying uncommon visual patterns and distinguishing between ambiguous HOIs\ncontinue to be difficult for them. We observe that these difficulties may arise\nfrom the limited capacity of traditional detector queries in representing\ndiverse intra-category patterns and inter-category dependencies. To address\nthis, we introduce the Interaction Prompt Distribution Learning (InterProDa)\napproach. InterProDa learns multiple sets of soft prompts and estimates\ncategory distributions from various prompts. It then incorporates HOI queries\nwith category distributions, making them capable of representing near-infinite\nintra-category dynamics and universal cross-category relationships. Our\nInterProDa detector demonstrates competitive performance on HICO-DET and vcoco\nbenchmarks. Additionally, our method can be integrated into most\ntransformer-based HOI detectors, significantly enhancing their performance with\nminimal additional parameters.\n",
