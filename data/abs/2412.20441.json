  "abstract": "  This note is intended for expanding the details on the derivation and\nproperties of density functional theory, in hope to make them more systematic,\nbetter motivated, and step-by-step for readers new to the domain. The note\nstarts with basic concepts in quantum mechanics, then takes the step towards\nmany-body systems using the tools of second quantization and Fock space, with\nsome highlights on properties of the Coulomb system. Given these general\ntechnical preparations, the Hartree-Fock method is naturally unrolled, with\nexpressions for various cases and quantities. Density functional theory is then\npresented, with a motivating reasoning of the Kohn-Sham formulation, and a\nconnection and comparison of the expressions with the Hartree-Fock method.\nLieb's celebrated 1983 paper on functional analysis on density functionals is\nalso summarized.\n",
