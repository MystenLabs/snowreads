  "abstract": "  We investigate canonically quantized open string solutions associated to the\nanalytically continued action for the recently proposed tropical limit of\ntopological A-type models, tropological sigma models, with various boundary\nconditions. These solutions naturally give rise to a non-relativistic\ncounterpart of branes, which we name tropical branes. We provide a preliminary\nworldsheet description of these tropical branes, laying the groundwork for an\nupcoming paper that will explore the role of tropical branes in the context of\nbrane quantization.\n",
