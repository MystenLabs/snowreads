In this paper, we show our\ndevelopment of a wearable electronic stethoscope, coined Patchkeeper (PK), that\ncan be used for internal body sound recording over long periods of time.\nPatchkeeper also integrates several state-of-the-art biological sensors,\nincluding electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmography (PPG), and inertial\nmeasurement unit (IMU) sensors. As a wearable device, Patchkeeper can be placed\non various parts of the body to collect sound from particular organs, including\nheart, lung, stomach, and joints etc. We show in this paper that several vital\nsignals can be recorded simultaneously with high quality. As Patchkeeper can be\noperated directly by the user, e.g. without involving health care\nprofessionals, we believe it could be a useful tool for telemedicine and remote\ndiagnostics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"vSbxutGh8DX6HBnmyt_kRxKCI7lcEtcbwIoJb6HbpFw","pdfSize":"3313781"}
