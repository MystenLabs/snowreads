  "abstract": "  We investigate the global hypoellipticity and global solvability of systems\nof left-invariant differential operators on compact Lie groups. Focusing on\ndiagonal systems, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for these\nglobal properties. Specifically, we show that global solvability is\ncharacterized by a Diophantine condition on the symbol of the system, while\nglobal hypoellipticity further requires that a set depending on the symbol to\nbe finite. As an application, we provide a complete characterization of these\nproperties for systems of vector fields defined on products of tori and\nspheres. Additionally, we present illustrative examples, including systems\ninvolving higher-order differential operators. Finally, we extend our analysis\nto triangular systems on compact Lie groups, introducing an additional\ncondition related to the boundedness of the dimensions of the representations\nin these Lie groups.\n",
