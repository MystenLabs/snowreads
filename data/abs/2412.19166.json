This is achieved by expressing the memory kernels as a linear\nsuperposition of exponentially decaying modes. Given the structure of the\ninteraction with the internal degrees of freedom, and assuming the\nrepresentation of the thermal force as a superposition of modal contributions,\nthe fluctuation-dissipation relation follows simply from the moment analysis of\nthe corresponding Fokker-Planck equation, imposing the condition that at\nequilibrium all the internal degrees of freedom are uncorrelated with particle\nvelocity. Moreover, the functional structure of the resulting equation of\nmotion corresponds to the principle of complete decoupling amongst the internal\ndegrees of freedom. The theory is extended to the case of confined geometries,\nby generalizing previous results including the effect of fluid inertia.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DCgpZTT5jvGMbf5tr6SUb3yzu8HnupzQ-cvEBTz2w2o","pdfSize":"1146092"}
