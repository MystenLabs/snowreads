  "abstract": "  We investigated the complete thermodynamic cycle of aluminium nanoparticles\nthrough classical molecular dynamics simulations, spanning a wide size range\nfrom 200 atoms to 11000 atoms. The aluminium-aluminium interactions are\nmodelled using a newly developed Bayesian Force Field (BFF) from the FLARE\nsuite, a cutting-edge tool in our field. We discuss the database requirements\nto include melted nanodroplets to avoid unphysical behaviour at the phase\ntransition. Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of structural\nstability up to sizes as large as $3~ 10^5$ atoms. The developed Al-BFF\npredicts an icosahedral stability range of up to 2000 atoms, approximately 2\nnm, followed by a region of stability for decahedra, up to 25000 atoms. Beyond\nthis size, the expected structure favours face-centred cubic (FCC) shapes. At a\nfixed heating/cooling rate of 100K/ns, we consistently observe a hysteresis\nloop, where the melting temperatures are higher than those associated with\nsolidification. The annealing of a liquid droplet further stabilizes\nicosahedral structures, extending their stability range to 5000 atoms. Using a\nhierarchical k-means clustering, we find no evidence of surface melting but\nobserve some mild indication of surface freezing. In any event, the liquid\ndroplet's surface shows local structural order at all sizes.\n",
