New constraints are reported on the\nproduction cross-section times branching fraction for charged Higgs boson\nmasses between 200 GeV and 3000 GeV. The results are interpreted in the context\nof the Georgi-Machacek model for which the most stringent constraints to date\nare set for the masses considered in the combination.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cB_KVehYEaiyhZwUNeRuWNwOUYdIyA6sxoncdWf7Mz0","pdfSize":"1694044"}
