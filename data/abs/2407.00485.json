Our coarse propagators are based on the coarsening\nof the numerical discretization scheme combined with, if possible, temporal\ncoarsening rather than coarsening of particles and/or Fourier modes, which are\nnot possible or effective for PIF schemes. Specifically, we use PIF with a\ncoarse tolerance for nonuniform FFTs or even the standard particle-in-cell\nschemes as coarse propagators for the ParaPIF algorithm. We state and prove the\nconvergence of the algorithm and verify the results numerically with Landau\ndamping, two-stream instability, and Penning trap test cases in 3D-3V. We also\nimplement the space-time parallelization of the PIF schemes in the open-source,\nperformance-portable library IPPL and conduct scaling studies up to 1536 A100\nGPUs on the JUWELS booster supercomputer. The space-time parallelization\nutilizing the ParaPIF algorithm for the time parallelization provides up to\n$4-6$ times speedup compared to spatial parallelization alone and achieves a\npush rate of around 1 billion particles per second for the benchmark plasma\nmini-apps considered.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Srp_l_jMah9Fb2HeHFjUilwDCeBoqzy8qhBYFjerNoc","pdfSize":"4613397"}
