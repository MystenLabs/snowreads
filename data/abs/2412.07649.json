  "abstract": "  We propose a method to learn the nonlinear impulse responses to structural\nshocks using neural networks, and apply it to uncover the effects of US\nfinancial shocks. The results reveal substantial asymmetries with respect to\nthe sign of the shock. Adverse financial shocks have powerful effects on the US\neconomy, while benign shocks trigger much smaller reactions. Instead, with\nrespect to the size of the shocks, we find no discernible asymmetries.\n",
