Photo-induced force microscopy (PiFM) employs\npulsed illumination and noncontact force microscopy resulting in unprecedented\nspatial and high spectral resolution. The near-field-enhanced light absorption\nin the materials leads to thermal expansion affecting the distance-dependent\nweak van der Waals (VdW) force acting between the tip and the sample. We model\nthe non-linear impact of material characteristics and surface shape on the\ntip-sample interaction, the heat generation from the presence of a\nphoto-induced electric field, the associated thermal expansion under different\nillumination conditions including light polarization and the feedback to the\ndynamic tip motion due to the expansion. Comparison of the results with our\nexperimental investigation of a polymer nanosphere shows good agreement,\ncontributing new insights into the understanding required for a quantitative\nanalysis of nanostructured materials imaged using PiFM.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7F_vmF7t1r173jA9ws1-YFSg0gLhz5hdVT9cW9VdmYA","pdfSize":"2310513"}
