To explore this, we utilized the renormalized\nfirst Nikitin model, revealing an exponential detuning variation with a phase\nand an imaginary coupling along with the shift. By employing the time-dependent\nSchr\\\"odinger equation, we investigated the behavior of our system. Our\nfindings indicate that the imaginary coupling provides specific information,\nwhile the shift generates allowed and forbidden zones in the energy diagram of\nthe real part of the energy. In the diagram of the imaginary part of the\nenergy, time dictates order or chaos in the system and identifies the\ninformation transmission zone. Notably, the first Nikitin model exhibits\nsimilarities to the Rabi model in the short-time approximation. Our theoretical\nconclusions are consistent with numerical solutions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"J-C-ht9CRlowVJZPtcUEy6Q8x7THL2mPXgss4m8QutU","pdfSize":"12789385"}
