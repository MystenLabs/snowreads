This work extends the same\nparadigm to time-evolving worldsheets in the background target spacetime\nspanning the Kasner wedges. Specifically, we demonstrate that approaching the\nnull horizons of the Kasner worldsheet induces a Carrollian structure,\nnecessitating an infinite limit on the time-evolution parameter. We further\nexamine how the associated Bogoliubov transformations on the usual tensile\nKasner worldsheets -- encompassing quantum modes, vacuum states, and\noscillators -- provide insights into their yet-unexplored tensionless regime.\nIntriguingly, phenomena such as null string complementarity (i.e., the\nemergence of open string physics from closed strings) and Hagedorn physics\nnaturally arise in the quantum vacuum of tensionless worldsheets. These\nfindings validate that time-like entanglement in Kasner worldsheets is not\nmerely analogous to, but exactly equivalent to, space-like entanglement in\nRindler worldsheets, viewed in distinct causally-disconnected regions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PKA5fvBgx-wiL_ZUxtJicw2ZNiFS1CVp8BDrhBHLu7Y","pdfSize":"1191457"}
