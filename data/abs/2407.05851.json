Both static and\ndynamic magnetization studies show that non-trivial shape anisotropy,\nchirality, and inhomogeneous demagnetization fields influenced by specific\ncrystallographic arrangements lead to multiple low-energy state magnetization\ntextures, spin-wave mode localization, and controllable spin-wave propagation,\nhighlighting the substantial potential of gyroidal nanostructures.\n  The review integrates insights into micro/nano texturing to elucidate the\nintricate relationships between gyroidal geometry, chirality, and their\neffective magnetic properties, especially at microwave frequencies. Our study\nof resonance frequencies in gyroid samples under rotational field manipulation\nfurther reveals the significant influence of geometric anisotropy on\nferromagnetic resonance signal strength. This chapter establishes a fundamental\nunderstanding of ferromagnetic gyroidal nanostructures, paving the way for\ntheir future investigation in 3D magnonics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ddNmgEDu0FjfoP35i1aw_gnAxkSiTdV6SIXDhuAzVzI","pdfSize":"35281488"}
