We\nuse conditionally clean ancillae to reduce the gate counts and depths of\nseveral circuit constructions. In particular, we present:\n  (a) n-controlled NOT using 2n Toffolis and O(log n) depth given 2 clean\nancillae.\n  (b) n-qubit incrementer using 3n Toffolis given log*(n) clean ancillae.\n  (c) n-qubit quantum-classical comparator using 3n Toffolis given log*(n)\nclean ancillae.\n  (d) unary iteration over [0, N) using 2.5N Toffolis given 2 clean ancillae.\n  (e) unary iteration via skew tree over [0, N) using 1.25 N Toffolis given n\ndirty ancillae.\n  We also describe a technique for laddered toggle detection to replace clean\nancillae with dirty ancillae in all our constructions with a 2x Toffoli\noverhead. Our constructions achieve the lowest gate counts to date with\nsublinear ancilla requirements and should be useful building blocks to optimize\ncircuits in the low-qubit regime of Early Fault Tolerance.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0J8Sabbwi-gwRye6160BWGHjeO48vMFcH0q36uKsoqc","pdfSize":"5574932"}
