Our study\nfocuses on the extraction of the concepts that form metaphoric analogies in\nliterary texts. To this end, we construct a novel dataset in this domain with\nthe help of domain experts. We compare the out-of-the-box ability of recent\nlarge language models (LLMs) to structure metaphoric mappings from fragments of\ntexts containing proportional analogies. The models are further evaluated on\nthe generation of implicit elements of the analogy, which are indirectly\nsuggested in the texts and inferred by human readers. The competitive results\nobtained by LLMs in our experiments are encouraging and open up new avenues\nsuch as automatically extracting analogies and metaphors from text instead of\ninvesting resources in domain experts to manually label data.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2PzM5erhtUqqltoseFg01KDKJaLGMw7ZkpOqUwyqYZg","pdfSize":"366195"}
