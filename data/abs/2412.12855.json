  "abstract": "  The scalar meson $f_{0}(980)$ has long posed a perplexing puzzle within the\nrealm of light hadron physics. Conventionally, its mass and width in normal\ndecay processes have been estimated as $M=990\\pm20$~MeV/$c^2$ and\n$\\Gamma=40-100$~MeV, respectively. Theoretical explanations regarding the\ninternal structure of $f_{0}(980)$ range from it being a conventional\nquark-antiquark meson to a tetraquark state, a $K\\overline{K}$ molecule, or\neven a quark-antiquark gluon hybrid. However, a definitive consensus has\nremained elusive over a considerable duration. Recent observations by the\nBESIII experiment have unveiled anomalously narrow widths of $f_{0}(980)$ in\nfive independent isospin-symmetry-breaking decay channels. Harnessing these\nexperimental findings, we performed a simultaneous fit to the $\\pi\\pi$\ninvariant mass distributions, resulting in a refined determination of the mass\nand width in isospin-symmetry-breaking decays as\n$M=990.0\\pm0.4(\\text{stat})\\pm0.1(\\text{syst})$~MeV/$c^2$ and\n$\\Gamma=11.4\\pm1.1(\\text{stat})\\pm0.9(\\text{syst})$~MeV, respectively. Here,\nthe first errors are statistical and the second are systematic. Furthermore, by\nemploying the parameterized Flatt\\'{e} formula to fit the same $\\pi\\pi$\ninvariant mass distributions, we ascertained the values of the two coupling\nconstants, $g_{f\\pi\\pi}$ and $g_{fK\\overline{K}}$, as $g_{f\\pi\\pi}=0.46\\pm0.03$\nand $g_{fK\\overline{K}}=1.24\\pm0.32$, respectively. Based on the joint\nconfidence regions of $g_{f\\pi\\pi}$ and $g_{fK\\overline{K}}$, we draw the\nconclusion that the experimental data exhibit a propensity to favor the\n$K\\overline{K}$ molecule model and the quark-antiquark ($q\\bar{q}$) model,\nwhile offering relatively less support for the tetraquarks ($q^{2}\\bar{q}^{2}$)\nmodel and the quark-antiquark gluon ($q\\bar{q}g$) hybrid model.\n",
