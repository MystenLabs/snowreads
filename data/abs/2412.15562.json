In this context, the digital copy\nmanagement algorithm based on the P2M (Project to Method) method plays a\nsignificant role in increasing efficiency and reducing costs through the\nimplementation of digital technologies. This research aims to develop and\nimplement an algorithm for managing a digital copy of a project using the P2M\nmethod using the Kolmogorov test to evaluate the effectiveness of various\nprocesses and determine the best ways to improve productivity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computer Science/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QUDx4ufXoTVIN_9z-YGL8E6_-KLzk6Bz4XwG6bXe_qQ","pdfSize":"1470469"}
