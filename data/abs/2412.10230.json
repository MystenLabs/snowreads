  "abstract": "  Rivulets and droplets are naturally appearing shapes when small amounts of\nliquid are deposited on a partially wettable substrate. Here we study, by means\nof numerical simulations, the dewetting dynamics of a ring-rivulet on\nsubstrates with various contact angles and wettability patterns. In particular,\nwe consider, beyond the homogeous case, an annular band of lower contact angle\nas compared to the background and a constant radial gradient of contact angle,\npointing either inward or outward from the centre. We show that by tuning the\nparameters characterizing the patterns, it is possible to control not only the\nstability of the rivulet, i.e. its breakup/collapse dynamics and the associated\ntime scales, but also the dewetting morphology, in terms of number and position\nof the formed droplets.\n",
