A Mixed-Method\n  Study","authors":"Kevin Phong Pham and Michael Neumann","authorsParsed":[["Pham","Kevin Phong",""],["Neumann","Michael",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2024 19:53:01 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-10","timestamp":1720468381000,"abstract":"  Context: Software process improvement (SPI) is known as a key for being\nsuccessfull in software development. Measuring quality and performance is of\nhigh importance in agile software development as agile approaches focussing\nstrongly on short-term success in dynamic markets. Even if software engineering\nresearch emphasizes the importance of performance metrics while using agile\nmethods, the literature lacks on detail how to apply such metrics in practice\nand what challenges may occur while using them. Objective: The core objective\nof our study is to identify challenges that arise when using agile software\ndevelopment performance metrics in practice and how we can improve their\nsuccessful application. Method: We decided to design a mixed-method study.\nFirst, we performed a rapid literature review to provide an up-to-date overview\nof used performance metrics. Second, we conducted a single case study using a\nfocus group approach and qualitativ data collection and analysis in a\nreal-world setting. Results: Our results show that while widely used\nperformance metrics such as story points and burn down charts are widely used\nin practice, agile software development teams face challenges due to a lack of\ntransparency and standardization as well as insufficient accuracy.\nContributions: Based on our findings, we present a repository of widely used\nperformance metrics for agile software development. Furthermore, we present\nimplications for practitioners and researchers especially how to deal with\nchallenges agile software development face while applying such metrics in\npractice.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EGJV-WGj6UHIv0oBTS6YNAvlYoRNyZ3n8NfA_oN21SI","pdfSize":"194772"}
