To address this, we propose HierTKG, a\nframework combining Temporal Graph Networks (TGN) and hierarchical pooling\n(DiffPool) to model rumor dynamics across temporal and structural scales.\nHierTKG captures key propagation phases, enabling improved temporal link\nprediction and actionable insights for misinformation control. Experiments\ndemonstrate its effectiveness, achieving an MRR of 0.9845 on ICEWS14 and 0.9312\non WikiData, with competitive performance on noisy datasets like PHEME (MRR:\n0.8802). By modeling structured event sequences and dynamic social\ninteractions, HierTKG adapts to diverse propagation patterns, offering a\nscalable and robust solution for real-time analysis and prediction of rumor\nspread, aiding proactive intervention strategies.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Social and Information Networks","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VxCnTcfFSMOt3Fi9JkF0XEokH2EnrnZbrpxebCOskfo","pdfSize":"741793"}
