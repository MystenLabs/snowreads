For a small forcing, the system remains close\nto equilibrium and the large deviation functional of the density can be\ncomputed perturbatively by using the macroscopic fluctuation theory. This\napplies to general domains in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ and diffusive dynamics with\narbitrary transport coefficients. As a consequence, one can analyse the\ncorrelations at the first non trivial order in the forcing and show that, in\ngeneral, all the long range correlation functions are not equal to 0, in\ncontrast to the exactly solvable models previously known.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zpDllcU7gPSOO0vJJtdskbp8AdOc2R2fWGfNTwv-BYI","pdfSize":"1261581"}
