Gliomas, the most common primary brain tumors, arise\nfrom the carcinogenesis of glial cells in the brain and spinal cord, with\nglioblastoma patients having a median survival time of less than 14 months. MRI\nserves as a non-invasive and effective method for tumor detection, but manual\nsegmentation of brain MRI scans has traditionally been a labor-intensive task\nfor neuroradiologists. Recent advancements in computer-aided design (CAD),\nmachine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) offer promising solutions for\nautomating this process. This study proposes an automated deep learning model\nfor brain tumor detection and classification using MRI data. The model,\nincorporating spatial attention, achieved 96.90% accuracy, enhancing the\naggregation of contextual information for better pattern recognition.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms\nbaseline models, highlighting its robustness and potential for advancing\nautomated MRI-based brain tumor analysis.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xu_S19eBBPg1mp-U6FhIFicXZP4M6gbkG3HHEH0xzdE","pdfSize":"222237"}
