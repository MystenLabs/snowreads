By studying qubits coupled to cavity photons and driven at the resonance\nfrequency of the cavity $\\omega_{\\rm r}$, we establish a universal connection\nbetween the qubit AC Stark shift and the longitudinal and dispersive coupling\nto photons. We find that the longitudinal coupling $g_\\parallel$ is controlled\nby the slope of the AC Stark shift as function of the driving strength $A_{\\rm\nq}$, while the dispersive shift $\\chi$ depends on its curvature. The two\nquantities become proportional to each other in the weak drive limit ($A_{\\rm\nq}\\rightarrow 0$). Our approach unifies the adiabatic limit ($\\omega_{\\rm\nr}\\rightarrow 0$) -- where $g_\\parallel$ is generated by the static spectrum\ncurvature (or quantum capacitance) -- with the diabatic one, where the static\nspectrum plays no role. We derive analytical results supported by exact\nnumerical simulations. We apply them to superconducting and spin-hybrid cQED\nsystems, showcasing the flexibility of faster-than-dispersive longitudinal\nreadout.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4rNWaUcofa4_xttQfwb9QvnNmbdbi0Mb5c16uF97Xc4","pdfSize":"5503883"}
