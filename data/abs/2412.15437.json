  "abstract": "  This paper studies the design of controllers for discontinuous dynamics that\nensure the safety of non-smooth sets. The safe set is represented by\narbitrarily nested unions and intersections of 0-superlevel sets of\ndifferentiable functions. We show that any optimization-based controller that\nsatisfies only the point-wise active safety constraints is generally un-safe,\nruling out the standard techniques developed for safety of continuous dynamics.\nThis motivates the introduction of the notion of transition functions, which\nallow us to incorporate even the inactive safety constraints without falling\ninto unnecessary conservatism. These functions allow system trajectories to\nleave a component of the nonsmooth safe set to transition to a different one.\nThe resulting controller is then defined as the solution to a convex\noptimization problem, which we show is feasible and continuous wherever the\nsystem dynamics is continuous. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed\ndesign approach in a multi-agent reconfiguration control problem.\n",
