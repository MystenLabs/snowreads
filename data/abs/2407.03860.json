However,\nexisting approaches are often either too general, not taking into account the\ndiversity of genres and mechanisms between video games, or too narrow,\nselecting tools that were specifically designed for educational purposes. In\nthis paper we propose a more fundamental approach, defining beneficial\nconnections between individual design patterns present in video games and\ncomputational thinking skills. We argue that video games have the capacity to\nelicit these skills and even to potentially train them. This could be an\neffective method to solidify a conceptual base which would make programming\neducation more effective.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multimedia","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gDKiVqMuf81GqrOcbTnd6bC3agla1cejdkoJT_4qykk","pdfSize":"367898"}
