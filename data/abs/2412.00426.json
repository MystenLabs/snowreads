  "abstract": "  Named-entity recognition (NER) is a task that typically requires large\nannotated datasets, which limits its applicability across domains with varying\nentity definitions. This paper addresses few-shot NER, aiming to transfer\nknowledge to new domains with minimal supervision. Unlike previous approaches\nthat rely solely on limited annotated data, we propose a weakly supervised\nalgorithm that combines small labeled datasets with large amounts of unlabeled\ndata. Our method extends the k-means algorithm with label supervision, cluster\nsize constraints and domain-specific discriminative subspace selection. This\nunified framework achieves state-of-the-art results in few-shot NER on several\nEnglish datasets.\n",
