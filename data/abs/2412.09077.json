  "abstract": "  The proximal point algorithm plays a central role in non-smooth convex\nprogramming. The Augmented Lagrangian Method, one of the most famous\noptimization algorithms, has been found to be closely related to the proximal\npoint algorithm. Due to its importance, accelerated variants of the proximal\npoint algorithm have received considerable attention. In this paper, we first\nstudy an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) system, which provides valuable\ninsights into proving the convergence rate of the desired algorithm. Using the\nLyapunov function technique, we establish the convergence rate of the ODE\nsystem. Next, we apply the Symplectic Euler Method to discretize the ODE system\nto derive a new proximal point algorithm, called the Symplectic Proximal Point\nAlgorithm (SPPA). By utilizing the proof techniques developed for the ODE\nsystem, we demonstrate the convergence rate of the SPPA. Additionally, it is\nshown that existing accelerated proximal point algorithm can be considered a\nspecial case of the SPPA in a specific manner. Furthermore, under several\nadditional assumptions, we prove that the SPPA exhibits a finer convergence\nrate.\n",
