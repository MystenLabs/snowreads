In contrast to the sate-of-the-art Eulerian models, PyDDC uses\na Lagrangian approach to simulate the Fickian transport of single phase solute\nmixtures. This introduces additional flexibility of incorporating anisotropic\ndispersion and benefits from having no numerical artifacts in its\nimplementation. It also includes $\\mathrm{CO_2}$--brine phase equilibrium\nmodels, developed by other researchers, to study the overall dynamics in the\npresence of electrolyte brine at different pressure and temperatures above the\ncritical point of $\\mathrm{CO_2}$. We demonstrate the implementation procedure\nin depth, outlining the overall structure of the numerical solver and its\ndifferent attributes that can be used for solving specific tasks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FrYTV3W4V3s8s-O4ip4k318dIYWPz-sWg-FELenOaEE","pdfSize":"4991435","objectId":"0xd15e426aca851438530135166ad084ac72fb06d8dbffff0da2d57481016bf968","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
