  "abstract": "  An exact analytical expression is derived for Bloch states in three\ndimensions, based on the only assumption that the electronic wavefunction can\nbe expanded in terms of Gaussian type orbitals.\n  The resulting expression features multidimensional $\\vartheta -$functions\n(and their derivatives) on which the action of discrete space group symmetries\nis evaluated analytically and contrasted against the symmetry transformations\nproper of modular forms.\n  We integrate group theoretical arguments with continuity requirements of the\nBloch states to produce a viable algorithm for the determination of band\ninversions in materials with a non-trivial topological electronic band\nstructure; the proposed methodology is then applied to two simplified materials\nmodels.\n",
