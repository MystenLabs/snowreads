  "abstract": "  We prove $\\mathrm{H}^1$ and $\\mathrm{BMO}$ endpoint inequalities for generic\ncancellative Haar shifts defined with respect to a possibly non-homogeneous\nBorel measure $\\mu$ satisfying a weak regularity condition. This immediately\nyields a new, highly streamlined proof of the $L^p$-results for the same\noperators due to L\\'opez-Sanchez, Martell, and Parcet. We also prove regularity\nproperties for the Haar shift operators on the natural martingale Lipschitz\nspaces defined with respect to the underlying dyadic system, and show that the\nclass of measures that we consider is sharp.\n",
