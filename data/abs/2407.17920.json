One critical development in ETS was the\nestablishment of a robust statistical foundation based on state space models\nwith a single source of error. However, an important challenge in ETS that\nremains unsolved is censored data estimation. This issue is critical in supply\nchain management, in particular, when companies have to deal with stockouts.\nThis work solves that problem by proposing the Tobit ETS, which extends the use\nof ETS models to handle censored data efficiently. This advancement builds upon\nthe linear models taxonomy and extends it to encompass censored data scenarios.\nThe results show that the Tobit ETS reduces considerably the forecast bias.\nReal and simulation data are used from the airline and supply chain industries\nto corroborate the findings.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"r_wMvEfj1BRM-7ABlmNzCXhP3mWBmDxXz_Yd2kkojYA","pdfSize":"266896"}
