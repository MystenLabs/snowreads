  "abstract": "  The dynamics of the merger of a dwarf disc galaxy with a massive spiral\ngalaxy of the Milky Way type have been studied in detail. The remnant of such\ninteraction after numerous crossings of the satellite through the disc of the\nmain galaxy is a compact stellar core, the characteristics of which are close\nto small compact elliptical galaxies (cEs) or large ultra-compact dwarfs\n(UCDs). Such transitional cE/UCD objects with an effective radius of 100-200 pc\narise as a result of stripping the outer layers of the stellar core during the\ndestruction of a disc dwarf galaxy. Numerical models of the satellite before\ninteraction include baryonic matter (stars and gas) and dark mass. We use\nN-body to describe the dynamics of stars and dark matter and Smoothed-Particle\nHydrodynamics to model the gas components of both galaxies. The direct method\nof calculating the gravitational force between all particles provides a\nqualitative resolution of spatial structures up to 10 pc. The simulated cE/UCD\ngalaxies contain very little gas and dark matter at the end of their evolution.\n",
