Through the concept of positional information, such\ncomponents are able to specify their position in order to, e.g., create robust\nspatial patterns or coordinate specific functionality. Such complex behaviour\ngenerally occurs far from thermodynamic equilibrium and thus requires the\ndissipation of free energy to sustain functionality. We show that in\nboundary-driven simple exclusion systems with position-dependent Langmuir\nkinetics, non-trivial Pareto-optimal trade-offs exist between the positional\ninformation, rescaled entropy production rate and global reaction current.\nPhase transitions in the optimal protocols that tune the densities of the\nsystem boundaries emerge as a result, showing that distinct protocols are able\nto exchange global optimality similar to phase coexistence in liquid-gas phase\ntransitions, and that increasing the positional information can lead to\ndiminishing returns when considering increased dissipation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RZTNC5FATQPolrNyNVStl5EvQ4jLg284V8OoLs2q8n0","pdfSize":"5856740"}
