For a given stable perturbation\n$B$ of $A$, explicit expressions of its core-EP inverse\n$B^{\\scriptsize\\textcircled{\\tiny $\\dagger$}}$ and its projection at zero\n$B^\\pi$ are presented. Then, the perturbation bounds of $\\parallel\nB^{\\scriptsize\\textcircled{\\tiny $\\dagger$}}-A^{\\scriptsize\\textcircled{\\tiny\n$\\dagger$}}\\parallel/\\parallel A^{\\scriptsize\\textcircled{\\tiny\n$\\dagger$}}\\parallel$ and $\\parallel B^{\\pi}-A^{\\pi}\\parallel$ are given\nprovided that $B$ is a stable perturbation of $A$. In addition, we investigate\nthe concept of acute perturbation of $A$. We give a perturbation analysis with\nrespect to core-EP inverses. We provide a condition under which the acute\nperturbation coincides with the stable perturbation for core-EP inverses.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"51YoAIj4a1yrkaG56pM2GmZTP0shuc70aqpwbRXcEz0","pdfSize":"173423"}
