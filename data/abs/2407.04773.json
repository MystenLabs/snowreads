Harnessing the transformer's capacity to capture\nlong-range correlations, we compute the full phase diagram and critical\nproperties of the model, in both the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cases.\nOur findings show that the ViT maintains high accuracy across the full phase\ndiagram. We compare these results with previous numerical studies in the\nliterature and, in particular, show that the ViT has a superior performance\nthan a restricted-Boltzmann-machine-like ansatz.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pVAaUpEEKm9Fnr1LE99sw7hdC0CMhvrqsL32yZoaRL8","pdfSize":"3714182"}
