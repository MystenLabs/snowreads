  "abstract": "  We reason that various recent works by different groups reporting new\nphenomenologies in superconductors can be understood in a unifying way as\ninstances of the appearance of novel competitions (or synergies in some cases)\nbetween the coexisting orders at play in superconducting materials. In\nparticular, we argue that the main common feature of such phenomenologies is to\nhave emerged from the induction, by nanoengineering, of novel characteristic\nlengths for each order, or of custom regular spatial patterns affecting them.\nWe claim, thus, that a fruitful path to discover new phenomenology is opened by\nthese and future searches of novel nanostructurations of superconducting\nmaterials.\n",
