The conductivities\ndevelop peaks and troughs as functions of real frequency at low temperatures\nand for $m/b$ close to the phase transition. We compute the poles of the\nconductivities as functions of complex frequency, finding poles with small\nimaginary part at low temperatures and close to the phase transition.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"deHuAYfLpC5vV6FraBd3eDSAam82J10W3Nm_h8ataWM","pdfSize":"2395609"}
