This paper proposes a solution by\ncombining both approaches and embedding a Large Language Model (LLM) in CP. The\nLLM handles word generation and meaning, while CP manages structural\nconstraints. This approach builds on GenCP, an improved version of On-the-fly\nConstraint Programming Search (OTFS) using LLM-generated domains. Compared to\nBeam Search (BS), a standard NLP method, this combined approach (GenCP with\nLLM) is faster and produces better results, ensuring all constraints are\nsatisfied. This fusion of CP and ML presents new possibilities for enhancing\ntext generation under constraints.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"h7bqUtUV5d8s9xcfJY9plkfIW-tej6W4Kk-SOnFTlgw","pdfSize":"480787"}
