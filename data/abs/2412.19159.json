By adopting a curriculum that\nmirrors the progressive complexity encountered in human learning, our approach\nsystematically enhances robots' ability to interpret and execute complex\ninstructions over time. We explore the principles of DRL and its synergy with\nICL, demonstrating how this combination not only improves training efficiency\nbut also equips mobile robots with the generalization capability required for\nnavigating through dynamic indoor environments. Empirical results indicate that\nrobots trained with our ICL-enhanced DRL framework outperform those trained\nwithout curriculum learning, highlighting the benefits of structured learning\nprogressions in robotic training.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Robotics","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_k6jC7dVbDw8THkmLhnJUwiGnQxNlc08-X3eKzL2OeE","pdfSize":"3110654"}
