The results obtained allow us to supply the\nbundle algorithm with suitable, easily computable ``pseudogradients'', ensuring\nconvergence to points satisfying a stationary condition. Both the theory and\ncomputational implementation heavily rely on the notion of SCD (subspace\ncontaining derivatives) mappings and the associated calculus. The approach is\nvalidated via a complex MPEC with equilibrium governed by a variational\ninequality of the 2nd kind and by an academic bilevel program with a nonsmooth\nupper-level objective.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nOiguZpQ5Dzh-DxagJuAXM2lqZOO0IUhJNh06DA2L-s","pdfSize":"376370"}
