We prove a Terao-type factorization statement on the\nsplitting of such a polynomial over the rationals under the assumption that our\nconic-line arrangements are free and admit ordinary quasi-homogeneous\nsingularities. Then we focus on the so-called $d$-arrangements in the plane. In\nparticular, we provide a combinatorial constraint for free $d$-arrangements\nadmitting ordinary quasi-homogeneous singularities.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7uO27a5dnMWVW1c4Or1AyyjzSnzcr4PKYJlrxie8stE","pdfSize":"128360"}
