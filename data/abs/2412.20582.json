  "abstract": "  Time series, as one of the most fundamental representations of sequential\ndata, has been extensively studied across diverse disciplines, including\ncomputer science, biology, geology, astronomy, and environmental sciences. The\nadvent of advanced sensing, storage, and networking technologies has resulted\nin high-dimensional time-series data, however, posing significant challenges\nfor analyzing latent structures over extended temporal scales. Time-series\nclustering, an established unsupervised learning strategy that groups similar\ntime series together, helps unveil hidden patterns in these complex datasets.\nIn this survey, we trace the evolution of time-series clustering methods from\nclassical approaches to recent advances in neural networks. While previous\nsurveys have focused on specific methodological categories, we bridge the gap\nbetween traditional clustering methods and emerging deep learning-based\nalgorithms, presenting a comprehensive, unified taxonomy for this research\narea. This survey highlights key developments and provides insights to guide\nfuture research in time-series clustering.\n",
