  "abstract": "  Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and smart contracts are the next generation and\nfast-growing market for quick and safe interaction between lenders and\nborrowers. However for maintaining a streamline ecosystem it is necessary to\nunderstand the risk associated with the particular user under consideration. In\nthis paper we have developed 'On Chain Credit Risk Score' of a wallet is an\nanswer to quantifying the risk of the particular wallet, namely the probability\nthat the particular wallet may have a loan liquidated. 'On Chain Credit Risk\nScore (OCCR Score)' of wallets, will help lending borrowing protocols and other\nDeFi institutes to understand the risk involved in giving out loans to a wallet\nand may change the Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio and subsequently the Liquidation\nThreshold (LT) if required.\n",
