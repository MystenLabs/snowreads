However, it is difficult to explain the relative importance of data\nelements with respect to the rules in which they appear. This paper develops a\nmeasure of an element's contribution to a set of association rules based on\nShapley values, denoted SHARQ (ShApley Rules Quantification). As is the case\nwith many Shapely-based computations, the cost of a naive calculation of the\nscore is exponential in the number of elements. To that end, we present an\nefficient framework for computing the exact SharQ value of a single element\nwhose running time is practically linear in the number of rules. Going one step\nfurther, we develop an efficient multi-element SHARQ algorithm which amortizes\nthe cost of the single element SHARQ calculation over a set of elements. Based\non the definition of SHARQ for elements we describe two additional use cases\nfor association rules explainability: rule importance and attribute importance.\nExtensive experiments over a novel benchmark dataset containing 45 instances of\nmined rule sets show the effectiveness of our approach.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Databases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mMsu-bAqXKG93fFuGYj-R-eblwVmpZ1jgLG1pVJs1L8","pdfSize":"1532160"}
