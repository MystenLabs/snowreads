Here, we show\nthat multicore fibres can be effectively used not only for the scope of\ncommunication but also for the generation of entangled states. By exploiting\nthe formalism of completely positive trace preserving maps, we describe the\naction of a multicore fibre as a quantum channel and propose a protocol to\nimplement bound entangled states of two qudits. Notably, the presence of\ncrosstalk among the cores of the fibre is fundamental for the generation of\nsuch states.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zOGwVoZLCRwdMzIyx98TC1JxczxAYWfJoUZ8vQAMjP0","pdfSize":"807108"}
