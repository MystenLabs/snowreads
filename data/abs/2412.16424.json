  "abstract": "  Research in neutrino physics has been very active, both in experimental\nadvances, with a new generation of detectors in operation and planning, and in\ntheoretical discussions regarding the fundamental nature of the neutrino. This\nscientific dynamism has attracted many new students to the field. One of the\nfirst topics studied in neutrino physics by newcomers is the formalism of\nneutrino flavor oscillations and its associated phenomenology. We present this\nwork as a compilation of this basic knowledge, through a step-by-step approach\nthat facilitates an efficient understanding of this vast theoretical and\nexperimental landscape.\n",
