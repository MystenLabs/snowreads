To achieve this, we revisit the derivation of the Clarke transform\nleading to a formulation capable of considering arbitrary joint locations. The\nproposed modified Clarke transform opens new opportunities in mechanical design\nand algorithmic approaches beyond the current limiting dependency on symmetric\narranged joint locations. By presenting an encoder-decoder architecture based\non the Clarke transform, joint values between different robot designs can be\ntransformed enabling the use of an analogous robot design and direct knowledge\ntransfer. To demonstrate its versatility, applications of control and\ntrajectory generation in simulation are presented, which can be easily\nintegrated into an existing framework designed, for instance, for three\nsymmetric arranged joints.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"3bYj362KgYst7gN1QMh6jK5UcEPsHJ1eQlXx07KngWQ","pdfSize":"3918390"}
