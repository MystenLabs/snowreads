These methods allow\nus to handle infinitely many lattice conditions and isolate the new P-time\ntractable matrices represented by tensor products of matchgates. We use these\nmethods to prove a complexity dichotomy for $4 \\times 4$ matrices that says\nValiant's holographic algorithm is universal for planar tractability in this\nsetting.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Dr3o4kpsC30eCzBhsZGPOqw7V5NVA43b8kRPEjOdZvM","pdfSize":"1148403"}
