We investigate an electronic bridge process in the Th III ion, where\nnuclear excitation occurs via electronic transitions, and demonstrate that a\nproper choice of laser frequencies can lead to a significant enhancement of\nthis effect. Electrons also reduce the lifetime of the nuclear excited state.\n  Additionally, the electronic structure of the Th III ion exhibits features\nthat make it particularly useful for probing new physics. Notably, it contains\na metastable state connected to the ground state via a weak M2 transition,\nwhich can be utilized for quantum information processing, as well as searches\nfor oscillating axion field, violation of local Lorentz invariance, test of the\nEinstein's equivalence principle, and measurement of nuclear weak quadrupole\nmoment. The electronic states of the ion present a unique case of level\ncrossing involving the 5f, 6d, and 7s single-electron states. This crossing\nrenders the transition frequencies highly sensitive to potential time-variation\nof the fine-structure constant.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ESl5wEOQOMkrM2MUM6BTk06ousPEWU0BEHartQFRDR0","pdfSize":"165615"}
