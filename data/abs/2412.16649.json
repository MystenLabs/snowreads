Thanks to the advances in experimental\ntechniques and reaction theory, various new aspects of nuclei are being\nrevealed by knockout reactions. In this article, we review the basic concept of\nthe quasi-free knockout reaction, and recent achievements in the SEASTAR\nproject using the MINOS system. We also present our new findings on the\nlow-energy nucleon knockout reaction and the $\\alpha$ knockout reaction. The\ncombination of the (microscopic) structure theory, reaction theory and\nexperiments will be the key to a complete understanding of the $\\alpha$\nformation and its universality in the coming decades. Noble clusters, e.g.,\n$d$, $t$, $^{3}$He, etc. are in the scope of the ONOKORO project. The\nimplementation of the two (and more) nucleon correlation in the reaction theory\nis essential to connect the properties of such clusters and the reaction\nobservables. A new framework, CDCCIA, is introduced for this purpose, which\nwill also be applicable to the two-nucleon knockout reactions, e.g., $(p,3p)$,\n$(p,2pn)$, and $(p,p2n)$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8A6xF1N61yxfTaDdGdxilDHsb8F7_RO3yMTDsSkUq0s","pdfSize":"1640249"}
