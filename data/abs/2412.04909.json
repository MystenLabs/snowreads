  "abstract": "  From 2012 to 2023, the PRISMA-32 array was in operation at the Experimental\nComplex NEVOD (MEPhI, Moscow). The purpose of the array was to study extensive\nair showers by detecting the air-shower neutron and electron-photon components\nusing unshielded neutron detectors. To expand the capabilities of this\nfacility, including for the study of cosmic and geophysical phenomena with a\nneutron flux, its upgrade was carried out. During the upgrade, a dedicated\nmeasuring channel for studying variations of the neutron background and the\nprocesses affecting these variations was created. To achieve this, the\nphotomultipliers, the integrating amplifiers, the digitalizing electronics and\nthe high-voltage power supply system were replaced. The paper describes the\nstructure of the upgraded array, which was named PRISMA-36, and presents the\nresults of studying the characteristics of the main elements of its \"variation\"\nchannel. A method for identifying signals caused by neutron capture and the\ndetermined criteria for their selection are discussed. An example of a Forbush\ndecrease, caused by a X1.1-class flare and recorded with the variation channel\nof the PRISMA-36 array, is given.\n",
