This is one of\nthe few massive white dwarfs with a dynamically measured mass and the one with\nthe shortest spin period. It emits pulsed X-rays with a very soft spectrum,\npowered by accretion from the tenuous stellar wind of its companion of sdO\nspectral type. The current level of mass accretion cannot provide enough\nangular momentum to explain the small, but precisely measured, spin-up rate of\n72 nanoseconds per year, which is instead best interpreted as the result of the\nradial contraction of this young white dwarf. The higher mass transfer rate\nexpected during the future evolutionary stages of HD 49798 will drive the white\ndwarf above the Chandrasekhar limit, but the final fate, a type Ia SN explosion\nor the collapse to a millisecond pulsar, is uncertain.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nX4JRRJv0KlGarmaL19zkbzMzT7Dme6YkJ_PwZhkzgw","pdfSize":"1614553"}
