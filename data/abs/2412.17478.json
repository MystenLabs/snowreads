  "abstract": "  Electroencephalography (EEG) is an non-invasive method to record the\nelectrical activity of the brain. The EEG signals are low bandwidth and\nrecorded from multiple electrodes simultaneously in a time synchronized manner.\nTypical EEG signal processing involves extracting features from all the\nindividual channels separately and then fusing these features for downstream\napplications. In this paper, we propose a signal transformation, using basic\nsignal processing, to combine the individual channels of a low-bandwidth\nsignal, like the EEG into a single-channel high-bandwidth signal, like audio.\nFurther this signal transformation is bi-directional, namely the high-bandwidth\nsingle-channel can be transformed to generate the individual low-bandwidth\nsignals without any loss of information. Such a transformation when applied to\nEEG signals overcomes the need to process multiple signals and allows for a\nsingle-channel processing. The advantage of this signal transformation is that\nit allows the use of pre-trained single-channel pre-trained models, for\nmulti-channel signal processing and analysis. We further show the utility of\nthe signal transformation on publicly available EEG dataset.\n",
