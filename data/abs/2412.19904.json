Auxiliary directions will be\ncompletely factorized in the path integral, and the embedding does not alter\nthe expectation values of the original theory. We perform the molecular\ndynamics updates by using the matrix elements of $W \\in M_N(\\mathbb{C})$ as the\ndynamical variables without group theoretic constraints. The framework enables\nus to introduce non-separable Hamiltonians for the HMC in lattice gauge theory\nexactly, whose immediate application includes the Riemannian manifold HMC.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Blu1tWcRtQB1fXkeT4wFAov6rBvypwApURQkZ9snnAU","pdfSize":"541226"}
