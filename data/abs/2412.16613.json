We show that the subsequent gain in\ncomputational yield is significant, and it may allow to perform simulations of\nnon-well mixed chemical systems. We illustrate this idea with simulations of\nFrank model, originally introduced to explain the emergence of homochirality in\nprebiotic systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nACVBXs37_lxUtcRmCAbDFNmLxSJakxjM4Mn_G72cjk","pdfSize":"505840"}
