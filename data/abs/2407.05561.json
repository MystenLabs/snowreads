This\nVladimirov-Kochubei operator generates a real-time diffusion process in the\nring of $p$-adic integers, a Brownian motion in $\\mathbb Z_p$. The current work\nshows that this process is a limit of discrete time random walks. It motivates\nthe construction of the Vladimirov-Kochubei operator, provides further\nintuition about the properties of ultrametric diffusion, and gives an example\nof the weak convergence of stochastic processes in a profinite group.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OuyKbmrf8cKa7ZieCdjhKcPnmP5VkZ5x2BMuxpUZrWE","pdfSize":"263498"}
