  "abstract": "  The problem of converting images of text into plain text is a widely\nresearched topic in both academia and industry. Arabic handwritten Text\nRecognation (AHTR) poses additional challenges due to diverse handwriting\nstyles and limited labeled data. In this paper we present a complete OCR\npipeline that starts with line segmentation using Differentiable Binarization\nand Adaptive Scale Fusion techniques to ensure accurate detection of text\nlines. Following segmentation, a CNN-BiLSTM-CTC architecture is applied to\nrecognize characters. Our system, trained on the Arabic Multi-Fonts Dataset\n(AMFDS), achieves a Character Recognition Rate (CRR) of 99.20% and a Word\nRecognition Rate (WRR) of 93.75% on single-word samples containing 7 to 10\ncharacters, along with a CRR of 83.76% for sentences. These results demonstrate\nthe system's strong performance in handling Arabic scripts, establishing a new\nbenchmark for AHTR systems.\n",
