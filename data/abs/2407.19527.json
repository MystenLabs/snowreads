In this paper,\nwe present Serafim PT*, a family of open-source sentence encoders for\nPortuguese with various sizes, suited to different hardware/compute budgets.\nEach model exhibits state-of-the-art performance and is made openly available\nunder a permissive license, allowing its use for both commercial and research\npurposes. Besides the sentence encoders, this paper contributes a systematic\nstudy and lessons learned concerning the selection criteria of learning\nobjectives and parameters that support top-performing encoders.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xIjYYPM6U6aznEh6gg72kqKOpqPKQEq87nUyM-2CJQA","pdfSize":"173292"}
