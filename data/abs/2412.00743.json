In this work, we propose a method to enable detectable\nquantum interference within the two-body loss rate resulting from various\ninelastic scattering channels. Our approach utilizes a ``ring-coupling\"\nconfiguration, achieved by combining external radio-frequency and static\nelectric fields during ultracold atomic collisions. We conduct close-coupling\ncalculations for $^7$Li-$^{41}$K collisions at ultracold limit to validate our\nproposal. The results show that the interference profile displayed in two-body\nloss rate is unable to be observed with unoptimized external field parameters.\nParticularly, our findings demonstrate that the two-body loss rate coefficient\nexhibits distinct constructive and destructive interference patterns near the\nmagnetically induced $p$-wave resonance in the incoming channel near which a\nrf-induced scattering resonance exists. These interference patterns become\nincreasingly pronounced with greater intensities of the external fields. This\nwork opens a new avenue for controlling inelastic scattering processes in\nultracold collisions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vIjiWpJBgL8QNHVBbRGJMi006NnD5c2XECLVk01A6wk","pdfSize":"1136428"}
