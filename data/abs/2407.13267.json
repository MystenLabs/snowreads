Traditional Network Scale Up Method (NSUM) models often\nnecessitate standalone surveys for each geographic region, escalating costs and\ncomplexity. This study introduces a partially pooled NSUM model, using a\nhierarchical Bayesian framework that efficiently aggregates and utilizes data\nacross multiple regions without increasing sample sizes. We developed this\nmodel for a novel national survey dataset from the Philippines and we\ndemonstrate its ability to produce detailed municipal-level prevalence\nestimates of trafficking for CSEM production. Our results not only underscore\nthe model's precision in estimating hidden populations but also highlight its\npotential for broader application in other areas of social science and public\nhealth research, offering significant implications for resource allocation and\nintervention planning.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WPxBo7_S6nda3GUYL0mB4NQHmIQCuq373XXFK2QfqL4","pdfSize":"562752"}
