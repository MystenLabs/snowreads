  "abstract": "  The $J\\bar T$ deformation is a fully tractable irrelevant deformation of\ntwo-dimensional CFTs, which yields a UV-complete QFT that is local and\nconformal along one lightlike direction and non-local along the remaining one.\nSuch QFTs are interesting, in particular, as toy models for the holographic\ndual to (near)-extremal black holes. Despite its non-locality, the deformed\ntheory has been shown to posess a (Virasoro-Kac-Moody)$^2$ symmetry algebra,\nwhose action on the non-local side is non-standard. In this article we present,\nin a unified way, three different perspectives on the classical symmetries of\n$J\\bar T$ - deformed CFTs: Hamiltonian, Lagrangian and holographic, showing how\nthe peculiar action of the symmetries can be recovered in each of them. The\nperfect match we obtain between the Lagrangian and holographic results\nconstitutes a precision check of the holographic dictionary proposed in [1],\nwhich we slightly generalize and improve. We also comment on the interpretation\nof the Comp\\`ere-Song-Strominger boundary conditions from the $J\\bar T$\nviewpoint.\n",
