It is obtained following the Joos-Zeh prescription for\ndecoherence, by adding a number of scattering particles in the configuration\nspace of the cat. Quantization follows swiftly, if the Hamiltonian approach,\nrather than the semiclassical, is adopted. I have studied this system in a\nseries of previous works, focusing on the problem of quantum-classical\ncorrespondence. In this paper I test the dynamics of this system by two related\nyet different indicators: the time autocorrelation function of the canonical\nposition and the out of time correlator of position and momentum.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cg8YNiANNpkWoIXkCAy2u0Qyi88G1UaSMhOL89AAgGU","pdfSize":"450637","objectId":"0xd747962ad053cc04438a8f36f976f8069d31bf536f6c9bce304a5adfbc9de39f","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
