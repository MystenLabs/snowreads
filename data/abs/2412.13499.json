  "abstract": "  We study ultrafilters from the perspective of the algebra in the\n\\v{C}ech-Stone compactification of the natural numbers, and idempotent elements\ntherein. The first two results that we prove establish that, if $p$ is a\nQ-point (resp. a selective ultrafilter) and $\\mathscr F^p$ (resp. $\\mathscr\nG^p$) is the smallest family containing $p$ and closed under iterated sums\n(resp. closed under Blass--Frol\\'{\\i}k sums and Rudin--Keisler images), then\n$\\mathscr F^p$ (resp. $\\mathscr G^p$) contains no idempotent elements. The\nsecond of these results about a selective ultrafilter has the following\ninteresting consequence: assuming a conjecture of Blass, in models of the form\n$\\mathbf{L}(\\mathbb R)[p]$ where $\\mathbf{L}(\\mathbb R)$ is a Solovay model (of\n$\\mathsf{ZF}$ without choice) and $p$ is a selective ultrafilter, there are no\nidempotent elements. In particular, the theory $\\mathsf{ZF}$ plus the existence\nof a nonprincipal ultrafilter on $\\omega$ does not imply the existence of\nidempotent ultrafilters, which answers a question of DiNasso and Tachtsis\n(Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 146, 397-411). Following the line of obtaining\nindependence results in $\\mathsf{ZF}$, we finish the paper by proving that\n$\\mathsf{ZF}$ plus \"every additive filter can be extended to an idempotent\nultrafilter\" does not imply the Ultrafilter Theorem over $\\mathbb R$, answering\nanother question of DiNasso and Tachtsis from the same paper.\n",
