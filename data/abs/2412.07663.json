It is\nobserved that in properly reduced units, the shear relaxation times exhibit\nquasi-universal behaviour when the density increases from the gas-like low\nvalues to the high-density regime near crystallization. They first decrease\nwith density at low densities, reach minima at moderate densities, and then\nincrease toward the freezing point. The reduced relaxation times at the minima\nand at the fluid-solid phase transition are all comparable for the various\nsystems investigated, despite more than ten orders of magnitude difference in\nreal systems. Important implications of these results are discussed.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mrK4hqK6ppSxsnvaONvL7vdi_9sTV8UhGe81GNEL7Gg","pdfSize":"447825"}
