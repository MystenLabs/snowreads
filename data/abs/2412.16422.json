  "abstract": "  We present a framework based on Clarke coordinates for spatial\ndisplacement-actuated continuum robots with an arbitrary number of joints. This\nframework consists of three modular components, i.e., a planner, trajectory\ngenerator, and controller defined on the manifold. All components are\ncomputationally efficient, compact, and branchless, and an encoder can be used\nto interface existing framework components that are not based on Clarke\ncoordinates. We derive the relationship between the kinematic constraints in\nthe joint space and on the manifold to generate smooth trajectories on the\nmanifold. Furthermore, we establish the connection between the displacement\nconstraint and parallel curves. To demonstrate its effectiveness, a\ndemonstration in simulation for a displacement-actuated continuum robot with\nfour segments is presented.\n",
