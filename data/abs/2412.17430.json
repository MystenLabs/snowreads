We establish\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for the distribution to be discrete and\nprovide some sufficient conditions for its singularity. We also explore\nnon-trivial metric properties of the $A_2$-representation with the specified\nalphabet.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Ie1FlXzMPsyAOWyyoyhvAj7-rTzu7xU5yq85VxC9FPg","pdfSize":"133672"}
