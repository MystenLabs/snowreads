This work is concerned with the specific\ndownstream task of Emotion Recognition from images, and proposes a framework\nthat combines CAM-based techniques with Object Detection on a corpus level to\nbetter understand on which image cues a particular model, in our case EmoNet,\nrelies to assign a specific emotion to an image. We demonstrate that the model\nmostly focuses on human characteristics, but also explore the pronounced effect\nof specific image modifications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ziYP9d0pBboRi0xwvKp6Nrq6ejugEFNehuWUDpb_aOk","pdfSize":"5137080","objectId":"0x7eda0a1741082500765919c744175a80e463c3e61e9d2adcfaca5d8d01a4b1f9","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
