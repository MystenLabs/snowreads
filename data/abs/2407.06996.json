This weak effect is unique to each\nmolecular species, making it an essential tool in e.g. spectroscopy and\nlabel-free microscopy. The invention of the laser enabled a regime of\nstimulated Raman scattering (SRS), where the efficiency is greatly increased by\ninducing coherent molecular oscillations. However, this phenomenon required\nhigh intensities due to the limited interaction volumes, and this limitation\nwas overcome by the emergence of anti-resonant fibres (ARFs) guiding light in a\nsmall hollow channel over long distances. Based on their unique properties,\nthis Perspective reviews the transformative impact of ARFs on modern SRS-based\napplications ranging from development of light sources and convertors for\nspectroscopy and materials science, to quantum technologies for the future\nquantum networks, providing insights into future trends and the expanding\nhorizons of the field.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2PcvptrhN4gtRhHW-i2Pt5aTZqY0wIeFpaoXh7Ue4Sk","pdfSize":"1377643"}
