In this paper, we introduce the\nAD method into a recently proposed asynchronous measurement-device-independent\n(AMDI) QKD protocol, taking finite-key effects into account. Simulation results\nshow that the AD method significantly enhances AMDIQKD, e.g., extending the\ntransmission distance by 16 km with a total pulse count of N = 7.24*10^13, and\nenables AMDI-QKD, previously unable to generate keys, to generate keys with a\nmisalignment error rate of 10%. As the AD method can be directly integrated\ninto the current system through refined post-processing, our results facilitate\nthe practical implementation of AMDI-QKD in various applications, particularly\nin scenarios with high channel losses and misalignment errors.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"qLt9-VWxPwlOgeLwIDyjBm6PDlWoDvmywDJLp-iG2DE","pdfSize":"871822"}
