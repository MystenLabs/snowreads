  "abstract": "  Given an integer $k\\ge1$, an edge-$k$-coloring of a graph $G$ is an\nassignment of $k$ colors $1,\\ldots,k$ to the edges of $G$ such that no two\nadjacent edges receive the same color. A vertex-distinguishing (resp.\nsum-distinguishing) edge-$k$-coloring of $G$ is an edge-$k$-coloring such that\nfor any two distinct vertices $u$ and $v$, the set (resp. sum) of colors taken\nfrom all the edges incident with $u$ is different from that taken from all the\nedges incident with $v$. The vertex-distinguishing chromatic index (resp.\nsum-distinguishing chromatic index), denoted $\\chi'_{vd}(G)$ (resp.\n$\\chi'_{sd}(G)$), is the smallest value $k$ such that $G$ has a\nvertex-distinguishing-edge-$k$-coloring (resp.\nsum-distinguishing-edge-$k$-coloring). Let $G$ be a $d$-regular graph on $n$\nvertices, where $n$ is even and sufficiently large. We show that $\\chi'_{vd}(G)\n=d+2$ if $d$ is arbitrarily close to $n/2$ from above, and $\\chi'_{sd}(G) =d+2$\nif $d\\ge \\frac{2n}{3}$. Our first result strengthens a result of Balister et\nal. in 2004 for such class of regular graphs, and our second result constitutes\na significant advancement in the field of sum-distinguishing edge coloring.\n  To achieve these results, we introduce novel edge coloring results which may\nbe of independent interest.\n",
