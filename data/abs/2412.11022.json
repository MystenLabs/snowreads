We first show that there is\nno local obstacle to conservation, unlike the contribution from a loop of\nmassless, minimally coupled scalars. This is correlated to the absence of an\nEddington ($R^2$) counterterm and to the vanishing of the stress tensor when\nthe photon in integrated out in the presence of a constant graviton field. We\nalso show that there is a secularly growing 1-loop contribution to the electric\ncomponents of the Weyl tensor for plane wave gravitons. Its coefficient agrees\nwith that of the secular 1-loop correction to the Newtonian potential, and both\ncan be resummed using a variant of the renormalization group.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cKv1RGhEpAtzUQXvGpS_P6qd8xylY1PL9-YX70CnbNo","pdfSize":"202099"}
