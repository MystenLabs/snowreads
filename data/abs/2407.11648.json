In the context\nof circumstellar discs, this can, for instance, cause fragmentation of the disc\ngas, and -- under suitable conditions -- lead to the direct formation of\ngas-giant planets. If one wants to study these phenomena, the disc's\ngravitational potential needs to be obtained by solving the Poisson equation.\nThis requires to specify suitable boundary conditions. In the case of a\nspherical-polar computational mesh, a standard multipole expansion for\nobtaining boundary values is not practicable. We hence compare two alternative\nmethods for overcoming this limitation. The first method is based on a known\nGreen's function expansion (termed \"CCGF\") of the potential, while the second\n(termed \"James' method\") uses a surface screening mass approach with a suitable\ndiscrete Green's function. We demonstrate second-order convergence for both\nmethods and test the weak scaling behaviour when using thousands of\ncomputational cores. Overall, James' method is found superior owing to its\nfavourable algorithmic complexity of $\\sim \\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ compared with the\n$\\sim\\mathcal{O}(n^4)$ scaling of the CCGF method.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"vMjnaCu4HicOZrtXGTD4A00gh9DNXpIAgHJE1RuDuBc","pdfSize":"970520"}
