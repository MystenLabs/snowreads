It is shown that some difference schemes\n(midpoint scheme, Kahan scheme) in some special cases provide approximate\nsolutions of differential equations, which are periodic sequences. Such\nsolutions are called periodic. A purely algebraic method for finding such\nsolutions is developed. It is shown that midpoint scheme inherits periodicity\nnot only in case of linear oscillator, but also in case of nonlinear\noscillator, integrable into elliptic functions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"bYXnsUtod8NyuBhSjS8JbxEvsEDtHq5uipkQltDc--I","pdfSize":"402128"}
