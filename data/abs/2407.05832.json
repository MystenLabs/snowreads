The\nresearch leverages diverse planetary datasets, including\nhigh-spatial-resolution albedo maps and element maps (LPFe, LPK, LPTh, LPTi)\nderived from laser and gamma-ray measurements. The primary objective is to\nidentify relationships between chemical elements and albedo, thereby expanding\nour understanding of planetary surfaces and offering predictive capabilities\nfor areas with incomplete datasets. To bridge the gap in resolution between the\nalbedo and element maps, we employ Gaussian blurring techniques, including an\ninnovative adaptive Gaussian blur. Our methodology culminates in the deployment\nof an Extreme Gradient Boosting Regression Model, optimized to predict full\nalbedo based on elemental composition. Furthermore, we present an interactive\nanalytical tool to visualize prediction errors, delineating their spatial and\nchemical characteristics. The findings not only pave the way for a more\ncomprehensive understanding of the Moon's surface but also provide a framework\nfor similar studies on other celestial bodies.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_2hDz6pmi78z_tFAcdsTEzccJDGPTeXWNErPOBT4avg","pdfSize":"3119712"}
