  "abstract": "  SightGlow is a web extension tailored to improve color perception accuracy\nfor individuals with red-green color blindness. The research was focused on\nevaluating whether personalized color adjustment and selective zoom enhance\nuser interaction and satisfaction for individuals with low vision and color\nvision impairment. The system was developed as an iterative process by\nconducting a pilot user survey. Existing web extensions were limited in\naddressing challenges faced by low vision and color blindness; hence this\napplication provides additional features, including selective zoom and color\ncontrols, which make it unique. Most participants responded that the\napplication's flexibility to adjust the color balance for any images or video\ngraphic content enhanced their user experience, hence resulting in the\neffectiveness of the system.\n",
