  "abstract": "  In 1966, Erd\\H{o}s, Goodman, and P\\'{o}sa showed that if $G$ is an $n$-vertex\ngraph, then at most $\\lfloor n^2/4 \\rfloor$ cliques of $G$ are needed to cover\nthe edges of $G$, and the bound is best possible as witnessed by the balanced\ncomplete bipartite graph. This was generalized independently by\nGy\\H{o}ri--Kostochka, Kahn, and Chung, who showed that every $n$-vertex graph\nadmits an edge-decomposition into cliques of total `cost' at most $2 \\lfloor\nn^2/4 \\rfloor$, where an $i$-vertex clique has cost $i$. Erd\\H{o}s suggested\nthe following strengthening: every $n$-vertex graph admits an\nedge-decomposition into cliques of total cost at most $\\lfloor n^2/4 \\rfloor$,\nwhere now an $i$-vertex clique has cost $i-1$. We prove fractional relaxations\nand asymptotically optimal versions of both this conjecture and a conjecture of\nDau, Milenkovic, and Puleo on covering the $t$-vertex cliques of a graph\ninstead of the edges. Our proofs introduce a general framework for these\nproblems using Zykov symmetrization, the Frankl-R\\\"odl nibble method, and the\nSzemer\\'edi Regularity Lemma.\n",
