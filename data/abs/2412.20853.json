In particular, we require that the collusion is by\nitself incentive-compatible and individually rational to all of its\nparticipants. We then study the structural properties of these notions, and\nimportantly, characterize the class of collusion-resistant and\nincentive-compatible transaction fee mechanisms in the single bidder case, and\nshow that this is exactly the class of posted-price where the price is not too\nprohibitive. We analyze welfare and revenue implications, as well as the shape\nof the solution space, for both regular and non-regular distributions.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Science and Game Theory","Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CxaFpAQYwPv6qTfBYCa4JdKdPnf_sM3x-NVlKww1DqE","pdfSize":"571245"}
