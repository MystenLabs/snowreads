  "abstract": "  We present a comprehensive theory for a novel method to discretize the\nspectral density of a bosonic heat bath, as introduced in [H. Takahashi and R.\nBorrelli, J. Chem. Phys. \\textbf{161}, 151101 (2024)]. The approach leverages a\nlow-rank decomposition of the Fourier-transform relation connecting the bath\ncorrelation function to its spectral density. By capturing the time, frequency,\nand temperature dependencies encoded in the spectral density-autocorrelation\nfunction relation, our method significantly reduces the degrees of freedom\nrequired for simulating open quantum system dynamics. We benchmark our approach\nagainst existing methods and demonstrate its efficacy through applications to\nboth simple models and a realistic electron transfer process in biological\nsystems. Additionally, we show that this new approach can be effectively\ncombined with the tensor-train formalism to investigate the quantum dynamics of\nsystems interacting with complex non-Markovian environments. Finally, we\nprovide a perspective on the selection and application of various spectral\ndensity discretization techniques.\n",
