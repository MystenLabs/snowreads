  "abstract": "  We study the quasiparticles in chiral double layers with electron pairing\nwithin the framework of the Bogoliubov de Gennes equation. In the presence of\nan edge it is demonstrated that the quasiparticle modes can be distinguished as\nedge modes and bulk modes, which appear at different energies. The bulk-edge\ncorrespondence is obtained by an analytic continuation from the in-gap edge\nmodes to the bands of bulk modes. By varying the energy we find a transition\nfrom localized edge modes to delocalized bulk modes. We calculate the\nquasiparticle currents, discuss briefly how these currents couple to external\ncurrents, and predict how this can be used to control the quasiparticle modes.\n",
