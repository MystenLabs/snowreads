  "abstract": "  We propose and justify a matrix reduction method for calculating the optimal\napproximation of an observed matrix $A \\in {\\mathbb C}^{m \\times n}$ by a sum\n$\\sum_{i=1}^p \\sum_{j=1}^q B_iX_{ij}C_j$ of matrix products where each $B_i \\in\n{\\mathbb C}^{m \\times g_i}$ and $C_j \\in {\\mathbb C}^{h_j \\times n}$ is known\nand where the unknown matrix kernels $X_{ij}$ are determined by minimizing the\nFrobenius norm of the error. The sum can be represented as a bounded linear\nmapping $BXC$ with unknown kernel $X$ from a prescribed subspace ${\\mathcal T}\n\\subseteq {\\mathbb C}^n$ onto a prescribed subspace ${\\mathcal S} \\subseteq\n{\\mathbb C}^m$ defined respectively by the collective domains and ranges of the\ngiven matrices $C_1,\\ldots,C_q$ and $B_1,\\ldots,B_p$. We show that the optimal\nkernel is $X = B^{\\dag}AC^{\\dag}$ and that the optimal approximation\n$BB^{\\dag}AC^{\\dag}C$ is the projection of the observed mapping $A$ onto a\nmapping from ${\\mathcal T}$ to ${\\mathcal S}$. If $A$ is large $B$ and $C$ may\nalso be large and direct calculation of $B^{\\dag}$ and $C^{\\dag}$ becomes\nunwieldy and inefficient. { The proposed method avoids} this difficulty by\nreducing the solution process to finding the pseudo-inverses of a collection of\nmuch smaller matrices. This significantly reduces the computational burden.\n",
