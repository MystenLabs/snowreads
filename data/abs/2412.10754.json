  "abstract": "  With the continuous advancement of processors, modern micro-architecture\ndesigns have become increasingly complex. The vast design space presents\nsignificant challenges for human designers, making design space exploration\n(DSE) algorithms a significant tool for $\\mu$-arch design. In recent years,\nefforts have been made in the development of DSE algorithms, and promising\nresults have been achieved. However, the existing DSE algorithms, e.g.,\nBayesian Optimization and ensemble learning, suffer from poor interpretability,\nhindering designers' understanding of the decision-making process. To address\nthis limitation, we propose utilizing Fuzzy Neural Networks to induce and\nsummarize knowledge and insights from the DSE process, enhancing\ninterpretability and controllability. Furthermore, to improve efficiency, we\nintroduce a multi-fidelity reinforcement learning approach, which primarily\nconducts exploration using cheap but less precise data, thereby substantially\ndiminishing the reliance on costly data. Experimental results show that our\nmethod achieves excellent results with a very limited sample budget and\nsuccessfully surpasses the current state-of-the-art. Our DSE framework is\nopen-sourced and available at https://github.com/fanhanwei/FNN\\_MFRL\\_ArchDSE/\\ .\n",
