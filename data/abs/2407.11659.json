We introduce a novel method to predict the evolution of the solar\nline-of-sight (LoS) magnetogram using image-to-image translation with Denoising\nDiffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). Our approach combines \"computer science\nmetrics\" for image quality and \"physics metrics\" for physical accuracy to\nevaluate model performance. The results indicate that DDPMs are effective in\nmaintaining the structural integrity, the dynamic range of solar magnetic\nfields, the magnetic flux and other physical features such as the size of the\nactive regions, surpassing traditional persistence models, also in flaring\nsituation. We aim to use deep learning not only for visualisation but as an\nintegrative and interactive tool for telescopes, enhancing our understanding of\nunexpected physical events like solar flares. Future studies will aim to\nintegrate more diverse solar data to refine the accuracy and applicability of\nour generative model.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"jFH-KWsOOlyvpiSAIBFA4s9M6at9MA45-2l9KRfphDk","pdfSize":"678039"}
