  "abstract": "  Uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods play an important role in reducing\nerrors in weather forecasting. Conventional approaches in UQ for weather\nforecasting rely on generating an ensemble of forecasts from physics-based\nsimulations to estimate the uncertainty. However, it is computationally\nexpensive to generate many forecasts to predict real-time extreme weather\nevents. Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) is an uncertainty-aware deep learning\napproach designed to provide confidence about its predictions using only one\nforecast. It treats learning as an evidence acquisition process where more\nevidence is interpreted as increased predictive confidence. We apply EDL to\nstorm forecasting using real-world weather datasets and compare its performance\nwith traditional methods. Our findings indicate that EDL not only reduces\ncomputational overhead but also enhances predictive uncertainty. This method\nopens up novel opportunities in research areas such as climate risk assessment,\nwhere quantifying the uncertainty about future climate is crucial.\n",
