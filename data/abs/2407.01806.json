As a consequence, we\nprove the existence and the uniqueness of a prime factorization for orbit\nequivalence relations arising from direct products of higher rank lattices.\nThis extends and strengthens Zimmer's primeness result for equivalence\nrelations arising from actions of lattices in simple Lie groups. The proof of\nour main result relies on a combination of ergodic theory of algebraic group\nactions and Popa's intertwining theory for equivalence relations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DFMcr4C4kpGiqzO6L1Xtbub4NlrrZRl2OblkAZzVUz8","pdfSize":"375154"}
