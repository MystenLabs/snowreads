Optically stimulated luminescent detectors (OSLDs) are the most\ncommonly used detector type which offers good dose linearity and accuracy in\nthe megavoltage energy range. Freiberg Instruments offer a dosimetry system\nunder the brand name myOLSchip which consists of a BeO OSL dosimeter, reader,\nand eraser. A Varian Truebeam was used to characterize the detectors and\ncalibrate their response in order to perform in-situ dosimetry during\ntreatment. The OSLDs were tested with both photon and electron beams from 6-15\nMV and 6-20 MV respectively. The dose signal to dose conversion in this\ninvestigation follows the recommendations of TG-191 in developing a dose\nresponse curve and creating a batch calibration factor for each dosimeter. The\nrepeatability of this system is also investigated following successive erasing\nand re-irradiation cycles. The results of this data have been compared to the\nstated accuracy and precision of the BeO detectors by the manufacturer and\nshown to have good dose linearity and repeatability across multiple exposures\nand erasure cycles.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ogCBfu1UpBszJ3aXyMQy99Dqd1gW1Miz7GRCsk_GXto","pdfSize":"704511","objectId":"0x97ec38e19669a13da063d623d32db2eb650d00a24d42fa9449fa06446c779f4d","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
