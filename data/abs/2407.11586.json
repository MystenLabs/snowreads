Beyond the family of\nFeSe interfaced with various TiO$_2$ terminated oxides, high pairing\ntemperature up to 80~K has been recently observed in FeSe interfaced with\nFeO$_x$-terminated LaFeO$_3$. Here we successfully extend the FeSe/FeO$_x$\nsuperconducting interface to FeSe/NdFeO$_3$, by constructing\n1uc-FeSe/6uc-NdFeO$_3$/Nb:SrTiO$_3$ heterostructures. Intriguingly,\nwell-annealed FeSe/NdFeO$_3$ exhibits a low doping level of 0.038$\\sim$0.046\n~e$^-/$Fe which deviates universally magic doping level (0.10$\\sim$0.12\ne$^-/\\rm{Fe}$) and provides a new playground for studying the FeSe/oxide\ninterface in the low electron-doped regime. Comparing it with thick FeSe films\nat the comparable electron doping level induced by surface potassium dosing,\nFeSe/NdFeO$_3$ shows a larger superconducting gap and the absence of a nematic\ngap, indicating an enhancement of the superconductivity and suppression of\nnematicity by the FeSe/FeO$_x$ interface. These results not only expand the\nFeSe/FeO$_x$ superconducting family but also enrich the current understanding\non the roles of the oxide interface.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"34nrNEVsADDJ9u1P92MewkKAl9wI1V-iXqluTueDfSk","pdfSize":"6979720"}
