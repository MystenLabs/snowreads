There is a significant amount of research that suggests that social\nmedia are highly polarized. A phenomenon that is commonly observed is the echo\nchamber structure, where users are organized in polarized communities and form\nconnections only with similar-minded individuals, limiting themselves to\nconsume specific content. In this paper we explore a way to decrease the\npolarization of networks with two echo chambers. Particularly, we observe that\nif some users adopt a moderate opinion about a topic, the polarization of the\nnetwork decreases. Based on this observation, we propose an efficient algorithm\nto identify a good set of K users, such that if they adopt a moderate stance\naround a topic, the polarization is minimized. Our algorithm employs a Graph\nNeural Network and thus it can handle large graphs more effectively than other\napproaches\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Social and Information Networks","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4l1uMBADpCrkr5YbOijO6XbpLmLSmZUbAKsl5QKg8LI","pdfSize":"2492823"}
