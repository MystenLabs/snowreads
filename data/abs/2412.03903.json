The approach significantly improves\nthe accuracy of the traffic near-miss video analysis and presents insights into\nhuman visual perception in traffic scenarios. Moreover, it contributes to\ntraffic safety enhancements and provides novel perspectives on the potential\ncognitive errors in traffic accidents.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"taZhaoz9MKbVc5rKb0D16hx4EdbX2KdLy-lYkdyzzsw","pdfSize":"1028816"}
