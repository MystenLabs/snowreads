Additionally, we leverage the specific\nfeatures of our design, which are conveniently suited for inlaying it into the\nwell known BB84 quantum communication protocol. We first define a trivial\nextension of our initial proposal allowing for such task (symmetric scheme) to\nthen come up with what we denote as asymmetric scheme, better matching\npracticality.\n  Furthermore, a realistic simulation of the user-server authentication\nprotocol has been achieved by employing a noisy model for both transmission and\nstorage, the latter relying on cavity-enhanced atomic-frequency comb (AFC)\nmemories. While in a noiseless scenario our proposal is ensured to be airtight,\nconsidering a certain degree of noise poses a challenge when aiming to actually\nimplement it. We have implemented a deep neural network to distinguish\nlegitimate users from forgery attempts, outperforming a mere statistical\napproach designed for the same task. Such method achieved a success rate of\n0.75 with storage times of $1$ $\\mu s$ and a user-server distance of $10$ km.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"M0zCz7JD3L6an3oI-YjUtx2NuJf_Rn89ETSeddM0Vks","pdfSize":"629214"}
