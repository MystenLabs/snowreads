We write down all effective operators up to dimension\nsix where such interactions couple the SM to spin 0 and spin 1/2 particles. We\nidentify the exotic states accessible through the portal and find the\ninteractions couple the SM to new particles with exotic combinations of baryon\nand lepton number, and particles with unusual SM charge, including states in\nhigher dimensional representations of both SU(3) and SU(2), and states of\nhigher electric charge. We discuss the phenomenology of these interactions\nincluding novel particle decays, and we classify some of the collider\nproduction modes for exotic states at LHC, LHeC and the muon collider.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"MPe41kVx7I-4r1ufYTz21uQziMy5Hb0JxXpky_hMQSw","pdfSize":"485464"}
