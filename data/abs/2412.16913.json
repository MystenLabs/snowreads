By leveraging the\nsecond subderivative of the extended-valued objective function and imposing a\nsuitable restriction on the multiplier, we derive two point-based sufficient\ncharacterizations for tilt stability of local optimal solutions around which\nthe objective function has positive semidefinite Hessians, and for a class of\nlinear positive semidefinite cone constraint set, establish a point-based\nnecessary characterization with a certain gap from the sufficient one. For this\nclass of linear positive semidefinite cone constraint case, under a suitable\nrestriction on the set of multipliers, we also establish a point-based\nsufficient and necessary characterization, which is weaker than the dual\nconstraint nondegeneracy when the set of multipliers is singleton. As far as we\nknow, this is the first work to study point-based sufficient and/or necessary\ncharacterizations for nonlinear semidefinite programs with convex constraint\nsets without constraint nondegeneracy conditions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fcD44jtVXHqGwO4GPZ30FbIw0t2Dp0FGGUMUWS48SL8","pdfSize":"390017"}
