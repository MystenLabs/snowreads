{"id":"2412.05911","title":"Unveiling True Talent: The Soccer Factor Model for Skill Evaluation","authors":"Alexandre Andorra, Maximilian G\\\"obel","authorsParsed":[["Andorra","Alexandre",""],["GÃ¶bel","Maximilian",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Dec 2024 12:09:05 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-10","timestamp":1733659745000,"abstract":"  Evaluating a soccer player's performance can be challenging due to the high\ncosts and small margins involved in recruitment decisions. Raw observational\nstatistics further complicate an accurate individual skill assessment as they\ndo not abstract from the potentially confounding factor of team strength. We\nintroduce the Soccer Factor Model (SFM), which corrects this bias by isolating\na player's true skill from the team's influence. We compile a novel data set,\nweb-scraped from publicly available data sources. Our empirical application\ndraws on information of 144 players, playing a total of over 33,000 matches, in\nseasons 2000/01 through 2023/24. Not only does the SFM allow for a structural\ninterpretation of a player's skill, but also stands out against more\nreduced-form benchmarks in terms of forecast accuracy. Moreover, we propose\nSkill- and Performance Above Replacement as metrics for fair cross-player\ncomparisons. These, for example, allow us to settle the discussion about the\nGOAT of soccer in the first quarter of the twenty-first century.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications","Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NWYa4Em3hbYunlo4FcHD6YqABZ5CI-fWs8URKsd5u7s","pdfSize":"1133908"}
