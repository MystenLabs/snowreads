  "abstract": "  We present ZeroBAS, a neural method to synthesize binaural audio from\nmonaural audio recordings and positional information without training on any\nbinaural data. To our knowledge, this is the first published zero-shot neural\napproach to mono-to-binaural audio synthesis. Specifically, we show that a\nparameter-free geometric time warping and amplitude scaling based on source\nlocation suffices to get an initial binaural synthesis that can be refined by\niteratively applying a pretrained denoising vocoder. Furthermore, we find this\nleads to generalization across room conditions, which we measure by introducing\na new dataset, TUT Mono-to-Binaural, to evaluate state-of-the-art\nmonaural-to-binaural synthesis methods on unseen conditions. Our zero-shot\nmethod is perceptually on-par with the performance of supervised methods on the\nstandard mono-to-binaural dataset, and even surpasses them on our\nout-of-distribution TUT Mono-to-Binaural dataset. Our results highlight the\npotential of pretrained generative audio models and zero-shot learning to\nunlock robust binaural audio synthesis.\n",
