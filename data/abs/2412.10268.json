  "abstract": "  We investigate two sub-classes of skew bracoids, the first consists of those\nwe term almost a brace, meaning the multiplicative group decomposes as a\ncertain semi-direct product, and then those that are almost classical, which\nadditionally specifies the relationship between the multiplicative group and\nthe additive. Skew bracoids with these properties have applications in\nHopf-Galois theory, in particular for questions concerning the Hopf-Galois\ncorrespondence, and can also yield solutions to the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter\nequation. We use this skew bracoid perspective to give a new construction\nbuilding on the induced Hopf-Galois structures of Crespo, Rio and Vela, recover\na result of Greither and Pareigis on the Hopf-Galois correspondence, and\nexamine the solutions that arise from skew bracoids, in particular where more\nthan one solution may be drawn from a single skew bracoid.\n",
