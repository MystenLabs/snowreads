It emphasises that obtaining explicit consent of individuals is necessary\nfor setting cookies. The introduction of the German Telecommunication Telemedia\nData Protection Act (Telekommunikation-Telemedien-Datenschutzgesetz, TTDSG) has\nreplaced the relevant section of the German Telemedia Act (Telemediengesetz,\nTMG) and transpose the concept of informed consent for storing and accessing\ninformation on terminal equipment, aligning with Article 5(3) ePrivacy\nDirective. To meet these requirements, companies exploring alternatives to\nobtaining consent are developing technical mechanisms that rely on a legal\nbasis. Google tested initially \"Federated Learning of Cohorts\" (FLoC) as part\nof their \"Privacy Sandbox\" strategy. This technology was significantly\ncriticized, Google introduced a new project called \"Google Topics\", which aims\nto personalize advertising by categorizing users into interest groups, called\ntopics. Implementation of this technology began in July 2023.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QEXX195qzta9winMV-Bw7c4PymjwnrWs2saxOlnlfUY","pdfSize":"326572"}
