The method makes use of Field Programmable Gate arrays\nand was originally used to detect fast-moving objects such as space debris or\nnear-Earth asteroids. Here we present an application of the method to detect\nslow-moving Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) in the New Horizons target search\nobservations. A cadence that takes continuous images of one HSC field of view\nfor half a night fits the method well. The observations for the New Horizons\nKuiper Belt Extended Mission (NH/KEM) using HSC began in May 2020, and are\nongoing. Here we show our result of the analysis of the dataset acquired from\nMay 2020 through June 2021 that have already passed the proprietary period and\nare open to the public. We detected 84 KBO candidates in the June 2020 and June\n2021 datasets, when the observation field was close to opposition.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HRWNNUphrqwZpD0pAE7sz5TPeBCprPs2o1SP9SHeHW4","pdfSize":"666471"}
