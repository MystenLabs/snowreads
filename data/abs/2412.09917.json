A\nrecent improvement in the ab initio derivation of effective Hamiltonians leads\nto a much better starting point for the optimization procedure. In addition, we\nintroduce a protocol to avoid over-fitting, enabling a more reliable\nextrapolation beyond available data. These developments will enable more robust\npredictions for exotic isotopes produced at rare isotope beam facilities and in\nastrophysical environments.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kLgPNRLWm6z_ZKpHe_jkP5hwUk10gXjkMZtxwhaH1NQ","pdfSize":"1141348"}
