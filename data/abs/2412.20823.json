  "abstract": "  A class of non-strictly hyperbolic systems of quasilinear equations with\noscillatory solutions of the Cauchy problem, globally smooth in time in some\nopen neighborhood of the zero stationary state, is found. For such systems, the\nperiod of oscillation of solutions does not depend on the initial point of the\nLagrangian trajectory. The question of the possibility of constructing these\nsystems in a physical context is also discussed, and non-relativistic and\nrelativistic equations of cold plasma are studied from this point of view.\n",
