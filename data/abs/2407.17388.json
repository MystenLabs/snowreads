The environment functions analogously to the escapement mechanism\nin a mechanical clock, regulating the gear train and permitting the advancement\nof timing in discrete intervals. In our proposed model, the relative phase of\nthe two spins become synchronized through interaction with a mutual,\ncorrelated, environment. We show that for a system of qubits, several arguments\ncan be made that significantly reduce the cardinality of the set of allowed\nmeasurements and, hence, the complexity of the problem. We present a\nnumerically efficient method to calculate the degree of quantumness that exists\nin the correlations of our final density matrix. This method also provides a\ntight upper bound for when the system is described by rank-3 and rank-4 density\nmatrices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1BKNrYA9ZXNGBIa7Oq-YJ6VTfvJa9Vqxu8Y2NM3LewA","pdfSize":"1442004"}
