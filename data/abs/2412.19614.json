It is found that\nthe rate of decrease of the net-baryon number probability mass function\ndiminishes with the temperature and, in the extensions of the CEM, falls to the\nlevel consistent with the phase transition at large baryon chemical potentials.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"TVT0Tfhomeb3pKJvpWbjphSxHojvevYjMbxwXmxENIE","pdfSize":"473324"}
