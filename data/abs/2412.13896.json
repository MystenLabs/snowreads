This model has the same global symmetry structure as the Standard\nModel but the additional Higgs field enlarges the scalar spectrum and opens the\npossibility for the occurrence of spontaneous symmetry breaking of the global\nsymmetries. Both the spectrum and the running of the gauge coupling of the\ncustodial 2HDM are studied on a line of constant Standard Model physics with\ncutoff ranging from 300 to 600 GeV. The lower bounds of the realizable masses\nfor the additional BSM scalar states are found to be well bellow the W boson\nmass. In fact, for the choice of quartic couplings in this work the estimated\nlower mass for one of the BSM states is found to be about $\\sim 0.2m_{W}$ and\nindependent of the cutoff.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"2e-Y0k0FhrY4R_5ea5832VxJjsB_KrHL_rn9G0wDJpo","pdfSize":"640632"}
