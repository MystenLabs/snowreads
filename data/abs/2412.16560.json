Its piecewise minimality index $\\rho(u)$ is\nthe smallest length $k$ such that $u$ is minimal among its order-$k$ class\n$[u]_k$ in Simon's congruence. We initiate a study of these two descriptive\ncomplexity measures. Among other results we provide efficient algorithms for\ncomputing $h(u)$ and $\\rho(u)$ for a given word $u$.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Formal Languages and Automata Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mIbgSd0cWSkwKi8Nh8tRwOKld-N13of_7ZbnnRfih4s","pdfSize":"274685"}
