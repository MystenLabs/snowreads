In this work, we investigate the effect of\ndropping MLP and attention layers at inference time on the performance of\nLlama-v2 models. We find that dropping dreeper attention layers only marginally\ndecreases performance but leads to the best speedups alongside dropping entire\nlayers. For example, removing 33\\% of attention layers in a 13B Llama2 model\nresults in a 1.8\\% drop in average performance over the OpenLLM benchmark. We\nalso observe that skipping layers except the latter layers reduces performances\nfor more layers skipped, except for skipping the attention layers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nor8wzwSrjDzR2I7fZzETPPDik__wIk8VAkRf-KQkU4","pdfSize":"493551"}
