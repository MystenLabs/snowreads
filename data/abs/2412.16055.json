One special\ninstance of our general theorem is the following: Let $\\Delta$ denote the\n8-dimensional simplex viewed as an abstract simplicial complex, and suppose\nthat its vertices are arranged in a $3\\times 3$ array. Then for any continuous\nmap $f:\\Delta \\to \\mathbb{R}^3$ it is possible to partition the rows or the\ncolumns of the vertex array into two parts, such that the disjoint faces\n$\\sigma$ and $\\tau$ induced by the two parts satisfy $f(\\sigma)\\cap f(\\tau)\n\\neq \\emptyset$. Our result also has consequences for geometric transversals\nand topological Helly.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"iLVHbckdyh9eVX_WutR46HCPlSp4g_39V6CSB2BmrVk","pdfSize":"118625"}
