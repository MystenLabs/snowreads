First, we give a simple proof of the fact that\nevery CBER on $[\\mathbb{N}]^{\\mathbb{N}}$ is hyperfinite on some set of the\nform $[A]^{\\mathbb{N}}$. Using the idea behind the proof, we show the analogous\nresult for every topological Ramsey space.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kmQzpXDtwMyU-NGgzjPCNVg-8rzQLpP9kG_X8vt1WtI","pdfSize":"152207"}
