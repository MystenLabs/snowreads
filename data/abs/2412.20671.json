To address this,\nwe propose a two-step framework. Initially, it identifies confounding sensitive\nattributes that limit rumor detection performance and cause unfairness across\ngroups. Subsequently, we aim to learn equally informative representations\nthrough invariant learning. Our method considers diverse sets of groups without\nsensitive attribute annotations. Experiments show our method easily integrates\nwith existing rumor detectors, significantly improving both their detection\nperformance and fairness.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Social and Information Networks","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ImEyZvAta7pRLlc94_H_reB4BNihVblT68jXLdPC1LQ","pdfSize":"986600"}
