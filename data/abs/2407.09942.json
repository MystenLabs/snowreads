DB provides a set of four\nparameters that characterize both incoherent and coherent errors in the\nsingle-qubit gate set. Furthermore, DB reveals asymmetries in gate performance\ninduced by strong relaxation errors ($T_1$). We experimentally demonstrate DB\nusing a superconducting transmon qubit and support these results with a simple\nanalytical model and master equation simulations. Our findings uncover critical\nerrors missed by conventional RB and point to strategies to mitigate these\nerrors.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"v2ftPUPaupFyFDAaq2bPZfhNV4ONbKG16TsGbK-MPXA","pdfSize":"7917086","objectId":"0xc8a2502dcc41ae2b2330ce3f79b8abd9e8d4c6345701bd72b335f2147d99b213","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
