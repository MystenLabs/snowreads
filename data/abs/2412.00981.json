  "abstract": "  Precision optical filters are key components for current and future photonic\ntechnologies. Here, we demonstrate a low loss spectral filter consisting of an\nultrasteep bandpass feature with a maximum gradient of (90.6$\\pm$0.7) dB/GHz,\ncentred within a notch filter with (128$\\pm$6) dB of suppression. The filter\nconsists of a fiber Bragg grating with multiple $\\pi$-phase discontinuities\ninscribed into a single mode photosensitive fiber. The measured performance\nclosely matches the simulated spectrum calculated from the design parameters\nindicating a high degree of confidence in the repeatability and manufacture of\nsuch devices. These filters show great promise for applications reliant on\nhigh-frequency resolution noise suppression, such as quantum networking, and\nhighlight the opportunities for the versatility, efficiency, and extreme\nsuppression offered by high-performance fiber Bragg grating devices.\n",
