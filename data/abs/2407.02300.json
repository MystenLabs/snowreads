The SCE can be used to generate an enormous\nnumber of approximations but distinguishing the superb approximations from the\ndeficient ones can only be achieved after the fact by comparison to\nexperimental or numerical results. Here, we propose a method of using the SCE\nto a priori obtain uniform approximations, namely asymptotic matching. If the\nasymptotic behaviour of a problem can be identified, then the approximations\ngenerated by the SCE can be tuned to asymptotically match the desired behaviour\nand this can be used to obtain uniform approximations over the entire domain of\nconsideration, without needing to resort to empirical comparisons. We\ndemonstrate this method by applying it to the task of obtaining uniform\napproximations of the modified Bessel functions of the second kind,\n$K_\\alpha(x)$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"h5LzGnL3_Qxf7nVgxj_ZZv37glqHVfkQp3gCxPwWzqQ","pdfSize":"2061187"}
