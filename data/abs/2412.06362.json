  "abstract": "  We studied rotational modulation of the radial velocities of narrow emission\nlines in four classical T Tauri stars. We found that the previously declared\nshift of the mean velocity of neutral and ionized helium lines relative to the\nmean radial velocity of the star is not associated with the inflow of accreted\ngas into the hotspot, since the radial velocity curves for lines with different\nvelocity shifts should exhibit phase shifts relative to each other, while the\nobserved phase shifts are absent within their uncertainties and do not\ncorrespond to the observed line velocity shifts. This means that the line\nshifts are not caused by the actual gas motion. For neutral helium lines, the\nshifts can be explained by the large optical thickness of the lines and the\nStark effect at plasma parameters expected at the base of the accretion column\nof T Tauri stars.\n",
