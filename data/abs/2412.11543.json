  "abstract": "  We address unsupervised dependency parsing by building an ensemble of diverse\nexisting models through post hoc aggregation of their output dependency parse\nstructures. We observe that these ensembles often suffer from low robustness\nagainst weak ensemble components due to error accumulation. To tackle this\nproblem, we propose an efficient ensemble-selection approach that considers\nerror diversity and avoids error accumulation. Results demonstrate that our\napproach outperforms each individual model as well as previous ensemble\ntechniques. Additionally, our experiments show that the proposed\nensemble-selection method significantly enhances the performance and robustness\nof our ensemble, surpassing previously proposed strategies, which have not\naccounted for error diversity.\n",
