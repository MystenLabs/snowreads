Despite advancements\nin visual colorization using large-scale generative models like diffusion\nmodels, challenges with controllability and identity consistency persist,\nmaking current solutions unsuitable for industrial application.To address this,\nwe propose ColorFlow, a three-stage diffusion-based framework tailored for\nimage sequence colorization in industrial applications. Unlike existing methods\nthat require per-ID finetuning or explicit ID embedding extraction, we propose\na novel robust and generalizable Retrieval Augmented Colorization pipeline for\ncolorizing images with relevant color references. Our pipeline also features a\ndual-branch design: one branch for color identity extraction and the other for\ncolorization, leveraging the strengths of diffusion models. We utilize the\nself-attention mechanism in diffusion models for strong in-context learning and\ncolor identity matching. To evaluate our model, we introduce ColorFlow-Bench, a\ncomprehensive benchmark for reference-based colorization. Results show that\nColorFlow outperforms existing models across multiple metrics, setting a new\nstandard in sequential image colorization and potentially benefiting the art\nindustry.
