It includes red emission\nlines in the range of 580-730 nm and a prominent line at 852 nm corresponding\nto the 6P3/2-6S1/2 transition. A T-shaped all-sapphire cell with a length of 1\ncm, containing Cs atomic vapor and capable of being heated up to 500 oC, was\nused. The laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) power at 852 nm was investigated as\na function of the cell temperature. The maximum LIF power was achieved at 130\noC, while a significant decrease was observed around 300 oC. At 130 oC, the\nDoppler-broadened LIF spectrum at 852 nm exhibited self-conversion, resulting\nin the formation of two distinct peaks within the spectrum. The LIF power at\n852 nm was also studied as a function of the 456 nm radiation power. The Cs\ncell demonstrated potential as an efficient optical filter and down-converter,\neffectively transforming 456 nm radiation into 852 nm radiation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kVPmTXtplwia4yy4HT1T4Eun5Sz7QWLHnbPY5UT1x8Q","pdfSize":"430014"}
