Its effectiveness hinges\non the timing of isolation, which is often dictated by the onset of\ncontagiousness. While minimizing isolation delays is crucial, the impact of\nevolving epidemic dynamics, such as changes in viral load distributions among\ncases, is less understood. These dynamics could inform more efficient isolation\nstrategies. We developed a multi-scale agent-based model to assess isolation\npolicies that consider viral loads. Our model compares the outcomes of\nuniversal isolation with strategies that exempt low viral load cases post-peak.\nWe found that most low viral load cases identified after the peak are less\ncontagious, raising the question of their need for isolation. Our analysis\nreveals that exempting these individuals slightly increases new infections and,\nunexpectedly, reduces efficiency, defined as infections averted per isolation.\nThese results advise caution with adaptive isolation policies. Our flexible\nmodel can evaluate complex strategies, aiding future public health planning.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"fb4jOXCyc_H5wGcbfTalHlbIajVRwMvu_fFsmybHDO4","pdfSize":"2061002"}
