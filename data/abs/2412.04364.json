  "abstract": "  We prove that most Artin groups of large and hyperbolic type are Hopfian,\nmeaning that every self-epimorphism is an isomorphism. The class covered by our\nresult is generic, in the sense of Goldsborough-Vaskou. Moreover, assuming the\nresidual finiteness of certain hyperbolic groups with an explicit presentation,\nwe get that all large and hyperbolic type Artin groups are residually finite.\nWe also show that most quotients of the five-holed sphere mapping class group\nare hierarchically hyperbolic, up to taking powers of the normal generators of\nthe kernels. The main tool we use to prove both results is a Dehn-filling-like\nprocedure for short hierarchically hyperbolic groups (these also include e.g.\nnon-geometric 3-manifolds, and triangle- and square-free RAAGs).\n",
