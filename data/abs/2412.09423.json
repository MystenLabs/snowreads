  "abstract": "  Understanding the properties of excited states of complex molecules is\ncrucial for many chemical and physical processes. Calculating these properties\nis often significantly more resource-intensive than calculating their ground\nstate counterparts. We present a quantum machine learning model that predicts\nexcited-state properties from the molecular ground state for different\ngeometric configurations. The model comprises a symmetry-invariant quantum\nneural network and a conventional neural network and is able to provide\naccurate predictions with only a few training data points. The proposed\nprocedure is fully NISQ compatible. This is achieved by using a quantum circuit\nthat requires a number of parameters linearly proportional to the number of\nmolecular orbitals, along with a parameterized measurement observable, thereby\nreducing the number of necessary measurements. We benchmark the algorithm on\nthree different molecules by evaluating its performance in predicting excited\nstate transition energies and transition dipole moments. We show that, in many\ninstances, the procedure is able to outperform various classical models that\nrely solely on classical features.\n",
