Federated Learning (FL) enables the training of\ngenerative AI Models across data siloes, sharing only model parameters while\nimproving data security. Since FL is a cooperative learning paradigm, clients\nand servers naturally share legal responsibility in the FL pipeline. Our work\ncontributes to clarifying the roles of both parties, explains strategies for\nshifting responsibilities to the server operator, and points out open technical\nchallenges that we must solve to improve FL's practical applicability under the\nEU AI Act.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"iEkHqsEEy0o7K0PWBMj_e_bsK0W5kFWEmSKfk-wxQ_Y","pdfSize":"111381"}
