We emphasize that the UV description of an anomaly-free\nfusion category symmetry must include the fiber functor, giving rise to a local\nsymmetry action, a charge category and a trivial phase. We construct an\n``onsite'' matrix-product-operator (MPO) version of the Hopf algebra symmetry\noperators in a lattice model with tensor-product Hilbert space. In particular,\nwe propose a systematic framework for classifying and constructing SPTs with\nnon-invertible symmetries. An SPT phase corresponds to a Q-system in the charge\ncategory, such that the Q-system becomes a matrix algebra when the symmetry is\nforgotten. As an example, we provide an explicit microscopic realization of all\nthree $\\mathsf{Rep}^\\dagger(D_8)$ SPT phases, including a trivial phase, and\nfurther demonstrate the $S_3$-duality among these three SPT phases.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0HWv0DQEXk18uLNhfPqoXQVbJFhXilKM72tT9kOUAQc","pdfSize":"653987"}
