  "abstract": "  We consider the application of machine learning models for short-term\nintra-day trading in equities. We envisage a scenario wherein machine learning\nmodels are submitted by independent data scientists to predict discretised\nten-candle returns every five minutes, in response to five-minute candlestick\ndata provided to them in near real-time. An ensemble model combines these\nmultiple models via a weighted-majority algorithm. The weights of each model\nare dynamically updated based on the performance of each model, and can also be\nused to reward model owners. Each model's performance is evaluated according to\ntwo different metrics over a recent time window: In addition to accuracy, we\nalso consider a `utility' metric that is a proxy for a model's potential\nprofitability under a particular trading strategy. We present experimental\nresults on real intra-day data that show that our weighted-majority ensemble\ntechniques show improved accuracy as well as utility over any of the individual\nmodels, especially using the utility metric to dynamically re-weight models\nover shorter time-windows.\n",
