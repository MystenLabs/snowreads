  "abstract": "  We study one-dimensional optical wave turbulence described by the 1D\nSchr{\\\"o}dinger-Helmholtz model for nonlinear light propagation in spatially\nnonlocal nonlinear optical media such as nematic liquid crystals. By exploiting\nthe specific structure of the nonlocal response, we derive a reduced wave\nkinetic equation under a semi-local approximation that permits the study of\nweak-wave turbulent cascades. We explore the realisability of the wave\nturbulence predictions and demonstrate new turbulent behaviour related to\nspatial nonlocality. Moreover, we show strong dependence of the wave turbulence\nto the possible presence of incoherent solitonic structures.\n",
