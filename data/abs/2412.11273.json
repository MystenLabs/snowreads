The $\\textit{NuSTAR}$ observation was conducted in\nconjunction with $\\textit{NICER}$, shortly after EF Eri entered a high\naccretion state following an unprecedented period of low activity lasting 26\nyears since 1997. $\\textit{NuSTAR}$ detected hard X-ray emission up to 50 keV\nwith an X-ray flux of $1.2\\times10^{-10}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ ($3\\rm{-}50\nkeV$). Folded X-ray lightcurves exhibit a single peak with $\\sim65\\%$ spin\nmodulation throughout the $3\\rm{-}50$ keV band. We found no evidence of QPO\nsignals at $\\nu = 0.1\\rm{-}100$ Hz with an upper limit on the QPO amplitude\nbelow $5\\%$ ($90\\%$ CL) at $\\nu \\sim 0.5$ Hz where the optical QPO was\npreviously detected. Our 1-D accretion column model, called ${\\tt MCVSPEC}$,\nwas fitted to the $\\textit{NuSTAR}$ spectral data, yielding an accurate WD mass\nmeasurement of $M = (0.55\\rm{-}0.58) M_\\odot$. $\\texttt{MCVSPEC}$ accounts for\nradiative cooling by thermal bremsstrahlung and cyclotron emission, X-ray\nreflection off the WD surface, and a previously constrained range of the\naccretion column area. The derived WD mass range is in excellent agreement with\nthe previous measurement of $M = (0.55\\rm{-}0.60) M_\\odot$ in the optical band.\nThis demonstrates a combination of broadband X-ray spectral analysis and the\n${\\tt MCVSPEC}$ model that can be employed in our ongoing $\\textit{NuSTAR}$\nobservation campaign of other polars to determine their WD masses accurately.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"klWJtuvkmy1BA2VGF7sObilW8v8yj0WluYXmJrWtXdo","pdfSize":"1983371"}
