  "abstract": "  Despite the rising prevalence of deep neural networks (DNNs) in\ncyber-physical systems, their vulnerability to adversarial bit-flip attacks\n(BFAs) is a noteworthy concern. This paper proposes B3FA, a semi-black-box\nBFA-based parameter attack on DNNs, assuming the adversary has limited\nknowledge about the model. We consider practical scenarios often feature a more\nrestricted threat model for real-world systems, contrasting with the typical\nBFA models that presuppose the adversary's full access to a network's inputs\nand parameters. The introduced bit-flip approach utilizes a magnitude-based\nranking method and a statistical re-construction technique to identify the\nvulnerable bits. We demonstrate the effectiveness of B3FA on several DNN models\nin a semi-black-box setting. For example, B3FA could drop the accuracy of a\nMobileNetV2 from 69.84% to 9% with only 20 bit-flips in a real-world setting.\n",
