To overcome this, we present\nULSR-GS, a framework dedicated to high-fidelity surface extraction in\nultra-large-scale scenes, addressing the limitations of existing GS-based mesh\nextraction methods. Specifically, we propose a point-to-photo partitioning\napproach combined with a multi-view optimal view matching principle to select\nthe best training images for each sub-region. Additionally, during training,\nULSR-GS employs a densification strategy based on multi-view geometric\nconsistency to enhance surface extraction details. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that ULSR-GS outperforms other state-of-the-art GS-based works on\nlarge-scale aerial photogrammetry benchmark datasets, significantly improving\nsurface extraction accuracy in complex urban environments.
