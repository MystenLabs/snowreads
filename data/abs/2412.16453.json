Recent research has shown that many students are aware of\ngenerative AI (GenAI) tools; however, there are gaps in the extent and\neffectiveness of how students use them. With over two years of widespread GenAI\nusage, it is crucial to understand whether students' help-seeking behaviors\nwith these tools have evolved and how. This paper presents findings from a\nrepeated cross-sectional survey conducted among computing students across North\nAmerican universities (n=95). Our results indicate shifts in GenAI usage\npatterns. In 2023, 34.1% of students (n=47) reported never using ChatGPT for\nhelp, ranking it fourth after online searches, peer support, and class forums.\nBy 2024, this figure dropped sharply to 6.3% (n=48), with ChatGPT nearly\nmatching online search as the most commonly used help resource. Despite this\ngrowing prevalence, there has been a decline in students' hourly and daily\nusage of GenAI tools, which may be attributed to a common tendency to\nunderestimate usage frequency. These findings offer new insights into the\nevolving role of GenAI in computing education, highlighting its increasing\nacceptance and solidifying its position as a key help resource.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computers and Society","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6bSiKpeu_vc6vhSb201M-fCFpXtseyGeGOwUSgO6MpI","pdfSize":"459184"}
