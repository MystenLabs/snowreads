  "abstract": "  The general position problem in graph theory asks for the number of vertices\nin a largest set $S$ of vertices of a graph $G$ such that no shortest path of\n$G$ contains more than two vertices of $S$. The analogous monophonic position\nproblem is obtained from the general position problem by replacing ``shortest\npath\" by ``induced path.\" This paper studies monophonic position sets in the\nCartesian and lexicographic products of graphs. Sharp lower and upper bounds\nfor the monophonic position number of Cartesian products are established, along\nwith several exact values. For the lexicographic product, the monophonic\nposition number is determined for arbitrary graphs.\n",
