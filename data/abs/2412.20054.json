  "abstract": "  Low-energy lattice models are the cornerstone for understanding many-body\neffects and interactions between systems and measurements. A key challenge is\nidentifying appropriate states that canonically transform between momentum and\nreal space while retaining the correlation, entanglement, and geometric\nproperties - generally called the Wannier obstruction. Here, we introduce a\nphase-space approach to bypass these obstructions. Instead of treating phase\nspace as a manifold, we embed real space through a Bloch vector space at each\nmomentum. Orbital and spin states are introduced through product states with\nthe Bloch vector, while quantum statistics, correlations, topology, and\nentanglements are inherited from the Hamiltonian. We apply this framework to\nexplore unconventional pairing symmetry and the Bogoliubov-de-Gennes (BdG)\nequation in the phase space. Our findings demonstrate that while\nsuperconductivity exhibits global coherence in momentum space, the local\nWannier orbital symmetry primarily determines the pairing symmetry. We\nanalytically solve the spin-fluctuation mediated pairing symmetry on the phase\nspace by engineering a flat band with artificial gauge fields. We then apply\nthe model to a square-octagon superconductor Lu$_2$Fe$_3$Si$_5$ using density\nfunctional theory (DFT) to unravel a coexistence of nodeless $s_{\\pm}$ and\nnodal $s_{z^2}$ pairing symmetries. This phase-space framework provides a\nrobust, obstruction-free lattice model for complex many-body systems and their\nexotic excitations.\n",
