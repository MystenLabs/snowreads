In the special case that our\nGrassmannian is projective space, this is equivalent to asking when a variety\ncan be recovered from its Chow form; the answer is \"always\" by work of Chow in\n1937. In the general Grassmannian setting, the analogous question is when a\nvariety can be recovered from its Chow-Lam form. We give both necessary\nconditions for recovery and families of examples where, in contrast with the\nprojective case, recovery is not possible.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wOoA_rtHpOkFRZDjYeyfhUWuJUifBe4d6dxCxv2Ou2M","pdfSize":"295078"}
