Our presented notation is a generalization of the\nexisting diagrammatic notation of standard electronic coupled-cluster theory.\nFurther, we discuss point-group symmetry inside a cavity and its exploitation\nwithin a QED-CC code for efficiency and the targeted treatment of excited\nstates.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"VbsYZSTVL2iH9VQYXqrWo4irWdWvzr_5kx7sHm1osYQ","pdfSize":"991251"}
