  "abstract": "  Pair trading is a market-neutral quantitative trading strategy that exploits\nprice anomalies between two correlated assets. By taking simultaneous long and\nshort positions, it generates profits based on relative price movements,\nindependent of overall market trends. This study explores the mathematical\nfoundations of pair trading, focusing on identifying cointegrated pairs,\nconstructing trading signals, and optimizing model parameters to maximize\nreturns. The results highlight the strategy's potential for consistent\nprofitability even in volatile market conditions.\n",
