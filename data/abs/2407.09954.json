Boolean modelling is more\nand more used, but the description of the dynamics from two-levels components\nmay be too limited to capture certain dynamical properties. %However, in\nBoolean models, the description of the dynamics may be too limited to capture\ncertain dynamical properties. Multivalued logical models can overcome this\nlimitation by allowing more than two levels for each component. However,\nmultivaluing a Boolean model is challenging.\n  Results: We present MRBM, a method for efficiently identifying the components\nof a Boolean model to be multivalued in order to capture specific fixed-point\nreachabilities in the asynchronous dynamics. To this goal, we defined a new\nupdating scheme locating reachability properties in the most permissive\ndynamics. MRBM is supported by mathematical demonstrations and illustrated on a\ntoy model and on two models of stem cell differentiation.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Molecular Networks","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"ms3t3jtY403XLEkBA7lxdvEzOeNHo6vKc6beMDbyhZM","pdfSize":"1525051","objectId":"0x83a72467c85aebd4cae084fb1bd34805e6734a67ec1c78646b6e5156500b0a2c","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
