We find that\nbinary classifiers are not well calibrated for ranking, and perform poorly\nduring evaluation. For Task 3, we use embeddings from BERT to predict the\nseverity of eating disorder symptoms based on user post history. We find that\nclassical machine learning models perform well on the task, and end up\ncompetitive with the baseline models. Representation of text data is crucial in\nboth tasks, and we find that sentence transformers are a powerful tool for\ndownstream modeling.
