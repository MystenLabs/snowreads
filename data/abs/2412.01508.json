  "abstract": "  This paper proposes the second version of the widespread Hand Gesture\nRecognition dataset HaGRID -- HaGRIDv2. We cover 15 new gestures with\nconversation and control functions, including two-handed ones. Building on the\nfoundational concepts proposed by HaGRID's authors, we implemented the dynamic\ngesture recognition algorithm and further enhanced it by adding three new\ngroups of manipulation gestures. The ``no gesture\" class was diversified by\nadding samples of natural hand movements, which allowed us to minimize false\npositives by 6 times. Combining extra samples with HaGRID, the received version\noutperforms the original in pre-training models for gesture-related tasks.\nBesides, we achieved the best generalization ability among gesture and hand\ndetection datasets. In addition, the second version enhances the quality of the\ngestures generated by the diffusion model. HaGRIDv2, pre-trained models, and a\ndynamic gesture recognition algorithm are publicly available.\n",
