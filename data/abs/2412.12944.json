  "abstract": "  Online optimisation studies the convergence of optimisation methods as the\ndata embedded in the problem changes. Based on this idea, we propose a primal\ndual online method for nonlinear time-discrete inverse problems. We analyse the\nmethod through regret theory and demonstrate its performance in real-time\nmonitoring of moving bodies in a fluid with Electrical Impedance Tomography\n(EIT). To do so, we also prove the second-order differentiability of the\nComplete Electrode Model (CEM) solution operator on $L^\\infty$.\n",
