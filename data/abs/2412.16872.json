  "abstract": "  We consider the cubic nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation with long-range linear\npotentials in one space dimension, and prove the modified scattering in the\nenergy space for the associated final state problem with a prescribed small\nasymptotic profile. Compared with the leading term of the free solution, the\nasymptotic profile has an additional phase correction depending both on the\nlong-range part of the potential and on the nonlinear term. The proof is based\non a simple energy method and does not rely on global-in-time Strichartz\nestimates for Schr\\\"odinger equations with linear potentials. In particular,\nthe class of potentials to which our theorem applies is large enough to\naccommodate slowly decaying negative potentials so that the associated\nSchr\\\"odinger operators may have negative eigenvalues.\n",
