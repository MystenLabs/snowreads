In this short review, we describe a variety of approaches used to\nobtain biological insight from the structural ensembles of disordered proteins,\nregions, and complexes and the integrative biology challenges that arise from\ncombining diverse experiments and computational models. Importantly, we\nhighlight findings regarding structural and dynamic characterization of\ndisordered regions involved in binding and phase separation, as well as drug\ntargeting of disordered regions, using a broad framework of integrative\nmodeling approaches.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ErUhn1Hv_kdLKmPVDd-4-x_mLZf1wk8DfbtUzZWIuB8","pdfSize":"826432"}
