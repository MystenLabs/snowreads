  "abstract": "  We humans are biased - and our robotic creations are biased, too. Bias is a\nnatural phenomenon that drives our perceptions and behavior, including when it\ncomes to socially expressive robots that have humanlike features. Recognizing\nthat we embed bias, knowingly or not, within the design of such robots is\ncrucial to studying its implications for people in modern societies. In this\nchapter, I consider the multifaceted question of bias in the context of\nhumanoid, AI-enabled, and expressive social robots: Where does bias arise, what\ndoes it look like, and what can (or should) we do about it. I offer\nobservations on human-robot interaction (HRI) along two parallel tracks: (1)\nrobots designed in bias-conscious ways and (2) robots that may help us tackle\nbias in the human world. I outline a curated selection of cases for each track\ndrawn from the latest HRI research and positioned against social, legal, and\nethical factors. I also propose a set of critical next steps to tackle the\nchallenges and opportunities on bias within HRI research and practice.\n",
