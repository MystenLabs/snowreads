Computations are completed for\nboth constrained and Lagrangian formulations and they imply that the only\ncritical Reuleaux polygons for the area functional are the regular ones. As a\nconsequence, new variational proofs for the Blaschke-Lebesgue and Firey-Sallee\ntheorems are found.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GyPMdnhpv6slgxzVpDPHrX_gUQAXdoDfV5xOXZ5lSpA","pdfSize":"580965"}
