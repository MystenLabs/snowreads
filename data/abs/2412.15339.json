In this context, however, energy fluctuations become\nextremely relevant and have a significant impact on the charging efficiency. In\nour work, we consider a simple yet paradigmatic model in which a flying qubit\n(the battery) coherently interacts with a single mode optical cavity (the\ncharger) through a number conserving Jaynes-Cummings interaction. By making use\nof full-counting statistics techniques, we fully characterize the average\ncharging power, its fluctuations and the associated charging efficiency for\nseveral different choices of initial states of the optical cavity,\ndemonstrating that preparing the latter in a genuinely quantum non-Gaussian\nFock state (rather than a classical or even non-classical Gaussian state) leads\nto a definite and (in principle) measurable advantage in all these figures of\nmerit.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XM1SpBepxd25KFJafUo3rsC5T4fsxmZzm7eIORGdaQc","pdfSize":"863270"}
