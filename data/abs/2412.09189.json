In this study, we focus on\nthe $f(R,T)$ modified gravity theory, where $R$ denotes the Ricci scalar and\n$T$ represents the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. We employ Barrow's\nholographic dark energy model, derived from fractal surfaces of black holes, to\ninvestigate the reconstruction process. The numerical results are subsequently\npresented for various infrared cutoffs, such as the Hubble horizon, future\nevent horizon, and Granda-Oliveros cutoff.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ScAzNIxavZag4MTvQPjfVXVFG1o51hVDQ3BSR87WL5E","pdfSize":"604935"}
