A significant source of uncertainty in the\ncross-section comes from limitations in our knowledge of nucleon and nuclear\neffects in the scattering process. Here we present a fully analytic\nimplementation of the Correlated Fermi Gas nuclear model for the quasi-elastic\nlepton nucleus scattering. The implementation is then used to separately\ncompare form factor effects and nuclear model effects, specifically the\nRelativistic Fermi Gas nuclear model, for both electron-carbon and\nneutrino-carbon scattering data.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"H4LdV1Yx-nY9WEPktvlRcO-SFYOE6ofhgk-XkOKVvRY","pdfSize":"838746"}
