  "abstract": "  This paper develops a theory of competitive equilibrium with indivisible\ngoods based entirely on economic conditions on demand. The key idea is to\nanalyze complementarity and substitutability between bundles of goods, rather\nthan merely between goods themselves. This approach allows us to formulate\nsufficient, and essentially necessary, conditions for equilibrium existence,\nwhich unify settings with complements and settings with substitutes. Our\nanalysis has implications for auction design.\n",
