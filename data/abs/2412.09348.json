  "abstract": "  Theoretical predictions from a modified theory of gravity with a nonminimal\ncoupling between matter and curvature are compared to data from recent\ncosmological surveys. We use type Ia supernovae data from the Pantheon+ sample\nand the recent 5-year Dark Energy Survey (DES) data release along with baryon\nacoustic oscillation measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument\n(DESI) and extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) to\nconstrain the modified model's parameters and to compare its fit quality to the\nFlat-$\\Lambda$CDM model. We find moderate to strong evidence for a preference\nof the nonminimally coupled theory over the current standard model for all\ndataset combinations. Although the modified model is shown to be capable of\nmatching early-time observations from the cosmic microwave background and\nlate-time supernovae data, we find that there is still some incoherence with\nrespect to the conclusions drawn from baryon acoustic oscillation observations.\n",
