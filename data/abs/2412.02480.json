We\nexpress the semi-leptonic $B$ decay width as a function of $\\alpha_s$(5 GeV),\nthe Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $|V_{cb}|$, $b$- and $c$-quark\nmasses in the $\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme. The method fixes the value of\n$|V_{cb}|$ according to the recent measurement from Belle based on exclusive\n$B$ decays and uses the PDG averages for the $b$- and $c$-quark masses. By\nfitting $\\alpha_s(5\\mathrm{\\,GeV})$ to current world averages of the $B^{\\pm}$\nand $B^{0}$ semi-leptonic decay widths, the analysis obtains\n$\\alpha_s(5\\mathrm{\\,GeV}) = 0.225 \\pm 0.012$, corresponding to a 5-flavor\nextrapolation of $\\alpha_s(m_{Z}) = 0.121 \\pm 0.003$. Taking into account\nfuture results from higher-order perturbative QCD calculations, heavy quark\nmasses derived from lattice QCD, and measurements of $|V_{cb}|$ as well as $B$\ndecay widths from upcoming $B$ and $Z$ factory data, this method could yield a\ndetermination of $\\alpha_s(m_{Z})$ with a competitive precision of\n$\\Delta\\alpha_s(m_{Z}) \\sim 0.0018$. This precision is comparable to the\ncurrent accuracy of $\\alpha_s(m_{Z})$ measurements from $\\tau$ decays, which is\nregarded as the most precise approach.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"L3-dIl6Jy3gpZk7RhOYIFSFNnVdX4ESgKGv6vgYyggA","pdfSize":"623115"}
