Our study shows that in countries such as the United States and the\nUnited Kingdom, far more land is allocated to golf courses than to renewable\nenergy facilities. Areas equivalent to those currently used for golf could\nsupport the installation of up to 842 GW of solar and 659 GW of wind capacity\nin the top ten countries with the most golf courses. In many of these\ncountries, this potential exceeds both current installed capacity and\nmedium-term projections. These findings underscore the untapped potential of\nrethinking land use priorities to accelerate the transition to renewable\nenergy.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"m1399rE7HCfw2FufO50Bj6tNhyHKsatMPh44-xqb7Gk","pdfSize":"1505216"}
