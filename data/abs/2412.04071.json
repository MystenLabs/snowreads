Since massive neutrinos affect structure formation and evolution,\nprobes of large scale structure are sensitive to the sum of their masses. In\nthis work, we explore future constraints on $\\sum m_\\nu$ utilizing\nline-intensity mapping (LIM) as a promising emerging probe of the density of\nour Universe, focusing on the fine-structure [CII] line as an example, and\ncompare these constraints with those derived from traditional galaxy surveys.\nAdditionally, we perform a multi-tracer analysis using velocity tomography via\nthe kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich and moving lens effects to reconstruct the\nthree-dimensional velocity field. Our forecasts indicate that the\nnext-generation AtLAST detector by itself can achieve $\\sigma_{\\Sigma m_\\nu}\n\\sim 50$ meV sensitivity. Velocity tomography will further improve these\nconstraints by 4%. Incorporating forecasts for CMB-S4 and DESI-BAO in a\ncomprehensive multi-tracer analysis, while setting a prior on the optical depth\nto reionization $\\tau$ derived using 21-cm forecasted observations, to break\ndegeneracies, we find that a $\\gtrsim5\\sigma$ detection of $\\sum m_\\nu\\!\\sim\\!\n60$ meV, under the normal hierarchy, is within reach with LIM. Even without a\n$\\tau$ prior, our combined forecast reaches $\\sigma_{\\Sigma m_\\nu} \\!\\sim\\! 18$\nmeV.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7EAvJy7YJ_L4h9iGwIMwpXCN1MtiTc6tj1lDB0lDppU","pdfSize":"1125675"}
