A comparative\nanalysis of AI-supported and traditional Excel-based methods reveals distinct\nstrengths and limitations in fostering understanding of pendulum experiments.\nThis study explores the integration of AI-assisted tools, such as a custom\nchatbot based on ChatGPT, and traditional Excel-based methods in physics\neducation, revealing that while both approaches produce comparable quantitative\nlearning gains, AI tools provide significant qualitative advantages. These\ninclude enhanced emotional engagement and higher motivation, highlighting the\npotential of AI to create a more positive and supportive learning environment.\nAdaptive AI technologies offer significant promise in supporting structured,\ndata-intensive tasks, emphasizing the necessity for thoughtfully balanced\nintegration into educational practices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"-siwJNOWJlERsx6oRbbnYWaa-Tqi-JlrsiH2kRtwHI0","pdfSize":"666878"}
