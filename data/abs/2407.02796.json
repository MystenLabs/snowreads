In this study, we apply their\nmethod to an analogue de Sitter spacetime in the quantum Hall system with an\nexpanding edge. Because this system is chiral, there is no need to impose the\ncondition of ingoing modes near the horizon, which was assumed in the original\nmethod. Moreover, this system is structured so that the de Sitter space is\nsandwiched between two flat spaces, and although the effects of the anomaly\nwould not appear in an ordinal de Sitter spacetime, they manifest themselves as\nboundary conditions between the de Sitter and the flat regions. By performing\ncalculations under these boundary conditions, we obtain the flux of Hawking\nradiation in the outer flat region with the Gibbons-Hawking temperature of the\nde Sitter horizon.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rFr8UIM6BVPkAv2ZlTl0D3R5TtBXx1NH_9ugsmj8DqM","pdfSize":"1708929"}
