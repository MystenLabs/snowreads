FMD calculates the distance between distributions of\nreference and generated symbolic music embeddings, capturing abstract musical\nfeatures. We validate FMD across several datasets and models. Results indicate\nthat FMD effectively differentiates model quality, providing a domain-specific\nmetric for evaluating symbolic music generation, and establishing a\nreproducible standard for future research in symbolic music modeling.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Sound","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Multimedia","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"_C4g0NK9v8B02XkLW_pyCbOb_fXBUtSK7V0WKi3DGDA","pdfSize":"526822"}
