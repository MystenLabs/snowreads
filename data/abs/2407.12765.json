Various statistical and normalization schemes have been\nattempted, but without complete or convincing similarity properties. Our prior\nwork on the transport processes in wall-bounded flows point toward\nself-similarity in the gradient space, where the first and second derivatives\nof the Reynolds stress components exhibit universal scaling across the entire\nboundary layer. This scaling is extendable to compressible flows. Finally, a\nuniversal, integral scaling for the mean velocity profiles is discovered and\npresented.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hI6oP00zLIw1K3jqh4VZBCLeNm-oJyFwE1y7EtgEgvQ","pdfSize":"352359","objectId":"0x92332beb97810f126c581132970cde4db31fef40b4d408210d4b7644d43d30cd","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
