We point out\nthat violations of the isospin symmetric limit of vanishing electric charge\nchemical potential are small along the $T_{pc}(\\mu_B)$ for the entire range of\n$\\mu_B$ covered in the RHIC beam energy scan. For the strangeness neutral\nmatter produced in heavy-ion collisions this leads to a close relation between\n$\\chi_{11}^{BS}$ and $\\chi_{11}^{QS}$. We compare lattice QCD results for\n$\\chi_{11}^{BS}/\\chi_2^S$ along the $T_{pc}(\\mu_B)$ line with preliminary\nexperimental measurements of $\\chi_{11}^{BS}/\\chi_2^S$ for collision energies\n$7.7~{\\rm GeV}\\le \\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}\\le 62.4~{\\rm GeV}$. While we find good\nagreements for $\\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}\\ge 39$~GeV, differences are sizeable at\nsmaller values of $\\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$. Moreover, we compare lattice QCD results\nfor the ratio of the strangeness ($\\mu_S$) to baryon ($\\mu_B$) chemical\npotentials, which define a strangeness neutral system with fixed electric\ncharge to baryon number density, with experimental results obtained by the STAR\ncollaboration for $\\mu_S/\\mu_B$ using strange baryon yields on the freeze-out\nline. Finally, we determine the baryon chemical potential at the freeze-out\n($\\mu_B^f$) by comparing $\\chi_1^B/\\chi_2^B$ along the $T_{pc}(\\mu_B)$ with the\nexperimentally measured net-proton cumulants $\\chi_1^p/\\chi_2^p$. We find that\n$\\{\\mu_B^f, T_{pc}(\\mu_B^f) \\}$ are consistent with the freeze-out parameters\nof the statistical-model fits to experimentally measured hadron yields for\n$\\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}} \\geq 11.5$ GeV.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fO-WuXim9vrdkzUG5PjudEWx4wg4abIUj1sf2tns4NQ","pdfSize":"959254"}
