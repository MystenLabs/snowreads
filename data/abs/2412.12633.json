  "abstract": "  A rooted arborescence of a directed graph is a spanning tree directed towards\na particular vertex. A recent work of Chepuri et al. showed that the\narborescences of a covering graph of a directed graph G are closely related to\nthe arborescences of G. In this paper, we study the weighted sum of\narborescences of a random covering graph and give a formula for the expected\nvalue, resolving a conjecture of Chepuri et al.\n",
