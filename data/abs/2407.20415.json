In this\npaper we will show two stability results for Cayley fibrations with certains\ntypes of conical singularities (in particular Morse type singularities present\nin holomorphic fibrations of Calabi--Yau fourfolds). The first is a stability\nresult for weak fibrations, which has minimal assumptions. Then we show\nstability of Cayley fibrations in the usual sense. This requires stronger\ngeometric assumptions on the Cayley cone and the initial fibration. As an\napplication we construct examples of Cayley fibrations on twisted connected sum\n$G_2$ manifolds times a circle. In particular we also obtain examples of\ncoassociative fibrations of twisted connected sum $G_2$ manifolds, completing\nthe longstanding programme by Kovalev.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"BzZPGdBJQpBDakY8V3eLmojpDtxfTUjFf4Yk1kGa8yA","pdfSize":"714955"}
