  "abstract": "  The local metric dimension ${\\rm dim}_l$ in relation to the clique number\n$\\omega$ is investigated. It is proved that if $\\omega(G)\\leq n(G)-3$, then\n${\\rm dim}_l(G) \\leq n(G)-3$ and the graphs attaining the bound classified.\nMoreover, the graphs $G$ with ${\\rm dim}_l(G) = n(G)-3$ are listed (with no\ncondition on the clique number). It is proved that if $\\omega(G)=n(G)-2$, then\n$n(G)-4 \\leq {\\rm dim}_l(G)\\leq n(G)-3$, and all graphs are divided into two\ngroups depending on which of the options applies. The conjecture asserting that\nfor any graph $G$ we have ${\\rm dim}_l(G) \\leq\n\\left[(\\omega(G)-2)/(\\omega(G)-1)\\right] \\cdot n(G)$ is proved for all graphs\nwith $\\omega(G)\\in\\{n(G)-1,n(G)-2,n(G)-3\\}$. A negative answer is given for the\nproblem whether every planar graph fulfills the inequality ${\\rm dim}_l(G) \\leq\n\\lceil (n(G)+1)/2 \\rceil$.\n",
