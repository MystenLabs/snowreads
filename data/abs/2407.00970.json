This function, first\nstudied by H\\\"{o}rmander and Bernhardsson in 1993, has only real zeros $\\pm\n\\tau_n$, $n=1,2, \\ldots$, and the sequence $(\\tau_n-n-\\frac12)$ has $\\ell^2$\nnorm bounded by $0.13$. The zeros $\\tau_n$ can be computed by means of a fixed\npoint iteration.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OEuXfQNnmScxXdZqux0XzV1ngaK5zMH0JXz01fd5HaY","pdfSize":"154631"}
