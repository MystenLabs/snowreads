  "abstract": "  Numerical interpolation techniques are widely employed for calculating large\nrational functions in scattering amplitude computations. It has been observed\nin recent years that these rational functions greatly simplify upon partial\nfractioning. In this conference proceedings paper, based on the article [H. A.\nChawdhry, Phys. Rev. D 110, 056028 (2024)], a technique is presented to\ninterpolate such rational functions directly in partial-fractioned form, from\nevaluations at special integer points chosen for their properties under a\np-adic absolute value. It is shown that the technique can require 25 times\nfewer numerical probes than conventional finite-field-based techniques and can\nproduce results that are more compact in size by 2 orders of magnitude. The\nreconstructed results moreover exhibit additional patterns that could be\nexploited in future work to further improve the size of the results and the\nnumber of required numerical probes.\n",
