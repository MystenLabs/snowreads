  "abstract": "  The Pauli exclusion principle is fundamental to understanding electronic\nquantum systems. It namely constrains the expected occupancies $n_i$ of\norbitals $\\varphi_i$ according to $0 \\leq n_i \\leq 2$. In this work, we first\nrefine the underlying one-body $N$-representability problem by taking into\naccount simultaneously spin symmetries and a potential degree of mixedness\n$\\boldsymbol w$ of the $N$-electron quantum state. We then derive a\ncomprehensive solution to this problem by using basic tools from representation\ntheory, convex analysis and discrete geometry. Specifically, we show that the\nset of admissible orbital one-body reduced density matrices is fully\ncharacterized by linear spectral constraints on the natural orbital occupation\nnumbers, defining a convex polytope $\\Sigma_{N,S}(\\boldsymbol w) \\subset\n[0,2]^d$. These constraints are independent of $M$ and the number $d$ of\norbitals, while their dependence on $N, S$ is linear, and we can thus calculate\nthem for arbitrary system sizes and spin quantum numbers. Our results provide a\ncrucial missing cornerstone for ensemble density (matrix) functional theory.\n",
