  "abstract": "  To ensure the effective and objective development of transportation networks,\nit is crucial to identify performance limitations across various subsystems. A\ntimetable-independent assessment of infrastructure capacity at railway\njunctions is a fundamental aspect of long-term rail network planning. While\nrecent research introduced queueing-based methods to quantify route-based\nrailway junction performance, modelling arrival and service processes has been\nlimited to exponential distributions. This work utilizes Phase-Type\nDistributions to propose an extension to a previously described Continuous-Time\nMarkov Chain model. In a comparison between assumed distribution combinations,\nthe effect of a more detailed stochastic process modelling is described.\nFurthermore, an analysis of the differences to a simulation method is conducted\nfor an exemplary railway junction. The introduced method enables infrastructure\nmanagers to accurately model stochastic processes for performance determination\nin the early stages of the strategic planning phase.\n",
