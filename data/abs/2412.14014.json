  "abstract": "  The sphere partition function is one of the simplest euclidean gravity\ncomputations. It is usually interpreted as count of states. However, the one\nloop gravity correction contains a dimension depenent phase factor, $i^{D+2}$,\nwhich seems confusing for such an interpretation. We show that, after including\nan observer, this phase gets cancelled for the quantity that should correspond\nto a count of states.\n",
