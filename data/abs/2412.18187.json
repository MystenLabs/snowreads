  "abstract": "  Existing Sign Language Learning applications focus on the demonstration of\nthe sign in the hope that the student will copy a sign correctly. In these\ncases, only a teacher can confirm that the sign was completed correctly, by\nreviewing a video captured manually. Sign Language Translation is a widely\nexplored field in visual recognition. This paper seeks to explore the\nalgorithms that will allow for real-time, video sign translation, and grading\nof sign language accuracy for new sign language users. This required algorithms\ncapable of recognizing and processing spatial and temporal features. The aim of\nthis paper is to evaluate and identify the best neural network algorithm that\ncan facilitate a sign language tuition system of this nature. Modern popular\nalgorithms including CNN and 3DCNN are compared on a dataset not yet explored,\nTrinidad and Tobago Sign Language as well as an American Sign Language dataset.\nThe 3DCNN algorithm was found to be the best performing neural network\nalgorithm from these systems with 91% accuracy in the TTSL dataset and 83%\naccuracy in the ASL dataset.\n",
