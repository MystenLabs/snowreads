  "abstract": "  This paper discusses the need to move away from an instrumental view of text\ncomposition AI assistants under direct control of the user, towards a more\nagentic approach that is based on a value rationale. Based on an analysis of\nmoral dimensions of AI assistance in computer mediated communication, the paper\nproposes basic guidelines for designing the agent's persona.\n",
