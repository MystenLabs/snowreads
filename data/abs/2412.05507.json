To streamline this modeling\nprocess, we introduce AutoURDF, an unsupervised approach for constructing\ndescription files for unseen robots from point cloud frames. Our method\nleverages a cluster-based point cloud registration model that tracks the 6-DoF\ntransformations of point clusters. Through analyzing cluster movements, we\nhierarchically address the following challenges: (1) moving part segmentation,\n(2) body topology inference, and (3) joint parameter estimation. The complete\npipeline produces robot description files that are fully compatible with\nexisting simulators. We validate our method across a variety of robots, using\nboth synthetic and real-world scan data. Results indicate that our approach\noutperforms previous methods in registration and body topology estimation\naccuracy, offering a scalable solution for automated robot modeling.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Robotics","Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gdcP6Sdy5M6jfbszEXP4q_EB8xTAdWjAdBmyVNonyRU","pdfSize":"23620150"}
