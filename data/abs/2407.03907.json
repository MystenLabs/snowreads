We cast the problem of solving\nquasinormal modes (QNMs) in AdS-like spacetime as the linear evolution problem\nof the non-normal operator in null slicing by using ingoing\nEddington-Finkelstein coordinates. In terms of spectrum instability, based on\nthe generalised eigenvalue problem, the QNM spectrum and\n$\\epsilon$-pseudospectrum has been studied, while the open structure of\n$\\epsilon$-pseudospectrum caused by the non-normality of operator indicates the\nspectrum instability. In terms of dynamical instability, the concept of the\ndistance to dynamical instability has been firstly introduced in gravity\naspects, which plays a crucial role in bridging the spectrum instability and\nthe dynamical instability. We calculate the distance, named the complex\nstability radius, as parameters vary. Finally, we report the transient effect\nin the energy norm of the evolution operator, whose behaviour can be roughly\nreflected by the three kinds of abscissas in context of pseudospectrum, and\nexplain the relationship between the waveform and the transient effect.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"wNdo9hjrVD3L3ZXjf8sPbgv0XHDWnrQw9QKwva3avgw","pdfSize":"11326072"}
