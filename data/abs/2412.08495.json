Past fundamental research has primarily concentrated on\nsingle drops, though in applications they are rarely isolated. Here, we\nexperimentally explore the effect of neighbouring drops on the evaporation\nprocess, employing direct imaging, confocal microscopy, and PTV. Remarkably,\nthe centres of the drops move away from each other rather than towards each\nother, as we would expect due to the shielding effect at the side of the\nneighbouring drop and the resulting reduced evaporation on that side. We find\nthat pinning-induced motion mediated by suspended particles in the droplets is\nthe cause of this counter-intuitive behaviour. Finally, the azimuthal\ndependence of the radial velocity in the drop is compared to the evaporative\nflux and a perfect agreement is found.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dtwZmkKt3tQpru6CTwKscDNOd24svmoah8ph2HcZGJs","pdfSize":"13324259"}
