Using methods of qualitative analysis of dynamical\nsystems, complemented by numerical solutions of the evolution equations, we\nstudy the late-time behavior of our model. We show that contrary to the\nuncoupled scenario, the coupled phantom model admits accelerated scaling\nsolutions. However, they do not correspond to a final state of the universe's\nevolution and, therefore, cannot be used to solve the cosmological coincidence\nproblem. Furthermore, we show that, for certain coupling parameter values, the\ntotal equation-of-state parameter's asymptotic behavior is significantly\nchanged when compared to the uncoupled scenario, allowing for solutions less\nphantom even for steeper potentials of the phantom scalar field.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uAbNCGye7_HGGmRJVJfHYVC39Ym2UShEWQ-P9gH0zK4","pdfSize":"1773343"}
