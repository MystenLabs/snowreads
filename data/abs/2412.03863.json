In\n2022, Nagel posed a stronger conjecture that within any union-closed family\nwhose ground set size is at least $k$, there are always $k$ elements in the\nground set that appear in at least $\\frac{1}{2^{k-1}+1}$ proportion of the sets\nin the family.\n  Das and Wu showed that this conjecture is true for $k\\geq 3$ and $k=2$ if\n$|\\mathcal{F}|$ is outside a particular range. In this companion paper, we\nanalyse further when $\\mathcal{F}$ fails Nagel's conjecture for $k=2$ via\nlinear programming.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ddA31Pd85lVkXYo014Q0TwXSpP2Q1t3OBf2ONNy55-E","pdfSize":"146103"}
