  "abstract": "  In this work, we employed Monte Carlo simulations to study the Ising, $XY$,\nand Heisenberg models on a simple cubic lattice, where the system models evolve\ntoward the steady state under the influence of competition between one- and\ntwo-spin flip dynamics. With probability $q$, the system is in contact with a\nthermal reservoir at temperature $T$ and evolves toward the lower energy state\nthrough one-spin flip dynamics. On the other hand, with probability $1-q$, the\nsystem is subjected to an external energy flux that drives it toward the higher\nenergy state through two-spin flip dynamics. As a result, we constructed the\nphase diagram of $T$ as a function of $q$. In this diagram, we identified the\nantiferromagnetic ($AF$) ordered phase, the ferromagnetic ($F$) ordered phase,\nand the disordered paramagnetic ($P$) phase for all the models studied. Through\nthese phases, we observed self-organization phenomena in the systems. For low\nvalues of $q$, the system is in the $AF$ phase, and as $q$ increases the system\ncontinuously transitions to the $P$ phase. Now, for high values of $q$, the\nsystem through continuous phase transitions again reaches an ordered phase, the\n$F$ phase, at low values of $T$. Additionally, we also calculated the critical\nexponents of the system, showing that these are not affected by the\nnon-equilibrium regime of the system.\n",
