  "abstract": "  At the heart of neural network force fields (NNFFs) is the architecture of\nneural networks, where the capacity to model complex interactions is typically\nenhanced through widening or deepening multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) or by\nincreasing layers of graph neural networks (GNNs). These enhancements, while\nimproving the model's performance, often come at the cost of a substantial\nincrease in the number of parameters. By applying the Trainable Adaptive\nActivation Function Structure (TAAFS), we introduce a method that selects\ndistinct mathematical formulations for non-linear activations, thereby\nincreasing the precision of NNFFs with an insignificant addition to the\nparameter count. In this study, we integrate TAAFS into a variety of neural\nnetwork models, resulting in observed accuracy improvements, and further\nvalidate these enhancements through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using\nDeepMD.\n",
