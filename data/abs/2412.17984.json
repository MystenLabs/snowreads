  "abstract": "  In this companion paper for the DAGECC (Domain Adaptation and GEneralization\nfor Character Classification) competition organized within the frame of the\nICPR 2024 conference, we present the general context of the tasks we proposed\nto the community, we introduce the data that were prepared for the competition\nand we provide a summary of the results along with a description of the top\nthree winning entries. The competition was centered around domain adaptation\nand generalization, and our core aim is to foster interest and facilitate\nadvancement on these topics by providing a high-quality, lightweight, real\nworld dataset able to support fast prototyping and validation of novel ideas.\n",
