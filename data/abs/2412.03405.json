The main ingredients for\nthis are the Wiener chaos decomposition and the classical Euler scheme for\nBSDEs. We show convergence of this scheme under very mild assumptions, and\nprovide a rate of convergence in more restrictive cases. We then implement it\nusing neural networks, and we present several numerical examples where we can\ncheck the accuracy of the method.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"g-aXMfbhfaWIb2jpyS5KeA36-2HFtmBIKwJl-V-Az5Q","pdfSize":"995931"}
