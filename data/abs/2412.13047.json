  "abstract": "  Recently, Gaussian splatting has emerged as a strong alternative to NeRF,\ndemonstrating impressive 3D modeling capabilities while requiring only a\nfraction of the training and rendering time. In this paper, we show how the\nstandard Gaussian splatting framework can be adapted for remote sensing,\nretaining its high efficiency. This enables us to achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance in just a few minutes, compared to the day-long optimization\nrequired by the best-performing NeRF-based Earth observation methods. The\nproposed framework incorporates remote-sensing improvements from EO-NeRF, such\nas radiometric correction and shadow modeling, while introducing novel\ncomponents, including sparsity, view consistency, and opacity regularizations.\n",
