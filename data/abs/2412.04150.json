  "abstract": "  A classroom activity for high school physics students is presented to explore\nthe distinction between correlation and causation. Using data linking ice cream\nsales to drowning deaths, presented within a fictional news article, students\nanalyze the relationship, create plots, and identify temperature as the hidden\nvariable explaining the correlation. The activity fosters critical thinking by\nengaging students in scientific reasoning, illustrating how data representation\ninfluences conclusions, and supporting the development of scientific literacy\nand data interpretation skills.\n",
