  "abstract": "  Upper bounds are obtained for the $p$-capacity of compact sets in $\\R^d$,\nwith $d \\ge 2$ and $1<p<d$. Upper and lower bounds are obtained for the product\nof $p$-capacity and powers of the $q$-torsional rigidity over the collection of\nall non-empty, open, bounded and convex sets in $\\R^d$ with either a perimeter\nconstraint, or a measure constraint, or a combination of perimeter and measure\nconstraints. For some range of parameters we identify the ball as the unique\n(up to homotheties) maximiser or minimiser respectively.\n",
