Assuming large skewness, the\nproduction amplitude is dominated by the leading twist-2 gluonic\nenergy-momentum tensor (EMT). We use our recent results for the gluonic\ngravitational form factors of light nuclei in the impulse approximation, to\nestimate the differential cross sections for $J/\\Psi$ production off a deuteron\nand Helium-4 at current electron facilities.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"P9evm9EKKMSG8DRtPA1kWZdD1fT0z4HeRt52Z7jUXVI","pdfSize":"1069820","objectId":"0xbb00a1c6addf96d691c341c1c7949b18b1738a9860bf8afb4d13770f6f60ad7f","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
