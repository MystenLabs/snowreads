Further, devices\nemploy power splitting to harvest energy and receive data simultaneously from a\nHybrid Access Point (HAP). To this end, this paper outlines a Mixed Integer\nLinear Program (MILP) that can be employed by a HAP to optimize the following\nquantities over a given time horizon: (i) mode (downlink or uplink) of time\nslots, (ii) transmit power of each packet, (iii) power splitting ratio of\ndevices, and (iv) decoding order in uplink slots. The MILP yields the optimal\nnumber of packet transmissions over a given planning horizon given non-causal\nchannel state information. We also present a learning based approach to\ndetermine the mode of each time slot using causal channel state information.\nThe results show that the learning based approach achieves 90% of the optimal\nnumber of packet transmissions, and the HAP receives 25% more packets as\ncompared to competing approaches.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"We0z0WKQRcpIjEgzkIgBBUDS8GL3wy_34Qh6N67VLmQ","pdfSize":"729888"}
