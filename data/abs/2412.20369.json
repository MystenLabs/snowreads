  "abstract": "  We consider the curved geometries modelled on the homogeneous space $G/P$,\nwhere $G=SL(6,\\mathbb R)$ acts transitively on the Grassmannian $Gr(3,3)$ of\nthree-dimensional subspaces in $\\mathbb R^6$, and $P$ is the corresponding\nisotropic subgroup. We classify the strongly invariant operators between\nsections of vector bundles induced on such geometries by irreducible\n$P$-modules, i.e., those obtained via homomorphisms of semi-holonomic Verma\nmodules.\n",
