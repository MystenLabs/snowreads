The j=1/2 wave function requires cubic symmetry, while a\nnoncubic crystal field mixes j=1/2 and 3/2 character. Spectroscopic studies of\n$5d^5$ iridates typically claim noncubic symmetry, e.g., based on a splitting\nof the excited j=3/2 quartet. A sizable splitting is particularly puzzling in\nantifluorite-type K$_2$IrCl$_6$, a frustrated fcc quantum magnet with global\ncubic symmetry. It raises the fundamental question about the stability of j=1/2\nmoments against magneto-elastic coupling. Combining resonant inelastic x-ray\nscattering with optical spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the multi-peak line\nshape in K$_2$IrCl$_6$ reflects a vibronic character of the j=3/2 states rather\nthan a noncubic crystal field. The quasimolecular crystal structure with well\nseparated IrCl$_6$ octahedra explains the existence of well-defined sidebands\nthat are usually smeared out in solids. Our results highlight the\nspin-orbital-lattice entangled character of cubic K$_2$IrCl$_6$ with ideal\nj=1/2 moments.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"uMDGZD8ksjNbZsU8ESgFm9y4cvqR1aW7JfKLuD2WDhw","pdfSize":"3310479","objectId":"0x2cdbfd5471f834707a7f44e8ecad605c793102cbfdc4ec30fc08b4ab59945331","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
