The brane-vector can be responsible for\ndark matter because it is odd under a $\\mathrm{Z}_2$ symmetry, neutral under\nthe Standard Model (SM) symmetries, and couples extremely weak to the SM\nparticles due to its gravitational origin. Interestingly, the brane-vector dark\nmatter could leave particular imprints on the cosmic microwave background (CMB)\nand the primordial gravitational waves. Hence, the precise measurements of the\nCMB and the observations of the primordial gravitational waves generated during\nthe inflation can provide a potential way to probe the extra-dimensions and\nbranes which are the main ingredients of string/M theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dTgYhAtsY5Z0RdYTrX7BNcAoRKKpk8Z-jbR8-3FahUo","pdfSize":"730364","objectId":"0xab616f70e0b1242a048440ded9f7c50310fd58e98723dbd84eb4b29436b1f5f4","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
