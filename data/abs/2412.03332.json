  "abstract": "  The $\\ell_2^2$ min-sum $k$-clustering problem is to partition an input set\ninto clusters $C_1,\\ldots,C_k$ to minimize $\\sum_{i=1}^k\\sum_{p,q\\in\nC_i}\\|p-q\\|_2^2$. Although $\\ell_2^2$ min-sum $k$-clustering is NP-hard, it is\nnot known whether it is NP-hard to approximate $\\ell_2^2$ min-sum\n$k$-clustering beyond a certain factor.\n  In this paper, we give the first hardness-of-approximation result for the\n$\\ell_2^2$ min-sum $k$-clustering problem. We show that it is NP-hard to\napproximate the objective to a factor better than $1.056$ and moreover,\nassuming a balanced variant of the Johnson Coverage Hypothesis, it is NP-hard\nto approximate the objective to a factor better than 1.327.\n  We then complement our hardness result by giving the first\n$(1+\\varepsilon)$-coreset construction for $\\ell_2^2$ min-sum $k$-clustering.\nOur coreset uses $\\mathcal{O}\\left(k^{\\varepsilon^{-4}}\\right)$ space and can\nbe leveraged to achieve a polynomial-time approximation scheme with runtime\n$nd\\cdot f(k,\\varepsilon^{-1})$, where $d$ is the underlying dimension of the\ninput dataset and $f$ is a fixed function.\n  Finally, we consider a learning-augmented setting, where the algorithm has\naccess to an oracle that outputs a label $i\\in[k]$ for input point, thereby\nimplicitly partitioning the input dataset into $k$ clusters that induce an\napproximately optimal solution, up to some amount of adversarial error\n$\\alpha\\in\\left[0,\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$. We give a polynomial-time algorithm that\noutputs a $\\frac{1+\\gamma\\alpha}{(1-\\alpha)^2}$-approximation to $\\ell_2^2$\nmin-sum $k$-clustering, for a fixed constant $\\gamma>0$.\n",
