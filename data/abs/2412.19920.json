We investigate\nnine foundational models, focusing on their responses to viewpoint changes,\nincluding the often-overlooked accidental viewpoints where specific camera\norientations obscure an object's true 3D structure. Our methodology enables\nrecognizing and classifying out-of-distribution (OOD), accidental, and stable\nviewpoints using feature representations alone, without accessing the actual\nimages. Our findings indicate that while foundation models consistently encode\naccidental viewpoints, they vary in their interpretation of OOD viewpoints due\nto inherent biases, at times leading to object misclassifications based on\ngeometric resemblance. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations on\nthree downstream tasks - classification, VQA, and 3D reconstruction - we\nillustrate the impact of viewpoint instability and underscore the importance of\nfeature robustness across diverse viewing conditions.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HzT2o2xKewxV1RSJQoJrmKIf1RUwPWhjdvvJi6PkTL0","pdfSize":"11923447"}
