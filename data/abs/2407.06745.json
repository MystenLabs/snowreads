We begin by introducing a stochastic mean-reverting\nprocesses, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model. After this we discuss the Kalman\nfilter in detail, and its application with this model. After a demonstration of\nthe Kalman filter on a simulated OU process and a discussion of maximum\nlikelihood estimation (MLE) for estimating model parameters, we apply the\nKalman filter with the OU process and trailing parameter estimation to real\nstock market data. We finish by proposing a simple day-trading algorithm using\nthe Kalman filter with the OU process and backtest its performance using\nApple's stock price. We then move to the Heston model, a combination of\nGeometric Brownian Motion and the OU process. Maximum likelihood estimation is\ncommonly used for Heston model parameter estimation, which results in very\ncomplex forms. Here we propose an alternative but easier way of parameter\nestimation, called the method of moments (MOM). After the derivation of these\nestimators, we again apply this method to real stock data to assess its\nperformance.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance","Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"L24ziJqHrqixR1npq554yxhI_CP4MudOnrtAhhCIbG8","pdfSize":"1286674"}
