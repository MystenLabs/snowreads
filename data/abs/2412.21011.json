  "abstract": "  Let the tight $\\ell$-cycle minus one edge $C_\\ell^{3-}$ be the $3$-graph on\n$\\{1,\\dots,\\ell\\}$ consisting of $\\ell-1$ consecutive triples in the cyclic\norder. We show that, for every $\\ell\\ge 5$ not divisible by $3$, the Tur\\'an\ndensity of $C_{\\ell}^{3-}$ is $1/4$ and also prove some finer structure\nresults. This proves a conjecture of Mubayi--Sudakov--Pikhurko from 2011 and\nextends the results of Balogh--Luo [Combinatorica 44 (2024) 949--976] who\nestablished analogous claims for all sufficiently large $\\ell$.\n  Results similar to ours were independently obtained by\nLidick\\'y--Mattes--Pfender [arXiv:2409.14257].\n",
