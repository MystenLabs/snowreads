  "abstract": "  We propose a boundary value correction method for the Brezzi-Douglas-Marini\nmixed finite element discretization of the Darcy flow with non-homogeneous\nNeumann boundary condition on 2D curved domains. The discretization is defined\non a body-fitted triangular mesh, i.e. the boundary nodes of the mesh lie on\nthe curved physical boundary. However, the boundary edges of the triangular\nmesh, which are straight, may not coincide with the curved physical boundary. A\nboundary value correction technique is then designed to transform the Neumann\nboundary condition from the physical boundary to the boundary of the triangular\nmesh. One advantage of the boundary value correction method is that it avoids\nusing curved mesh elements and thus reduces the complexity of implementation.\nWe prove that the proposed method reaches optimal convergence for arbitrary\norder discretizations. Supporting numerical results are presented. Key words:\nmixed finite element method, Neumann boundary condition, curved domain,\nboundary value correction method.\n",
