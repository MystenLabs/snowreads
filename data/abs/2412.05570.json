  "abstract": "  While novel view synthesis for dynamic scenes has made significant progress,\ncapturing skeleton models of objects and re-posing them remains a challenging\ntask. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel approach to\nautomatically discover the associated skeleton model for dynamic objects from\nvideos without the need for object-specific templates. Our approach utilizes 3D\nGaussian Splatting and superpoints to reconstruct dynamic objects. Treating\nsuperpoints as rigid parts, we can discover the underlying skeleton model\nthrough intuitive cues and optimize it using the kinematic model. Besides, an\nadaptive control strategy is applied to avoid the emergence of redundant\nsuperpoints. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency\nof our method in obtaining re-posable 3D objects. Not only can our approach\nachieve excellent visual fidelity, but it also allows for the real-time\nrendering of high-resolution images.\n",
