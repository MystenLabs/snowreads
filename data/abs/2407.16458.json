We show that for\nevery $\\epsilon>0$, there exists a constant $C>0$ such that the following\nholds. Let $d\\ge C$ be an integer, let $G$ be a $d$-regular graph and let $p\\ge\n\\frac{C}{d}$. Then, with probability tending to one as $|V(G)|$ tends to\ninfinity, there exists a matching in $G_p$ covering at least\n$(1-\\epsilon)|V(G)|$ vertices.\n  We further show that for a wide family of $d$-regular graphs $G$, which\nincludes the $d$-dimensional hypercube, for any $p\\ge \\frac{\\log^5d}{d}$ with\nprobability tending to one as $d$ tends to infinity, $G_p$ contains an induced\nsubgraph on at least $(1-o(1))|V(G)|$ vertices, whose degrees are tightly\nconcentrated around the expected average degree $dp$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hkGEAEe7BwYSjKU1URvWHnW-o1uz_94b8x-Fyo5AAdQ","pdfSize":"147591"}
