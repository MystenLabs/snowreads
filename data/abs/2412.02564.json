  "abstract": "  We show that if $X$ is a smooth Fano manifold which caries a K\\\"ahler Ricci\nsoliton, then the canonical cone of the product of $X$ with a complex\nprojective space of sufficiently large dimension is a Calabi--Yau cone. This\ncan be seen as an asymptotic version of a conjecture by Mabuchi and Nikagawa.\nThis result is obtained by the openness of the set of weight functions $v$ over\nthe momentum polytope of a given smooth Fano manifold, for which a $v$-soliton\nexists. We discuss other ramifications of this approach, including a\nLicherowicz type obstruction to the existence of a K\\\"ahler Ricci soliton and a\nFujita type volume bound for the existence of a $v$-soliton.\n",
