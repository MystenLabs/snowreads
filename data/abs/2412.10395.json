Special cases of\nthese integrals in terms of fundamental constants are also evaluated. The\nmethod used in these derivations is contour integration.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lyMBibLjrS_qtx4YX8fvYqCSAuampN3izaVZgxSj42Q","pdfSize":"2309845"}
