Considering 17 chemical\nabundances relative to iron ([X/Fe]) for 9,923 stars, we employ Principal\nComponent Analysis (PCA) and Extreme Deconvolution (XD) to identify 10 distinct\nstellar groups. This approach, free from chemical or dynamical cuts, reveals\nknown populations, including the accreted halo, thick disc, thin disc, and\nin-situ halo. The thick disc is characterised by multiple substructures,\nsuggesting it comprises stars formed in diverse environments. Our findings\nhighlight the limited discriminatory power of magnesium in separating accreted\nand disc stars. Elements such as Ba, Al, Cu, and Sc are critical in\ndistinguishing disc from accreted stars, while Ba, Y, Eu and Zn differentiate\ndisc and accreted stars from the in-situ halo. This study demonstrates the\npotential power of combining a latent space representation of the data (PCA)\nwith a clustering algorithm (XD) in Galactic archaeology, in providing new\ninsights into the galaxy's assembly and evolutionary history.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MxLU_c2-_cwYv8XpZ-px7tzrUgp12FqwIgK0n0gDL6I","pdfSize":"2177380","objectId":"0xff787a7fe7d6ea4778261084c5f8c55d907c0003077afa3c7d9c0110ab5b69c0","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
