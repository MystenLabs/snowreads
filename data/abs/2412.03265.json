  "abstract": "  The evolution of nuclear shell structures at $N=32$ and 34 are studied in\nnuclei far from the stability line using effective interactions derived from\nrealistic nuclear forces. The state-of-the-art \\textit{ab initio} in-medium\nsimilarity renormalization group method is used for this purpose. The\ncalculated results are consistent with experimental observations, and\npredictions are made where experimental data are unavailable. The shell gaps\nare analyzed from the evolution of effective single-particle energies, and\nvarious facets of nuclear interaction, such as central, spin-orbit, and tensor\nparts, are addressed by spin-tensor decomposition of the effective\ninteractions. The roles played by these components in the development of shell\nclosure, particularly by the tensor components, were highlighted throughout the\nstudy. Then, we discussed the low-lying structure of the exotic $N=32$ isotones\nbelow Ca. The present work demonstrates essential components of nuclear force\nin shaping magic numbers far from stability and provides deeper insights into\nthe structure of exotic nuclei.\n",
