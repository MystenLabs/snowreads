For this model, we\nfirst prove the existence of a global-in-time weak solution by approximating\nthe singular potentials via a Yosida approximation, applying the corresponding\nresults for regular potentials, and eventually passing to the limit in this\napproximation scheme. Then, we prove the uniqueness of weak solutions and its\ncontinuous dependence on the velocity fields and the initial data. Afterwards,\nassuming additional regularity of the domain as well as the velocity fields, we\nestablish higher regularity properties of weak solutions and eventually the\nexistence of strong solutions. In the end, we discuss strict separation\nproperties for logarithmic type potentials in both two and three dimensions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bZ2sWedl3wyURT02EhZ1WCTXe5xtuT9X4CSyn1SrsYg","pdfSize":"574769"}
