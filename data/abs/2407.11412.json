Our proof does not rely on the theory of\nGriffiths positivity for the direct image sheaf.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gQQxw44knqK9uksWvXmLcnQ62VYr4wAOC2I4Usz1vSE","pdfSize":"299250"}
