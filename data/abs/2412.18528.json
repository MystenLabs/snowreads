These FSPT states may\ninvolve decoration layers of both Majorana chains and complex fermions. We\nderive general consistency formulas explicitly for (2+1)D and (3+1)D systems,\nwhere nontrivial twists arise from fermionic symmetric local unitaries or\n\"gauge transformations\" that ensure coboundaries vanish at the cochain level.\nAdditionally, we present explicit example for a (3+1)D FSPT with symmetry group\n$G_f=\\mathbb{Z}_2^f \\times \\mathbb{Z}_4 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_4$ with Majorana\nchain decorations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1OIOtHC-zw_QZxHhT4xPgYgDR0aa1Brkt_r5jgRqFvY","pdfSize":"909155"}
