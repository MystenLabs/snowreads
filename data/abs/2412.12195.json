  "abstract": "  We prove that the word problem in an Artin group G based on a diagram without\nA_3 or B_3 subdiagrams can be solved using a system of length preserving\nrewrite rules which, together with free reduction, can be used to reduce any\nword over the standard generators of G to a geodesic word in G in quadratic\ntime. This result builds on work of Holt and Rees, and of Blasco-Garc\\'ia,\nCumplido and Morris-Wright. Those articles prove the same result for all Artin\ngroups that are either sufficiently large or 3-free, respectively.\n",
