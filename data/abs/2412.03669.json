Effectively, the Coulomb field\nacts like a target of $\\gamma^*$ virtual photons, with target density\nproportional to $Z^2$. Primakoff was the first to describe how to determine the\n$\\pi^0$ lifetime by measuring the $\\gamma\\gamma^*\\to\\pi^0$ production cross\nsection. For the case that a high energy (190 GeV/c) pion beam is used,\nPrimakoff scattering, viewed in the rest frame of the pion, is effectively\nlow-energy soft scattering of $\\approx$ 250 MeV gamma rays from a pion at rest.\nTogether, low-energy soft scattering and high-energy hard scattering studies\nplay crucial complementary roles in testing the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)\nframework. OBJECTIVES: This article presents a short description of Primakoff's\nscientific career and personal life. It reviews Primakoff scattering studies of\npion polarizability and the chiral anomaly $\\gamma \\rightarrow \\pi \\pi \\pi$ at\nCERN COMPASS and the $\\pi^0$ lifetime study at Jefferson Laboratory (JLab). A\nreview of Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT) is presented. It serves as a\npedagogical introduction to Primakoff reactions. RESULTS: We discuss the good\nagreement of these studies with 2-flavor (u,d) ChPT predictions. CONCLUSIONS:\nWe discuss why Primakoff studies at CERN AMBER and JLab will be important for\nvalidating the theoretical framework of 3-flavor (u, d, s) ChPT. These include\nthe kaon polarizability, $\\gamma\\to\\pi\\pi\\eta$ and $\\gamma\\to KK\\pi$ chiral\nanomalies, kaonic hybrid states, and $\\pi^0$ and $\\eta$ lifetimes. DISCUSSION:\nBy comparing 3-flavor ChPT predictions with data for kaons, $\\pi^0$ and $\\eta$,\nit will be possible to assess how well the model captures the interplay of the\nadditional flavor and the effects of strange quarks.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7Fe2nUACdD19fef03sYTUFbCJOHLI4UXcKxj2HRnyE4","pdfSize":"836458"}
