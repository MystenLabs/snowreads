To this end, we study the non-equilibrium dynamics of\na particle moving in a tilted colored noise ratchet in two different\nsituations. In the first, the colored noise variable is reset to a specific\nvalue every time the particle transitions from one well to another in the\nratchet. Contrary to intuition, we find that the current magnitude decreases as\nthe correlation time of the noise increases, and increases monotonically with\nnoise strength. The average displacement of the particle is against the tilt,\nwhich implies that the particle performs work. We then consider a variation of\nthe same problem in which the colored noise process is allowed to evolve freely\nwithout any resetting at the transitions. Again, the average displacement is\nagainst the potential. However, the current magnitude increases with the\ncorrelation time, and there is an optimal noise strength that maximizes the\ncurrent magnitude. Finally, we provide quantitative arguments to explain these\nfindings and their relevance to active biological matter such as tissues.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pCr4D4_HgfhVPI6521uA8aHG4XnvgsdDtN3_zWMODYc","pdfSize":"1048770"}
