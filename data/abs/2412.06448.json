Initial polystyrene substrate and\nmicrospheres are transparent at the laser wavelength (800 nm). Peak intensity\nof the laser irradiation focusing by the microspheres reaches 1013 W/cm2,\nresulting in multiphoton absorption followed by ionization and further\ncarbonization processes. Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron\nmicroscopy analysis show that carbonization products contain carbon crystalline\nnanoobjects.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lnD5nYyzotT4PNTVLow8e9ptJ66-_MHV4AOkjA0Asug","pdfSize":"9362579"}
