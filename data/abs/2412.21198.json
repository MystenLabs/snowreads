  "abstract": "  Dynamic magnetic response in a trilayered structure with non-equivalent\nlayers (ABA type) has been studied with Monte Carlo simulation using Metropolis\nalgorithm. In each layer, ferromagnetic (FM) nearest neighbour Ising\ninteractions are present along with antiferromagnetic (AFM) nearest neighbour\ncoupling across different layers. The system is studied under a harmonically\noscillating external magnetic field. It is revealed that along with dynamic\nphase transition (DPT), compensation phenomenon emerges in this system under\ndynamic scenario too. This feature in dynamic case is unique for such\ntrilayered systems only, in contrast to the bulk system reported earlier. The\ntemporal behaviour of the magnetisation of each individual layer shows that\ndifferent magnetic response of the non-equivalent layers results into such\ndynamic compensation phenomenon. The difference in response also results into\nwarping of the dynamic hysteresis loops, under various external parameter\nvalues, such as amplitude of the oscillating field and temperature.\n",
