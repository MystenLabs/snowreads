In particular, if we have\na Fine interior of codimension $1$, then the hypersurface is of general type\nand the Newton polytope has lattice width $2$. In this article we study this\nsituation for lattice $3$-polytopes and the corresponding surfaces of general\ntype. In particular, we classify all $2$-dimensional Fine interiors of those\nlattice $3$-polytopes which have at most $40$ interior lattice points, thus\nobtaining many examples of surfaces of general type and genus at most $40$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"A-EOaDfZELyIPOcVWjXYWuGtPxH7msgOc_xJRhpV9lM","pdfSize":"284532"}
