This technical report presents the newly\nimplemented component on locality sensitive hashing, kernel density estimation,\nand fast spectral clustering. The report includes a user's guide to the newly\nimplemented algorithms, experiments and demonstrations of the new\nfunctionality, and several technical considerations behind our development.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Mathematical Software","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RbJ1j-c_N-ikeYaOCEjawboifGIz0pF0U8kq-1Ke-rk","pdfSize":"998144"}
