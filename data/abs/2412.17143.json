Given a logic\nprogram modelling a computational problem, an execution of DLV2 produces the\nso-called answer sets that correspond one-to-one to the solutions to the\nproblem at hand. The computational process of DLV2 relies on the typical Ground\n& Solve approach where the grounding step transforms the input program into a\nnew, equivalent ground program, and the subsequent solving step applies\npropositional algorithms to search for the answer sets. Recently, emerging\napplications in contexts such as stream reasoning and event processing created\na demand for multi-shot reasoning: here, the system is expected to be reactive\nwhile repeatedly executed over rapidly changing data. In this work, we present\na new incremental reasoner obtained from the evolution of DLV2 towards iterated\nreasoning. Rather than restarting the computation from scratch, the system\nremains alive across repeated shots, and it incrementally handles the internal\ngrounding process. At each shot, the system reuses previous computations for\nbuilding and maintaining a large, more general ground program, from which a\nsmaller yet equivalent portion is determined and used for computing answer\nsets. Notably, the incremental process is performed in a completely transparent\nfashion for the user. We describe the system, its usage, its applicability and\nperformance in some practically relevant domains.
