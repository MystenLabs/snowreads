  "abstract": "  This paper presents a simplified weak Galerkin (WG) finite element method for\nsolving biharmonic equations avoiding the use of traditional stabilizers. The\nproposed WG method supports both convex and non-convex polytopal elements in\nfinite element partitions, utilizing bubble functions as a critical analytical\ntool. The simplified WG method is symmetric and positive definite.\nOptimal-order error estimates are established for WG approximations in both the\ndiscrete $H^2$ norm and the $L^2$ norm.\n",
