  "abstract": "  This paper proposes a framework that has the ability to animate and generate\ndifferent scenarios for the mobility of a movable anchor which can follow\nvarious paths in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). When the researchers use NS-2\nto simulate a single anchor-assisted localization model, they face the problem\nof creating the movement file of the movable anchor. The proposed framework\nsolved this problem by allowing them to create the movement scenario regarding\ndifferent trajectories. The proposed framework lets the researcher set the\nneeded parameters for simulating various static path models, which can be\ndisplayed through the graphical user interface. The researcher can also view\nthe mobility of the movable anchor with control of its speed and communication\nrange. The proposed framework has been validated by comparing its results to\nNS-2 outputs plus comparing it against existing tools. Finally, this framework\nhas been published on the Code Project website and downloaded by many users.\n",
