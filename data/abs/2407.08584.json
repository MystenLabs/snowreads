Without prior knowledge of future job arrivals, we propose an\noptimal balanced task assignment algorithm (OBTA) that minimizes the completion\ntime of each arriving job. We significantly reduce OBTA's computational\noverhead by narrowing the search space of potential solutions. Additionally, we\nextend an approximate algorithm known as water-filling (WF) and nontrivially\nprove that its approximation factor equals the number of task groups in the job\nassignment. We also design a novel heuristic, replica-deletion (RD), which\noutperforms WF. To further reduce the completion time of each job, we expand\nthe problem to include job reordering, where we adjust the order of outstanding\njobs following the shortest-estimated-time-first policy. Extensive trace-driven\nevaluations validate the performance and efficiency of the proposed algorithms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"IX3vmzODPy6L-btmTzXZMjFZ3IXagHEqe9JsFeuIwiA","pdfSize":"3885453"}
