This paper proposes a solution to\nthe problem: Automated generation of massive reasonable empirical theorems by\nforward reasoning based on strong relevant logics. In fact, this can be\nregarded as a part of our approach to the problems of ATF (Automated Theorem\nFinding) and AKA (Automated Knowledge Appreciation).\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"tTLgZ5ONEImoxp2GTNnxIYIOLco4GGbX14j3kFcuLzQ","pdfSize":"1023391"}
