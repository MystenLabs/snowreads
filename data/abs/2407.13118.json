To address this, we introduce a novel approach utilizing Bayesian\nmodeling to analyze the dynamic development of functional modules in infants\nover time. This method retains inter-individual variability and, in comparison\nto conventional group averaging techniques, more effectively detects modules,\ntaking into account the stationarity of module evolution. Furthermore, we\nexplore gender differences in module development under awake and sleep\nconditions by assessing modular similarities. Our results show that female\ninfants demonstrate more distinct modular structures between these two\nconditions, possibly implying relative quiet and restful sleep compared with\nmale infants.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yx9psqGcrjWtfhbm96AKfSL9IzTtXPC3MuNAloRusXk","pdfSize":"6002170"}
