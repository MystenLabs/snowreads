The arguments relied on\nmulti-linear properties of linking number and certain other link invariants.\nHere we produce a very similar upper bound for all non-trivial links by a\nmore-general, entirely geometric, argument (but one which, unlike the original,\nhas no analog in higher dimensions). Shortly after the initial paper,\n[arXiv:2308.08064] proved lower bounds which broadly cover this wider class.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JWCMkCaj_JlenJAYWV41jqKUG6u9lrr0OXGiTxUt0z4","pdfSize":"75665"}
