Our study focuses on rigorous assessment of the\nmodel's performance and generalizability. Large-scale retrospective analysis\ndemonstrates an average AUC of 0.931 across 21 conditions. External validation\nacross two distinct health systems confirms consistent performance (AUC 0.923),\nestablishing generalizability to different evaluation scenarios, with notable\nperformance in critical findings such as small bowel obstruction (AUC 0.958)\nand acute pancreatitis (AUC 0.961). Subgroup analysis shows consistent accuracy\nacross patient sex, age groups, and varied imaging protocols, including\ndifferent slice thicknesses and contrast administration types. Comparison of\nhigh-confidence model outputs to radiologist reports reveals instances where\na2z-1 identified overlooked findings, suggesting potential for quality\nassurance applications.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"d3NyMfRzNVlU790rmFCp-6d0EEDeQPmQHQLAPfuF3iA","pdfSize":"5252542"}
