  "abstract": "  We study oscillons in a real scalar field theory in a (3+1)-dimensional AdS\nspace with global coordinates. The initial configuration is given by a Gaussian\nshape with an appropriate core size as in Minkowski spacetime. The solution\nexhibits a long lifetime. In particular, since the AdS space can be seen as a\nbox, the recurrence phenomenon can be observed under suitable conditions.\nFinally, we discuss some potential applications of the oscillon in the context\nof AdS/CFT duality.\n",
