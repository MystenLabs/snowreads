On the other hand, in mission critical\nsettings such as biomedical applications, other aspects also factor in-chief of\nwhich is a model's ability to produce reasonable estimates of its own\nuncertainty. In the present study, we discuss these two desiderata through the\nlens of how they shape the entropy of a model's output probability\ndistribution. We find that domain specificity and uncertainty awareness can\noften be successfully combined, but the exact task at hand weighs in much more\nstrongly.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kLMQQHy17SSa5Lptzp-EdD3VOfGimcFyEXQAkNaWO8w","pdfSize":"875435"}
