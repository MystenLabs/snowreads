  "abstract": "  We study the $k$-center problem in the context of individual fairness. Let\n$P$ be a set of $n$ points in a metric space and $r_x$ be the distance between\n$x \\in P$ and its $\\lceil n/k \\rceil$-th nearest neighbor. The problem asks to\noptimize the $k$-center objective under the constraint that, for every point\n$x$, there is a center within distance $r_x$. We give bicriteria\n$(\\beta,\\gamma)$-approximation algorithms that compute clusterings such that\nevery point $x \\in P$ has a center within distance $\\beta r_x$ and the\nclustering cost is at most $\\gamma$ times the optimal cost. Our main\ncontributions are a deterministic $O(n^2+ kn \\log n)$ time\n$(2,2)$-approximation algorithm and a randomized\n$O(nk\\log(n/\\delta)+k^2/\\varepsilon)$ time $(10,2+\\varepsilon)$-approximation\nalgorithm, where $\\delta$ denotes the failure probability. For the latter, we\ndevelop a randomized sampling procedure to compute constant factor\napproximations for the values $r_x$ for all $x\\in P$ in subquadratic time; we\nbelieve this procedure to be of independent interest within the context of\nindividual fairness.\n",
