  "abstract": "  The Harmonized Tariff System (HTS) classification industry, essential to\ne-commerce and international trade, currently lacks standardized benchmarks for\nevaluating the effectiveness of classification solutions. This study\nestablishes and tests a benchmark framework for imports to the United States,\ninspired by the benchmarking approaches used in language model evaluation, to\nsystematically compare prominent HTS classification tools. The framework\nassesses key metrics--such as speed, accuracy, rationality, and HTS code\nalignment--to provide a comprehensive performance comparison. The study\nevaluates several industry-leading solutions, including those provided by\nZonos, Tarifflo, Avalara, and WCO BACUDA, identifying each tool's strengths and\nlimitations. Results highlight areas for industry-wide improvement and\ninnovation, paving the way for more effective and standardized HTS\nclassification solutions across the international trade and e-commerce sectors.\n",
