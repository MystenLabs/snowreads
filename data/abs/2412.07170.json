Although Bayesian approaches are recognized for their finite-sample\nperformance and capability to circumvent issues such as the cold-start problem;\nhowever, rigorous proofs of their asymptotic properties, particularly in\nnon-i.i.d. structures, remain lacking. We derive conditions under which the\nposterior distributions of latent traits converge to the true values for a\nsequence of given items, and demonstrate that Bayesian estimators remain robust\nunder the mis-specification of the prior. Our analysis then extends to adaptive\nitem selection methods in which items are chosen endogenously during the test.\nAdditionally, we develop a Bayesian decision-theoretical framework for the item\nselection problem and propose a novel selection that aligns the test process\nwith optimal estimator performance. These theoretical results provide a\nfoundation for Bayesian methods in adaptive testing, complementing prior\nevidence of their finite-sample advantages.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"p4hhLvb_Q5PhR1PDDM1803ZnOKjC2TRqgBLkRlK_OEg","pdfSize":"715863"}
