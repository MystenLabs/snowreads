We show positivity\nof the transverse density of $\\Theta^{++}$ (analogous to the positivity of the\ntransverse density of the electromagnetic current $J^+$) and discuss its\nconsequences in conjunction with analyticity and quark-hadron duality, as well\nas the connection to $\\pi\\pi$ scattering at low energies. Our analysis takes\ninto account the perturbative QCD effects, dominating at high momenta (or low\ntransverse coordinate $b$), the effects of Chiral Perturbation Theory,\ndominating at low momenta (high $b$), and meson dominance in the intermediate\nregion. We incorporate constraints form analyticity, leading to sum rules for\nthe spectral densities of the corresponding form factors, which {\\em i.a.} are\nrelevant for the high-momentum (or the low-$b$) asymptotics. With the obtained\nhigh- and low-$b$ behavior, we deduce that the scalar (trace-anomaly)\ngravitational transverse density $\\Theta^{\\mu}_\\mu(b)$ must change sign, unlike\nthe case of the positive definite $J^+(b)$ or $\\Theta^{++}(b)$. We also discuss\nthe transverse pressure in the pion, which is positive and singular at low $b$,\nand negative at high $b$, in harmony with the stability criterion. The results\nfor the form factors for space-like momenta are compared to the recent lattice\nQCD data.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tR9tBSohFNqLu33cQrhU1QfWIAe1OFpaWzzir8g1m5A","pdfSize":"908683"}
