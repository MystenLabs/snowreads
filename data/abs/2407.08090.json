An undergraduate major in\nphysics typically takes a semester or a year of electromagnetic theory as a\njunior or senior, and a graduate student in physics typically takes an\nadditional semester or year at a more advanced level. In fall 2023, the author\ntaught his undergraduate electricity and magnetism class using numerical\nmethods in Haskell in parallel with traditional analytical methods. This\narticle describes what functional programming has to offer to physics in\ngeneral, and electromagnetic theory in particular. We give examples from vector\ncalculus, the mathematical language in which electromagnetic theory is\nexpressed, and electromagnetic theory itself.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2hurn2548zG0mhiVdiaUyR1ltMY7heOHWkbRcFHBL9I","pdfSize":"537810"}
