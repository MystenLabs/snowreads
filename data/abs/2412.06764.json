These scalar curvature\nfluctuations are inherently nonlinear and typically non-Gaussian. We argue that\nthe effects of non-Gaussianity may not always be adequately captured by an\nexpansion around a Gaussian field, expressed through nonlinear parameters such\nas $f_{\\rm{NL}}$. As a consequence, the resulting amplitude of the stochastic\ngravitational wave background may differ significantly from predictions based\non the standard quadratic source model routinely used in the literature.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SeQOjx1I0FWbbt1EWgGaDPyjT4e80DqS5Gh15b2HHps","pdfSize":"4030831"}
