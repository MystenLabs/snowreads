This is in the spirit of the pathwise control problem\n(Lions--Souganidis 1998, Buckdahn--Ma 2007; also Davis--Burstein 1992), with\nrenewed interest and recent works drawing motivation from filtering, SPDEs, and\nreinforcement learning. Results include regularity of rough value functions,\nvalidity of a rough dynamic programming principles and new rough stability\nresults for HJB equations, removing excessive regularity demands previously\nimposed by flow transformation methods. Measurable selection is used to relate\nRSDEs to \"doubly stochastic\" SDEs under conditioning. In contrast to previous\nworks, Brownian statistics for the to-be-conditioned-on noise are not required,\naligned with the \"pathwise\" intuition that these should not matter upon\nconditioning. Depending on the chosen class of admissible controls, the\ninvolved processes may also be anticipating. The resulting stochastic value\nfunctions coincide in great generality for different classes of controls. RSDE\ntheory offers a powerful and unified perspective on this problem class.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"k7S_YY50RwaZy2zozoPSnnlYOe1IGALTzgwq-ekfy6g","pdfSize":"483627"}
