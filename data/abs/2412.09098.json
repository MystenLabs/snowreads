  "abstract": "  Previous theoretical studies on superconductivity were focused on the static\nstates and adiabatic processes. Quantum mechanics simulations of time-dependent\nprocesses in superconductors were rarely performed previously. Here we use\nreal-time time-dependent density functional theory to show a new phenomenon\nthat the electron-phonon excitation is coherent and mode-selective, resulting\nin a periodic band oscillation. Surprisingly, the predicted oscillation\nfrequency of charges or bands here are strongly correlated with a broad range\nof superconductivity transition temperatures of various main families of\nsuperconductors, including cuprates, Fe-based, hydrides, and WTe2. This shed\nlight on the pairing mechanism in unconventional superconductors, paving the\nway for the design of higher temperature superconductors.\n",
