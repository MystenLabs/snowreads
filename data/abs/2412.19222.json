  "abstract": "  We perform extensive simulations of the two-dimensional cavity-coupled\nelectron gas in a modulating potential as a minimal model for cavity quantum\nmaterials. These simulations are enabled by a newly developed\nquantum-electrodynamical (QED) auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method. We\npresent a procedure to greatly reduce finite-size effects in such calculations.\nBased on our results, we show that a modified version of weak-coupling\nperturbation theory is remarkably accurate for a large parameter region. We\nfurther provide a simple parameterization of the light-matter correlation\nenergy as a functional of the cavity parameters and the electronic density.\nThese results provide a numerical foundation for the development of the QED\ndensity functional theory, which was previously reliant on analytical\napproximations, to allow quantitative modeling of a wide range of systems with\nlight-matter coupling.\n",
