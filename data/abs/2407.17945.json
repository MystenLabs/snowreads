{"id":"2407.17945","title":"A tight N/O-potential relation in star-forming galaxies","authors":"Nicholas Fraser Boardman, Vivienne Wild, Natalia Vale Asari","authorsParsed":[["Boardman","Nicholas Fraser",""],["Wild","Vivienne",""],["Asari","Natalia Vale",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2024 11:05:25 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-26","timestamp":1721905525000,"abstract":"  We report a significantly tighter trend between gaseous N/O and $M_*/R_e$ (a\nproxy for gravitational potential) than has previously been reported between\ngaseous metallicity and $M_*/R_e$, for star-forming galaxies in the MaNGA\nsurvey. We argue this result to be a consequence of deeper potential wells\nconferring greater resistance to metal outflows while also being associated\nwith earlier star-formation histories, combined with N/O being comparatively\nunaffected by metal-poor inflows. The potential-N/O relation thus appears to be\nboth more resistant to short-timescale baryonic processes and also more\nreflective of a galaxy's chemical evolution state, when compared to\npreviously-considered relations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cIl4cthcv6ZE81TFEdx0TM55VTTvb4s8oNSDQ503K9I","pdfSize":"3370263"}
