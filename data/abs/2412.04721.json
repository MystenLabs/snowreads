  "abstract": "  The Compton Spectrometer and Imager balloon payload (COSI-Balloon) is a\nwide-field-of-view Compton ${\\gamma}$-ray telescope that operates in the 0.2 -\n5 MeV bandpass. COSI-Balloon had a successful 46-day flight in 2016 during\nwhich the instrument observed the Crab Nebula, Cygnus X-1, and Centaurus A.\nUsing the data collected by the COSI-Balloon instrument during this flight, we\npresent the source flux extraction of signals from the variable balloon\nbackground environment and produce images of these background-dominated sources\nby performing Richardson-Lucy deconvolutions. We also present the spectra\nmeasured by the COSI-Balloon instrument, compare and combine them with\nmeasurements from other instruments, and fit the data. The Crab Nebula was\nobserved by COSI-Balloon and we obtain a measured flux in the energy band 325 -\n480 keV of (4.5 ${\\pm}$ 1.6) ${\\times}$ 10$^{-3}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The\nmodel that best fits the COSI-Balloon data combined with measurements from\nNuSTAR and Swift-BAT is a broken power law with a measured photon index\n${\\Gamma}$ = 2.20 ${\\pm}$ 0.02 above the 43 keV break. Cygnus X-1 was also\nobserved during this flight, and we obtain a measured flux of (1.4 ${\\pm}$ 0.2)\n${\\times}$ 10$^{-3}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the same energy band and a\nbest-fit result (including data from NuSTAR, Swift-BAT, and INTEGRAL/ IBIS) was\nto a cutoff power law with a high-energy cutoff energy of 138.3 ${\\pm}$ 1.0 keV\nand a photon index of ${\\Gamma}$ = 1.358 ${\\pm}$ 0.002. Lastly, we present the\nmeasured spectrum of Centaurus A and our best model fit to a power law with a\nphoton index of ${\\Gamma}$ = 1.73 ${\\pm}$ 0.01.\n",
