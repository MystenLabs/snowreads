This renders some algorithmic methods such as probabilistic\n  roadmaps less viable, as nodes and edges may become invalid as a result of\nthese\n  changes.\n  In this paper, we present a method of transforming any configuration\n  space graph, such as a roadmap, to a dynamic data structure capable of\nupdating\n  the validity of its nodes and edges in response to discrete changes in\nobstacle positions.\n  We use methods from computational geometry to compute 3D swept volume\n  approximations of configuration space points and curves to achieve 10-40\n  percent faster updates and up to 60 percent faster motion planning queries\nthan previous algorithms while requiring a\n  significantly shorter pre-processing phase, requiring minutes instead of\n  hours needed by the competing method to achieve somewhat similar update\ntimes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TurEUgx8y8PNGLW9MsvdKZWFgYvce1QqhDa57kZvik4","pdfSize":"4620978"}
