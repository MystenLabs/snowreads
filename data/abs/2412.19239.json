  "abstract": "  For arbitrary nontrivial linear combinations of a finite number of Poisson\nkernels, the fulfillment of the Nagy condition is established for all numbers\nn, starting from some number. It is also proved for any n the existence of\nlinear combinations of m Bernoulli kernels and linear combinations of m\nconjugate Poisson kernels that satisfy the Nikolsky condition and at the same\ntime do not satisfy the Nagy condition.\n",
