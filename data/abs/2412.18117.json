  "abstract": "  We consider the stochastic six-vertex (S6V) model and asymmetric simple\nexclusion process (ASEP) under general initial conditions which are bounded\nbelow lines of arbitrary slope at $\\pm\\infty$. We show under\nKardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) scaling of time, space, and fluctuations that the\nheight functions of these models converge to the KPZ fixed point. Previously,\nour results were known in the case of ASEP (for a particular direction in the\nrarefaction fan) via a comparison approach arXiv:2008.06584.\n",
