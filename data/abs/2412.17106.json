The derived expressions allow for the\ninclusion of arbitrary temperature profiles, enabling detailed calculations of\nradiative energy loss across various evolution scenarios. This advancement is\ncrucial for utilizing high-$p_\\perp$ observables to constrain QGP properties\nthrough precision QGP tomography.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qV5vV_aCih2jZial2Fmtps24Ge4ix52AJOqMx7S7J3w","pdfSize":"1282783"}
