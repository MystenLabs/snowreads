  "abstract": "  Cosmography has been extensively utilized to constrain the kinematic state of\nthe Universe using measured distances. In this work, we propose a new method to\nreconstruct coupling theories using the first kind of Chebyshev polynomial for\ntwo variables in which the functional form of the $f(Q,T)$ theory has been\nobtained. Further, the unknowns that appeared in the series are constrained\nusing the cosmographic parameters. We find the explicit form of the luminosity\ndistance in terms of cosmographic parameters to perform MCMC analysis using the\nPANTHEON+SH0ES data set. Through the distance modulus function, we observe that\nthe result comes out to be an excellent match to the standard cosmological\nmodel and data.\n",
