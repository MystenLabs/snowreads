Moreover, the\nnoise level in these samples approximates their distance to the underlying\nmanifold. Building on this insight, we propose a novel method to enhance sample\ngeneration by aligning the estimated noise level with the true distance of\nnoisy samples to the manifold. Specifically, we introduce a noise level\ncorrection network, leveraging a pre-trained denoising network, to refine noise\nlevel estimates during the denoising process. Additionally, we extend this\napproach to various image restoration tasks by integrating task-specific\nconstraints, including inpainting, deblurring, super-resolution, colorization,\nand compressed sensing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method\nsignificantly improves sample quality in both unconstrained and constrained\ngeneration scenarios. Notably, the proposed noise level correction framework is\ncompatible with existing denoising schedulers (e.g., DDIM), offering additional\nperformance improvements.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"NvwMYwvlIJgugDthkl_AGrO12hNdbE7q61ZfSfHTYmU","pdfSize":"45120314"}
