First we present an\nalternative, arguably simpler, derivation of the gray hole conjecture, applying\nuniformly to all probes of the firewall probability previously discussed. This\nderivation is based on the wormhole shortening picture using the handle-disk\ngeometry. However we modifies Saad's story utilizing a \"Wilsonian\" effective\ngravitational description, adapted to the time scale probed, in which high\nfrequency modes are integrated out generating the gravitational bulk geometries\n(dual to the genus expansion in the matrix integral side) whereas low frequency\nmodes are more precisely resolved by being represented as eigenvalue D-branes\nwhere JT universes can end. This treatment results in an effective \"twist\nfactor cutoff\" prescription which simplifies the discussion of long time\nquantities including the firewall probability. In the second part we discuss\neffects of matter loops on the firewall probability. While such effects lead to\nnew firewall sources, we argue that these matter loop contributions are\nsub-dominant at late times.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"v0fcEItKCNdVcjOAzYQxL8EdjUTPXhF1_wqPFNUeR0U","pdfSize":"2155681"}
