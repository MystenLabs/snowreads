  "abstract": "  Landmark-guided character animation generation is an important field.\nGenerating character animations with facial features consistent with a\nreference image remains a significant challenge in conditional video\ngeneration, especially involving complex motions like dancing. Existing methods\noften fail to maintain facial feature consistency due to mismatches between the\nfacial landmarks extracted from source videos and the target facial features in\nthe reference image. To address this problem, we propose a facial landmark\ntransformation method based on the 3D Morphable Model (3DMM). We obtain\ntransformed landmarks that align with the target facial features by\nreconstructing 3D faces from the source landmarks and adjusting the 3DMM\nparameters to match the reference image. Our method improves the facial\nconsistency between the generated videos and the reference images, effectively\nimproving the facial feature mismatch problem.\n",
