Despite the development of many acceleration techniques, the\ncomputational overhead of incorporating NQEs in complex systems is sizable,\nparticularly at low temperatures. In this work, we leverage deep learning and\nmultiscale coarse-graining techniques to mitigate the computational burden of\npath integral molecular dynamics (PIMD). Specifically, we employ a\nmachine-learned potential to accurately represent corrections to classical\npotentials, thereby significantly reducing the computational cost of simulating\nNQEs. We validate our approach using four distinct systems: Morse potential,\nZundel cation, single water molecule, and bulk water. Our framework allows us\nto accurately compute position-dependent static properties, as demonstrated by\nthe excellent agreement obtained between the machine-learned potential and\ncomputationally intensive PIMD calculations, even in the presence of strong\nNQEs. This approach opens the way to the development of transferable\nmachine-learned potentials capable of accurately reproducing NQEs in a wide\nrange of molecular systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CsZQB8PCfvDZRE0Lg5EFMeCL_ubkcCmx9e7b1mqS4Mc","pdfSize":"1408273"}
