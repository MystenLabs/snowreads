We show that the underlying idea of implicit polynomial filtering can\nbe utilized in much the same manner via the implicitly shifted LR iteration to\ncreate a restart procedure for the non-symmetric Lanczos algorithm for\neigenvalue computations, which preserves the tri-diagonal structure of the\nreduced matrix.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BpAnrf75QiIn6kDQJH9wE7o_bVCeUal1cNzheAdpjmY","pdfSize":"163259"}
