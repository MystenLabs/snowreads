  "abstract": "  Copula-based dependence modelling often relies on parametric formulations.\nThis is mathematically convenient but can be statistically inefficient if the\nparametric families are not suitable for the data and model in focus. To\nimprove the flexibility in modeling dependence, we consider a Bayesian\nnonparametric mixture model of Archimedean copulas which can capture complex\ndependence patterns and can be extended to arbitrary dimensions. In particular\nwe use the Poisson-Dirichlet process as mixing distribution over the single\nparameter of the Archimedean copulas. Properties of the mixture model are\nstudied for the main Archimedenan families and posterior distributions are\nsampled via their full conditional distributions. Performance of the model is\nvia numerical experiments involving simulated and real data.\n",
