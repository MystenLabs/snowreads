The compositional variation of the average total\nmoment for thin-film bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ alloys is in stark contrast to the\nhistorical measurements of bulk fcc Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$. These GGA calculations\nreveal that significant improvements of this ferromagnetic forced bct phase on\nMgO(001) are possible via substrate selection. For example, bct\nCo$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ films on MgO(001) are calculated to have lower atomic moments\nthan those on substrates with smaller lattice constants such as GaAs(001),\nBaTiO$_3$(110), and SrTiO$_3$(110) which is predicted to increase the average\natomic moment up to $2.61$ $\\mu_\\text{B}/\\text{atom}$ and lead to increased\nstructural stability and therefore thicker film growths leading to higher TMR\neffects and better MTJ devices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Z04_ZkklSd470-S3ven9GVuubUgT-AmoWbvvACSfaY0","pdfSize":"860698"}
