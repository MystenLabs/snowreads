We then derive finite difference\napproximations for derivatives on variable meshes in both one-dimensional and\nmulti-dimensional cases, and discuss constraints on the weight function. To\ndemonstrate efficacy, we apply the method to the two-dimensional\ntime-independent Schr\\\"odinger equation for a harmonic oscillator, achieving\nimproved eigenfunction resolution without increased computational cost.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zhzZjeTtEsRm1d0acDkvpR__m3qJETqBL-7S6XsXpxE","pdfSize":"132947"}
