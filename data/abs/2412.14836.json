  "abstract": "  Many natural computational problems, including e.g. Max Weight Independent\nSet, Feedback Vertex Set, or Vertex Planarization, can be unified under an\numbrella of finding the largest sparse induced subgraph, that satisfies some\nproperty definable in CMSO$_2$ logic.\n  It is believed that each problem expressible with this formalism can be\nsolved in polynomial time in graphs that exclude a fixed path as an induced\nsubgraph.\n  This belief is supported by the existence of a quasipolynomial-time algorithm\nby Gartland, Lokshtanov, Pilipczuk, Pilipczuk, and Rz\\k{a}\\.zewski [STOC 2021],\nand a recent polynomial-time algorithm for $P_6$-free graphs by Chudnovsky,\nMcCarty, Pilipczuk, Pilipczuk, and Rz\\k{a}\\.zewski [SODA 2024].\n  In this work we extend polynomial-time tractability of all such problems to\n$P_7$-free graphs of bounded clique number.\n",
