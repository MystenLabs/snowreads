  "abstract": "  In this research, we apply the observer approach introduced by Djennoune et\nal. \\cite{djennoune2019modulating} to estimate water levels in a coupled tanks\nsystem. Central to this approach is the use of a remarkable modulating\nfunction-based transformation $T_n $, which employs a time/output-dependent\ncoordinate transformation. This transformation converts the original system\ninto a form where the effects of initial conditions are effectively nullified.\nThe primary advantage of utilizing the $T_n $ transformation is its ability to\nachieve instantaneous convergence, ensuring both rapid and accurate state\nestimation. The observer's finite-time convergence is assured, with the\nestimation error remaining bounded within a finite period. Numerical\nsimulations further validate the effectiveness of this method for the Coupled\nTanks system, demonstrating the robustness of the $T_n $ transformation in\npractical applications.\n",
