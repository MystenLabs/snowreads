At present, VFCs include powerful computing resources that bring the\ncomputational resources nearer to the requesting devices. This paper presents a\nnew algorithm based on meta-heuristic optimization method for task scheduling\nproblem in VFC. The task scheduling in VFC is formulated as a multi-objective\noptimization problem, which aims to reduce makespan and monetary cost. The\nproposed method utilizes the grey wolf optimization (GWO) and assigns the\ndifferent priorities to static and dynamic fog nodes. Dynamic fog nodes\nrepresent the parked or moving vehicles and static fog nodes show the\nstationary servers. Afterwards, the tasks that require the most processing\nresources are chosen and allocated to fog nodes. The GWO-based method is\nextensively evaluated in more details. Furthermore, the effectiveness of\nvarious parameters in GWO algorithm is analyzed. We also assess the proposed\nalgorithm on real application and random data. The outcomes of our experiments\nconfirm that, in comparison to previous works, our algorithm is capable of\noffering the lowest monetary cost.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vsO9EBMGDRVyrvQeT_wUvceFT8JnzqOk1VNv3QOgdhk","pdfSize":"1004157"}
