Phys. J. C 80 (2020) no.11, 1029] and\nits parameters determined from the combined HERA data. This model features an\nanalytical solution for the non-linear Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) evolution\nequation and the exponential behavior of the saturation momentum on the impact\nparameter $b$-dependence, characterized by $Q_s\\propto \\exp(-mb)$. We compare\nour results with experimental data at small-$x$, including the proton structure\nfunction $F_2$, charm structure function $F_2^{c\\bar{c}}$, and exclusive vector\nmeson production. The model shows good agreement across a wide kinematic range.\nOur findings support using this approach for reliable predictions in upcoming\nexperiments like the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) and the LHeC.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pbDdgmjs2lNPFKUZKJIKIOkDlp4aW_79Lg1lvvFdeRU","pdfSize":"736674"}
