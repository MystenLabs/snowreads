This\nanalysis aims to discern the magnetic field structure and its temporal\nevolution. The quasar 3C 273 is one of the most studied active galactic nuclei\ndue to its high brightness, strong polarization, and proximity, which enables\nresolving the transverse structure of its jet in detail. We used polarized data\nfrom 2014, collected at six frequencies (5, 8, 15, 22, 43, 86 GHz) with the\nVery Long Baseline Array, to produce total and linear polarization intensity\nimages, as well as RM maps. Our analysis reveals a well-defined transverse RM\ngradient across the jet, indicating a helical, ordered magnetic field that\nthreads the jet and likely contributes to its collimation. Furthermore, we\nidentified temporal variations in the RM magnitude when compared with prior\nobservations. These temporal variations show that the environment around the\njet is dynamic, with changes in the density and magnetic field strength of the\nsheath that are possibly caused by interactions with the surrounding medium.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ckmPmhbSPUMVE4K22Ku3Au5jbcDinn0NZS-3sp7gzY8","pdfSize":"3305498"}
