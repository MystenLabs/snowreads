These discoveries are providing strong constraints on\nthe seeding of BHs and the nature of the first objects in the Universe. Here,\nwe study the impact of the freeze-out electron fractions ($f_e$) at the end of\nthe epoch of cosmic recombination on the formation of the first structures in\nthe Universe. At $f_e$ below the current fiducial cosmic values of $\\rm \\sim\n10^{-4}$, the baryonic collapse is delayed due to the lack of molecular\nhydrogen cooling until the host halo masses are increased by one to two orders\nof magnitude compared to the standard case and reach the atomic cooling limit.\nThis results in an enhanced enclosed gas mass by more than an order of\nmagnitude and higher inflow rates of up to $0.1~M_{\\odot}/{yr}$. Such\nconditions are conducive to the formation of massive seed BHs with $\\sim\n10^{4}$ M$_{\\odot}$. Our results reveal a new pathway for the formation of\nmassive BH seeds which may naturally arise from free\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vObbG7mjDGfrKjHBaod5rOIxvTchyTUSCck8jjPBCh8","pdfSize":"412398"}
