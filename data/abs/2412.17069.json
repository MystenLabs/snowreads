Effective\ndata curation and sample selection are crucial for optimizing the training\nprocess of deep neural networks. This paper introduces SALN, a method designed\nto prioritize and select samples within each batch rather than from the entire\ndataset. By utilizing jointly selected batches, SALN enhances training\nefficiency compared to independent batch selection. The proposed method applies\na spectral analysis-based heuristic to identify the most informative data\npoints within each batch, improving both training speed and accuracy. The SALN\nalgorithm significantly reduces training time and enhances accuracy when\ncompared to traditional batch prioritization or standard training procedures.\nIt demonstrates up to an 8x reduction in training time and up to a 5\\% increase\nin accuracy over standard training methods. Moreover, SALN achieves better\nperformance and shorter training times compared to Google's JEST method\ndeveloped by DeepMind.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"gdN-tH-gaa_Kbrgw_2WPFIBOziUjgpRiYqtPz3B8WAs","pdfSize":"744538"}
