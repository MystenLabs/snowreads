On the other hand, within the group-theoretic setting,\n$\\text{AdS}^{4|4{\\cal N}} $ is realised as the coset superspace\n$\\mathsf{OSp}({\\cal N}|4;\\mathbb{R}) /\\big[ \\mathsf{SL}(2, \\mathbb{C}) \\times\n\\mathsf{O}({\\cal N}) \\big]$, with its structure group being $\\mathsf{SL}(2,\n\\mathbb{C}) \\times \\mathsf{O}({\\cal N})$. Here we explain how the two\nframeworks are related. We give two explicit realisations of\n$\\text{AdS}^{4|4{\\cal N}} $ as a conformally flat superspace, thus extending\nthe ${\\cal N}=1$ and ${\\cal N}=2$ results available in the literature. As\napplications, we describe: (i) a two-parameter deformation of the\n$\\text{AdS}^{4|4{\\cal N}} $ interval and the corresponding superparticle model;\n(ii) some implications of conformal flatness for superconformal higher-spin\nmultiplets and an effective action generating the $\\mathcal{N}=2$ super-Weyl\nanomaly; and (iii) $\\kappa$-symmetry of the massless AdS superparticle.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"ZcXY2HWgyuNYekZ5k4v9ODVN7PHiqkonZKwIA7Bn-c0","pdfSize":"418826"}
