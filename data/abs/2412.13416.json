  "abstract": "  Establishing reliable quantum links between a network of satellites and\nground stations is a crucial step towards realizing a wide range of\nsatellite-based quantum protocols, including global quantum networks,\ndistributed sensing, quantum key distribution, and quantum clock\nsynchronization. In this article, we envision a network of satellites and\nground stations where quantum links are created through the exchange of\nentangled photon pairs. We simulate the dynamics of a satellite constellation\nand a set of Bell tests between the constellation and ground stations. We\nidentify the regions on Earth where Bell tests can be successfully conducted\nwith a satellite or a set of them, at a specified level of confidence. These\nregions move with the constellation and will be referred to as \"Bell violation\nshadows\". We demonstrate that these shadows provide valuable insights for the\nstudy and evaluation of many satellite-mediated or satellite-assisted quantum\nprotocols.\n",
