Here we give a brief account of this work\nwhich started with [1] where the complete spectrum of irreducible isometry\nrepresentations of the fields in $AdS_4$ was derived for the squashed $S^7$\ncompactification. The operator spectra determine the mass spectrum of the\nfields in $AdS_4$ and are important for the corresponding $\\mathcal{N} =1$\nsupermultiplet structure which appears in two versions depending on the choice\nof boundary conditions. By an orientation-flip on the squashed $S^7$ we can\nalso determine the spectrum of the corresponding non-supersymmetric theory,\nand, e.g., its spectrum of marginal operators on the boundary of $AdS_4$ which\nmay have some relevance for the $AdS$ stability conjecture in the swampland\nprogram. The role of singletons is discussed and a possible new Higgsing\nphenomenon turning them into bulk fields is suggested. Details are here given\nprimarily for 2-forms and comments are made on the key role of $G_2$ and\noctonions for the structure of the operator equations and mode functions on the\nsquashed $S^7$. Some important features of these improved methods were obtained\nin Joel Karlsson's 2021 MSc thesis [5].
