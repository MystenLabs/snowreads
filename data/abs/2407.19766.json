However, the fragility of NHSE has been\nrevealed recently, such as the boundary sensitivity, and it stimulates a lot of\nstudies on discussing the fate of that. Here we present a theorem which shows\nthat the combined spatial reflection symmetry can be considered as a criterion\nin one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems to determine whether the NHSE can\nexist or not. Distinct from previous studies, our proposed criterion only\nrelies on analyzing the symmetry of the system, freeing out other requirements,\nsuch as the information of the energy spectrum. Furthermore, by taking the\nnon-Hermitian Kitaev chain as an example, we verify our theorem through both a\nmathematical proof via the non-Bloch band theory and the exact diagonalization\nnumerical studies. Our results reveal a profound connection between the\nsymmetry and the fate of NHSE.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pGuR8VnVcrOGVaDj9_4LW6-v3yuskOH_BvnBAkPKOmQ","pdfSize":"971947"}
