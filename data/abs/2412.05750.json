  "abstract": "  We propose a \"Coprime Buratti-Horak-Rosa (BHR) Conjecture\": If $L$ is a\nmultiset of size $v-1$ with support contained in $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, \\lfloor v/2\n\\rfloor\\}$ such that $\\gcd(v,x) = 1$ for all $x \\in L$, then $L$ is realizable.\nThis is a specialization of the well-known BHR Conjecture and it includes\nBuratti's original conjecture.\n  We argue that the most effective route to a resolution of the conjecture when\nthe support has size 3 is to focus on $L = \\{1^a, x^b, y^c\\}$, where $1<x<y$,\nwith $a$ large subject to $a < x+y$. We use grid-based graphs to construct\nlinear realizations for many such multisets. A partial list of parameter sets\nthat the constructions cover: $a = x+y-1$; $a = x+y-2$ when $x=3$ or $x$ is\neven; $a \\geq 4x-3$ for $x$ odd, $y > 2x-2$, and $b \\geq y-2x+2$; $a \\geq x$\nfor $y=tx$, with $x$ and $t$ odd, and $b \\geq tx+2t-3$; $a \\geq 7$ for $x=3$\nand $b \\geq y-4$. As well as these (and further) immediate results, the\ntechniques introduced show promise for further development, both to head\ntowards a proof of the conjecture when the support has size 3 and for\nsituations with larger support.\n  We also show that if $y > (2x^2 + 2x + 1)/(x-2)$ then the Coprime BHR\nConjecture holds for $\\{1^a,x^b,y^c\\}$ for infinitely many values of $v$, and\nthat there are at most 3 values of $v$ for which it does not hold when $(x,y) =\n(6,18)$.\n",
