The number of generic strata is\ndetermined, and a complete parametrization of these strata is given in terms of\na modulus formed by a combinatorial and an analytic part. The bifurcation\ndiagram is described for the degree 4. A realization theorem is proved for any\ngeneric modulus.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0HpdXTxACpwtkN8v9GLF5JuTVf6AxBGknuWlVVq4gZE","pdfSize":"4521697"}
