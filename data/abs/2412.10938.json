  "abstract": "  Integral representations of two $q$-difference operators are provided in\nterms of special functions arising in the theory of asymptotic solutions to\n$q$-difference equations in the complex domain. Both representations are\nunified through the so-called $(p,q)$-differential operator, for which a\nkernel-like function is provided, generating the sequence of\n$(p,q)$-factorials.\n",
