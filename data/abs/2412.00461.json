However, van der Waals\nstacking of two-dimensional (2D) gallenene under confinement remain poorly\nunderstood. In this study, we present evidence of the formation of\nparallel-stacked hexagonal gallenene (a100) structures in liquid gallium. The\npresent study demonstrates the AB stacking of 2D gallenene a100 crystals in\nliquid gallium sandwiched between two graphene layers, as observed through\ntransmission electron microscopy. A nonlinear optical response of the confined\nhexagonal gallenene was investigated through second harmonic generation (SHG)\nmicroscopy. The SHG signal exhibits periodic peak intensity shifts upon angular\nrotation up to 90 degrees and intensity dampening at elevated temperatures.\nThese findings offer insights on device applications of 2D gallenene.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZswJM5HyfwGTKccsOwwV4ZZSypSEy1LEKAWHP3xv-sc","pdfSize":"3077235"}
