  "abstract": "  Since 2022, the LHCb detector has been taking both proton-proton and lead-ion\ndata at the LHC collision rate using a fully software-based trigger. This has\nbeen implemented on GPUs at its first stage and CPUs at its second. The setup\nallows for reconstruction, alignment, calibration and selections to be\nperformed online -- known as the real time analysis paradigm. As well as this,\nphysics analyses are performed using the output of online reconstruction with\nearly results shown using data taken in 2022.\n",
