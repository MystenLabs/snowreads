In this model, the Brinkman equation is employed for\nfluid flow in the porous medium, incorporating inertial effects into the fluid\ndynamics. A generalized poromechanical framework is used, incorporating fluid\ninertial effects in accordance with thermodynamic principles. We carry out the\nanalysis of the unique solvability of the governing equations, and the\nexistence proof relies on an auxiliary multi-valued parabolic problem. We\npropose a Lagrange multiplier-based mixed finite element method for its\nnumerical approximation and show the well-posedness of both semi-and\nfully-discrete problems. Then, a priori error estimates for both the semi- and\nfully-discrete schemes are derived. A series of numerical experiments is\npresented to confirm the theoretical convergence rates, and we also employ the\nproposed monolithic scheme to simulate 2D physical phenomena in geophysical\nfluids and biomechanics of the brain function.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_FXRHoUi8v7Ys10_yx2QkUJLYK1pBgpl50munlcl5zo","pdfSize":"7165383"}
