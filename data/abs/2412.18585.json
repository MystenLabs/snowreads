  "abstract": "  In 1987, Albert Schwarz suggested a formula which extends the super Mumford\nform from the moduli space of super Riemann surfaces into the super Sato\nGrassmannian. His formula is a remarkably simple combination of super tau\nfunctions. We compute the Neveu-Schwarz action on super tau functions, and show\nthat Schwarz's extended Mumford form is invariant under the the super\nHeisenberg-Neveu-Schwarz action, which strengthens Schwarz's proposal that a\nlocus within the Grassmannian can serve as a universal moduli space with\napplications to superstring theory. Along the way, we construct the\nNeveu-Schwarz, super Witt, and super Heisenberg formal groups.\n",
