It is part of one of the global\nintegration processes between European countries and Russia, which began in\n1999. It causes a lot of controversy and approval from different sides. For the\nsake of clarity, an assessment is being made of the industrial application of\nthe Dublin Descriptors. The assessment is based on the method of integral\nindicators. To use the method, the enterprise is formalized as a model of\nevents at each moment in time. Each event in the enterprise is tied to the\nstudent's skill. Accordingly, students' skills are grouped by educational\nlevel. Education levels are given as Dublin descriptors. The chosen approach\nmakes it possible to determine the correlation between levels of education and\nskills. It makes it possible to analyze meaningful interconnection. A universal\nassessment of the use of Dublin descriptors in the enterprise allows the\nformation of up-to-date lists of employees for higher education, professional\ndevelopment and training.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"00ck0MPmxfcbktsx4iy6FRc6mys5D4GSHQyIAO7Yz4c","pdfSize":"154918"}
