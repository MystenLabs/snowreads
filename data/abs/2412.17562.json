This\nstudy addresses the challenges of Roman Urdu -- a Latin-script adaptation of\nUrdu widely used in digital communication -- by creating a novel parallel\ndataset comprising 75,146 sentence pairs. Roman Urdu's lack of standardization,\nphonetic variability, and code-switching with English complicates language\nprocessing. We tackled this by employing a hybrid approach that combines\nsynthetic data generated via advanced prompt engineering with real-world\nconversational data from personal messaging groups. We further refined the\ndataset through a human evaluation phase, addressing linguistic inconsistencies\nand ensuring accuracy in code-switching, phonetic representations, and synonym\nvariability. The resulting dataset captures Roman Urdu's diverse linguistic\nfeatures and serves as a critical resource for machine translation, sentiment\nanalysis, and multilingual education.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"atuVjrnv_KP09peezMid9fJvzUoERv1Fb5PFCkIp72s","pdfSize":"382849"}
