Traditional work on data provenance was, to a large extent,\nrestricted to positive query languages or the negation-free fragment of\nfirst-order logic and showed how provenance abstractions can be usefully\ndescribed as elements of commutative semirings -- most generally as\nmultivariate polynomials with positive integer coefficients. We describe and\nevaluate here a provenance approach for dealing with negation, based on\nquotient semirings of polynomials with dual indeterminates. This not only\nprovides a semiring provenance analysis for full first-order logic (and other\nlogics and query languages with negation) but also permits a reverse provenance\nanalysis, i.e., finding models that satisfy various properties under given\nprovenance tracking assumptions. We describe the potential for applications to\nexplaining missing query answers or failures of integrity constraints, and to\nusing these explanations for computing repairs. This approach also is the basis\nof a systematic study of semiring semantics in a broad logical context.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Logic in Computer Science","Computer Science/Databases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"7SXYrc738hbY9RTNekIFmvmUBTXs3m1dCSno_zcjCz4","pdfSize":"460778"}
