We also present a\ntransformation that reduces the task of checking strong equivalence to\nreasoning in classical First-Order logic, which serves as a foundation for\nautomating this procedure.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cZQOhNWuQ95HXTWgpr1v4GR0EOQMZ1bZK92N9Km1m00","pdfSize":"283199"}
