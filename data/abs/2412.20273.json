As floating-point numbers are\nfrequently employed to represent integral values, with certain applications\nexplicitly relying on this capability, it is pertinent to evaluate how\neffectively these new formats fulfil this function compared to the standard\nthey seek to replace. While empirical results are known for posits, this aspect\nhas yet to be formally investigated.\n  This paper provides rigorous derivations and proofs of the integral\nrepresentation capabilities of posits and takums, examining both the exact\nnumber of bits required to represent a given integer and the largest\nconsecutive integer that can be represented with a specified number of bits.\nThe findings indicate that, while posits are generally less effective than IEEE\n754 floating-point numbers in this regard, takums demonstrate overall superior\nrepresentational strength compared to both IEEE 754 and posits.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Discrete Mathematics","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_c8Czx13YZQUGicylYHnQ39QgD3K_7ugH75_cmxg2SQ","pdfSize":"222831"}
