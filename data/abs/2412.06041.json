Proper orthogonal decomposition\n(POD) with Galerkin projection (GP) has shown to offer high accuracy and\nmassive runtime improvements over direct numerical simulation (DNS). However,\nprevious implementations of POD-GP use MPI-based libraries like PETSc and\nFEniCS and face significant runtime bottlenecks. We propose a\n$\\textbf{Py}$Torch-based $\\textbf{POD-GP}$ library (PyPOD-GP), a GPU-optimized\nlibrary for chip-level thermal simulation. PyPOD-GP achieves over $23.4\\times$\nspeedup in training and over $10\\times$ speedup in inference on a GPU with over\n13,000 cores, with just $1.2\\%$ error over the device layer.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"2eJQdN94Hi2d7FEuQxiUBkhVkDmr6_PEs74ZiDqepDY","pdfSize":"1973347"}
