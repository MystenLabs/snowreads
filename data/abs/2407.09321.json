As applications, we\nrecover its transition density and study its long-time asymptotic behaviors. We\nalso compare with previous results on transition densities for skew Brownian\nmotions. We propose two approaches for generating quasi-random samples by\napproximating the cumulative distribution function and discussing their risk\nmeasurement application.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Quantitative Finance/Risk Management"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NeKh1HYlRP0fngTOGLAarWMfF6EXmvOvYpatNN_WTFs","pdfSize":"808870","objectId":"0x02be05a0bcb54b236a521a218bc3c98658cf3fe428652108573f57b9cbba0c9d","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
