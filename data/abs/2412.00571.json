Music, an art form and medium for entertainment, deeply rooted\ninto human culture, is seeing an increased involvement of AI into its\nproduction. However, despite the effective application of AI music generation\n(AIGM) tools, the unregulated use of them raises concerns about potential\nnegative impacts on the music industry, copyright and artistic integrity,\nunderscoring the importance of effective AIGM detection. This paper provides an\noverview of existing AIGM detection methods. To lay a foundation to the general\nworkings and challenges of AIGM detection, we first review general principles\nof AIGM, including recent advancements in deepfake audios, as well as\nmultimodal detection techniques. We further propose a potential pathway for\nleveraging foundation models from audio deepfake detection to AIGM detection.\nAdditionally, we discuss implications of these tools and propose directions for\nfuture research to address ongoing challenges in the field.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zXEES-e6H9aFJ1vdSWNS3abjLdun-5UVgo30E3d4Ro4","pdfSize":"946543"}
