We derive constraints on the\nmass of planet b and c (<20M$_\\oplus$ at 3$\\sigma$ confidence level and\n$17_{-6}^{+13} M_{\\oplus}$ respectively) and atmospheric metallicity\n(logZ/Z$_\\odot$=-2.04$_{-0.59}^{0.69}$, -0.16$_{-0.94}^{1.15}$ respectively)\nfrom atmospheric retrievals. The V1298 Tau planets, are likely to be similar in\nterms of mass at the current age, implying that both planets are potential\nsub-Neptune/super-Earth progenitors. However, planet c is expected to lose a\nhigher fraction of its mass compared to planet b given its close proximity to\nthe host star. Alternatively, the observed spectrum of planet c can be\nexplained by atmospheric hazes, which is in contrast to planet b where\nefficient haze formation can be ruled out. Higher haze formation efficiency in\nplanet c could be due to differences in atmospheric composition, temperature\nand higher UV flux incident compared to planet b.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6a0EJtkUL7Cw_5UGe_K8uZb6cIfW-QK2sXcFMW8LQn4","pdfSize":"7964193","objectId":"0xe1508cf23c69b61eba4032c03d4f3a18fd1f4c9c997a87b4c1cce54020e903ac","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
