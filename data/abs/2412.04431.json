Infinity redefines visual autoregressive model under a bitwise\ntoken prediction framework with an infinite-vocabulary tokenizer & classifier\nand bitwise self-correction mechanism, remarkably improving the generation\ncapacity and details. By theoretically scaling the tokenizer vocabulary size to\ninfinity and concurrently scaling the transformer size, our method\nsignificantly unleashes powerful scaling capabilities compared to vanilla VAR.\nInfinity sets a new record for autoregressive text-to-image models,\noutperforming top-tier diffusion models like SD3-Medium and SDXL. Notably,\nInfinity surpasses SD3-Medium by improving the GenEval benchmark score from\n0.62 to 0.73 and the ImageReward benchmark score from 0.87 to 0.96, achieving a\nwin rate of 66%. Without extra optimization, Infinity generates a high-quality\n1024x1024 image in 0.8 seconds, making it 2.6x faster than SD3-Medium and\nestablishing it as the fastest text-to-image model. Models and codes will be\nreleased to promote further exploration of Infinity for visual generation and\nunified tokenizer modeling.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"g1HvmQoX97AobnOZjE_uZKxe8zDvzYms8RvJPw7gYA0","pdfSize":"15749358"}
