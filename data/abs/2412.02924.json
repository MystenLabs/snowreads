  "abstract": "  Accurate prediction over long time horizons is crucial for modeling complex\nphysical processes such as wave propagation. Although deep neural networks show\npromise for real-time forecasting, they often struggle with accumulating phase\nand amplitude errors as predictions extend over a long period. To address this\nissue, we propose a novel loss decomposition strategy that breaks down the loss\ninto separate phase and amplitude components. This technique improves the\nlong-term prediction accuracy of neural networks in wave propagation tasks by\nexplicitly accounting for numerical errors, improving stability, and reducing\nerror accumulation over extended forecasts.\n",
