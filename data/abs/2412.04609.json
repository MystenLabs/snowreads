Here\nwe explore the possibility that the same type of tuning might account for the\ngeneration of the electroweak scale from a much lighter dynamically generated\nscale in a dark sector. We present a model that realizes this idea and provides\na proof of principle that the same dark sector can include a viable dark matter\ncandidate.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4tqnJxK71896Gw7stWheAKHmq-SjRPZO7ZnVCrzZl3A","pdfSize":"380603"}
