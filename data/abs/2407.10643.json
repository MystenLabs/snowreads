Here\nwe study the possibility of bending a waveguide to enhance the photon pair\ngeneration rate in a spontaneous four-wave mixing process. Whereas intuition\nmight suggest that bending makes the process less efficient, because the\nwaveguides are more lossy when bent, we show that the increase in the effective\nnonlinearity outperforms the disadvantage for moderate bending radii. That can\nbe explained by a better localization of the guided eigenmodes, leading to a\nreduced mode area. By studying selected waveguide devices with a fixed length,\nwe demonstrate an optimal improvement between 5 % and 270 % in the photon pair\ngeneration rate for an optimal bending radius. These findings have implications\nfor the future design of integrated photonic devices for quantum optical\napplications, especially in cases where the chip estate tends to be a limiting\nfactor.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"dYzCevv5b-S4mDhqd6I4cgIW7A2ku79ltnxUv4oxVgk","pdfSize":"1628050","objectId":"0x0f37137620351cb9966b531fdbae55198c25d8b1dba62eb0c56e4949d0c2bfa9","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
