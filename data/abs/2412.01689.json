Unlike previous\nstudies, real combusted iron particles with varying fuel-to-air equivalence\nratios were used instead of model oxides. In-situ video recordings reveal the\nevolution of particle size and morphology. Increasing temperature and\nshort-wavelength light exposure enhance the reaction rate, with light-induced\neffects only becoming significant above $40 ^\\circ$C for the duration of the\nexperiments. This behavior differs significantly from hematite/maghemite\noxides, attributed to the internal Fe phase structure of the combusted iron\nparticles. At $80^\\circ$C with additional light irradiation, a sudden decrease\nin reaction rate is observed due to solid ferrous oxide formation. While the\nfuel-to-air ratio induces differences in iron oxide phase composition, it does\nnot affect the dissolution combusted iron particles significantly.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"lY-ZGofZ5aK-AU8WtFA51WNxlZ2CuFxwu9tGncbxiOI","pdfSize":"42142914"}
