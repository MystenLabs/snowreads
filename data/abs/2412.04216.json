  "abstract": "  This work proposes a minimal model extending the duality between classical\nstatistical spin systems and fermionic systems beyond the case of free\nfermions. A Jordan-Wigner transformation applied to a two-dimensional tensor\nnetwork maps the partition sum of a classical statistical mechanics model to a\nGrassmann variable integral, structurally similar to the path integral for\ninteracting fermions in two dimensions. The resulting model is simple,\nfeaturing only two parameters: one governing spin-spin interaction (dual to\neffective hopping strength in the fermionic picture), the other measuring the\ndeviation from the free fermion limit. Nevertheless, it exhibits a rich phase\ndiagram, partially stabilized by elements of topology, and featuring three\nphases meeting at a tricritical point. Besides the interpretation as a spin and\nfermionic system, the model is closely related to loop gas and vertex models\nand can be interpreted as a parity-preserving (non-unitary) circuit. Its\nminimal construction makes it an ideal reference system for studying\nnon-linearities in tensor networks and deriving results by means of duality.\n",
