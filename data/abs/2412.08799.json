  "abstract": "  We report on an instance in quantum gravity where a topological expansion\nresums into an effective description on a single geometry. The original theory\nwhose gravitational path integral we study is JT quantum gravity with one\nasymptotic boundary at nonperturbatively low temperatures. The effective theory\nwe derive is a deformation of JT gravity by a highly quantum and nonlocal\ninteraction for the dilaton, evaluated only on a disk topology. This emergent\ndescription addresses a strongly quantum gravitational regime where all genera\ncontribute at the same order, successfully capturing the doubly nonperturbative\nphysics of the original theory.\n",
