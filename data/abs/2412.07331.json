  "abstract": "  Neurosymbolic Artificial Intelligence (NeSy) has emerged as a promising\ndirection to integrate low level perception with high level reasoning.\nUnfortunately, little attention has been given to developing NeSy systems\ntailored to temporal/sequential problems. This entails reasoning symbolically\nover sequences of subsymbolic observations towards a target prediction. We show\nthat using a probabilistic semantics symbolic automata, which combine the power\nof automata for temporal structure specification with that of propositional\nlogic, can be used to reason efficiently and differentiably over subsymbolic\nsequences. The proposed system, which we call NeSyA (Neuro Symbolic Automata),\nis shown to either scale or perform better than existing NeSy approaches when\napplied to problems with a temporal component.\n",
