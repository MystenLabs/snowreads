During finetuning stage, using\nthe same set of finetuning hyper-paramters every time for every given image,\nForgedit remembers and understands the input image in 30 seconds. During\nediting stage, the workflow of Forgedit might seem complicated. However, in\nfact, the editing process of Forgedit is not more complex than previous SOTA\nImagic, yet completely solves the overfitting problem of Imagic. In this paper,\nwe will elaborate the workflow of Forgedit editing stage with examples. We will\nshow how to tune the hyper-parameters in an efficient way to obtain ideal\nediting results.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CuV6gG6C7mq2SS4t2P205cjBWDJiU3oPZ_-T9uXUqp4","pdfSize":"3592994","objectId":"0x7f4d8d41ca13d1a3fab67e2ebda8dabdd9a3a190a77fbee6c1920df1d54b182f","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
