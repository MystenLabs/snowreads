In addition, we update the HQE predictions for the lifetime ratios\n$\\tau (B^+)/\\tau (B_d)$ and $\\tau (B_s)/\\tau (B_d)$, and provide new results\nfor the semileptonic branching fractions of the three mesons entirely within\nthe HQE. We obtain a considerable improvement of the theoretical uncertainties,\nmostly due to the reduction of the renormalisation scale dependence when going\nfrom LO to NNLO, and for all the observables considered, we find good\nagreement, within uncertainties, between the HQE predictions and the\ncorresponding experimental data. Our results read, respectively, $\\Gamma (B^+)\n= 0.587^{+0.025}_{-0.035}~{\\rm ps}^{-1}$, $\\Gamma (B_d) =\n0.636^{+0.028}_{-0.037}~{\\rm ps}^{-1}$, $\\Gamma (B_s) =\n0.628^{+0.027}_{-0.035}~{\\rm ps}^{-1}$, for the total decay widths, $\\tau\n(B^+)/\\tau (B_d) = 1.081^{+0.014}_{-0.016}$, $\\tau (B_s)/\\tau (B_d) =\n1.013^{+0.007}_{-0.007}$, for the lifetime ratios, and ${\\cal B}_{\\rm sl} (B^+)\n= (11.46^{+0.47}_{-0.32}) \\%$, ${\\cal B}_{\\rm sl} (B_d) =\n(10.57^{+0.47}_{-0.27}) \\%$, ${\\cal B}_{\\rm sl} (B_s) = (10.52^{+0.50}_{-0.29})\n\\%$, for the semileptonic branching ratios. Finally, we also provide an outlook\nfor further improvements of the HQE determinations of the $B$-meson decay\nwidths and of their ratios.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TmNln0mMsxjyARvcxlXb9jR2Cuyr-rDLl_U_esAH33M","pdfSize":"1422710"}
