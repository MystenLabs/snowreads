This\npaper introduces a novel AI-driven system, called AutoBIR, that leverages\nsemantic search and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and accelerate the\nspecification of BI requirements. The system facilitates intuitive interaction\nwith stakeholders through a conversational interface, translating user inputs\ninto prototype analytic code, descriptions, and data dependencies.\nAdditionally, AutoBIR produces detailed test-case reports, optionally enhanced\nwith visual aids, streamlining the requirement elicitation process. By\nincorporating user feedback, the system refines BI reporting and system design,\ndemonstrating practical applications for expediting data-driven\ndecision-making. This paper explores the broader potential of generative AI in\ntransforming BI development, illustrating its role in enhancing data\nengineering practice for large-scale, evolving systems.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ywE7mXRnRSw10x7YWrV9N8_rUrD02mrZMmzMC7XGHrE","pdfSize":"1322351"}
