Moreover, we give the classification of $2$-dimensional compatible\nanti-pre-Lie algebras from the classification of anti-pre-Lie algebras of the\nsame dimension.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"chYO5k-ewOl2d4LbSkQxluyVBGq_9qHZ61WLLgV_Ep0","pdfSize":"239216"}
