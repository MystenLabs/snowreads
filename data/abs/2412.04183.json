While complex models yield more accurate predictions,\ntheir interpretability is often weakened, which is a concern for credit scoring\nthat places importance on decision fairness. As features of the dataset are a\ncrucial factor for the credit scoring system, we implement Linear Discriminant\nAnalysis (LDA) as a feature reduction technique, which reduces the burden of\nthe models complexity. We compared 6 different machine learning models, 1 deep\nlearning model, and a hybrid model with and without using LDA. From the result,\nwe have found our hybrid model, XG-DNN, outperformed other models with the\nhighest accuracy of 99.45% and a 99% F1 score with LDA. Lastly, to interpret\nmodel decisions, we have applied 2 different explainable AI techniques named\nLIME (local) and Morris Sensitivity Analysis (global). Through this research,\nwe showed how feature reduction techniques can be used without affecting the\nperformance and explainability of the model, which can be very useful in\nresource-constrained settings to optimize the computational workload.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1GqZ494tNVFCMOYgTPtDTZLxswKpE75w4zIsUCn8Sp8","pdfSize":"487820"}
