This study\nproposes a framework based on an attention Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory\n(BiLSTM) network for predicting multiband images. Our model can forecast target\nimages on user-defined dates, including future dates and periods characterized\nby persistent cloud cover. By focusing on short sequences within a\nsequence-to-one forecasting framework, the model leverages advanced attention\nmechanisms to enhance prediction accuracy. Our experimental results demonstrate\nthe model's superior performance in predicting NDVI, multiple vegetation\nindices, and all Sentinel-2 bands, highlighting its potential for improving\nremote sensing data continuity and reliability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"22eaGUE3ZJ6H55WkDZKYdlX_Euc2dHRwi4VEebmOtMM","pdfSize":"1258321","objectId":"0x320d755ba3f0a8b222c18a3bc6dd3936d2e706a89d3fc1a7bd60081e91d1f53c","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
