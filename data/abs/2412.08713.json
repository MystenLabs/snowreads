  "abstract": "  We investigate MHV tree-level gravity amplitudes as defined on the\nspinor-helicity variety. Unlike their gluon counterparts, the gravity\namplitudes do not have logarithmic singularities and do not admit\nAmplituhedron-like construction. Importantly, they are not determined just by\ntheir singularities, but rather their numerators have interesting zeroes. We\nmake a conjecture about the uniqueness of the numerator and explore this\nfeature from a more mathematical perspective. This leads us to a new approach\nfor examining adjoints. We outline steps of our proposed proof and provide\ncomputational evidence for its validity in specific cases.\n",
