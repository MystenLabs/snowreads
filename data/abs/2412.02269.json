Employing both\none-loop and self-consistent Popov approximations, we derive the universal form\nof the relative shift in the transition temperature, which is proportional to\nthe s-wave scattering length. The results demonstrate excellent agreement with\nthose obtained through precise Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, the\nzero-point energy and various thermodynamic quantities are also analyzed in the\ncondensed phase.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gqjJiktLZa96kCNr6VHfjr6SuHNMgWQS2hRH0W_ugDM","pdfSize":"202775"}
