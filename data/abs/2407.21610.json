The Land\\'e g-factors and spin dephasing times are\nevaluated from the observed Larmor precession of electron and hole spins. The\nnanocrystal size in the three studied samples varies from about 8 to 16 nm,\nresulting in exciton transition varying from 1.69 to 1.78 eV at the temperature\nof 6 K, allowing us to study the corresponding energy dependence of the\ng-factors. The electron g-factor decreases with increasing confinement energy\nin the NCs as result of NC size reduction, and also with increasing\ntemperature. The hole g-factor shows the opposite trend. A model analysis shows\nthat the variation of g-factors with NC size arises from the transition energy\ndependence of the g-factors, which becomes strongly renormalized by\ntemperature.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"T2L-eeyFjECEbP0vkFQStXiVqxJq5mZ14cxTd9pq_ks","pdfSize":"1725149"}
