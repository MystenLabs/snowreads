In principle it is possible to interpret within WW all experiments\ninvolving the EM field interacting with macroscopic bodies, the latter treated\nclassically. In the WW formalism the essential difference between classical\nelectrodynamics and the quantum theory of the EM field is\\ just the assumption\nthat there is a random EM field filling space\\QTR{it}{, }i.e. the existence of\na zero-point field with a Gaussian distribution for the field amplitudes.

The model admits an\ninterpretation compatible with local realism, modulo a number of assumptions\nassumed plausible.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-yAzPkLgpylp4khH9X_XHnnc3kE6hp7fRARDAoDTYNo","pdfSize":"221896"}
