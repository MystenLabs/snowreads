Despite their great success, existing works primarily\nemploy polynomial approximation to construct the filters, whereas another\nsuperior option, namely ration approximation, remains underexplored. Although a\nhandful of prior works have attempted to deploy the rational approximation,\ntheir implementations often involve intensive computational demands or still\nresort to polynomial approximations, hindering full potential of the rational\ngraph filters. To address the issues, this paper introduces ERGNN, a novel\nspectral GNN with explicitly-optimized rational filter. ERGNN adopts a unique\ntwo-step framework that sequentially applies the numerator filter and the\ndenominator filter to the input signals, thus streamlining the model paradigm\nwhile enabling explicit optimization of both numerator and denominator of the\nrational filter. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of ERGNN over\nstate-of-the-art methods, establishing it as a practical solution for deploying\nrational-based GNNs.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Wi_j4SzIPOZRucazsgotA2mHrmqtOBMScfDStldOo2E","pdfSize":"721968"}
