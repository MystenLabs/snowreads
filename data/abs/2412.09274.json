In particular, we use\nthe eigenstates for a reversed harmonic oscillator as the complete bases in\nthis intermediate region. Under this setting, the transmission and reflection\ncoefficients are studied in addition to the frequencies of QNMs.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"veHq8UI-uD9Jp9vfCJhZdUZrHIkjK6UW8pjrFNC1wAA","pdfSize":"345223"}
