Our research demonstrates that it is feasible to: 1)\neffectively analyze complex robotic systems expressed using RSHPN, and 2)\nenable models to inherit properties from the meta-model. This approach\nsignificantly simplifies the analysis process, reduces design time, and ensures\nthe safety and reliability of the systems. These aspects are crucial for robots\noperating in human environments. Our results suggest that Petri nets could be\nfurther explored as a useful tool for the formal description and in-depth\nanalysis of the properties of robotic systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7go-6HzT3muc8QMD0YpmkWbm6u9D5GKH7aQ5gXVMEf8","pdfSize":"9731878"}
