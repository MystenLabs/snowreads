Can such information be obtained\naccurately? This paper studies novel packet processing architectures that\nreceive external hints about which packets are soon to arrive, thus enabling\nprefetching into fast cache memories of the state needed to process them,\njust-in-time for the packets' arrival. We explore possible approaches to (i)\nobtain such hints either from network devices or the end hosts in the\ncommunication and (ii) use these hints to better utilize cache memories. We\nshow that such information (if accurate) can improve packet processing\nthroughput by at least 50%.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"wdgYw3Zk71tFOOLrAEBrSp30IJM2PAF6NJXlWFPNn_0","pdfSize":"437223"}
