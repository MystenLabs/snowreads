This paper shows that offline RLHF is\nsusceptible to reward confusion, especially in the presence of spurious\ncorrelations in offline data. We create a benchmark to study this problem and\npropose a method that can significantly reduce reward confusion by leveraging\ntransitivity of preferences while building a global preference chain with\nactive learning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xT4Z0aBnJmB6uei1eefqEcaHQIGPNmSvc5Q8e7r_8TE","pdfSize":"1898773","objectId":"0x7c1ddf3b2c0ea6c9fbafea636cdc0063208d4485785667926508734376a65d55","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
