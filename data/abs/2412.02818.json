Researchers and engineers\ntypically address these failures using heuristic approaches, which are not only\nlabor-intensive and costly but also prone to overlooking critical failure modes\n(FMs). This paper introduces Robot Manipulation Diagnosis (RoboMD), a\nsystematic framework designed to automatically identify FMs arising from\nunanticipated changes in the environment. Considering the vast space of\npotential FMs in a pre-trained manipulation policy, we leverage deep\nreinforcement learning (deep RL) to explore and uncover these FMs using a\nspecially trained vision-language embedding that encodes a notion of failures.\nThis approach enables users to probabilistically quantify and rank failures in\npreviously unseen environmental conditions. Through extensive experiments\nacross various manipulation tasks and algorithms, we demonstrate RoboMD's\neffectiveness in diagnosing unknown failures in unstructured environments,\nproviding a systematic pathway to improve the robustness of manipulation\npolicies.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Robotics","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Nd3XWVyz84mZgtTe9imclp2JkzGmAPgjELGmKPoZKD4","pdfSize":"786414"}
