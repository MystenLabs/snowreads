It is\nimportant to study the quality and equity of its responses on health-related\ntopics, such as vaccination, as they may influence public health\ndecision-making. We use the Vaccine Hesitancy Scale (VHS) proposed by Shapiro\net al.1 to measure the hesitancy of ChatGPT responses in English, Spanish, and\nFrench. We find that: (a) ChatGPT responses indicate less hesitancy than those\nreported for human respondents in past literature; (b) ChatGPT responses vary\nsignificantly across languages, with English responses being the most hesitant\non average and Spanish being the least; (c) ChatGPT responses are largely\nconsistent across different model parameters but show some variations across\nthe scale factors (vaccine competency, risk). Results have implications for\nresearchers interested in evaluating and improving the quality and equity of\nhealth-related web information.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vBw-U89NOu7L2QaQkOcx8X8wlsEL4V62Kd7xzVFYOcA","pdfSize":"193193"}
