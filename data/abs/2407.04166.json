This\nallowed for an accurate determination of the energies of all four components of\nthe K$\\alpha$ transitions in U$^{90+}$. We find good agreement with\nstate-of-the-art bound-state QED calculations for the strong-field regime. Our\nresults do not support any systematic deviation between experiment and theory\nin helium-like systems, the presence of which was subject of intense debates in\nrecent years.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LZcRcE8kxZaKReEzFOG7sL6Q8t6cgog8rXGfbQrHXV4","pdfSize":"372237"}
