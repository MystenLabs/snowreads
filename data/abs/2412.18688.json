Despite significant\nprogress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), generating extended\nvideos remains a formidable challenge. As of this writing, OpenAI's Sora, the\ncurrent state-of-the-art system, is still limited to producing videos that are\nup to one minute in length. This limitation stems from the complexity of long\nvideo generation, which requires more than generative AI techniques for\napproximating density functions essential aspects such as planning, story\ndevelopment, and maintaining spatial and temporal consistency present\nadditional hurdles. Integrating generative AI with a divide-and-conquer\napproach could improve scalability for longer videos while offering greater\ncontrol. In this survey, we examine the current landscape of long video\ngeneration, covering foundational techniques like GANs and diffusion models,\nvideo generation strategies, large-scale training datasets, quality metrics for\nevaluating long videos, and future research areas to address the limitations of\nthe existing video generation capabilities. We believe it would serve as a\ncomprehensive foundation, offering extensive information to guide future\nadvancements and research in the field of long video generation.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uTvIFxm8sLrad1be5zk0y0Eie63a8caiLhL5qNJPsj8","pdfSize":"13725075"}
