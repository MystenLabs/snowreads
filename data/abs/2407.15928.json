We discuss the underlying hypotheses behind different sources\nof CP violation at high energies and the interplay between axion-mediated force\nexperiments and EDM observables. Specifically, we identify various mechanisms,\nbased on new sources of CP violation or Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking, that\ncan significantly relax EDM constraints, leading to a substantial redefinition\nof the QCD axion window for axion-mediated forces. By considerably enlarging\nthe QCD axion parameter space, our results provide a well-motivated target for\nexperiments probing scalar axion couplings to matter fields. These include\nfifth-force tests of gravity, as well as searches for spin-dependent forces via\nprecision magnetometry, proton storage rings and ultracold molecules.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0PgELAtAsukDpKDDSQ7YQ1pQi8N9e9Nsc0_LQWvtZ1k","pdfSize":"873339"}
