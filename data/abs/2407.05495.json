We characterize, also, which $M-D-G$ frames\nare Riesz bases by the parameters $L$, $M$ and $N$. Matrix-characterizations of\n$M-D-G$ Parseval frames and $M-D-G$ orthonormal bases are also given. Then, we\ncharacterize the existence of $M-D-G$ frames, $M-D-G$ Parseval frames, $M-D-G$\nRiesz bases and $M-D-G$ orthonormal bases for $\\ell^2(\\mathbb{Z})$ by the\nparameters $M$, $N$ and $L$. We present, also, a matrix-characterization of\ndual $M-D-G$ frames in $\\ell^2(\\mathbb{S})$. A perturbation matrix-condition of\n$M-D-G$ frames is also prsented. We, then, show that a pair of $M-D-G$ Bessel\nsystems can generate pairs of M-D-G dual frames. By the Zak-transform,\ncharacterizations of complete M-D-G systems and M-D-G frames in\n$\\ell^2(\\mathbb{Z})$ are given in the case of $M=N$ and necessary conditions\nfor a M-D-G system to be a Riesz basis/ orthonormal basis for\n$\\ell^2(\\mathbb{Z})$ are also given. We, also, study M-D-G $K$-frames in\n$\\ell^2(\\mathbb{S})$, where $K\\in B(\\ell^2(\\mathbb{S})\\,)$, and presente some\nsufficient matrix-conditions for a M-D-G system to form a K-frame and give a\nconstruction method of M-D-G $K$-frames which are not M-D-G frames and some\nexamples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2YTg8LRCX0zXTNt3mt1XDMLC3u6FgTsczBSo60s9f4I","pdfSize":"335883"}
