Our key theoretical\ncontribution lies in reformulating conditional score to decompose motion score\nand content score in diffusion models. By formulating motion transfer as a\nmixture of potential energies, MSG naturally preserves scene composition and\nenables creative scene transformations while maintaining the integrity of\ntransferred motion patterns. This novel sampling operates directly on\npre-trained video diffusion models without additional training or fine-tuning.\nThrough extensive experiments, MSG demonstrates successful handling of diverse\nscenarios including single object, multiple objects, and cross-object motion\ntransfer as well as complex camera motion transfer. Additionally, we introduce\nMotionBench, the first motion transfer dataset consisting of 200 source videos\nand 1000 transferred motions, covering single/multi-object transfers, and\ncomplex camera motions.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"L6ZV3FX-Tx3Q2j4roRLJG9JCjwsaV4ZiPBTCwOCOIVA","pdfSize":"11074441"}
