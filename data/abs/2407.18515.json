Socially efficient\nmechanisms are thus desirably designed to not only maximize the social welfare\nbut also incentivize the agents for their own profit. Under a generalized model\nthat includes applications such as double auctions and trading networks, this\nstudy establishes a socially efficient (SE), dominant-strategy incentive\ncompatible (DSIC), and individually rational (IR) mechanism with the minimum\ntotal budget expensed to the agents. The present method exploits discrete and\nknown type domains to reduce a set of constraints into the shortest path\nproblem in a weighted graph. In addition to theoretical derivation, we\nsubstantiate the optimality of the proposed mechanism through numerical\nexperiments, where it certifies strictly lower budget than\nVickery-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanisms for a wide class of instances.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rw7QFqhZD4q7ErhEs1hknS_chBDFpQnw5JqI_H5psjw","pdfSize":"872951"}
