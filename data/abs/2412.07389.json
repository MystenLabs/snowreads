  "abstract": "  Electroelastic waves in piezoelectric media are widely used in sensing and\nfiltering applications. Despite extensive research, computing the guided wave\ndispersion remains challenging. This paper presents semi-analytical approaches\nbased on spectral methods to efficiently and reliably compute dispersion\ncurves. We systematically assess the impact of electrical boundary conditions\non a 128{\\deg} Y-cut LiNbO3 wafer, examining open-open, open-shorted and\nshorted-shorted surfaces configurations. Multi-modal dispersion maps obtained\nfrom laser-ultrasonic experiments for each boundary condition exhibit excellent\nagreement with the computational predictions. A straightforward implementation\nof the spectral collocation method is made available as \"GEW piezo plate\"\n(https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14205789), while the spectral element method\nwill be integrated to \"GEWtool\" (http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10114243).\nTherewith, we aim to make advanced semi-analytical techniques more accessible\nto physicists and engineers relying on dispersion analysis.\n",
