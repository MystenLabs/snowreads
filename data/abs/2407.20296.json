This geometry supports a\ntwo-band insulating electronic system with Chern topology induced by a complex\nhoppping parameter. Inspired by the recent advances in the topology of\nnon-Hermitian systems, in this work we study a non-Hermitian version of the\ntopological checkerboard lattice. The complex band structure and Berry\ncurvature are calculated. In the insulating phase, the Chern number is the same\nas in the Hermitian version, but the Hall conductivity is no longer quantized.\nThe dependence of the Hall conductivity with the non-Hermitian parameters is\ninvestigated. The non-Hermiticity can be seen as a result of dissipation caused\nby coupling the system to the environment, so this study casts light on the\ntopology of open systems in condensed matter physics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KaSsPikLYx7ruyTYcc-qQh6-JvWq995SQ9vgZttMHA8","pdfSize":"780956","objectId":"0x7e00f0ed3555e3587764129f1594d36912c72837f10141ac59a90cb014377dad","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
