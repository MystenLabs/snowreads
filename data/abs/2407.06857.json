In this paper, we\ninvestigate the impact of battery degradation on the distribution network. We\nformulate a multi-objective framework for optimizing battery scheduling with\nthe goals of minimizing monetary costs and improving network performance. Our\nframework incorporates energy purchase and battery degradation into the costs\nand measures the network performance through energy losses and voltage\ndeviation. We propose Bach for battery degradation-aware cheduling based on\ne-constraint and fuzzy logic methods. Bach is implemented for the IEEE 33-bus\nnetwork for an experimental study. The results show the effectiveness of Bach\nin optimizing costs and performance simultaneously with battery degradation\nawareness and demonstrate the flexibility of further customization.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RNawKSWydVpZxiu4-mIeQw33HxCweYpSJ4nxwb4f5ww","pdfSize":"368854"}
