  "abstract": "  We integrate numerically the Schr\\\"odinger equation for the model helium atom\nirradiated by intense few-cycle laser pulse and find the emitted XUV spectra.\nThey demonstrate resonant peaks at the frequencies of transitions from the\ndoubly-excited autoionizing states (AISs) to the ground state. We study the\nproperties of these peaks depending on the laser pulse duration and find that\nthe decay of the AISs due to photoionization by the laser field affects them.\nMoreover, we consider the classical system of two coupled oscillators and find\nthat both the quantum (the atom with AIS in the field) and the classical (the\ncoupled oscillators with friction) systems demonstrate Fano-like resonant peak\ndescribed by an essentially complex asymmetry parameter. We find a remarkable\nsimilarity in the behavior of these systems and conclude that the classical\nsystem of coupled oscillators with friction is an analogy of the AIS having an\nextra decay channel in addition to the autoionization one.\n",
