Unlike conventional generative models\nthat independently process vertices, edges, and faces, our approach employs a\nunified wire-based representation for improved coherence in learning 3D\nwireframe structures. By re-ordering wire sequences based on semantic meanings,\nwe facilitate seamless semantic integration during sequence generation. Our\ntwo-phase technique merges a graph-based autoencoder with a transformer-based\ndecoder to learn latent geometric tokens and generate semantic-aware\nwireframes. Through iterative prediction and decoding during inference, our\nmodel produces detailed wireframes that can be easily segmented into distinct\ncomponents, such as walls, roofs, and rooms, reflecting the semantic essence of\nthe shape. Empirical results on a comprehensive house dataset validate the\nsuperior accuracy, novelty, and semantic fidelity of our model compared to\nexisting generative models.
