This setup is used\nto characterize the behaviour of a NbN coated superconducting cavity in a 2.5T\nstrong magnetic field, at a resonance frequency of 8.4GHz. We observe an\nincreasing surface resistance with increasing magnetic field, leading to a\ndecreasing quality factor. The behaviour is similar to that of previously\nstudied cavities using Nb3Tn.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Accelerator Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Mj-5SSxxO2HLxSR0DKj8dC-o8_z79oFzt1aRZWE3CWE","pdfSize":"1365379"}
