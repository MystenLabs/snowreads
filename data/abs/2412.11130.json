In this attempt it is found an object conjectured to be , almost\neverywhere, the converging \"spectrum\" of prime numbers . Reasons and\nconsequences of the conjecture are highlighted.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"U2pKI8rxMqcJ8TLVx6crMk0jrltjIb4abzhNqcmOfjA","pdfSize":"826109"}
