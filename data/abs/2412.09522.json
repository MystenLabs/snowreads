Simulations show that the transport is\ncontrolled by the nonlinear interactions between the ITG turbulence and\nself-generated vortex flows and zonal flows, leading to an anisotropic\nstructure of fluctuation and transport on the poloidal plane and in the\ntoroidal direction. Magnetic islands greatly enhance turbulent transport of\nboth particle and heat. The turbulent transport exhibits variations in the\ntoroidal direction, with transport through the resonant layer near the island\nX-point being enhanced when the X-point is located at the outer mid-plane. A\nquantitative agreement is shown between simulations and KSTAR experiments in\nterms of time frequency and perpendicular wavevector spectrum.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aXNrIFiM9T1JJwd3DjpF1jPNZzjWF3jwaKer3RkDZwo","pdfSize":"4396843"}
