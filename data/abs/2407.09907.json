A peak atomic density of $1.93(6)\n\\times 10^{12}$ atoms/cm$^3$ is achieved, which corresponds to a factor of 2\nincrease relative to ablation. We further propose extensions of this method to\nother atomic and molecular species.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ECXIB-EyGOBj39ZLEp1mkOP1OlWkzCtDvxGAyNrllr8","pdfSize":"344735"}
