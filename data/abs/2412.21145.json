  "abstract": "  I will show that there exist two binary words (one of length 4 and one of\nlength 6) that play a special role in many different problems in combinatorics\non words. They can therefore be considered \\textit{the shortest interesting\nbinary words}. My claim is supported by the fact that these two words appear in\ndozens of papers in combinatorics on words.\n",
