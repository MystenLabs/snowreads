In this Chapter, we\nbriefly introduce such bursty phenomena by first walking through the most\nprominent observations of bursty human behavior. We then introduce several\nconventional measures that have been developed for characterizing bursty\nphenomena. Finally, we discuss the fundamental modeling directions proposed to\nunderstand the emergence of burstiness in human dynamics through the assumption\nof task prioritization, temporal correlations, and external factors. This\nChapter is only a concise introduction to the field. Still, it provides the\nmost important references, which will help interested readers to learn in depth\nthe ever-growing research area of bursty human dynamics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1eaCgI_uFLwuJvKI6U8qu8EQXGddy_X0u1OHYYbdlNM","pdfSize":"1298683"}
