Here, we propose how to enhance\nthe tripartite entanglement among magnons, photons and phonons in a hybrid\ncavity-magnon optomechanical system by exploiting a synergistic effect of the\noptical parametric amplification (OPA) and mechanical parametric amplification\n(MPA). We find that in the case of individually applying the OPA or MPA, the\ntripartite entanglement can be enhanced by several folds. Remarkably, upon\nsuitably tuning the phase matching of the two parametric fields presented\nsimultaneously, the strengths of the entanglement can be further enhanced due\nto the constructive interference between the OPA and MPA. We also show that our\nmethod can improve the robustness of the entanglement against thermal noise.\nOur work provides a promising method for manipulating the entanglement with\neasy tunability and may serve as a useful tool for the enhancement and\nprotection of fragile quantum resources.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fD45cI7riJdvr399IMCO5PQps2Y-rhs038FbaQcLA8s","pdfSize":"6235091"}
