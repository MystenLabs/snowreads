This evidence grows to\n$27_{-8}^{+11}$ if the $2.6M_\\odot$ component of GW190814 is a neutron star.\nThe trough in $C_s$ separating the two peaks is inferred to be below\n$0.05^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$ (at the $50\\%$ level) if $2.6M_\\odot$ neutron stars\nexist. The second peak above $1/3$ beyond baryon chemical potential\n$\\mu_B=1.6-1.9$ GeV most likely signals non-perturbative effects in cold quark\nmatter, for instance color superconductivity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"9pptYEGWgInUBsJYLXPRwZmkqUHzaXw4MDpcSdSLlCo","pdfSize":"1002632"}
