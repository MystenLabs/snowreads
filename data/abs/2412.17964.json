This methodology is designed to integrate\ninformation from diverse data sources, including unstructured documents (PDFs)\nand structured databases, through a coordinated multi-agent orchestration and\ndynamic retrieval approach. Our methodology leverages specialized agents-such\nas SQL agents, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agents, and router agents -\nthat dynamically select the most appropriate retrieval strategy based on the\nnature of each query. To further improve accuracy and contextual relevance, we\nemploy dynamic prompt engineering, which adapts in real time to query-specific\ncontexts. The methodology's effectiveness is demonstrated within the domain of\nContract Management, where complex queries often require seamless interaction\nbetween unstructured and structured data. Our results indicate that this\napproach enhances response accuracy and relevance, offering a versatile and\nscalable framework for developing question-answer systems that can operate\nacross various domains and data sources.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TQQCpZ7GrzIGsG7ljW87lPWdbCynZU3gSo0vSNaItPw","pdfSize":"865509"}
