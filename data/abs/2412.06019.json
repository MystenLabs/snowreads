  "abstract": "  Using the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), Burdge et al. (2020) discovered\nsystems of eclipsing double white dwarfs (EDWDs) having orbital periods <1 hr.\nFrom the properties of 3 of the discovered systems, I estimate a merger rate of\nDWDs, per WD in the Galaxy, of $R_{\\rm merge, WD}\\approx8\\times\n10^{-12}$yr$^{-1}$, or a rate per unit stellar mass in the Galaxy, of $R_{\\rm\nmerge, M*}\\approx4.8\\times 10^{-13}$yr$^{-1}$M$_\\odot^{-1}$.This likely\nsomewhat underestimates the rate, because of several known effects that work\nagainst EDWD detection in ZTF. The derived merger rate is within the\nuncertainty range, $R_{\\rm merge, M*} =(4.6-5.8)\\times\n10^{-13}$yr$^{-1}$M$_\\odot^{-1}$, measured independently by Maoz et al. (2018)\nbased on two samples of DWDs discovered via radial-velocity variations. Based\non the expected period distribution of DWDs and their detectability, of order\n100 additional eclipsing DWDs with periods >1 hr are discoverable in ZTF, with\npotential to significantly improve the merger-rate's measurement precision.\n",
