Central to our approach is the concept of\n\"alternating simulation functions,\" which serve to relate the concrete dynamics\nof impulsive subsystems to their finite abstractions. Dissipativity conditions\nare employed to ensure the compositionality of the finite abstractions,\nenabling the representation of complex interconnected systems as compositions\nof their subsystem abstractions. The methodology relies on incremental\npassivity properties such as supply rates and storage functions, alongside\nforward completeness, to construct finite abstractions for individual impulsive\nsubsystems.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computer Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"lv7ROycdQX7FOMZl31E1FJ9q1IqywOQAHKFHmz6vYZk","pdfSize":"318371"}
