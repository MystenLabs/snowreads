We\njustify the formal relation of hyperbolic geometry with the q-entropy through\nthe use of the $\\kappa$-entropy, which is directly related to the hyperboloid\nmodel of hyperbolic space. We comment on the relation between orthogonality in\nthis form of the Pythagorean theorem and the independence of the probability\ndistributions appearing in the q-entropy composition through the use of the\nDvoretzky-Rogers lemma.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RxaOZxg7pJxP37VjAAple3hEchXOcGUSHXv2azU2wac","pdfSize":"135562"}
