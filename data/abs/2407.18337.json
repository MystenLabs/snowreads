This approach addresses\nlimitations in existing directreconstruction methods for 3-{\\gamma} PET, which\noften struggle withdetector imperfections and uncertainties in estimated\nintersectionpoints. The pipeline begins by processing raw data, managingprompt\nphoton order in detectors, and propagating energy andspatial uncertainties on\nthe line of response (LOR). It thenconstructs histo-images backprojecting\nnon-symmetric Gaussianprobability density functions (PDFs) in the histo-image,\nwithattenuation correction applied when such data is available.\nAthree-dimensional (3-D) convolutional neural network (CNN)performs image\ntranslation, mapping the histo-image to radioac-tivity image. This architecture\nis trained using both supervisedand adversarial approaches. Our evaluation\ndemonstrates thesuperior performance of this method in balancing event\ninclu-sion and accuracy.
