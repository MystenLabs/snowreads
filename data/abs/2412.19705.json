  "abstract": "  In this paper, we study the noise sensitivity of the semidefinite program\n(SDP) proposed for direct data-driven infinite-horizon linear quadratic\nregulator (LQR) problem for discrete-time linear time-invariant systems. While\nthis SDP is shown to find the true LQR controller in the noise-free setting, we\nshow that it leads to a trivial solution with zero gain matrices when data is\ncorrupted by noise, even when the noise is arbitrarily small. We then study a\nvariant of the SDP that includes a robustness promoting regularization term and\nprove that regularization does not fully eliminate the sensitivity issue. In\nparticular, the solution of the regularized SDP converges in probability also\nto a trivial solution.\n",
