The key contributions (opens-sourced) are the integration of\nthese components and the design of custom teleoperation devices, addressing\npractical challenges in the deployment of service robots.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yJU8Or23dLT8EZqDFeg46I4RxiG2KSLcr7VgmV6G-YY","pdfSize":"2558570"}
