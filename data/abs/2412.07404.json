The most widely used first order PWMs is compared with the higher\norder PWMs for parameter estimation of (MBUW) distribution. Asymptotic\ndistribution of this PWM estimator is derived. This comparison is illustrated\nusing real data analysis.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Q_igXoW5maW1Lq4483auJ7HaNxaa9jiGv2r3xcPqo5Y","pdfSize":"1579698"}
