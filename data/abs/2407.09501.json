It consists of 3 steps: an encoding scheme to inject the\nproblem into the CA, the CA iterations step itself and a simple classifying\nstep, typically a linear classifier. This paper demonstrates that the ReCA\nconcept is effective even in arguably the simplest implementation of a ReCA\nsystem. However, we also report a failed attempt on the UCR Time Series\nClassification Archive where ReCA seems to work, but only because of the\nencoding scheme itself, not in any part due to the CA. This highlights the need\nfor ablation testing, i.e., comparing internally with sub-parts of one model,\nbut also raises an open question on what kind of tasks ReCA is best suited for.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kArXjO5oqPkWRATqOS2a8jls7KpykBLQxmFvmhY12jw","pdfSize":"1402194"}
