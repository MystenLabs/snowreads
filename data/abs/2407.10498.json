Using a\nsingle-band model and symmetry analysis, we present general superconducting\npairing functions beyond the nearest-neighbor approximation, uncovering new\ntypes of gap functions, including the nodal singlet gap function and the\ntriplet non-unitary pairing function that breaks time-reversal symmetry. The\nnon-unitarity builts in the asymmetrical band dispersion in the superconducting\nquasiparticle energy spectra. Performing exact T-matrix calculations of\nquasiparticle interference due to a single scalar impurity scattering, we found\nthat the interference patterns possess characteristic features distinguishing\nthe type of pairing and possible nematic and chiral symmetry violations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UFPEcddXP--EfM6fiOktNKNeiW8S1q3dPCU2aKwqEFs","pdfSize":"18440007"}
