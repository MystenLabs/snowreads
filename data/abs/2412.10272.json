  "abstract": "  In industrial contexts, effective workforce allocation is crucial for\noperational efficiency. This paper presents an ongoing project focused on\ndeveloping a decision-making tool designed for workforce allocation,\nemphasising the explainability to enhance its trustworthiness. Our objective is\nto create a system that not only optimises the allocation of teams to scheduled\ntasks but also provides clear, understandable explanations for its decisions,\nparticularly in cases where the problem is infeasible. By incorporating\nhuman-in-the-loop mechanisms, the tool aims to enhance user trust and\nfacilitate interactive conflict resolution. We implemented our approach on a\nprototype tool/digital demonstrator intended to be evaluated on a real\nindustrial scenario both in terms of performance and user acceptability.\n",
