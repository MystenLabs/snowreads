The proposed model (PM) dependence\non the proton and neutron numbers, the pairing, isospin, and deformation\nproperties of the initial and final nuclei is inspired by the insights offered\nby nuclear many-body methods. Compared with the previous phenomenological and\nnuclear models, the PM yields the best agreement with the experimental data.\nIts stability and predictive power are cross-validated, and predictions for\nnuclear systems of experimental interest are provided.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iqqI32F3qp28CBFKjyNBrED2XFRkZe8EvGQijhYnoYU","pdfSize":"512674"}
