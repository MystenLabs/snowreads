  "abstract": "  As foundation models increasingly permeate sensitive domains such as\nhealthcare, finance, and mental health, ensuring their behavior meets desired\noutcomes and social expectations becomes critical. Given the complexities of\nthese high-dimensional models, traditional techniques for constraining agent\nbehavior, which typically rely on low-dimensional, discrete state and action\nspaces, cannot be directly applied. Drawing inspiration from robotic action\nselection techniques, we propose the grounded observer framework for\nconstraining foundation model behavior that offers both behavioral guarantees\nand real-time variability. This method leverages real-time assessment of\nlow-level behavioral characteristics to dynamically adjust model actions and\nprovide contextual feedback. To demonstrate this, we develop a system capable\nof sustaining contextually appropriate, casual conversations (\"small talk\"),\nwhich we then apply to a robot for novel, unscripted interactions with humans.\nFinally, we discuss potential applications of the framework for other social\ncontexts and areas for further research.\n",
