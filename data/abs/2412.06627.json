The\ndependence of the absorption spectrum on the polarization, a phenomenon known\nas dichroism, is present in the atmosphere of magnetic white dwarfs. Its\nevaluation for processes in the continuum spectrum has been elusive so far due\nto the absence of appropriate ionization equilibrium models and incomplete data\non photoionization cross sections. We combined rigorous solutions to the\nequilibrium of atomic populations with approximate cross sections to calculate\nthe absolute opacity due to photoionization in a magnetized hydrogen gas. We\npredict a strong right-handed circularly polarized absorption ($\\chi^+$) formed\nblueward of the cyclotron resonance for fields from about 14 to several hundred\nmegagauss. In energies lower than the cyclotron fundamental, this absorption\nshows a deep trough with respect to linear and left-handed circular\npolarizations that steepens with the field strength. The jump in $\\chi^+$ is\ndue to the confluence of a large number of photoionization continua produced by\nright-handed circularly polarized transitions from atomic states with a\nnonnegative magnetic quantum number toward different Landau levels.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LOzYUl0pVMcItl0EMWLpgB6HfK0Pd8FdAG19e_H70Qw","pdfSize":"316308"}
