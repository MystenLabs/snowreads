Furthermore,\nproviding an accurate uncertainty estimation is beneficial to clinicians, as it\nindicates how confident a model is about its prediction. We propose a novel\n2.5D cross-slice attention model that utilizes both global and local\ninformation, along with an evidential critical loss, to perform evidential deep\nlearning for the detection in MR images of prostate cancer, one of the most\ncommon cancers and a leading cause of cancer-related death in men. We perform\nextensive experiments with our model on two different datasets and achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance in prostate cancer detection along with improved\nepistemic uncertainty estimation. The implementation of the model is available\nat https://github.com/aL3x-O-o-Hung/GLCSA_ECLoss.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UACL9_i-5ks7WGRU561bqBL0qnZqDtSEGF1uEwhyzgQ","pdfSize":"715912"}
