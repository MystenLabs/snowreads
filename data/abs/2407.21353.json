All the other\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ preserving renormalization group flows sporadically known in the\nliterature (e.g. $\\mathcal{M}(10,3) \\to \\mathcal{M}(8,3)$ studied by Klebanov\net al) fall into our proposal (e.g. $k=3, I=1$). We claim our new flows give a\ncomplete understanding of the renormalization group flows between Virasoro\nminimal models that preserve a modular tensor category with the $SU(2)_{q-2}$\nfusion ring.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3n6toBhX451DgWV6ELPQqK3DTQs5rb10cQBtv5YJwik","pdfSize":"282795"}
