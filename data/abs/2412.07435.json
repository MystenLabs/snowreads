  "abstract": "  In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in proving discretization\nbounds for sampling under isoperimetry and for diffusion models. As data size\ngrows, reducing the iteration cost becomes an important goal. Inspired by the\ngreat success of the parallel simulation of the initial value problem in\nscientific computation, we propose parallel Picard methods for sampling tasks.\nRigorous theoretical analysis reveals that our algorithm achieves better\ndependence on dimension $d$ than prior works in iteration complexity (i.e.,\nreduced from $\\widetilde{O}(\\log^2 d)$ to $\\widetilde{O}(\\log d)$), which is\neven optimal for sampling under isoperimetry with specific iteration\ncomplexity. Our work highlights the potential advantages of simulation methods\nin scientific computation for dynamics-based sampling and diffusion models.\n",
