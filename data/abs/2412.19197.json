  "abstract": "  As is well known, for the 3D Patlak-Keller-Segel system, regardless of\nwhether they are parabolic-elliptic or parabolic-parabolic forms, finite-time\nblow-up may occur for arbitrarily small values of the initial mass. In this\npaper, it was proved for the first time that one can prevent the finite-time\nblow-up when the initial mass is less than a certain critical threshold via the\nstabilizing effect of the moving Navier-Stokes flows. In details, we\ninvestigate the nonlinear stability of the Couette flow $(Ay, 0, 0)$ in the\nPatlak-Keller-Segel-Navier-Stokes system with\n$(x,y,z)\\in\\mathbb{T}\\times\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{T}$ and show that if the\nCouette flow is sufficiently strong (A is large enough), then solutions for\nPatlak-Keller-Segel-Navier-Stokes system are global in time as long as the\ninitial velocity is sufficiently small and the initial cell mass is less than\n$\\frac{24}{5} \\pi^2$.\n",
