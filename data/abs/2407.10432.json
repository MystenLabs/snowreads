However, their realizations in\nrealistic materials, in particular in two dimensional systems, remains the big\nchallenge due to the lack of adequate candidates. Here, based on the\nfirst-principle calculation and tight-binding model simulations, we identify\nthe currently \\emph{existing} bilayer $\\alpha_{5}$-phase borophenes as the\ntwo-dimensional second-order topological insulators, protected by the\n$C_{2}$-rotational symmetry. The formation of interlayer B-B covalent bonds,\nstabilizing the bilayer borophenes and opening the large direct bulk gaps\n($\\sim 0.55-0.62$ eV) at Fermi level, plays the key roles. The second-order\ntopology is characterized by the bulk quantized quadrupole momentum. Our\nresults enriches the candidates for the second-order topological insulators,\nand also provide a way to study topological states in borophenes.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"k7mq1VF_WbmfNE8hG4t7vX6pLeKtibbkRlWuXRZ1E2Q","pdfSize":"18678788"}
