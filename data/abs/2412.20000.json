In this paper, we define\nSchouten like metric as a particular solution of a prescribed Ricci curvature\nproblem and we classify them on five dimensional nilpotent Lie groups by\nestablishing a link with algebraic Schouten solitons. This also permit us to\nmake a classification of five dimensional nilsoliton.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"z6gCc-avWboJB1KyYq8iOBoEMlpYjYH_ZnwMv1LKT58","pdfSize":"116746"}
