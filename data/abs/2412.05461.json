The\nconstruction of this group generalizes that of the double Riordan group, and\nlays the pattern for further generalizations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0gCvPMXpZf85ukXqfa1W3fMNa4GQNZfoUUzKyiLtSV4","pdfSize":"111411"}
