  "abstract": "  This study explores the prevalence of dark patterns in mobile games that\nexploit players through temporal, monetary, social, and psychological means.\nRecognizing the ethical concerns and potential harm surrounding these\nmanipulative strategies, we analyze user-generated data of 1496 games to\nidentify relationships between the deployment of dark patterns within \"dark\"\nand \"healthy\" games. Our findings reveal that dark patterns are not only\nwidespread in games typically seen as problematic but are also present in games\nthat may be perceived as benign. This research contributes needed quantitative\nsupport to the broader understanding of dark patterns in games. With an\nemphasis on ethical design, our study highlights current problems of revenue\nmodels that can be particularly harmful to vulnerable populations. To this end,\nwe discuss the relevance of community-based approaches to surface harmful\ndesign and the necessity for collaboration among players/users and\npractitioners to promote healthier gaming experiences.\n",
