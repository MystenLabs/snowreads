We\nexplore the response of astrometric measurements to a stochastic gravitational\nwave background (SGWB) in synergy with PTA data. Analytical, covariant\nexpressions for this response are derived, accounting for the presence of a\npossible dipolar anisotropy in the SGWB. We identify the optimal estimator for\nextracting SGWB information from astrometric observations and examine how\nsensitivity to SGWB properties varies with the sky positions of stars and\npulsars. Using representative examples of current PTA capabilities and\nnear-future astrometric sensitivity, we demonstrate that cross-correlating\nastrometric and PTA data can improve constraints on SGWB properties, compared\nto PTA data alone. The improvement is quantified through Fisher forecasts for\nthe SGWB amplitude, spectral tilt, and dipolar anisotropy amplitude. In the\nfuture, such joint constraints could play a crucial role in identifying the\norigin of SGWB signals detected by PTAs.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sscKImcHsYOc5Qaukc-zafEw_hjjgmDf4Ztbnhckfn8","pdfSize":"2172408"}
