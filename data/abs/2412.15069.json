  "abstract": "  Dynamically maintaining the minimum cut in a graph $G$ under edge insertions\nand deletions is a fundamental problem in dynamic graph algorithms for which no\nconditional lower bound on the time per operation exists. In an $n$-node graph\nthe best known $(1+o(1))$-approximate algorithm takes $\\tilde O(\\sqrt{n})$\nupdate time [Thorup 2007]. If the minimum cut is guaranteed to be $(\\log\nn)^{o(1)}$, a deterministic exact algorithm with $n^{o(1)}$ update time exists\n[Jin, Sun, Thorup 2024]. We present the first fully dynamic algorithm for\n$(1+o(1))$-approximate minimum cut with $n^{o(1)}$ update time. Our main\ntechnical contribution is to show that it suffices to consider small-volume\ncuts in suitably contracted graphs.\n",
