This paper generally reviews the current state of the art of coverage\npath planning methods. Two widely used techniques applicable to agricultural\nenvironments are described in detail. The first consists of breaking down a\ncomplex field with obstacles into simpler subregions known as cells, to\nsubsequently generate a coverage pattern in each of them. The second analyzes\nspaces composed of parallel strips through which the robot must circulate, in\norder to find the optimal order of visiting strips that minimizes the total\ndistance traveled. Additionally, the combination of both techniques is\ndiscussed in order to obtain a more efficient global coverage plan. This\nanalysis was conceived to be implemented with the soybean crop weeding robot\ndeveloped at CIFASIS (CONICET-UNR).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sOjapak5x7pzTJdiIEx-IzY5NMGLzfQ-nZ9sihyn0eg","pdfSize":"5200633"}
