The nature of the energy dissipation is usually\ngoverned by partial differential equations that have been described, such as\nNavier-Stokes Equations, although usually in climate modeling, the Kolmogorov\nturbulence cascading approximation leads towards an isotropic representation.\nIn recent years, Meneveau et al. have proposed to go away from Kolmogorov\nassumptions and propose multifractal models where we can account for a new\nanisotropic representation. Our research aims to use Direct Numerical\nSimulations (DNS) from the JHU Turbulence Database and Large Eddy Simulations\n(LES) we simulated using OpenFOAM to predict how accurate these simulations are\nin replicating Meneveau experimental procedures with numerical simulations\nusing the same rigorous mathematical approaches. Modeling turbulence cascading\nusing higher fidelity data will advance the field and produce faster and better\nremote sensing metrics. We have written computer code to analyze DNS and LES\ndata and study the multifractal nature of energy dissipation. The box-counting\nmethod is used to identify the multifractal dimension spectrum of the DNS and\nLES data in every direction to follow Meneveau work to represent\nturbulence-cascading effects in the atmosphere better.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"imk67hPkRtB2QWWEbjgV3G4OmPV_H5fyqBu7jKG7vEo","pdfSize":"1417611"}
