  "abstract": "  We use Matsuki's decomposition for symmetric pairs $(G, H)$ of (not\nnecessarily compact) reductive Lie groups to construct the radial parts for\ninvariant differential operators acting on matrix-spherical functions. As an\napplication, we employ this machinery to formulate an alternative,\nmathematically rigorous approach to obtaining radial parts of Casimir operators\nthat appear in the theory of conformal blocks, which avoids poorly defined\nanalytical continuations from the compact quotient cases. To exemplify how this\nworks, after reviewing the presentation of conformal 4-point correlation\nfunctions via matrix-spherical functions for the corresponding symmetric pair,\nwe for the first time provide a complete analysis of the Casimir radial part\ndecomposition in the case of Lorentzian signature. As another example, we\nrevisit the Casimir reduction in the case of conformal blocks for two scalar\ndefects of equal dimension. We argue that Matsuki's decomposition thus provides\na proper mathematical framework for analysing the correspondence between\nCasimir equations and the Calogero-Sutherland-type models, first discovered by\none of the authors and Schomerus.\n",
