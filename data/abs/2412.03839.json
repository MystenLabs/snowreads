FAS represents any software-controlled fluidic, conductive or\ndielectric structure that can dynamically alter antenna's shape and position to\nchange the gain, the radiation pattern, the operating frequency, and other\ncritical radiation characteristics. With its capability, it is highly\nanticipated that FAS can contribute greatly to the upcoming sixth generation\n(6G) wireless networks. This article substantiates this thought by addressing\nfour major questions: 1) Is FAS crucial to 6G? 2) How to characterize FAS? 3)\nWhat are the applications of FAS? 4) What are the relevant challenges and\nfuture research directions? In particular, five promising research directions\nthat underscore the potential of FAS are discussed. We conclude this article by\nshowcasing the impressive performance of FAS.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"clXNor5XleClW3i-pD4rP-uBA_QTHbN-oSLUa3jJY9o","pdfSize":"2263393"}
