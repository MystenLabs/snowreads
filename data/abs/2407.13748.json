To tackle this problem, many methods adopt weakly supervised 3D object\ndetection that estimates 3D boxes by leveraging 2D boxes and\nscene/class-specific priors. However, these approaches generally depend on\nsophisticated manual priors, which is hard to generalize to novel categories\nand scenes. In this paper, we are motivated to propose a general approach,\nwhich can be easily adapted to new scenes and/or classes. A unified framework\nis developed for learning 3D object detectors from RGB images and associated 2D\nboxes. In specific, we propose three general components: prior injection module\nto obtain general object geometric priors from LLM model, 2D space projection\nconstraint to minimize the discrepancy between the boundaries of projected 3D\nboxes and their corresponding 2D boxes on the image plane, and 3D space\ngeometry constraint to build a Point-to-Box alignment loss to further refine\nthe pose of estimated 3D boxes. Experiments on KITTI and SUN-RGBD datasets\ndemonstrate that our method yields surprisingly high-quality 3D bounding boxes\nwith only 2D annotation.
