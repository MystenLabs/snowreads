  "abstract": "  The minimum positive co-degree of a nonempty $r$-graph $H$, denoted by\n$\\delta_{r-1}^+(H)$, is the largest integer $k$ such that for every $(r-1)$-set\n$S \\subset V(H)$, if $S$ is contained in a hyperedge of $H$, then $S$ is\ncontained in at least $k$ hyperedges of $H$. Given a family $\\mathcal{F}$ of\n$r$-graphs, the positive co-degree Tur\\'an function\n$\\mathrm{co^+ex}(n,\\mathcal{F})$ is the maximum of $\\delta_{r-1}^+(H)$ over all\n$n$-vertex $r$-graphs $H$ containing no member of $\\mathcal{F}$. The positive\nco-degree density of $\\mathcal{F}$ is $\\gamma^+(\\mathcal{F}) = \\underset{n\n\\rightarrow \\infty}{\\lim} \\frac{\\mathrm{co^+ex}(n,\\mathcal{F})}{n}.$ While the\nexistence of $\\gamma^+(\\mathcal{F})$ is proved for all families $\\mathcal{F}$,\nonly few positive co-degree densities are known exactly.\n  For a fixed $r \\geq 2$, we call $\\alpha \\in [0,1]$ an achievable value if\nthere exists a family of $r$-graphs $\\mathcal{F}$ with $\\gamma^+(\\mathcal{F}) =\n\\alpha$, and call $\\alpha$ a jump if for some $\\delta > 0$, there is no family\n$\\mathcal{F}$ with $\\gamma^+(\\mathcal{F}) \\in (\\alpha, \\alpha + \\delta)$.\nHalfpap, Lemons, and Palmer showed that every $\\alpha \\in [0, \\frac{1}{r})$ is\na jump. We extend this result by showing that every $\\alpha \\in [0, \\frac{2}{2r\n-1})$ is a jump. We also show that for $r = 3$, the set of achievable values is\ninfinite, more precisely, $\\frac{k-2}{2k-3}$ for every $k \\geq 4$ is\nachievable. Finally, we determine two additional achievable values for $r=3$\nusing flag algebra calculations.\n",
