Although HTE estimation methods aim to improve accuracy, how to\nprovide explicit subgroup descriptions remains unclear, hindering data\ninterpretation and strategic intervention management. In this paper, we propose\nCURLS, a novel rule learning method leveraging HTE, which can effectively\ndescribe subgroups with significant treatment effects. Specifically, we frame\ncausal rule learning as a discrete optimization problem, finely balancing\ntreatment effect with variance and considering the rule interpretability. We\ndesign an iterative procedure based on the minorize-maximization algorithm and\nsolve a submodular lower bound as an approximation for the original.\nQuantitative experiments and qualitative case studies verify that compared with\nstate-of-the-art methods, CURLS can find subgroups where the estimated and true\neffects are 16.1% and 13.8% higher and the variance is 12.0% smaller, while\nmaintaining similar or better estimation accuracy and rule interpretability.\nCode is available at https://osf.io/zwp2k/.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"B8Pi2YN1QeIpXRz2j3m-O9mkrKr0ULw6h6cRzy96G_g","pdfSize":"1442878"}
