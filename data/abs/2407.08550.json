We organize production operations within a\nhierarchical framework based on the automation pyramid. Atomic operation\nfunctionalities are modeled as microservices, which are executed through\ninterface invocation within a dedicated digital twin system. This allows for a\nscalable and flexible foundation for orchestrating production processes. In\nthis digital twin system, low-level, hardware-specific data is semantically\nenriched and made interpretable for LLMs for production planning and control\ntasks. Large language model agents are systematically prompted to interpret\nthese production-specific data and knowledge. Upon receiving a user request or\nidentifying a triggering event, the LLM agents generate a process plan. This\nplan is then decomposed into a series of atomic operations, executed as\nmicroservices within the real-world automation system. We implement this\noverall approach on an automated modular production facility at our laboratory,\ndemonstrating how the LLMs can handle production planning and control tasks\nthrough a concrete case study. This results in an intuitive production facility\nwith higher levels of task automation and flexibility. Finally, we reveal the\nseveral limitations in realizing the full potential of the large language\nmodels in autonomous systems and point out promising benefits.
