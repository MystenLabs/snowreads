We demonstrate that if the total energy is\nnegative, every collision-free solution has an infinite number of velocity\nsyzygies. Specifically, the velocities of the three bodies become parallel\nwithin every interval of time containing three consecutive syzygies. Using\ncomparison theory for matrix Riccati equations, we derive new upper and lower\nbounds on the moments when syzygies occur.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EWGNAlR5Lkc4fZmBmN92j4nk39W3brS9sRKu22eKV4s","pdfSize":"306812"}
