The most\ndirect experimental method for studying this property of infinite nuclear\nmatter is to probe the isoscalar giant monopole resonance (ISGMR) in finite\nnuclei. This work explores the use of 6Li as a probe to study the ISGMR in\nseveral stable nuclei: 58Ni, 90Zr, 116Sn, and 208Pb, as complementary to using\ninelastic scattering of {\\alpha}-particles, which has been used to great effect\nover the last several decades. Elastic and inelastic scattering data for these\ntargets were collected with 343-MeV 6Li beams. In all nuclei studied in this\nwork, the ISGMR strength distributions extracted from multipole decomposition\nanalyses of the inelastic scattering spectra agree very well with the\npreviously measured ISGMR responses from {\\alpha}-particle scattering,\nestablishing the feasibility of employing 6Li inelastic scattering in\ninvestigations of the ISGMR.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"87GEjlxsIn32uyzqSdKhr1k78VdARR_5qwuPtGOxacs","pdfSize":"719656"}
