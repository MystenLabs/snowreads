The vast proliferation of\ntime-series data across a wide range of fields has increased the relevance of\nevaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of these distance measures. To\nprovide a comprehensive view of this field, this work considers over 100\nstate-of-the-art distance measures, classified into 7 categories: lock-step\nmeasures, sliding measures, elastic measures, kernel measures, feature-based\nmeasures, model-based measures, and embedding measures. Beyond providing\ncomprehensive mathematical frameworks, this work also delves into the\ndistinctions and applications across these categories for both univariate and\nmultivariate cases. By providing comprehensive collections and insights, this\nstudy paves the way for the future development of innovative time-series\ndistance measures.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Databases","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"TZ3U6RS9byj-dxO_pzQThwLgZYbmElPscbhB6h5A0Do","pdfSize":"3544429"}
