In this work we\nstudy the extension of this strategy to gauge theories. We consider $U(1)$\ngauge theories with $N_g$ neutral Majorana fermions $\\chi_a$, $N_f$ charge-1\nbosons $\\phi_i$ and $N_f\\times N_g$ charge-1 Dirac fermions $\\psi_{ia}$ in the\n$d=4-2\\epsilon$ expansion. Analytically continuing to $N_g=\\frac12$\nschematically matches the Lagrangian and matter content of $3d$ $\\mathcal{N}=1$\nSQED, and we check whether this match can be made rigorous. We compute\nanomalous dimensions of $\\chi_a$ up to two loops and of meson operators up to\none loop at the fixed points, and compare to expectations from SUSY. While we\nfind obstructions to SUSY at small $N_f$, at large $N_f$ the observables\napproach the expected values at a SUSY fixed point. This may allow for checks\nof $3d$ $\\mathcal{N}=1$ IR dualities between gauge theories.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WnGy65c-BEBHLyXmmvive2Clorw6mzVaGF7bJRpO-TE","pdfSize":"799319"}
