Deep generative\nmodels achieve top performance in this task, assuming enough labelled\ntrajectories are available for training. To this end, large amounts of\nsynthetically generated, labelled trajectories exist (e.g., generated by video\ngames). However, such trajectories are not meant to represent pedestrian motion\nrealistically and are ineffective at training a predictive model. We propose a\nmethod and an architecture to augment synthetic trajectories at training time\nand with an adversarial approach. We show that trajectory augmentation at\ntraining time unleashes significant gains when a state-of-the-art generative\nmodel is evaluated over real-world trajectories.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"f__t1zNeZmtOsGlZtDWh33G3irVAspl9MmF99SoCHZ0","pdfSize":"1545716"}
