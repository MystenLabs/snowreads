  "abstract": "  Tuning the spatial extent of directional thermal emission across an\narbitrary, and fixed spectral bandwidth is a fundamentally enabling capability\nfor a range of emerging applications such as thermophotovoltaics, thermal\nimaging, and radiative cooling. However, previous experimental demonstrations\nwere limited to narrow bandwidths, and the resonance frequency itself changed\nsignificantly as a function of the reconfigured directional response. Here, we\ndemonstrate thermo-optic tuning of directional infrared emissivity using\nInAs-based gradient ENZ materials functioning as broadband directional thermal\nemitters whose angular selectivity can be modified via thermal free-carrier\neffects. We experimentally demonstrate two emitters achieving a 5{\\deg} and\n10{\\deg} increase in the angular extent of their directional emissivity in the\np-polarization across a prescribed, broad wavelength range of operation (12.5\nto 15$\\mu$m), for moderate temperatures below 400 K. Temperature-driven control\nof directional emissivity offers a new mode of post-fabrication control of\nradiative heat transfer that may in turn enable novel device functionalities.\n",
