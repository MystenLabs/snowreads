(2) Deletions of nonelements are prohibited, i.e., it is prohibited to\ndelete $x$ if $x$ is not currently a member of the dataset. Under these\nconditions, the space required for the approximate representation of a datasets\nof cardinality $n$ with a false-positive probability of $\\epsilon^{+}$ is at\nmost $(1+o(1))n\\cdot\\log_2 (1/\\epsilon^{+}) + O(n)$ bits [Bender et al., 2018;\nBercea and Even, 2019].\n  We prove that if these conditions are lifted, then the space required for the\napproximate representation of datasets of cardinality $n$ from a universe of\ncardinality $u$ is at least $\\frac 12 \\cdot (1-\\epsilon^{+} -\\frac 1n)\\cdot\n\\log \\binom{u}{n} -O(n)$ bits.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LFfzaDZM8J6i5Ajb5GZUqcSicQX2l4rDBeY05l4f5G8","pdfSize":"218395"}
