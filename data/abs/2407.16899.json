Initially, we present a taxonomy of these\ndevices and illustrate it with a set of scenarios and personas. Later, we\npropose a generic architecture for the implementation of AIMEs and present some\nexamples from the scenarios. We show that the proposed framework and\narchitecture are a valid tool for the study of intelligent musical devices.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Hhg1-yEFFMA3SC0zCfi-am8JwF0oYAY5TeckTswgkRE","pdfSize":"597670"}
