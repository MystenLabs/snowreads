For superconducting qubits, the measurement process involves the\neffective manipulation of the joint qubit-resonator dynamics, and should\nideally provide the highest quality for qubit state discrimination with the\nshortest readout pulse and resonator reset time. Here, we harness model-free\nreinforcement learning (RL) together with a tailored training environment to\nachieve this multi-pronged optimization task. We demonstrate on the IBM quantum\ndevice that the measurement pulse obtained by the RL agent not only\nsuccessfully achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an assignment error of\n$(4.6 \\pm 0.4)\\times10^{-3}$, but also executes the readout and the subsequent\nresonator reset almost 3x faster than the system's default process.\nFurthermore, the learned waveforms are robust against realistic parameter\ndrifts and follow a generalized analytical form, making them readily\nimplementable in practice with no significant computation overhead. Our results\nprovide an effective readout strategy to boost the performance of\nsuperconducting quantum processors and demonstrate the prowess of RL in\nproviding optimal and experimentally informed solutions for complex quantum\ninformation processing tasks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZjABUQX6qfCXvGryzbarzPbCVODtSl4rTlqyIAleEyo","pdfSize":"2179513"}
