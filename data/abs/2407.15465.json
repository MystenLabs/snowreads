In this\nstudy, high-fidelity numerical simulations are conducted to analyze the\nsubcritical roughness-induced laminar-turbulent transition at the leading-edge\nattachment-line boundary layer of a blunt swept body under hypersonic\nconditions. This simulation represents a significant advancement by\nsuccessfully reproducing the complete leading-edge contamination process\ninduced by surface roughness elements in a realistic configuration, thereby\nproviding previously unattainable insights. Two roughness elements of different\nheights are examined. For the lower-height roughness element, additional\nunsteady perturbations are required to trigger a transition in the wake,\nsuggesting that the flow field around the roughness element acts as a\ndisturbance amplifier for upstream perturbations. Conversely, a higher\nroughness element can independently induce the transition. A low-frequency\nabsolute instability is detected behind the roughness, leading to the formation\nof streaks. The secondary instabilities of these streaks are identified as the\ndirect cause of the final transition.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8cLzb85IdysG6oj9DbSCbq_NmDiu7hpa9wi3jCjNdzs","pdfSize":"25753410"}
