Here, we propose an AI-enabled, rapid, constant-time-overhead\nrearrangement protocol, and we experimentally assemble defect-free 2D and 3D\natom arrays with up to 2024 atoms with a constant time cost of 60 ms. The AI\nmodel calculates the holograms for real-time atom rearrangement. With precise\ncontrols over both position and phase, a high-speed spatial light modulator\nmoves all the atoms simultaneously. This protocol can be readily used to\ngenerate defect-free arrays of tens of thousands of atoms with current\ntechnologies, and become a useful toolbox for quantum error correction.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"af5ifwmDWqiH3ilnSUxpQORLh9S1MB9u5ukYLjq_HTM","pdfSize":"19928640"}
