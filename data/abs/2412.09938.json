  "abstract": "  Respiratory rate is a vital sign indicating various health conditions.\nTraditional contact-based measurement methods are often uncomfortable, and\nalternatives like respiratory belts and smartwatches have limitations in cost\nand operability. Therefore, a non-contact method based on Pixel Intensity\nChanges (PIC) with RGB camera images is proposed. Experiments involved 3 sizes\nof bounding boxes, 3 filter options (Laplacian, Sobel, and no filter), and 2\ncorner detection algorithms (ShiTomasi and Harris), with tracking using the\nLukas-Kanade algorithm. Eighteen configurations were tested on 67 subjects in\nstatic and dynamic conditions. The best results in static conditions were\nachieved with the Medium Bounding box, Sobel Filter, and Harris Method (MAE:\n0.85, RMSE: 1.49). In dynamic conditions, the Large Bounding box with no filter\nand ShiTomasi, and Medium Bounding box with no filter and Harris, produced the\nlowest MAE (0.81) and RMSE (1.35)\n",
