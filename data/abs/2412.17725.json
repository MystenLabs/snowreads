The formed stars are injected into bulges and give rise\nto perturbation of bulges. In this paper, we investigate the issues of\nnon-rotating, spherically symmetric bulges under the perturbation of fast,\nmassive outflows with stars formed inside. We show that the potential\nperturbation of outflows together with injection and dynamical friction of\nthese stars could drive bulge oscillations. Still, we find non-zero radial\nvelocity of bulges will be driven by the episodic outflows of AGNs and after\nthe AGN quenched, the radial velocity will tend to zero within a timescale\n$\\sim\\tau_{\\rm AGN}$, which is the AGN's lifetime. For some typical values of\nbulges and AGNs, we find the expansion and contraction velocities are of a few\n$10\\,\\rm km\\,s^{-1}$ for $10^{10}\\,M_\\odot$ bulges and mass outflowing rate\n$500\\,M_\\odot/\\rm yr$, which would give observational signatures.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tVBPb7sEN1iNvWu7imFKj9fyooEzjAPtkBo8n_eqWTU","pdfSize":"618616"}
