Tracking the system's state and\nparameters based on a physical model is a common task for which filtering\nalgorithms, such as Kalman filters and their non-linear extensions, are\ntypically used. However, many of these filters use assumptions on the\ntransition probabilities or the covariance model, which can lead to\ninaccuracies in non-linear systems. We will show the application of a\nstochastic coupling filter that can approximate arbitrary transition densities\nunder non-Gaussian noise. The filter is based on transport maps, which couple\nthe approximation densities to a user-chosen reference density, allowing for\nstraightforward sampling and evaluation of probabilities.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ru7GIEH_0-dYSSgHGedOa-cc79WhrXVfFd5Pz_Ehygo","pdfSize":"566559","objectId":"0xaf9d172a2a650eacc6eee3b91df7d3897c3668fa5c19b95250d5ba1fb0f7a73e","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
