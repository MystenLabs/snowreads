But with it comes uncertainties that must be\nmanaged in order to guarantee Service Level Agreements. Service observability\ncan help the environment better deal with uncertainties, delivering relevant\nand up-to-date information in a timely manner to support decision making.\nObservability is considered a superset of monitoring since it uses not only\nperformance metrics, but also other instrumentation domains such as logs and\ntraces. However, as Fog Computing is typically characterised by\nresource-constrained nodes and network uncertainties, increasing observability\nin fog can be risky due to the additional load injected into a restricted\nenvironment. There is no work in the literature that evaluated fog\nobservability. In this paper, we first outline the challenges of achieving\nobservability in a Fog environment, based on which we present a formal\ndefinition of fog observability. Subsequently, a real-world Fog Computing\ntestbed running a smart city use case is deployed, and an empirical evaluation\nof fog observability using open-source tools is presented. The results show\nthat under certain conditions, it is viable to provide observability in a Fog\nComputing environment using open-source tools, although it is necessary to\ncontrol the overhead modifying their default configuration according to the\napplication characteristics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"nLYmdtWEcCf1sJtnMMRImZnmWQcMsfO0bJVVI37qABI","pdfSize":"2222054"}
