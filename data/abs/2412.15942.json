Each layer represents a social relationship within a system of finitely\nmany individuals and finitely many layers. An agent can redistribute their\ngarbage and offload it onto their social neighbors in each layer at each time\nstep. We study the game from a mathematical perspective rather than applying\ngame theory. We investigate the scenario where all agents choose to average\ntheir garbage before offloading an equal proportion of it onto their social\nneighbors. It turns out that the garbage amounts of all agents in all layers\nconverge to the initial average of all agents across all layers when all social\ngraphs are connected and have order at least three. This implies that the\nwinners are those agents whose initial total garbage exceeds the average total\ngarbage across all agents.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fg6I0nwej9iiATuK2rbvDP8R_9opeB83YBLFASShXwI","pdfSize":"101128"}
