In this work, we leverage\nthe QSVT framework in two directions. We first show that the QSVT framework can\naccelerate one recently introduced quantum power method, which substantially\nimproves its running time. Additionally, we incorporate several elementary\nnumerical integration techniques, such as the rectangular method, Monte Carlo\nmethod, and quadrature method, into the QSVT framework, which results in\npolynomial speedup with respect to the size or the number of points of the\ngrid. Our results thus provide further examples to demonstrate the potential of\nthe QSVT and how it may enhance quantum algorithmic tasks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ixF6gXh1fuqBy1DiEdupdq_BG2NZl2m8OBerwHj8WC4","pdfSize":"557890"}
