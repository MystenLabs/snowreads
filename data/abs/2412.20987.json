In this paper, we question this lack of attention from black-box\nattacks to robust models. We establish a framework to evaluate the\neffectiveness of recent black-box attacks against both top-performing and\nstandard defense mechanisms, on the ImageNet dataset. Our empirical evaluation\nreveals the following key findings: (1) the most advanced black-box attacks\nstruggle to succeed even against simple adversarially trained models; (2)\nrobust models that are optimized to withstand strong white-box attacks, such as\nAutoAttack, also exhibits enhanced resilience against black-box attacks; and\n(3) robustness alignment between the surrogate models and the target model\nplays a key factor in the success rate of transfer-based attacks\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Pi8MLB0YJp2eB0Wa4xQciHlAB5C3wUvjDCUJWac0vj8","pdfSize":"567472"}
