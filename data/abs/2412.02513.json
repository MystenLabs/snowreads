  "abstract": "  The quantile-crossing spectrum is the spectrum of quantile-crossing processes\ncreated from a time series by the indicator function that shows whether or not\nthe time series lies above or below a given quantile at a given time. This\nbivariate function of frequency and quantile level provides a richer view of\nserial dependence than that offered by the ordinary spectrum. We propose a new\nmethod for estimating the quantile-crossing spectrum as a bivariate function of\nfrequency and quantile level. The proposed method, called spline autoregression\n(SAR), jointly fits an AR model to the quantile-crossing series across multiple\nquantiles; the AR coefficients are represented as spline functions of the\nquantile level and penalized for their roughness. Numerical experiments show\nthat when the underlying spectrum is smooth in quantile level the proposed\nmethod is able to produce more accurate estimates in comparison with the\nalternative that ignores the smoothness.\n",
