We frame both tasks as\nprediction problems and develop a difficulty classification model using labeled\nexamples, transfer learning, and large language models, demonstrating superior\naccuracy compared to previous approaches. For simplification, we evaluate the\ntrade-off between simplification quality and meaning preservation, comparing\nzero-shot and fine-tuned performances of large language models. We show that\nmeaningful text simplifications can be obtained with limited fine-tuning. Our\nexperiments are conducted on French texts, but our methods are\nlanguage-agnostic and directly applicable to other foreign languages.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YoZjELW4RrK64OVcDNsd8-MmZsw4wESpRjOijJiTuC8","pdfSize":"409835"}
