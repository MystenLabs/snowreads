ReLU neural networks induce a piecewise linear decomposition of their\ninput space called the canonical polyhedral complex. It has previously been\nestablished that it is decidable whether a ReLU neural network is piecewise\nlinear Morse. In order to expand computational tools for analyzing the\ntopological properties of ReLU neural networks, and to harness the strengths of\ndiscrete Morse theory, we introduce a schematic for translating between a given\npiecewise linear Morse function (e.g. parameters of a ReLU neural network) on a\ncanonical polyhedral complex and a compatible (``relatively perfect\") discrete\nMorse function on the same complex. Our approach is constructive, producing an\nalgorithm that can be used to determine if a given vertex in a canonical\npolyhedral complex corresponds to a piecewise linear Morse critical point.\nFurthermore we provide an algorithm for constructing a consistent discrete\nMorse pairing on cells in the canonical polyhedral complex which contain this\nvertex. We additionally provide some new realizability results with respect to\nsublevel set topology in the case of shallow ReLU neural networks.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Computer Science/Computational Geometry","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"GOBeB13WJwK3Tzf6mR0h1MMwvwpuxhXUw2PWfXJC64I","pdfSize":"1012265"}
