This study introduces an intersection-aware\nemergency medical service (EMS) accessibility model to evaluate and improve EMV\ntravel times across NYC. Integrating intersection density metrics, road network\ncharacteristics, and demographic data, the model identifies vulnerable regions\nwith inadequate EMS coverage. The analysis reveals that densely interconnected\nareas, such as parts of Staten Island, Queens, and Manhattan, experience\nsignificant accessibility deficits due to intersection delays and sparse\nmedical infrastructure. To address these challenges, this study explores the\nadoption of EMVLight, a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, which\ndemonstrates the potential to reduce intersection delays by 50\\%, increasing\nEMS accessibility to 95\\% of NYC residents within the critical benchmark of 4\nminutes. Results indicate that advanced traffic signal control (TSC) systems\ncan alleviate congestion-induced delays while improving equity in emergency\nresponse. The findings provide actionable insights for urban planning and\npolicy interventions to enhance EMS accessibility and ensure timely care for\nunderserved populations.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computer Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GBvlpEC4Ehr5PFgwGaCPsgQEUtv1n37ebpX8bHYCnA8","pdfSize":"23340759"}
