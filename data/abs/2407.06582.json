It is shown that\nthe resulting theories can be UV complete after bypassing typical Hagedorn-like\nsingularities if the coefficients of the deformations are fine-tuned. In this\nway, we have discovered that only two new UV complete QFTs are associated with\na M_p (p=3,4,...) minimal CFT based on the integrable structure of the RSOS\nscattering theory. One is the massless Z_{p-1} parafermionic sinh-Gordon models\n(PShG) with a self-dual coupling constant. This correspondence is confirmed by\nshowing that the scale-dependent vacuum energies computed by the thermodynamic\nBethe ansatz based on the S-matrices match those from the quantization\nconditions for the PShG models using the reflection amplitudes. The other UV\nQFT is reached from M_p by following the roaming trajectory of the Z_{p-1}\nparafermionic minimal series.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MIfGtXwgvKE3EdgozSButlhLhs16SDiTFGHIV3eqy_0","pdfSize":"714211"}
