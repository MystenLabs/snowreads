  "abstract": "  In a previous paper, we introduced an axiomatic system for information\nthermodynamics, deriving an entropy function that includes both thermodynamic\nand information components. From this function we derived an entropic\nprobability distribution for certain uniform collections of states. Here we\nextend the concept of entropic probability to more general collections,\naugmenting the states by reservoir and context states. This leads to an\nabstract concept of free energy and establishes a relation between free energy,\ninformation erasure, and generalized work.\n",
