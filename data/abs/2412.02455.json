For both negative and positive signs of\n{\\Lambda} a classification of trajectories is proposed, with entries based on\ndifferent solutions of the trajectory equation, obtained by the expansion of\nthe corresponding algebraic curve in Puiseux series. We also provide some\nspecific types of trajectories which correspond to different values of the\ncosmological constant. In the case of negative values of the cosmological\nconstant its upper limit is estimated from the galaxy rotation curves\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Yukfk8cspAZaXAlktB_5D6V0Cki0WFhNBWhAdceY42c","pdfSize":"741491"}
