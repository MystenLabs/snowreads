  "abstract": "  To achieve the federal goal to make half of all new vehicles sold in the U.S.\nin 2030 zero-emissions vehicles, the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT)\nFederal Highway Administration (FHWA) has employed the National Electric\nVehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program, which aims to promote an\ninterconnected network of publicly accessible electric vehicle (EV) charging\nstations. By analyzing panel data on a subset of U.S. counties, this paper\nexamines the relationship between different classes of EV charging stations and\nplug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and battery electric vehicles (BEVs).\nThrough an instrumental approach to identify potential endogeneity, this study\nsuggests that public charging stations and the implications of the NEVI Formula\nProgram might not provide the optimistic benefit expected in achieving the\nfederal goal. This finding indicates the need to reevaluate current strategies\nand explore additional incentives to enhance EV adoption and the effectiveness\nof public charging infrastructure.\n",
