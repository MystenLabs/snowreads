  "abstract": "  We obtain the minimax rate for a mean location model with a bounded\nstar-shaped set $K \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^n$ constraint on the mean, in an\nadversarially corrupted data setting with Gaussian noise. We assume an unknown\nfraction $\\epsilon<1/2-\\kappa$ for some fixed $\\kappa\\in(0,1/2]$ of the $N$\nobservations are arbitrarily corrupted. We obtain a minimax risk up to\nproportionality constants under the squared $\\ell_2$ loss of\n$\\max(\\eta^{*2},\\sigma^2\\epsilon^2)\\wedge d^2$ with \\begin{align*}\n  \\eta^* = \\sup \\bigg\\{\\eta : \\frac{N\\eta^2}{\\sigma^2} \\leq \\log\nM^{\\operatorname{loc}}(\\eta,c)\\bigg\\}, \\end{align*} where $\\log\nM^{\\operatorname{loc}}(\\eta,c)$ denotes the local entropy of the set $K$, $d$\nis the diameter of $K$, $\\sigma^2$ is the variance, and $c$ is some\nsufficiently large absolute constant. A variant of our algorithm achieves the\nsame rate for settings with known or symmetric sub-Gaussian noise, with a\nsmaller breakdown point, still of constant order. We further study the case of\nunknown sub-Gaussian noise and show that the rate is slightly slower:\n$\\max(\\eta^{*2},\\sigma^2\\epsilon^2\\log(1/\\epsilon))\\wedge d^2$. We generalize\nour results to the case when $K$ is star-shaped but unbounded.\n",
