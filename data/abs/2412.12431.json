We present old and new\nresults about the representation theories of the truncations\n$KQ/\\mathcal{A}^L$, $L \\in \\mathbb{N}$, tracking their development as $L$ goes\nto infinity. The goal is to gain a better understanding of the category of\nthose finite dimensional $KQ$-modules which arise as finitely generated modules\nover admissible quotients of $KQ$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nBwVesCWiDOUPgx5wXh1TuJPFoRP5eoWRvBhbUIoZoI","pdfSize":"326126"}
