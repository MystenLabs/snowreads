We describe the topology at infinity of the related character variety.\nWe use asymptotic abelianization of harmonic bundles away from the ramification\ndivisor and an equivariant approach near the branch points to find the WKB\n(also known as Liouville--Green or phase-integral) expansion of the involved\nmaps. We analyze the Stokes phenomenon governing their behavior.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8K3iNzaZysfm3Z3MAdT-6glEp44mGug4Fl4exKut9BY","pdfSize":"805136"}
