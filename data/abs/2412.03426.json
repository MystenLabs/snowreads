Therefore reliable measurements\nof the grid and aperture geometry over the lifetime are necessary to understand\nand predict the behavior of the system. Many different methods of measurement\nwere introduced over the years to tackle the challenges encountered when\ndiagnosing single electrodes or the whole assembly at once.\n  Modern industrial X-ray micro-computer-tomographs (uCT) offer the possibility\nto obtain a three-dimensional density map of a grid-system or it's components\ndown to microscopic scales of precision. This information allows a spectrum of\nnew diagnostic opportunities, like complete verification of the manufactured\nparts against CAD models, detecting internal defects or density-changes or the\ninspection of the assembled ion-optics and its internal alignment, which is\nnormally prohibited by the lack of optical access to all parts at once. Hence\nuCT imaging is a promising tool to complement established methods and open up\nnew experimental possibilities, however it also has its own weaknesses and\npitfalls. The methods developed for grid-erosion and -geometry measurement of a\nsmall state-of-the-art radio-frequency-ion-thruster, the obstacles encountered\nalong the route will be discussed and possible solutions demonstrated.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1GmOoBDe_UJygo8fz1WRZjM3uTgzRpKD8GVK7kzYyUI","pdfSize":"7123648"}
