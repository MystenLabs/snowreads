So, it's\ncrucial to distinguish between edible and poisonous mushrooms within the\nexisting species. This is essential due to the significant demand for mushrooms\nin people's daily meals and their potential contributions to medical science.\nThis work presents a novel Quantum Vision Transformer architecture that\nleverages quantum computing to enhance mushroom classification performance. By\nimplementing specialized quantum self-attention mechanisms using Variational\nQuantum Circuits, the proposed architecture achieved 92.33% and 99.24% accuracy\nbased on their category and their edibility respectively. This demonstrates the\nsuccess of the proposed architecture in reducing false negatives for toxic\nmushrooms, thus ensuring food safety. Our research highlights the potential of\nQMViT for improving mushroom classification as a whole.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"ubEhGX3L9Wjh6P3t_KrwQ7w3klmVnuySYYBGRsJ11vo","pdfSize":"1638628"}
