  "abstract": "  Recent observations by Mistele et al. show that the circular velocity curves\nof isolated galaxies remain flat out to the largest radii probed so far, i.e.\n$\\approx 1$ Mpc. The velocity decline beyond the expected virial radius is not\nobserved. These results imply that the galaxy halo is in thermal equilibrium\neven at large radii where particles did not have time to relax. The galaxies\nmust have already formed in the isothermal state. How is this possible? In the\npresent note we try to understand the formation of galaxies with warm dark\nmatter in the expanding universe.\n",
