Addressing the issue of class imbalance and\nlack of diversity in existing respiratory sound datasets, our study employs a\nlightweight and highly accurate model, using a two-dimensional label set to\nrepresent multiple respiratory sound characteristics. Our method achieved a\n59.2% ICBHI score in the four-category task on the ICBHI2017 dataset,\ndemonstrating its advantages in terms of lightweight and high accuracy. This\nstudy not only improves the accuracy of automatic diagnosis of lung respiratory\nsound abnormalities but also opens new possibilities for clinical applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3-Q8St-YjdEKTTUoqmZSQ8rQdecaoeVHQu8v-b2F9mI","pdfSize":"1234214"}
