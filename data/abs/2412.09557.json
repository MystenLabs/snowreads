Quantum kernel methods promise efficient learning by encoding feature\nmaps into exponentially large Hilbert spaces inherent in quantum systems. In\nthis work we implement quantum kernels on a 10-qubit star-topology register in\na nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) platform. We experimentally encode classical\ndata in the evolution of multiple quantum coherence orders using data-dependent\nunitary transformations and then demonstrate one-dimensional regression and\ntwo-dimensional classification tasks. By extending the register to a\ndouble-layered star configuration, we propose an extended quantum kernel to\nhandle non-parametrized operator inputs. By numerically simulating the extended\nquantum kernel, we show classification of entangling and nonentangling\nunitaries. These results confirm that quantum kernels exhibit strong\ncapabilities in classical as well as quantum machine learning tasks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computer Science/Machine Learning","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nncl5lovClqHrp6JV6UTDPz5RGVQ67bPUWM07HDK-iM","pdfSize":"2207399"}
