The\nallowed spatial topologies for these examples are of the form $M \\# M$, where\n$M$ is any closed, oriented, irreducible $3$-manifold which is not spherical.\nThis complements the recent results of [19], where, instead of initial data\nmethods, global spacetime gluing arguments were used. The study of such\nexamples is sure to yield insight into Bartnik's cosmological splitting\nconjecture [1].\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qpHXZ6caWftOsWLSItQTSPia9jawdXByZwNIRdaUoXA","pdfSize":"125623","objectId":"0xad4eec6f4a6bc0b1a9722e2c3a8c6fac4c7242e71a338ff18731c0f1718246af","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
