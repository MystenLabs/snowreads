  "abstract": "  We study the effects of strategy-dependent time delays in deterministic and\nstochastic compartment models of the Snowdrift game. In replicator dynamics\nwith two compartments, adults and kindergarten, augmented by death rates,\nstationary states of population sizes and strategy frequencies depend\ncontinuously on time delays represented by transition rates between\ncompartments. In the corresponding birth-death Markov jump processes we observe\nthe novel behavior, time delays are beneficial for the cooperation strategy.\n",
