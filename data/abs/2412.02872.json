One important object used in the construction of geodesic\nnets is a balanced vertex, where the sum of unit tangent vectors along adjacent\nedges is zero. We prove the existence of a balanced vertex of a triangle (with\nthree unbalanced vertices) on a general two-dimensional Riemannian surface when\nall angles measure less than $2\\pi/3$, if the length of the sides of the\ntriangle is not too large. This property is a generalization for the existence\nof the Fermat point of a planar triangle.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"H0ZdEP2-Bav0s5HhfL-8owei4g-E8V7B7YTZ64-3vGI","pdfSize":"924220"}
