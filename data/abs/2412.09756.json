  "abstract": "  We propose $\\mathtt{PrivHP}$, a lightweight synthetic data generator with\n\\textit{differential privacy} guarantees. $\\mathtt{PrivHP}$ uses a novel\nhierarchical decomposition that approximates the input's cumulative\ndistribution function (CDF) in bounded memory. It balances hierarchy depth,\nnoise addition, and pruning of low-frequency subdomains while preserving\nfrequent ones. Private sketches estimate subdomain frequencies efficiently\nwithout full data access.\n  A key feature is the pruning parameter $k$, which controls the trade-off\nbetween space and utility. We define the skew measure $\\mathtt{tail}_k$,\ncapturing all but the top $k$ subdomain frequencies. Given a dataset\n$\\mathcal{X}$, $\\mathtt{PrivHP}$ uses $M=\\mathcal{O}(k\\log^2 |X|)$ space and,\nfor input domain $\\Omega = [0,1]$, ensures $\\varepsilon$-differential privacy.\nIt yields a generator with expected Wasserstein distance: \\[\n\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{\\log^2 M}{\\varepsilon n} +\n\\frac{||\\mathtt{tail}_k(\\mathcal{X})||_1}{M n}\\right) \\] from the empirical\ndistribution. This parameterized trade-off offers a level of flexibility\nunavailable in prior work. We also provide interpretable utility bounds that\naccount for hierarchy depth, privacy noise, pruning, and frequency estimation\nerrors.\n",
