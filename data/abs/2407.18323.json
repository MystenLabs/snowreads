Furthermore, reconfigurable\nintelligent surfaces (RIS) have been proposed to modify the wireless\npropagation environment and enhance system performance. Given the sensitivity\nto blockages and limited coverage range, RIS is particularly promising for THz\ncommunications. Active RIS can overcome the multiplicative fading effect in\nRIS-aided communications. In this paper, we explore active RIS-assisted THz\ncommunications. We formulate the ergodic rate, considering factors associated\nwith active RIS, including active noise and signal amplification, and THz\nsignals, including molecular absorption and beam misalignment\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qUC31dPS52doPn9oTN7wG_MJ5khYXw_r-3jONwgl_Hs","pdfSize":"397044"}
