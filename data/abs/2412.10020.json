Moreover, they represent\nthe noncommutative generalization of classical Orsntein-Uhlenbeck semigroups;\nanalogously to the classical case, GQMSs are uniquely determined by a \"drift\"\nmatrix $\\mathbf{Z}$ and a \"diffusion\" matrix $\\mathbf{C}$, together with a\ndisplacement vector $\\mathbf{\\zeta}$. In this work, we completely characterize\nthose GQMSs that admit a normal invariant state and we provide a description of\nthe set of normal invariant states; as a side result, we are able to\ncharacterize quadratic Hamiltonians admitting a ground state. Moreover, we\nstudy the behavior of such semigroups for long times: firstly, we clarify the\nrelationship between the decoherence-free subalgebra and the spectrum of\n$\\mathbf{Z}$. Then, we prove that environment-induced decoherence takes place\nand that the dynamics approaches an Hamiltonian closed evolution for long\ntimes; we are also able to determine the speed at which this happens. Finally,\nwe study convergence of ergodic means and recurrence and transience of the\nsemigroup.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JO_PL8FTeezjHcy3UVBCqPbZWJTsovW-W0vSPk0QiiQ","pdfSize":"394087"}
