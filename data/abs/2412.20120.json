  "abstract": "  The Gamma-Theta Conjecture states that if the domination number of a graph is\nequal to its eternal domination number, then it is also equal to its clique\ncovering number. This conjecture is known to be true for several graph classes,\nsuch as outerplanar graphs, subcubic graphs and $C_k$-free graphs, where $k \\in\n\\{3,4\\}$. In this paper, we prove the Conjecture for the class of planar\ngraphs.\n",
