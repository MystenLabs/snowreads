We study the coupling\nbetween the mechanics and permeability of a viscous and elastically-bendable\nmembrane, and a multi-component bulk fluid solution. An equation for the\ninternal entropy production for irreversibilities at the membrane is derived,\ndetermining the generalized thermodynamic forces and fluxes, from which we\nidentify the deviatoric stress as a novel driving force for permeability. A\ncomplete set of equations of motion, constitutive laws, and boundary conditions\nto model the lipid membrane and bulk fluid system are provided.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Z4a8TBTE3Z3e_RsVZCeaOq_0xQgJ4zafyqS9VdB3QQU","pdfSize":"1296913"}
