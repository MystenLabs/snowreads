An analysis of new echelle spectra, supported by a joint study of a\nDQZ velocity template NLTT 44303, confirms the orbital period and constrains\nthe mass ratio revealing a carbon-polluted DQ white dwarf that is up to ~6\npercent more massive than its hydrogen-rich DA companion. Our new model\natmosphere analysis of the DA and DQ components, constrained by an accurate\nGaia parallax measurement that places the binary at a distance of 57.8 pc,\nreveals lower mass and temperature than previously estimated for both\ncomponents, but with higher carbon and nitrogen abundances in the DQ\natmosphere. The two components are nearly coeval and could have been generated\nfollowing a single common envelope event.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wMMDiv01LYzghbQ5XcLS2O9NG5ywWfamzvKXKB1uwVo","pdfSize":"765395"}
