In 2023, Huang \\emph{et al.} (\\textit{Topology automaton of\nself-similar sets and its applications to metrical classifications},\nNonlinearity \\textbf{36} (2023), 2541-2566.) studied the H\\\"older and Lipschitz\nequivalence of a class of p.c.f. self-similar sets which are not totally\ndisconnected. The main tool they used is the so called topology automaton. In\nthis paper, we define topology automaton for Bara\\'nski carpets, and we show\nthat the method used in Huang \\emph{et al.} still works for the self-affine and\nnon-p.c.f. settings. As an application, we obtain a very general sufficient\ncondition for Bara\\'nski carpets to be H\\\"older (or Lipschitz) equivalent.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Computer Science/Formal Languages and Automata Theory","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"5SzzmRYCTdR0nEq1jTeqR091JMSghqxUNcDPtUWvb0M","pdfSize":"1335203"}
