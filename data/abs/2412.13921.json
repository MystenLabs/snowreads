In particular, we characterize the\nprobability distribution of the particle position and provide detailed\nexpressions for the mean square displacement and the kurtosis. We highlight\nnon-Gaussian behaviour even within the long-term limit carried over with an\nexcess of probability both in the central part and in the distribution's tails.\nMoreover, when one of the two diffusion coefficients assumes the value zero, we\nprovide evidence that the probability distribution develops a cusp. Most of our\nresults are analytical, and corroborated by numerical simulations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"BnLT9duY0gtHNkZrqUlu_AlKtorQMBoMp1pr4VfyzT8","pdfSize":"2752751"}
