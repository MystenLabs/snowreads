{"id":"2412.18745","title":"Metabolic scaling, life history, and the equal fitness paradigm","authors":"Joseph R. Burger","authorsParsed":[["Burger","Joseph R.",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Dec 2024 02:29:45 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-30","timestamp":1735093785000,"abstract":"  Natural selection has produced an extraordinary diversity of life histories\nspanning many orders of magnitude in body size, vital rates, and biological\ntimes. In general, big and cold organisms grow and reproduce slowly and live\nlong lives; small and warm organisms grow and reproduce quickly and live short\nlives. The Metabolic Theory of Ecology (MTE) predicts equal and opposite\nscaling exponents of mass-specific biological rates (e.g., respiration, growth,\nand reproduction) and times (e.g., development, lifespan, and generation) as a\nfunction of size. However, empirical support for these predictions varies\ndepending on trait and taxon. Here I: 1) provide background and mixed support\nfor the quarter-power scaling exponents for life history rates and times\npredicted by MTE, 2) discuss possible explanations, including effects of\nnatural selection on taxonomic and functional groups, and inadequate data for\nlife history traits, 3) briefly summarize the Equal Fitness Paradigm (EFP) as a\nunifying theory of bioenergetics, life history and demography that does not\ndepend on any particular allometric scalings, and 4) discuss ramifications of\nthe EFP for other biological phenomena, including physiological performance\nmetrics and trophic energetics of ecosystems. I draw mostly from my knowledge\nof mammals, yet in many cases the mammalian examples can be generalized to\nother organisms. I end with prospects for further evaluating and extending the\nEFP.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"3K_pGM5ZaSvMVia2X2FY0PiRCruZ9gi76DmV9cfYkzU","pdfSize":"1265371"}
