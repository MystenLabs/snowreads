Constructing the MCI Bloch\nHamiltonian as a symmetry-protected tensor product of two topologically\nnon-trivial parent Chern insulators (CIs), we study two-dimensional (2D) MCIs\nand introduce 3D mixed MCIs, constructed by requiring the two 2D parent\nHamiltonians share only one momentum component. We study the 2D MCI response to\ntime reversal symmetric flux insertion, observing a $4\\pi$ Aharonov-Bohm\neffect, relating these topological states to fractional quantum Hall states via\nthe effective field theory of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect. As part of this\nresponse, we observe evidence of quantisation of a proposed topological\ninvariant for compactified many-body states, to a rational number, suggesting\nhigher-dimensional topology may also be relevant. Finally, we study effects of\nbulk perturbations breaking the symmetry-protected tensor product structure of\nthe child Hamiltonian, finding the MCI evolves adiabatically into a topological\nskyrmion phase.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"O57Zu_qH2lAWhCdyTi1xbd4WC3x_qc1AsWWlSTTSlgc","pdfSize":"4292815"}
