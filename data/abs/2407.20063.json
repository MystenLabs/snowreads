We propose a unified\napproach, enabling to simultaneously address both the effective dynamics and\nnon-equilibrium phononic state, depending on the position of a confined sensing\n(and heating) probe at the surface of the mechanical device. We present an\nanalytical solution for a unidimensional resonator whose thermomechanical\ndeformation profile generally follows that of the mechanical losses. In\nparticular, we find that both the dynamics and the mechanical fluctuations\nstrongly depend on the loss distribution. The effect of the quantum\nfluctuations of the heat source is also discussed. Our approach provides a\nthorough, general platform for analyzing thermal back-action effects and their\nconsequences, which may be of significance for future development in\nultrasensitive nanomechanical research.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yYNWXr3D-l1Y_JYE2oNe-AoaP62qobOvUFZmNwXlf2Y","pdfSize":"2044176"}
