We demonstrate that localized\nelectrons provide the main contribution to the spin dynamics signal at low\ntemperatures below 15~K for small magnetic fields of only a few mT. The spin\nrelaxation of these electrons is determined by random effective magnetic fields\ndue to a contact spin interaction, namely the hyperfine interaction with the\nnuclei in MoSe$_2$ or the exchange interaction with the magnetic ions of the\nEuS film. From the magnetic field angular dependence of the spin polarization\nwe evaluate the anisotropy of the intervalley electron $g$-factor and the spin\nrelaxation time. The non-zero in-plane $g$-factor $|g_x|\\approx 0.1$, the value\nof which is comparable to its dispersion, is attributed to randomly localized\nelectrons in the MoSe$_2$ layer.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rM9BbsXT8Pv__A9h-vg2OBiizBF6ZqAvxuiKGpjvE94","pdfSize":"770915"}
