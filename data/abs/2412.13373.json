In the present\npaper we are mainly interested in quantum analogs of the Laplace and Casimir\noperators, which are invariant with respect to the action of the Quantum Groups\nU_q(sl(N)), provided R is the Drinfeld-Jimbo matrix. We prove that any such\noperator maps the characteristic subalgebra of a Reflection Equation algebra\ninto itself. Also, we define the notion of normal ordering for the quantum\ndifferential operators and prove an analog of the Wick theorem. As an important\ncorollary we find a universal matrix Capelli identity generalizing the results\nof [Ok2] and [JLM].\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4v0FxBI3wOAHhRa3aPwR0rJoB3adH2Cxcll49EionHE","pdfSize":"216133"}
