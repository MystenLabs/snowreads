Two theorems on electron dispersion in helimagnets are proved. They\nreveal a Kramers-like degeneracy in helical magnetic field. The generalized\nBloch theorem together with periodic boundary conditions lead to a nontrivial\ntopological band structure. As a result, an unusual spin structure of electron\nbands appears. A 2D model of nearly free electrons is proposed to describe\nconductive hexagonal palladium layers under an effective field of magnetically\nordered CrO$_2$ spacers in PdCrO$_2$. The spin texture of the Fermi surface\ninduces abnormal conductivity and nonreciprocity of electronic transport. It is\nshown that the topological metal state is closely related to unconventional\nantiferromagnets.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yVpv-aEbbAmLdXWNt68f3QPhBcdHFvErDIolhuPeNug","pdfSize":"1032314"}
