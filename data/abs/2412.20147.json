Our finding presented here offers a first exact derivation of\nthe GUE Tracy-Widom distribution in the dynamics of the interacting quantum\nmodel not being mapped to a noninteracting fermion Hamiltonian via the\nJordan-Wigner transformation. On the basis of the exact solution of the folded\nXXZ model and our numerical analysis of the XXZ model, we discuss a universal\nbehavior for the probability of finding the left-most up-spin in the XXZ model.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"z-HVAAHvHqv71HyOf8CV2bC_HT5sNSGAUtcEMcIhUhQ","pdfSize":"1685825"}
