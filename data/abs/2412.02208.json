{"id":"2412.02208","title":"Positivity of double point divisors","authors":"Yonghwa Cho, Jinhyung Park","authorsParsed":[["Cho","Yonghwa",""],["Park","Jinhyung",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2024 06:48:36 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-04","timestamp":1733208516000,"abstract":"  The non-isomorphic locus of a general projection from an embedded smooth\nprojective variety to a hypersurface moves in a linear system of an effective\ndivisor which we call the double point divisor. David Mumford proved that the\ndouble point divisor from outer projection is always base point free, and Bo\nIlic proved that it is ample except for a Roth variety. The first aim of this\npaper is to show that the double point divisor from outer projection is very\nample except in the Roth case. This answers a question of Bo Ilic. Unlike the\ncase of outer projection, the double point divisor from inner projection may\nnot be base point free nor ample. However, Atsushi Noma proved that it is\nsemiample except when a variety is neither a Roth variety, a scroll over a\ncurve, nor the second Veronese surface. In this paper, we investigate when the\ndouble point divisor from inner projection is base point free or big.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EHiKIWKYf8wRWPWtS4vQoAfNSDgf6RDFPZYXbUpPWMM","pdfSize":"484345"}
