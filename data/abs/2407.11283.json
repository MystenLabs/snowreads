Megacities, defined as cities with\npopulations exceeding 10 million, are frequent hotspots of severe pollution,\nexperiencing numerous weeks of dangerously poor air quality due to the\nconcentration of harmful pollutants. In addition, the complex interplay of\nfactors makes accurate air quality predictions incredibly challenging, and\nprediction models often struggle to capture these intricate dynamics. To\naddress these challenges, this paper proposes an attention-enhanced deep\nmultitask spatiotemporal machine learning model based on long-short-term memory\nnetworks for long-term air quality monitoring and prediction. The model\ndemonstrates robust performance in predicting the levels of major pollutants\nsuch as sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide, effectively capturing complex\ntrends and fluctuations. The proposed model provides actionable information for\npolicymakers, enabling informed decision making to improve urban air quality.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Q6nVJMBCCTodgt--SidPVXdVU5VZQuXM5z36FJCyql4","pdfSize":"1115350"}
