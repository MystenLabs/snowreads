  "abstract": "  This article presents GRFsaw, an open-source software for generating\ntwo-phase (binary) microstructures with user-defined structural properties.\nUnlike most standard software for microstructure generation, GRFsaw is based on\nthe concept of thresholding Gaussian random fields (GRF). It is designed to be\nused by researchers or engineers in need of a lightweight tool to generate\nmicrostructures of various geometries, for example as input to simulations or\nto other models where such geometries are needed. This could be simulations of\nfluid flow through porous media, in predictive models of electromagnetic\nscattering by materials, or in mechanical loading simulations in order to\nassess, e.g., the material's elasticity or strength.\n",
