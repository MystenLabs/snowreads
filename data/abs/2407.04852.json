We use the representation of solution in\nterms of Hankel determinants of Bessel functions, which seems to be new. Hankel\ndeterminants can be rewritten as multiple contour integrals using Andr\\`eief\nidentity. Finally small $x$ asymptotics is obtained using elementary asymptotic\nmethods.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"N_T_-stlvLqds7ZS7JpkKCG5SY_vVB5CGdcXFsSM0wQ","pdfSize":"808256"}
