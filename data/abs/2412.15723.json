  "abstract": "  In this paper, we develop an algebraic K-stability theory (e.g. special test\nconfiguration theory and optimal destabilization theory) for log Fano $\\mathbb\nR$-pairs, and construct a proper K-moduli space to parametrize K-polystable log\nFano $\\mathbb R$-pairs with some fixed invariants (e.g. dimension, volume,\ncoefficients). All of these are well-known for log Fano $\\mathbb Q$-pairs, and\nthe strategy in this paper is trying to reduce the problems (in many cases) to\n$\\mathbb Q$-coefficients case rather than rebuilding the whole program as in\n$\\mathbb Q$-coefficients case.\n",
