  "abstract": "  Elemental rare-earth metals provide a playground for studying novel electron\ncorrelation effects and complex magnetism. However, ab initio simulations of\nthese systems remain challenging. Here, we employ fully charge self-consistent\ndensity functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) to\ninvestigate terbium (Tb) metal under pressure. We show that Tb exhibits a\nstrong band renormalization due to correlation effects, with the calculated\nelectron density of states in good agreement with the experiments. At higher\npressures, the correlated electronic structures persist but with modulation in\nthe Hubbard gap, highlighting the tunability of effective Coulomb interactions\nand kinetic energies. Our DFT+DMFT calculations further indicate a\nferromagnetic ground state of Tb at low pressure and low temperature, as well\nas a transition from ferromagnetism to paramagnetism at elevated temperatures.\nThese ab initio results also align with the experiments. Our study paves the\nway for exploring heavy lanthanides via advanced first-principles simulations.\n",
