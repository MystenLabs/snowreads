By exploiting the low-dimensional structures of the signals and\nPSFs, we formulate this as a low-rank matrix demixing problem. To solve this,\nwe develop a scaled gradient descent method without balancing regularization.\nWe establish theoretical guarantees under mild conditions, demonstrating that\nour method, with spectral initialization, converges to the ground truth at a\nlinear rate, independent of the condition number of the underlying data\nmatrices. Numerical experiments indicate that our approach is competitive with\nexisting convex methods in terms of both recovery accuracy and computational\nefficiency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GbdqYd3eLz-bdn1t_HSRixsHWSrhQuMZqwJ4nfan_oM","pdfSize":"1018250","objectId":"0x58b70e3eee344bd005d3b70bf1f9077efa55b3d2bed99928da0932b6701fe907","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
