We deploy a model-based approach relying on\nlinear time-invariant (LTI) dynamical systems under unknown inputs (UI). Our\nfindings reveal distinct changes in the spectral profile of brain dynamics -\nparticularly regarding the stability and frequency of the system's oscillatory\nmodes during transitions between consciousness states. These models further\nenable us to identify external drivers influencing large-scale brain activity\nduring naturalistic auditory stimulation. Our findings suggest that these\nidentified inputs delineate how stimulus-induced co-activity propagation\ndiffers across consciousness states. Notably, our approach showcases the\neffectiveness of LTI models under UI in capturing large-scale brain dynamic\nchanges and drivers in complex paradigms, such as naturalistic stimulation,\nwhich are not conducive to conventional general linear model analysis.\nImportantly, our findings shed light on how brain-wide dynamics and drivers\nevolve as the brain transitions towards conscious states, holding promise for\ndeveloping more accurate biomarkers of consciousness recovery in disorders of\nconsciousness.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"wUNOhc0AmxdvYTUNjvtpOkuPuv86YB8XMLjx1l1Gwko","pdfSize":"39568400"}
