However, the volume of notifications can lead to information\noverload, making it challenging for users to engage effectively. This study\ninvestigates how notification behavior and color influence user interaction and\nperception. To explore this, we developed an app prototype that tracks user\ninteractions with notifications, categorizing them as accepted, dismissed, or\nignored. After each interaction, users were asked to complete a survey\nregarding their perception of the notifications. The study focused on how\ndifferent notification colors might affect the likelihood of acceptance and\nperceived importance. The results reveal that certain colors were more likely\nto be accepted and were perceived as more important compared to others,\nsuggesting that both color and behavior play significant roles in shaping user\nengagement with notifications.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sj-vzbxl6nt0fbVH1KOXmJcnqHkiLMDH3UPuVl-BV-Q","pdfSize":"856607"}
