  "abstract": "  Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) advances have led to new\ntechnologies capable of generating high-quality code, natural language, and\nimages. The next step is to integrate GenAI technology into various aspects\nwhile conducting research or other related areas, a task typically conducted by\nresearchers. Such research outcomes always come with a certain risk of\nliability. This paper sheds light on the various research aspects in which\nGenAI is used, thus raising awareness of its legal implications to novice and\nbudding researchers. In particular, there are two risks: data protection and\ncopyright. Both aspects are crucial for GenAI. We summarize key aspects\nregarding our current knowledge that every software researcher involved in\nusing GenAI should be aware of to avoid critical mistakes that may expose them\nto liability claims and propose a checklist to guide such awareness.\n",
