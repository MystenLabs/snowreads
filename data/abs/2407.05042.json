In particular, we consider a\nspatially flat Friedmann--Lema\\^{\\i}tre--Robertson--Walker geometry and within\nthe framework of scalar nonmetricity theory, we consider a generalization of\nthe Brans-Dicke theory in nonmetricity gravity. Introducing a pressureless gas\nas the matter source, we also incorporate a coupling function responsible for\nthe interaction. Our findings reveal that the choice of connection in\nnonmetricity gravity significantly impacts the interaction between the scalar\nfield and the matter source. For one particular connection, we discover the\nabsence of asymptotic solutions with a nontrivial interacting component. More\nprecisely, in this scenario, the matter source does not directly interact with\nthe scalar field; however, there is an interaction with the dynamical degrees\nof freedom provided by the connection.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"haKhCcIdSvsFt8TdjBwb5aXhtPJ6jMvf9rIu6W5gAgQ","pdfSize":"661420"}
