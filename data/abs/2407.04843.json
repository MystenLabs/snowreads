However, gathering data that\ninclude crucial but rare scenarios - such as pedestrians jaywalking into heavy\ntraffic - can be costly and unsafe to collect. We propose a virtual reality\nhuman-in-the-loop simulator, JaywalkerVR, to obtain vehicle-pedestrian\ninteraction data to address these challenges. Our system enables efficient,\naffordable, and safe collection of long-tail pedestrian-vehicle interaction\ndata. Using our proposed simulator, we create a high-quality dataset with\nvehicle-pedestrian interaction data from safety critical scenarios called\nCARLA-VR. The CARLA-VR dataset addresses the lack of long-tail data samples in\ncommonly used real world autonomous driving datasets. We demonstrate that\nmodels trained with CARLA-VR improve displacement error and collision rate by\n10.7% and 4.9%, respectively, and are more robust in rare vehicle-pedestrian\nscenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VoMaX8oU5bgbwgLWfpb2mDEdqrm_ERTmZSYTn60PVAE","pdfSize":"3468035"}
