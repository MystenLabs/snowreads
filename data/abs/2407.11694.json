Then let\n$T_m^{\\text{new}}(N,k,\\chi)$ denote the restriction of the $m$-th Hecke\noperator to the space $S_k^{\\text{new}}(\\Gamma_0(N), \\chi)$. We demonstrate\nthat for fixed $m$ and trivial character $\\chi$, the second coefficient of the\ncharacteristic polynomial of $T_m^{\\text{new}}(N,k)$ vanishes for only finitely\nmany pairs $(N,k)$, and we further determine the sign. To demonstrate our\nmethod, for $m=2,4$, we also compute all pairs $(N,k)$ for which the second\ncoefficient vanishes. In the general character case, we also show that\nexcluding an infinite family where $S_k^{\\text{new}}(\\Gamma_0(N), \\chi)$ is\ntrivial, the second coefficient of the characteristic polynomial of\n$T_m^{\\text{new}}(N,k,\\chi)$ vanishes for only finitely many triples\n$(N,k,\\chi)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"41DenCWjqj5_5WBLhVElbgmr8-7yaeYM6KPlIFPaSRs","pdfSize":"304213"}
