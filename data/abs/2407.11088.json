In FRC, there are a number of computer numerical\ncontrol machines, an input buffer, an output buffer, and a robot. The input and\noutput buffers contain unprocessed and finished products, respectively, whereas\nthe robot performs the loading and unloading activities and transports the\nitems among buffers and machines. The system repeats a cyclic schedule in its\nrun and the cycle time depends on the order of robot activities. In order to\nmaximize the efficiency of the system, the order of the robot activities\nyielding the minimum cycle time should be determined. The aim of this research\nis to find novel exact models to solve this cycling scheduling problem. These\ntypes of problems have tight relations with traveling salesman problem. In this\nstudy, four main modeling approaches of the TSP, such as\nDantzig-Fulkerson-Johnson approach, Miller-Tucker-Zemlin approach, Vajda's\nn-step approach, and the network flow approach are studied. Only the DFJ\napproach cannot be adapted to the scheduling problem. The three other\napproaches are adapted successfully. Similarities and differences are discussed\nby using several numerical examples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"P4OQkrxjRVrrW2BUiIUifGiCW51lahD6dC897LFAVfI","pdfSize":"922744"}
