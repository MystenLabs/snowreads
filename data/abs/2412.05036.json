  "abstract": "  The geometric linearization of nonlinear differential equation is a robust\nmethod for the construction of analytic solutions. The method is related to the\nexistence of Lie symmetries which can be used to determine point\ntransformations such that to write the given differential equation in a linear\nform. In this study we employ another geometric approach and we utilize the\nEisenhart lift to geometric linearize the Newtonian system describing the\nmotion of a particle in a line under the application of an autonomous force.\nOur findings reveal that for the oscillator, the Ermakov potential with or\nwithout the oscillator term, and the Morse potential, Newton's second law can\nbe globally expressed in the form of that of a free particle. This study open\nnew directions for the geometric linearization of differential equations via\nequivalent dynamical systems.\n",
