However, training modern\ngenerative models from scratch is very expensive and requires large\ncomputational resources. In this paper, we introduce StyleAutoEncoder\n(StyleAE), a lightweight AutoEncoder module, which works as a plugin for\npre-trained generative models and allows for manipulating the requested\nattributes of images. The proposed method offers a cost-effective solution for\ntraining deep generative models with limited computational resources, making it\na promising technique for a wide range of applications. We evaluate\nStyleAutoEncoder by combining it with StyleGAN, which is currently one of the\ntop generative models. Our experiments demonstrate that StyleAutoEncoder is at\nleast as effective in manipulating image attributes as the state-of-the-art\nalgorithms based on invertible normalizing flows. However, it is simpler,\nfaster, and gives more freedom in designing neural\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GtW_ynJfborxSZ8DaG3Ih8tVZ-FfDZPfnq-ZRpZYrsw","pdfSize":"41654159"}
