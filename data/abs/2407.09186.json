SPH-ParVI simulates the flow of\na fluid under external effects driven by the target density; transient or\nsteady state of the fluid approximates the target density. The continuum fluid\nis modelled as an interacting particle system (IPS) via SPH, where each\nparticle carries smoothed properties, interacts and evolves as per the\nNavier-Stokes equations. This mesh-free, Lagrangian simulation method offers\nfast, flexible, scalable and deterministic sampling and inference for a class\nof probabilistic models such as those encountered in Bayesian inference and\ngenerative modelling.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"7LOgG6VpdxWDaQwMH25rQebrwEwxgsaTwToKTUG3mLE","pdfSize":"1256525","objectId":"0x1193bd75c981510c6f398ab0465e74a46c3ee5e21107e86cc239b4ea324cd1d5","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
