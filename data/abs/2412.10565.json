  "abstract": "  Touch is one of the most intuitive ways for humans to interact with the\nworld, and as we advance toward a ubiquitous computing environment where\ntechnology seamlessly integrates into daily life, natural interaction methods\nare essential. This paper introduces UbiTouch, a system leveraging thermal\nimaging to detect touch interactions on arbitrary surfaces. By employing a\nsingle thermal camera, UbiTouch differentiates between hovering and touch,\ndetects multi-finger input, and completes trajectory tracking. Our approach\nemphasizes the use of lightweight, low-computation algorithms that maintain\nrobust detection accuracy through innovative vision-based processing. UbiTouch\naims to enable scalable, sustainable, and adaptable interaction systems for\ndiverse applications, particularly with regards to on-human sensing.\n",
