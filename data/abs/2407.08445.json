The topology of $C$ gives rise to BPS sectors of\nlow-energy solitons known as kinky vortices, which interpolate between\n(possibly) different vacua at the ends of the cylinder and at the same time\ncarry magnetic flux.\n  We compute the spectrum of BPS vortices on the cylinder in an isolated Higgs\nvacuum, through the framework of \\emph{warped} exponential networks, which we\nintroduce. We then conjecture a relation between these and standard vortices on\n$\\mathbb{R}^2$, which are related to genus-zero open Gromov-Witten invariants\nof toric branes. More specifically, we show that in the limit of large\nFayet-Iliopoulos coupling, the spectrum of kinky vortices on $C$ undergoes an\ninfinite sequence of wall-crossing transitions, and eventually stabilizes. We\nthen propose an exact relation between a generating series of stabilized CFIV\nindices and the Gromov-Witten disk potential, and discuss its consequences for\nthe structure of moduli spaces of vortices.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VbjHuAhLN-jFFcr8VkVQRij4MyIFbg6lIUgQYadMxWI","pdfSize":"3081441","objectId":"0xc6724675787d310135349193f90ee0335c7372b2700934e1b152ca5377fe9f4f","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
