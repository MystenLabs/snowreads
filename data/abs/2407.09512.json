This paper\nis divided into two sections, covering the design and evaluation of a copilot\nrespectively. A case study of developing copilot templates for the retail\ndomain by Microsoft is used to illustrate the role and importance of each\naspect. The first section explores the key technical components of a copilot's\narchitecture, including the LLM, plugins for knowledge retrieval and actions,\norchestration, system prompts, and responsible AI guardrails. The second\nsection discusses testing and evaluation as a principled way to promote desired\noutcomes and manage unintended consequences when using AI in a business\ncontext. We discuss how to measure and improve its quality and safety, through\nthe lens of an end-to-end human-AI decision loop framework. By providing\ninsights into the anatomy of a copilot and the critical aspects of testing and\nevaluation, this paper provides concrete evidence of how good design and\nevaluation practices are essential for building effective, human-centered AI\nassistants.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"QuIlFeVcjwLUtdUpnHKO0G4Whxs5YlG9DGkxMw9jH9s","pdfSize":"539944"}
