The aim of this paper is two-fold. Using the\nsupersaturation-stability method, we prove a stability variant of Ning-Zhai's\nresult by showing that such a graph $G$ contains at least $n-3$ triangles if no\nvertex is in all triangles of $G$. This result could also be viewed as a\nspectral version of a result of Xiao and Katona (2021). The second part\nconcerns with the spectral supersaturation for the bowtie, which consists of\ntwo triangles sharing a common vertex. A theorem of Erd\\H{o}s, F\\\"{u}redi,\nGould and Gunderson (1995) says that every $n$-vertex graph with more than\n$\\lfloor n^2/4\\rfloor +1$ edges contains a bowtie. For graphs of given order,\nthe spectral supersaturation problem has not been considered for substructures\nthat are not color-critical. In this paper, we give the first such theorem by\ncounting the number of bowties. Let $K_{\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\rceil, \\lfloor\n\\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor}^{+2}$ be the graph obtained from $K_{\\lceil \\frac{n}{2}\n\\rceil, \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor}$ by embedding two disjoint edges into the\nvertex part of size $\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\rceil$. Our result shows that every\ngraph $G$ with $n\\ge 8.8 \\times 10^6$ vertices and $\\lambda (G)\\ge \\lambda\n(K_{\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\rceil, \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor}^{+2})$ contains at\nleast $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor$ bowties, and $K_{\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\rceil,\n\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor}^{+2}$ is the unique spectral extremal graph. This\ngives a spectral correspondence of a theorem of Kang, Makai and Pikhurko\n(2020). The method used in our paper provides a probable way to establish the\nspectral counting results for other graphs, even for non-color-critical graphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gihAX7pgrIaey0tP8HSXiZvtYwmjRQID94ZKhDnGjFM","pdfSize":"4668349"}
