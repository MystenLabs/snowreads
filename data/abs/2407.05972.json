However, the rigorous mathematical\nwell-posedness theory for these equations does not appear to have been\npreviously studied. This paper is the third in a series in which we initiate\nthe systematic analysis of the Carrollian fluid equations. In the present work\nwe prove the global-in-time existence of bounded entropy solutions to the\nisentropic Carrollian fluid equations in one spatial dimension for a particular\nconstitutive law ($\\gamma = 3$). Our method is to use a vanishing viscosity\napproximation for which we establish a compensated compactness framework. Using\nthis framework we also prove the compactness of entropy solutions in\n$L^\\infty$, and establish a kinetic formulation of the problem. This global\nexistence result in $L^\\infty$ extends the $C^1$ theory presented in our\ncompanion paper ``One-Dimensional Carrollian Fluids II: $C^1$ Blow-up\nCriteria''.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SYmpALzoQfgscELEYwimZ7ttY1D_s7EVHQNQOh6bE3U","pdfSize":"386757"}
