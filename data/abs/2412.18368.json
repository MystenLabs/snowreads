  "abstract": "  Given an identity relating families of Schur and power sum symmetric\nfunctions, this may be thought of as encoding representation-theoretic\nproperties according to how the $p$-to-$s$ transition matrices provide the\nirreducible character tables for symmetric groups. The case of the\nMurnaghan-Nakayama rule for cycles provides that $p_{n} = \\sum_{i = 0}^{n-1}\n(-1)^i s_{(n-i, 1^{i})}$, and, since the power sum generator $p_{n}$ reduces to\n$\\zeta(2n)$ for the Riemann zeta function $\\zeta$ and for specialized values of\nthe indeterminates involved in the inverse limit construction of the algebra of\nsymmetric functions, this motivates both combinatorial and number-theoretic\napplications related to the given case of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule. In this\ndirection, since every Schur-hook admits an expansion in terms of twofold\nproducts of elementary and complete homogeneous generators, we exploit this\nproperty for the same specialization that allows us to express $p_{n}$ with the\nBernoulli number $B_{2n}$, using remarkable results due to Hoffman on multiple\nharmonic series. This motivates our bijective approach, through the use of\nsign-reversing involutions, toward the determination of identities that relate\nSchur-hooks and power sum symmetric functions and that we apply to obtain a new\nrecurrence for Bernoulli numbers.\n",
