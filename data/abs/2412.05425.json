  "abstract": "  Spin qubits in quantum dots provide a promising platform for realizing\nlarge-scale quantum processors since they have a small characteristic size of a\nfew tens of nanometers. One difficulty of controlling e.g., a few thousand\nqubits on a single chip is the large number of control lines. The crossbar\ncontrol architecture has been proposed to reduce the number of control lines\nexploiting shared control among the qubits. Here, we compile the surface code\ncycle to a pulse sequence that can be executed in the crossbar architecture. We\ndecompose the quantum circuits of the stabilizer measurements in terms of\nnative gates of the spin-qubit architecture. We provide a routing and\nscheduling protocol, and construct a gate voltage pulse sequence for the\nstabilizer measurement cycle. During this protocol, coherent phase errors can\noccur on idle qubits, due to the operational constraints of the crossbar\narchitecture. We characterize these crosstalk errors during the stabilizer\nmeasurement cycle, and identify an experimentally relevant parameter regime\nwhere the crosstalk errors are below the surface code threshold. Our results\nprovide design guidelines for near-term qubit experiments with crossbar\narchitectures.\n",
