  "abstract": "  Due to their large sizes, volumetric scans and whole-slide pathology images\n(WSIs) are often processed by extracting embeddings from local regions and then\nan aggregator makes predictions from this set. However, current methods require\npost-hoc visualization techniques (e.g., Grad-CAM) and often fail to localize\nsmall yet clinically crucial details. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce INSIGHT, a novel weakly-supervised aggregator that integrates heatmap\ngeneration as an inductive bias. Starting from pre-trained feature maps,\nINSIGHT employs a detection module with small convolutional kernels to capture\nfine details and a context module with a broader receptive field to suppress\nlocal false positives. The resulting internal heatmap highlights diagnostically\nrelevant regions. On CT and WSI benchmarks, INSIGHT achieves state-of-the-art\nclassification results and high weakly-labeled semantic segmentation\nperformance.
