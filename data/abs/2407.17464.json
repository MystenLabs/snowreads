Advanced AI robotic algorithms (e.g., reinforcement learning) can\nbe trained and developed to autonomously make individual decisions to achieve a\ndesired and usually fixed goal. However, such independent decisions and goal\nachievements might not be ideal for a healthcare robot that usually interacts\nwith a dynamic end-user or a patient. In such a complex human-robot interaction\n(teaming) framework, the dynamic user continuously wants to be involved in\ndecision-making as well as introducing new goals while interacting with their\npresent environment in real-time. To address this challenge, an adaptive shared\nautonomy AI paradigm is required to be developed for the two interactive agents\n(Human & AI agents) with a foundation based on human-centered factors to avoid\nany possible ethical issues and guarantee no harm to humanity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cqmV3A91JPlvF-YPW8OatKLVUChGlb_9BPqxZB9zty4","pdfSize":"233876"}
