In the framework of the Teleparallel Equivalent of General\nRelativity (TEGR), we derive a true energy-momentum tensor for the\ngravitational waves and integrate it over a finite region of space, obtaining\nanalytical expressions for the energy of each wave and the resulting spacetime.\nOur findings reveal that the energy after the collision exceeds the\npre-collision, indicating energy creation. We analyze the energy density and\n``surface energy density\" on the wavefronts, underscoring their divergence near\nthe singularity. Additionally, we observe that the colliding waves drag\nobservers but exert no acceleration at the collision event. This study\naddresses and resolves longstanding issues raised by Szekeres in his seminal\nwork on colliding pp-waves, offering a more physically realistic framework\nthrough the local energy definition provided by TEGR. The implications for\ngravitational wave interactions and their energy transfer mechanisms are\ndiscussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DAcqOqFs_M0Eptz-Hp6sAiCtjmYADgK8uZwEyKlZpZM","pdfSize":"1037327"}
