  "abstract": "  The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need to improve the modeling,\nestimation, and prediction of how infectious diseases spread. SEIR-like models\nhave been particularly successful in providing accurate short-term predictions.\nThis study fills a notable literature gap by exploring the following question:\nIs it possible to incorporate a nonparametric\nsusceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) COVID-19 model into the\ninverse-problem regularization framework when the transmission coefficient\nvaries over time? Our positive response considers varying degrees of disease\nseverity, vaccination, and other time-dependent parameters. In addition, we\ndemonstrate the continuity, differentiability, and injectivity of the operator\nthat link the transmission parameter to the observed infection numbers. By\nemploying Tikhonov-type regularization to the corresponding inverse problem, we\nestablish the existence and stability of regularized solutions. Numerical\nexamples using both synthetic and real data illustrate the model's estimation\naccuracy and its ability to fit the data effectively.\n",
