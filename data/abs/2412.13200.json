The BV equation presents significant challenges for PINNs,\nprimarily due to the hyperbolic sine term, which renders the Hessian of the\nPINN loss function highly ill-conditioned. To address this issue, we introduce\na bypassing term that improves numerical stability by substantially reducing\nthe condition number of the Hessian matrix. Furthermore, the small magnitude of\nthe ionic flux \\( j \\) often leads to a common failure mode where PINNs\nconverge to incorrect solutions. We demonstrate that incorporating a secondary\nconservation law for the solid-phase potential \\( \\psi \\) effectively prevents\nsuch convergence issues and ensures solution accuracy. The proposed methods\nprove effective for solving both forward and inverse problems involving the BV\nequation. Specifically, we achieve precise parameter estimation in inverse\nscenarios and reliable solution predictions for forward simulations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"A5EJ1XZ6uSddYso45w__Mkyu2WwXi7XvFetSrS-J4PE","pdfSize":"1764050"}
