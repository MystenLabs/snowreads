Few\nresults about lifted linear codes are known in the literature. This paper\nproves some fundamental theory for lifted linear codes, and studies the support\n$2$-designs of the lifted projective Reed-Muller codes, lifted Hamming codes\nand lifted Simplex codes. In addition, this paper settles the weight\ndistributions of the lifted Reed-Muller codes of certain orders, and\ninvestigates the support $3$-designs of these lifted codes. As a by-product, an\ninfinite family of three-weight projective codes over $\\gf(4)$ is obtained.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rHEKOvUYMZrmULUPtWp0Jmss3qnUfYw81-8IYxk_2AI","pdfSize":"204094"}
