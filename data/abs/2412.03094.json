  "abstract": "  Recently, the question of whether surjective maps preserving the norm of a\nsymmetric Kubo-Ando mean can be extended to Jordan $\\ast$-isomorphisms has been\ntackled. The question was affirmatively answered for surjective maps between\n$C^{*}$-algebras for certain specific classes of symmetric Kubo-Ando means.\nHere, we give a comprehensive answer to this question for surjective maps\nbetween $AW^{*}$-algebras preserving the norm of any symmetric Kubo-Ando mean.\n",
