In particular, we are interested in linear inverse\nproblems with additive Gaussian noise and Gaussian priors defined using\nMat\\'{e}rn covariance models. In this case, we estimate the hyperparameters\nusing the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the marginalized posterior\ndistribution. However, this is a computationally intensive task since it\ninvolves computing log determinants. To address this challenge, we consider a\nstochastic average approximation (SAA) of the objective function and use the\npreconditioned Lanczos method to compute efficient approximations of the\nfunction and gradient evaluations. We propose a new preconditioner that can be\nupdated cheaply for new values of the hyperparameters and an approach to\ncompute approximations of the gradient evaluations, by reutilizing information\nfrom the function evaluations. We demonstrate the performance of our approach\non static and dynamic seismic tomography problems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DWraqw9RXWlH_LIj_HwnPsX9-rfu2EQvpmECk2tDQds","pdfSize":"3085914"}
