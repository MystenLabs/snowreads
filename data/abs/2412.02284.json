  "abstract": "  Broken inversion symmetry of magnetic lattice is normally described by\nLifshitz invariants in micromagnetic energy functional. Three exceptions are\nthe lattices with T$_\\textrm{d}$, C$_\\textrm{3h}$ and D$_\\textrm{3h}$ point\ngroup symmetries. The inversion symmetry breaking of the corresponding magnets\nis described by more complex 4-spin chiral invariants that cannot be related to\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Experimental detection of 4-spin chiral\ninteractions is an important task that has yet to be performed. We propose that\nthe 4-spin chiral interaction can be probed by energy selective magnon\nrelaxation in two-dimensional ferromagnet Fe$_{3}$GeTe$_{2}$ that possess\nD$_\\textrm{3h}$ point group symmetry.\n",
