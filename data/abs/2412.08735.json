Our algorithm performs tangential projections onto the set of\nseparable states, leading to classically correlated quantum trajectories. By\ncomparing this restricted evolution with the unrestricted one, we can\ncharacterize the entangling capabilities of quantum channels without making use\nof input-output relations. Moreover, applying this method is equivalent to\nsolving the nonlinear master equation in Lindblad form introduced in\n\\cite{PAH24} for two-qubit systems. We here extend these equations to\nmultipartite systems of qudits, describing non-entangling dynamics in terms of\na stochastic differential equation. We identify the impact of dynamical\nentanglement in open systems by applying our approach to several correlated\ndecay processes. Therefore, our methodology provides a complete and\nready-to-use framework to characterize dynamical quantum correlations caused by\narbitrary open-system processes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Gzj9wDdzuqpvkUM92ZP0zdJeSoHcMENCXyK4iC_VhRY","pdfSize":"2218283"}
