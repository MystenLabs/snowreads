The latter allows\nmodification by electric fields and the study of thermalized bosonic\nquasiparticles, from the single particle level to interacting degenerate dense\nensembles. Additionally, the freedom to combine bilayers of different van der\nWaals materials without lattice or relative twist angle constraints leads to\nlayer hybridized and moir\\'e excitons which can be widely engineered. This\nreview covers fundamental aspects of IXs including correlation phenomena as\nwell as the consequence of moir\\'e superlattices with a strong focus on TMD\nhomo- and hetero-bilayers.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zYrqC1pTfwyFeHmosMqAZZqg_PPvJugnwPvdaWpev7U","pdfSize":"11764361"}
