Capacitive-sharing\n(X-Y-U)-strip readout allows simultaneous measurement of the Cartesian\ncoordinates x and y of the position of the particles together with a third\ncoordinate u along the diagonal axis in a single readout PCB. This provides a\npowerful tool to address multiple-hit ambiguity and enable pattern recognition\ncapabilities in moderate particle flux environment of collider or fixed target\nexperiments in high energy physics HEP) and nuclear physics (NP). We present in\nthis paper the performance of a 10 cm {\\times} 10 cm triple-GEM detector with\ncapacitive-sharing (X-Y-U)-strip anode readout. Spatial resolutions of the\norder of {\\sigma}^res_x = 71.6 {\\pm} 0.8 {\\mu}m for X-strips, {\\sigma}^res_y =\n56.2 {\\pm} 0.9 {\\mu}m for Y-strips and {\\sigma}^res_u = 75.2 {\\pm} 0.9 {\\mu}m\nfor U-strips have been obtained at a beam test at Thomas Jefferson National\nAccelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab). Modifications of the readout design of\nfuture prototypes to improve the spatial resolution and challenges in scaling\nto large-area MPGDs are discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"tWXQa97qYlqkU2lN1MVBGuxA1nYU1CygZr6tUjcxkhI","pdfSize":"1042534","objectId":"0x9f0324e80ec0e1761723f34e40dcffff338717175fca0c3bb5baebfc1f526483","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
