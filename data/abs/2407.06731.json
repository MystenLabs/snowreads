These high-intensity forward neutrino fluxes from proton-proton LHC\ncollisions enable novel opportunities in QCD, neutrino physics, BSM searches,\nand astroparticle physics. In this contribution, we briefly review the physics\npotential of neutrino deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) measurements at the LHC\nto shed light on proton and nuclear structure, both for ongoing far-forward\nexperiments and for the proposed Forward Physics Facility (FPF) to operate\nconcurrently with the HL-LHC. We consider the reach of LHC neutrino DIS to\nscrutinise the mechanisms of forward hadron production and constrain QCD in the\nultra-small-$x$ region. We also discuss how neutrino DIS measurements at these\nfar-forward detectors enhance direct and indirect BSM searches at the HL-LHC.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hWS80-Ka05ruEzLpI9__3zS5M6uKyAefzOBFYZ6R7CY","pdfSize":"4133020"}
