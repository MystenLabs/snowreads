Through the development of a\nvariational approach employing the super-Gaussian function, we identify\nstationary parameters for the quantum droplets. The frequency of breathing mode\noscillations in these quantum droplets is estimated. Moreover, the study\nreveals that periodic modulation in time of the atomic scattering length\ninduces resonance oscillations in quantum droplet parameters or the emission of\nlinear waves, contingent on the amplitude of the external modulation. A similar\nanalysis is conducted for the Lee-Huang-Yang fluid, confined in a parabolic\npotential. Theoretical predictions are corroborated through direct numerical\nsimulations of the governing extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Additionally,\nwe study the collision dynamics of quasi-one-dimensional quantum droplets.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MYphnBpg95V9Yx4WBWePMIMlPdZgao4GQfOFlG2Wc1c","pdfSize":"1595664","objectId":"0x1654de933d1751ee50197b0828cc6881b92ac9d940ac5f8d40e3a48fc69e6b5d","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
