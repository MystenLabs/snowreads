We describe the\ntopology of the image by $\\varphi$ of a reduced curve on $(Z,z)$ by means of\niterated pencils defined recursively for each branch of the curve from the\ninitial one $\\langle f,g \\rangle$. This result generalizes the one obtained in\na previous paper for the case in which $(Z,z)$ is smooth and the curve\nirreducible. As a consequence of the methods we can describe also the\ntopological type of the discriminant curve of $\\varphi$, in particular the\ntopological type of each branch of the discriminant can be obtained from the\nmap without the previous knowledge of the critical locus.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RRI2tDI8gdsMiQaumvAqOAPjY7VnZTTHAoVURt2AEnI","pdfSize":"215042"}
