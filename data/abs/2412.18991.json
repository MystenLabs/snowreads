  "abstract": "  Answering an open question raised by Cooper, we show that there exist\n$\\Delta^0_2$ sets $D$ and $E$ such that the singleton degree of $E$ is a\nminimal cover of the singleton degree of $D$. This shows that the\n$\\Sigma^{0}_{2}$ singleton degrees, and the $\\Delta^{0}_{2}$ singleton degrees,\nare not dense (and consequently the $\\Pi^0_2$ $Q$-degrees, and the\n$\\Delta^{0}_{2}$ $Q$-degrees, are not dense). Moreover $D$ and $E$ can be built\nto lie in the same enumeration degree.\n",
