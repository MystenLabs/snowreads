To address this gap, we introduce a novel model for simulating\nthe spatio-temporal motion of nonlinear strings, integrating modal synthesis\nand spectral modeling within a neural network framework. Our model leverages\nphysical properties and fundamental frequencies as inputs, outputting string\nstates across time and space that solve the partial differential equation\ncharacterizing the nonlinear string. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the\nproposed architecture achieves superior accuracy in string motion simulation\ncompared to existing baseline architectures. The code and demo are available\nonline.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"APIfS1x0WxvJut7C_0TQ4SNZSGiqthVfzltvT5ER8oM","pdfSize":"2617134"}
