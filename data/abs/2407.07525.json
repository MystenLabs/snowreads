Previous approaches typically adhere to a global\nparadigm, where a pose graph is initially constructed followed by motion\nsynchronization to determine the absolute pose. However, this separated\napproach may not fully leverage the characteristics of multiview registration\nand might struggle with low-overlap scenarios. In this paper, we propose an\nincremental multiview point cloud registration method that progressively\nregisters all scans to a growing meta-shape. To determine the incremental\nordering, we employ a two-stage coarse-to-fine strategy for point cloud\ncandidate retrieval. The first stage involves the coarse selection of scans\nbased on neighbor fusion-enhanced global aggregation features, while the second\nstage further reranks candidates through geometric-based matching.\nAdditionally, we apply a transformation averaging technique to mitigate\naccumulated errors during the registration process. Finally, we utilize a\nReservoir sampling-based technique to address density variance issues while\nreducing computational load. Comprehensive experimental results across various\nbenchmarks validate the effectiveness and generalization of our approach.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"YM5JkA9TLIVQ09Q-IAA-AdKtVkjbdA8yFrkqnKjfWOU","pdfSize":"14555452"}
