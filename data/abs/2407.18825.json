The\ncontrol model of the CT-LMPC is parameterized as transfer functions with time\ndelays, and they are separated into deterministic and stochastic parts for\nrelevant control and filtering algorithms. We formulate time-delay,\nfinite-horizon CT linear-quadratic optimal control problems (LQ-OCPs) for the\nCT-LMPC. By assuming piece-wise constant inputs and constraints, we present the\nnumerical discretization of the proposed LQ-OCPs and show how to convert the\ndiscrete-time (DT) equivalent into a standard quadratic program. The\nperformance of the CT-LMPC is compared with the conventional DT-LMPC algorithm.\nOur numerical experiments show that, under fixed tunning parameters, the\nCT-LMPC shows better closed-loop performance as the sampling time increases\nthan the conventional DT-LMPC.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0niA5mcyinyVGIuPtSCsy0bG5RwPi8zuH_FlgexTHQI","pdfSize":"472677"}
