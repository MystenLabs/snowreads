  "abstract": "  The automatic estimation of pain is essential in designing an optimal pain\nmanagement system offering reliable assessment and reducing the suffering of\npatients. In this study, we present a novel full transformer-based framework\nconsisting of a Transformer in Transformer (TNT) model and a Transformer\nleveraging cross-attention and self-attention blocks. Elaborating on videos\nfrom the BioVid database, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performances, showing\nthe efficacy, efficiency, and generalization capability across all the primary\npain estimation tasks.\n",
