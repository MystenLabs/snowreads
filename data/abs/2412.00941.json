  "abstract": "  A standard model that arises in several applications in sequential decision\nmaking is partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) where a\ndecision-making agent interacts with an uncertain environment. A basic\nobjective in such POMDPs is the reachability objective, where given a target\nset of states, the goal is to eventually arrive at one of them. The limit-sure\nproblem asks whether reachability can be ensured with probability arbitrarily\nclose to 1. In general, the limit-sure reachability problem for POMDPs is\nundecidable. However, in many practical cases the most relevant question is the\nexistence of policies with a small amount of memory. In this work, we study the\nlimit-sure reachability problem for POMDPs with a fixed amount of memory. We\nestablish that the computational complexity of the problem is NP-complete.\n",
