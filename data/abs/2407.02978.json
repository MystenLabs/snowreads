However, concerns\nregarding the potential misuse of such texts in journalism, educational, and\nacademic contexts have surfaced. SemEval 2024 introduces the task of\nMultigenerator, Multidomain, and Multilingual Black-Box Machine-Generated Text\nDetection, aiming to develop automated systems for identifying\nmachine-generated text and detecting potential misuse. In this paper, we i)\npropose a RoBERTa-BiLSTM based classifier designed to classify text into two\ncategories: AI-generated or human ii) conduct a comparative study of our model\nwith baseline approaches to evaluate its effectiveness. This paper contributes\nto the advancement of automatic text detection systems in addressing the\nchallenges posed by machine-generated text misuse. Our architecture ranked 46th\non the official leaderboard with an accuracy of 80.83 among 125.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"c79bkd-Qn5_TsvL184hFXKhMOSE4m2hfNn6uYnVj5VY","pdfSize":"279877"}
