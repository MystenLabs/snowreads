Interleaved\nPN-junction topology offers the maximum mode/junction overlap and is the most\nefficient modulator in depletion-mode of operation. Due to its structure, the\naccurate modelling process must be fully three-dimensional, which is a\nnontrivial computational problem. This paper presents a rigorous 3D model for\nthe modulation efficiency of silicon-on-insulator interleaved junction optical\nphase modulators with submicron dimensions. Solution of Drift-Diffusion and\nPoisson equations were carried out on 3D finite-element-mesh and Maxwell\nequations were solved using Finite-Difference-Time-Domain (FDTD) method on 3D\nYee-cells. Whole of the modelling process has been detailed and all the\ncoefficients required in the model are presented. Model validation suggests <\n10% RMS error.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"jm2tC0snYI6ddOw3467rXfd_6f3tv5suv5AbCSmNn9U","pdfSize":"1231057"}
