  "abstract": "  Several indicators have been recently proposed for measuring various\ncharacteristics of the tuples of a dataset -- particularly, the so-called\nskyline tuples, i.e., those that are not dominated by other tuples. Numeric\nindicators are very important as they may, e.g., provide an additional\ncriterion to be used to rank skyline tuples and focus on a subset thereof. We\nconcentrate on an indicator of robustness that may be measured for any skyline\ntuple $t$: grid resistance, i.e., how large value perturbations can be\ntolerated for $t$ to remain non-dominated (and thus in the skyline).\n  The computation of this indicator typically involves one or more rounds of\ncomputation of the skyline itself or, at least, of dominance relationships.\nBuilding on recent advances in partitioning strategies allowing a parallel\ncomputation of skylines, we discuss how these strategies can be adapted to the\ncomputation of the indicator.\n",
