The proposed model is employing a tractable SB to\nformulate a data-to-data process between the clean speech distribution and the\nobserved noisy speech distribution. The model is trained with a data prediction\nloss, aiming to recover the complex-valued clean speech coefficients, and an\nauxiliary time-domain loss is used to improve training of the model. The\neffectiveness of the proposed SB-based model is evaluated in two different\nspeech enhancement tasks: speech denoising and speech dereverberation. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that the proposed SB-based outperforms\ndiffusion-based models in terms of speech quality metrics and ASR performance,\ne.g., resulting in relative word error rate reduction of 20% for denoising and\n6% for dereverberation compared to the best baseline model. The proposed model\nalso demonstrates improved efficiency, achieving better quality than the\nbaselines for the same number of sampling steps and with a reduced\ncomputational cost.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"brX2efvbg5dVRVdhVVFhaUODbtaXlkS-9w_BwKjV8G0","pdfSize":"164403","objectId":"0x6c50fb14b183dc241356a5bd6d236007df387f28abb46f467a2dce746c5a438b","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
