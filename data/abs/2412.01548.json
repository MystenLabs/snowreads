The measurement uses 140 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV collected by the ATLAS detector at the Large\nHadron Collider and supersedes the previous result in this decay channel using\nthe same dataset. The data analysis is performed using a neural\nsimulation-based inference method, which builds per-event likelihood ratios\nusing neural networks. The observed (expected) off-shell Higgs boson production\nsignal strength in the $ZZ\\to 4\\ell$ decay channel at 68% CL is\n$0.87^{+0.75}_{-0.54}$ ($1.00^{+1.04}_{-0.95}$). The evidence for off-shell\nHiggs boson production using the $ZZ\\to 4\\ell$ decay channel has an observed\n(expected) significance of $2.5\\sigma$ ($1.3\\sigma$). The expected result\nrepresents a significant improvement relative to that of the previous analysis\nof the same dataset, which obtained an expected significance of $0.5\\sigma$.\nWhen combined with the most recent ATLAS measurement in the $ZZ\\to 2\\ell 2\\nu$\ndecay channel, the evidence for off-shell Higgs boson production has an\nobserved (expected) significance of $3.7\\sigma$ ($2.4\\sigma$). The off-shell\nmeasurements are combined with the measurement of on-shell Higgs boson\nproduction to obtain constraints on the Higgs boson total width. The observed\n(expected) value of the Higgs boson width at 68% CL is $4.3^{+2.7}_{-1.9}$\n($4.1^{+3.5}_{-3.4}$) MeV.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6Cta_L6KeYI3VfWjozFQuw_1SfYrN_IwjHZFvnZILpU","pdfSize":"2950098"}
