  "abstract": "  We prove a large deviations principle for orthogonal projections of the unit\nball $\\mathbb{B}_p^n$ of $\\ell_p^n$ onto a random $k$-dimensional linear\nsubspace of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ as $n\\to\\infty$ in the case $2<p\\le \\infty$ and for\nthe intersection of $\\mathbb{B}_p^n$ with a random $k$-dimensional subspace in\nthe case $1\\le p <2$. The corresponding rate function is finite only on\n$L_q$-zonoids and their duals, respectively, and given in terms of the maximum\nentropy over suitable measures generating the $L_q$-zonoid, where\n$\\frac{1}{p}+\\frac{1}{q}=1$. In particular, we obtain that the renormalized\nprojections/sections almost surely tend to a $k$-dimensional Euclidean ball of\ncertain radius. Moreover, we identify the asymptotic probability that the\nrandom orthogonal projection remains within a ball of smaller radius. As a\nbyproduct we obtain an interesting inequality for the Gamma function.\n",
