  "abstract": "  Artificial intelligence (AI) systems capable of generating creative outputs\nare reshaping our understanding of creativity. This shift presents an\nopportunity for creativity researchers to reevaluate the key components of the\ncreative process. In particular, the advanced capabilities of AI underscore the\nimportance of studying the internal processes of creativity. This paper\nexplores the neurobiological machinery that underlies these internal processes\nand describes the experiential component of creativity. It is concluded that\nalthough the products of artificial and human creativity can be similar, the\ninternal processes are different. The paper also discusses how AI may\nnegatively affect the internal processes of human creativity, such as the\ndevelopment of skills, the integration of knowledge, and the diversity of\nideas.\n",
