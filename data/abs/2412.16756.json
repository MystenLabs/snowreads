  "abstract": "  The spectrum of an arbitrary self-adjoint extension of the minimal linear\nrelation associated with the discrete symplectic system in the limit point case\nis completely characterized by using the limiting Weyl--Titchmarsh\n$M_+(\\lambda)$-function. Furthermore, a dependence of the spectrum on a\nboundary condition is investigated and, consequently, several results of the\nsingular Sturmian theory are derived.\n",
