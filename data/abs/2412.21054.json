The DCT relates\none-loop Feynman integrals or fixed-branch integrals in one spacetime dimension\nto their corresponding quantities with auxiliary mass in any other dimension,\nmaking the expansion to high orders in $\\epsilon$ highly efficient. We applied\nthis method to several examples to demonstrate its validity and efficiency.
