To that end, chalcogenide-based\nnon-volatile phase-change materials (PCMs) present a promising solution due to\nzero static power. However, high switching voltage and small number of\noperating levels present serious roadblocks to widespread adoption of\nPCM-programmble units. Here, we demonstrate electrically programmable wide\nbandgap Sb2S3-clad silicon ring resonator using silicon microheater at CMOS\ncompatible voltage of < 3V. Our device shows low switching energy of 35.33 nJ\n(0.48 mJ) for amorphization (crystallization) and reversible phase transitions\nwith high endurance (> 2000 switching events) near 1550 nm. Combining volatile\nthermo-optic effect with non-volatile PCMs, we demonstrate 7-bit (127 levels)\noperation with excellent repeatability and reduced power consumption. Our\ndemonstration of low-voltage and low-energy operation, combined with the hybrid\nvolatilenonvolatile approach, marks a significant step towards integrating\nPCM-based programmable units in large-scale optical interconnects.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cRYnXD2Qlct_URtM1S8AeJRjlOdX45sM5GcPhyYF0us","pdfSize":"7015292"}
