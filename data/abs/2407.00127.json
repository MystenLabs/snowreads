This research focused on fine-tuning object\ndetection models for drone images to create accurate counts of animal species.\nHundreds of images taken using a drone and large, openly available drone-image\ndatasets were used to fine-tune machine learning models with the baseline\nYOLOv8 architecture. We trained 30 different models, with the largest having\n43.7 million parameters and 365 layers, and used hyperparameter tuning and data\naugmentation techniques to improve accuracy. While the state-of-the-art YOLOv8\nbaseline had only 0.7% accuracy on a dataset of safari animals, our models had\n95% accuracy on the same dataset. Finally, we deployed the models on the Jetson\nOrin Nano for demonstration of low-power real-time species detection for easy\ninference on drones.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"_M2vSysWBaK-61Z9c7ULR1Kk6vCtB_nh3AyOfsLeqTs","pdfSize":"21133409"}
