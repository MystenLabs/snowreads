When an interface\nwidth $\\ell$ is much larger than $\\Lambda$, the discrete model becomes the\nstandard fluctuating hydrodynamics, where the phase coexistence condition is\ngiven by the local equilibrium thermodynamics. In contrast, when $\\ell <\n\\Lambda$, the most probable density profile is determined by a new variational\nprinciple, where the chemical potential at the interface is found to deviate\nfrom the equilibrium coexistence chemical potential. This means that metastable\nstates at equilibrium stably appear near the interface as the influence of the\nparticle current. The variational function derived in the theoretical analysis\nis also found to be equivalent to the variational function formulated in an\nextended framework of thermodynamics called global thermodynamics. Finally, the\nvalidity of the theoretical result is confirmed by numerical simulations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yzjF-GurbnXpKQR8L6YQMYjqydx1E3LlpLgLroWHMpE","pdfSize":"1678425","objectId":"0x43b3ac58bcb9085cde90dfc58deeba09f709a9d5bd8df79866d58c2e556c38a2","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
