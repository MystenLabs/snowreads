  "abstract": "  The paper gives a new representation for the fractional Brownian motion that\ncan be applied to simulate this self-similar random process in continuous time.\nSuch a representation is based on the spectral form of mathematical description\nand the spectral method. The Legendre polynomials are used as the orthonormal\nbasis. The paper contains all the necessary algorithms and their theoretical\nfoundation, as well as the results of numerical experiments.\n",
