We show that depending on the\ndistance between the nanoparticles there can be a heat flux rectification with\nratios of about 6000 which are much higher than previously predicted\nrectification ratio of 2673. Furthermore, we identify a previously overlooked\nrange of forward rectification and a range of strong backward rectification\nwith rectification ratios larger than 8000 for relatively small Weyl node\nseparations. We investigate the mechanism behind this large heat flux\nrectification.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yv4jqEGneKf9QeDXE9rRbar4POKr64p-muJwF8jzR2c","pdfSize":"2745782"}
