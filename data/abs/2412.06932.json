We state conditions\nfor the existence of breathers and compute their spatiotemporal profiles near\nthe edges of the linear phonon spectrum. Our findings include the existence of\nstrongly nonlinear and dynamically stable breathers inside the band gap,\nasymptotic expressions for small-amplitude breather norms, and the construction\nof breather families with compact support on the lattice.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BFbzfXthODgK_BxEWRfvSShuTg_KkjjuYWSHlVp4ILE","pdfSize":"1637470"}
