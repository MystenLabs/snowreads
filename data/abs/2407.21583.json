We provide a model of a non-radial oscillation, aiming to explain\nthe observed variations of the cluster giant NGC 4349 No. 127. The star was\npreviously reported to host a brown dwarf companion, but whose existence was\nlater refuted in the literature. We reanalyzed 58 archival HARPS spectra,\nacquiring additional activity indicators using the SERVAL and RACCOON\npipelines. We searched for periodicity in the indicators and correlations\nbetween the indicators and radial velocities. We further present a simulation\ncode able to produce synthetic HARPS spectra, incorporating the effect of\nnon-radial oscillations, and compare the simulated results to the observed\nvariations. We find a positive correlation between chromatic index and radial\nvelocity, along with closed-loop Lissajous-like correlations between radial\nvelocity and each of the spectral line shape indicators (full width at half\nmaximum, and contrast of the cross-correlation function and differential line\nwidth). Simulations of a low-amplitude, retrograde, dipole (l = 1, m = 1),\nnon-radial oscillation can reproduce the observed behavior and explain the\nobservables. Photometric variations below the detection threshold of the\navailable ASAS-3 photometry are predicted. The oscillation and stellar\nparameters are largely in agreement with the prediction of oscillatory\nconvective modes. The periodic variations of the radial velocities and activity\nindicators, along with the respective phase shifts, measured for the\nintermediate-mass cluster giant NGC 4349 No. 127, can be explained by a\nnon-radial oscillation.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"B2ToxoNj4ePgRHN2brzgjRlmDDSCFAUBXruHayt3BDI","pdfSize":"3180983"}
