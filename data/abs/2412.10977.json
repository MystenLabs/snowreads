  "abstract": "  Reconstructing meshes from point clouds is an important task in fields such\nas robotics, autonomous systems, and medical imaging. This survey examines\nstate-of-the-art learning-based approaches to mesh reconstruction, categorizing\nthem into five paradigms: PointNet family, autoencoder architectures,\ndeformation-based methods, point-move techniques, and primitive-based\napproaches. Each paradigm is explored in depth, detailing the primary\napproaches and their underlying methodologies. By comparing these techniques,\nour study serves as a comprehensive guide, and equips researchers and\npractitioners with the knowledge to navigate the landscape of learning-based\nmesh reconstruction techniques. The findings underscore the transformative\npotential of these methods, which often surpass traditional techniques in\nallowing detailed and efficient reconstructions.\n",
