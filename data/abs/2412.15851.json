  "abstract": "  Let $\\mathsf{s}(n)$ denote the sum of binary digits of an integer $n \\geq 0$.\nIn the recent years there has been interest in the behavior of the differences\n$\\mathsf{s}(n+t)-\\mathsf{s}(n)$, where $t \\geq 0$ is an integer. In particular,\nSpiegelhofer and Wallner showed that for $t$ whose binary expansion contains\nsufficiently many blocks of $\\mathtt{1}$s the inequality $\\mathsf{s}(n+t)\n-\\mathsf{s}(n) \\geq 0$ holds for $n$ belonging to a set of asymptotic density\n$>1/2$, partially answering a question by Cusick. Furthermore, for such $t$ the\nvalues $\\mathsf{s}(n+t) - \\mathsf{s}(n)$ are approximately normally\ndistributed.\n  In this paper we consider a natural generalization to the family of\nblock-counting functions $N^w$, giving the number of occurrences of a block of\nbinary digits $w$ in the binary expansion. Our main result show that for any\n$w$ of length at least $2$ the distribution of the differences $N^w(n+t) -\nN^w(n)$ is close to a Gaussian when $t$ contains many blocks of $\\mathtt{1}$s\nin its binary expansion. This extends an earlier result by the author and\nSpiegelhofer for $w=\\mathtt{11}$.\n",
