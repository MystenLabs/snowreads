Galperin introduced the axiomatic mass center system for finite point\nsets in spherical and hyperbolic spaces, proving the uniqueness of the mass\ncenter system. In this paper, we revisit this system and provide a\nsignificantly simpler proof of its uniqueness. Furthermore, we extend the\naxiomatic mass center system to manifolds. As an application of our system, we\nderive a highly generalized version of Pappus' centroid theorem for volumes in\nthree geometries - Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic - across all\ndimensions, offering unified and notably simple proofs for all three\ngeometries.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mi5jaznwsNu8iEckXpHvm5aAUA8dspss278fHm3zARA","pdfSize":"668321"}
