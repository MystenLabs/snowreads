Such highest weight vectors arise as\npartition functions of Airy structures only under certain conditions on the\nrepresentations. In the spectral curve formulation of topological recursion, we\nshow that this generalization amounts to adding specific terms to the\ncorrelators $ \\omega_{g,1}$, which leads to a ``shifted topological recursion''\nformula. We then prove that the wave-functions constructed from this shifted\nversion of topological recursion are WKB solutions of families of quantizations\nof the spectral curve with $ \\hbar$-dependent terms. In the reverse direction,\nstarting from an $\\hbar$-connection, we find that it is of topological type if\nthe exact same conditions that we found for the Airy structures are satisfied.\nWhen this happens, the resulting shifted loop equations can be solved by the\nshifted topological recursion obtained earlier.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uWdBHZT8lg7osrYNmALL6OQrajMwIUSfn9oaIZf9aFM","pdfSize":"761237"}
