  "abstract": "  Modeling the propagation of cracks at the microscopic level is fundamental to\nunderstand the effect of the microstructure on the fracture process.\nNevertheless, microscopic propagation is often unstable and when using phase\nfield fracture poor convergence is found or, in the case of using staggered\nalgorithms, leads to the presence of jumps in the evolution of the cracks. In\nthis work, a novel method is proposed to perform micromechanical simulations\nwith phase field fracture imposing monotonic increases of crack length and\nallowing the use of monolithic implementations, being able to resolve all the\nsnap-backs during the unstable propagation phases. The method is derived for\nFFT based solvers in order to exploit its very high numerical performance n\nmicromechanical problems, but an equivalent method is also developed for Finite\nElements (FE) showing the equivalence of both implementations. It is shown that\nthe stress-strain curves and the crack paths obtained using the crack control\nmethod are superposed in stable propagation regimes to those obtained using\nstrain control with a staggered scheme. J-integral calculations confirm that\nduring the propagation process in the crack control method, the energy release\nrate remains constant and equal to an effective fracture energy that has been\ndetermined as function of the discretization for FFT simulations. Finally, to\nshow the potential of the method, the technique is applied to simulate crack\npropagation through the microstructure of composites and porous materials\nproviding an estimation of the effective fracture toughness.\n",
