  "abstract": "  Ensemble learning has proven effective in improving predictive performance\nand estimating uncertainty in neural networks. However, conventional ensemble\nmethods often suffer from redundant parameter usage and computational\ninefficiencies due to entirely independent network training. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Divergent Ensemble Network (DEN), a novel\narchitecture that combines shared representation learning with independent\nbranching. DEN employs a shared input layer to capture common features across\nall branches, followed by divergent, independently trainable layers that form\nan ensemble. This shared-to-branching structure reduces parameter redundancy\nwhile maintaining ensemble diversity, enabling efficient and scalable learning.\n",
