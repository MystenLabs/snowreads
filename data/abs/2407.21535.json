Scoring systems have a long history of active use in safety-critical\ndomains such as healthcare and justice, where they provide guidance for making\nobjective and accurate decisions. Given their genuine interpretability, the\nidea of learning scoring systems from data is obviously appealing from the\nperspective of explainable AI. In this paper, we propose a practically\nmotivated extension of scoring systems called probabilistic scoring lists\n(PSL), as well as a method for learning PSLs from data. Instead of making a\ndeterministic decision, a PSL represents uncertainty in the form of probability\ndistributions, or, more generally, probability intervals. Moreover, in the\nspirit of decision lists, a PSL evaluates features one by one and stops as soon\nas a decision can be made with enough confidence. To evaluate our approach, we\nconduct a case study in the medical domain.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"QV4p546ptxqL0IE30bvHevR-F13eslziQ5ZTPGZYzmA","pdfSize":"1162545","objectId":"0xd84ec9b2960ea534cb40c60159a30cd771a71ebc0721c0b7b70f262f9f09a7fb","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
