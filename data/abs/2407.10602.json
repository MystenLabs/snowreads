The first one holds more\ngenerally, namely for spacetimes satisfying the null convergence condition and\ncontaining a timelike conformal Killing vector with a \"temporal function\". We\nshow that all marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTSs) in such a spacetime are\nunstable. This prevents application of standard results on the propagation of\nstable MOTSs to MOTTs. On the other hand, it was shown recently that, for every\nsufficiently high genus, there exists a smooth, complete family of CMC surfaces\nembedded in the round 3-sphere S3. This family connects a Lawson minimal\nsurface with a doubly covered geodesic 2-sphere. We show by a simple scaling\nargument that this result translates to an existence proof for complete MOTTs\nwith CMC sections in de Sitter spacetime. Moreover, the area of these sections\nincreases strictly monotonically. We compare this result with an area law\nobtained before for holographic screens.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zoyx-zKvNTCrNfm-P3qvKSuYWIt2qJ7k-U9rKMO032M","pdfSize":"229117"}
