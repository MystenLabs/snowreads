{"id":"2412.10769","title":"OB associations: from stellar to galactic scales","authors":"Alexis L.

They have\nbeen analysed for decades, but the arrival of Hipparcos, and more recently of\nGaia led to a change of paradigm by allowing the identification of more\nreliable members using parallaxes and proper motions. This renewed interest\noffers an opportunity to emphasize the role of OB associations across many\nareas of astronomy. In this review, I highlight their importance across\nmultiple scales: how OB associations constitute suitable sites to study massive\nstars and stellar multiplicity, their relation with star clusters, their\ninteractions with the interstellar medium through the feedback of their massive\nmembers, and how they shape the structure and evolution of the Milky Way and\nbeyond.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1UHnO850B2V_-VsaUseJEu8uQ4e4sOvMJ38iuFHUm5c","pdfSize":"4405443"}
