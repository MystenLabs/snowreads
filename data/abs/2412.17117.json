  "abstract": "  We study the recently-proposed hyperbolic approximation of the Korteweg-de\nVries equation (KdV).\n  We show that this approximation, which we call KdVH, possesses a rich variety\nof\n  solutions, including solitary wave solutions that approximate KdV solitons,\nas well as other\n  solitary and periodic solutions that are related to higher-order water wave\nmodels,\n  and may include singularities.\n  We analyze a class of implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta time discretizations for\nKdVH\n  that are asymptotic preserving, energy conserving, and can be applied to\nother hyperbolized\n  systems. We also develop structure-preserving spatial discretizations based\non summation-by-parts\n  operators in space including finite difference, discontinuous Galerkin, and\nFourier methods. We use the\n  relaxation approach to make the fully discrete schemes energy-preserving.\n  Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these discretizations.\n",
