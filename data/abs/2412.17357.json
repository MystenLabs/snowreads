We present a machine learning-based algorithm to compute the minimum\ncontrol bounds required to confine particles within a region indefinitely,\nusing only samples of orbits that iterate within the region before diverging.\nThis model-free approach achieves high accuracy, with a mean squared error of\n$2.88 \\times 10^{-4}$ and computation times in the range of seconds. The\nresults highlight its efficiency and potential for real-time control of chaotic\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gLJSSHPVrsw4Qop2QAb_Xf6_NkNIErN1FU1_gVU9rcQ","pdfSize":"7989398"}
