We introduce a combinatorial optimization method\nleveraging simulated annealing to explicitly construct geometrically consistent\nbrane tilings, providing a proof of concept for efficient generation of gauge\ntheories using metaheuristic techniques. The implementation of this idea\nrecovers known examples and allows us to derive a new brane tiling with $26$\nquantum fields, whose construction is beyond the computational power of current\nmethods.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"raey_HxaNcr4u8wjYe3s6rD5fHz76hBjJ5yCJ_tTf9I","pdfSize":"328706"}
