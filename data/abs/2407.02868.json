This method, called dimensional deconstruction, can be used\nto construct a model with one-dimensional discrete space, which represents\ngeneral graph structures. In this paper, we propose the models with two extra\ndimensions, which resemble two-dimensional tori, cylinders, and rectangular\nregions, as continuum limits. We also try to build a model that mimics one with\nthe two-dimensional orbifold compactification.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"h5w882wKI1J4blJEiQ8n1XSPl76WhpO1haJDIY5L-i8","pdfSize":"197413"}
