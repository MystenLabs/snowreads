These wormholes can be embedded\nas saddle point solutions of General Relativity coupled to the Standard Model,\nthe inflaton being identified with the Higgs particle. Our scenario is based on\nthe assumption that the quantum effective potential for the Higgs turns\nnegative at a certain high energy window, in line with current measured values\nfor the Higgs and Top quark masses. Within our proposal, we can estimate\nvarious parameters and physical quantities of interest, in consistency with\ncurrent observational bounds.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TkyqULWeKatK-86pOsbg_EHoFfS3HLrhZst8-YqMQuc","pdfSize":"767470"}
