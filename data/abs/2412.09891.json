These MP states represent the exact Ground State solutions of the\nsystem and display distinctive characteristics determined by a maximum of three\nparameters exhibiting one antiferromagnetic Haldane phase (AFMH), together with\na secondary weak antiferromagnetic (WAFM) and a weak ferromagnetic phase (WFM).\nUsing Transfer Matrix Method (TM), we have obtained nontrivial features in the\nvariation of Quantum Correlation measures and QIT Measures around the VBS point\nfor an acritical choice of the parameters, and a Quantum Critical Point, for a\ncritical choice of the parameters, of the AFMH spin liquid phase of the system.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JVwqmuHicwqEdqS2ToXpGc9hcpZC8XECln_Os7h5EQ8","pdfSize":"550099"}
