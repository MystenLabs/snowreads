  "abstract": "  Traditionally, alloying and thermal treatment are considered as the main\ntools for design of new materials. Application of first-principles simulations\ncan significantly accelerate the process of materials design, however, to\naccount for both, multicomponent chemical disorder and finite temperature\neffects in theoretical simulations is a challenging task. In this work we have\ntrained machine learning interatomic potential to effectively simulate finite\ntemperature elastic properties of multicomponent \\beta-Ti94-xNbxZr6 alloys. Our\nsimulations predict the presence of the elinvar effect for the wide range of\ntemperatures. Importantly, we predict that in a vicinity of dynamical and\nmechanical instability, the \\beta-Ti94-xNbxZr6 alloys demonstrate strongly\nnon-linear concentration-dependence of elastic moduli, which leads to low\nvalues of moduli comparable to that of human bone. Moreover, these alloys\ndemonstrate a strong anisotropy of directional Young's modulus which can be\nhelpful for microstructure tailoring and design of materials with desired\nelastic properties.\n",
