The spatial discretization employs the\nFourier spectral collocation method, while the time discretization is\nimplemented using ETD-based multistep schemes. The absence of a higher-order\ndiffusion term in the NCH equation poses a significant challenge to its\nconvergence analysis. To tackle this, we introduce new error decomposition\nformulas and employ the higher-order consistency analysis. These techniques\nenable us to establish the $\\ell^\\infty$ bound of numerical solutions under\nsome natural constraints. By treating the numerical solution as a perturbation\nof the exact solution, we derive optimal convergence rates in\n$\\ell^\\infty(0,T;H_h^{-1})\\cap \\ell^2(0,T; \\ell^2)$. We conduct several\nnumerical experiments to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed\nschemes, including convergence tests and the observation of long-term\ncoarsening dynamics.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kgJrsjUPOtfY978enmEo7_1ArRUp89PWXoXeUhl-PQc","pdfSize":"963152"}
