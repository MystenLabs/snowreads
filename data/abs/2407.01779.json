Since an\naccurate estimation of the RTF in a noisy and reverberant environment is a\ncumbersome task, we aim at leveraging prior knowledge of the acoustic enclosure\nto robustify the RTF estimation by learning the RTF manifold. In this paper, we\npresent a novel robust RTF identification method, tested and trained with real\nrecordings, which relies on learning the RTF manifold using a GCN to infer a\nrobust representation of the RTF in a confined area, and consequently enhance\nthe beamformer's performance.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eWeFHaUh1jgsZNqHU-AJ1SYoh9x4t-4KM9H_D9oT0M8","pdfSize":"11806111"}
