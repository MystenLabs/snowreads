  "abstract": "  We consider electronic spectra of twisted carbon nanotubes and their\nperturbation by impurity atoms absorbed at different positions on nanotube\nsurface within the framework of Anderson hybrid model. A special attention is\ngiven to the cases when 1D Weyl (massless Dirac) modes are present in the\nnanotube spectrum and their hybridization with localized impurity states\nproduces, with growing impurity concentration c, onset of a mobility gap near\nthe impurity level and then opening, at yet higher c, of some narrow range of\ndelocalized states within this mobility gap. Such behaviors are compared with\nsimilar effects in the previously studied 2D graphene, carbon nanoribbons, and\nnon-twisted carbon nanotubes. Some possible practical applications are\ndiscussed.\n",
