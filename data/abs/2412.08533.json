  "abstract": "  The computation of integrals is a fundamental task in the analysis of\nfunctional data, which are typically considered as random elements in a space\nof squared integrable functions. Borrowing ideas from recent advances in the\nMonte Carlo integration literature, we propose effective unbiased estimation\nand inference procedures for integrals of uni- and multivariate random\nfunctions. Several applications to key problems in functional data analysis\ninvolving random design points are studied and illustrated. In the absence of\nnoise, the proposed estimates converge faster than the sample mean and the\nusual algorithms for numerical integration. Moreover, the proposed estimator\nfacilitates effective inference by generally providing better coverage with\nshorter confidence and prediction intervals, in both noisy and noiseless\nsetups.\n",
