  "abstract": "  Superoscillatory functions represent a counterintuitive phenomenon in physics\nbut also in mathematics, where a band-limited function oscillates faster than\nits highest Fourier component. They appear in various contexts, including\nquantum mechanics, as a result of a weak measurement introduced by Y. Aharonov\nand collaborators. These functions can be extended to the complex variable and\nare a specific instance of the more general notion of supershift. The aim of\nthis paper is to extend the notion of superoscillatory functions to the\nhypercomplex setting. This extension is richer than the complex case since the\nFueter-Sce extension theorem for Clifford-valued functions provides two notions\nof hyperholomorphic functions. We will explore these notions and address the\ncorresponding superoscillating theories.\n",
