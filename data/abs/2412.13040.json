Physiological\nstretching has been found to regulate soft tissue function at the molecular,\ncellular, and tissue scales, allowing tissues to preserve their homeostasis and\nadapt to challenges. In contrast, dysregulated or pathological stretching can\ninduce damage and tissue fragilisation. Many mechanisms have been described for\nthe repair of epithelial tissues across a range of time-scales. In this review,\nwe present the timescales of (i) physiological cyclic loading regimes, (ii)\nstrain-regulated remodelling and damage accumulation, and (iii) repair\nmechanisms in epithelial tissues. We discuss how fatigue in biological tissues\ndiffers from synthetic materials, in that damage can be partially or fully\nreversed by repair mechanisms acting on timescales shorter than cyclic loading.\nWe highlight that timescales are critical to understanding the interplay\nbetween damage and repair in tissues that experience cyclic loading, opening up\nnew avenues for exploring soft tissue homeostasis.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Quantitative Biology/Cell Behavior","Quantitative Biology/Tissues and Organs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"uU5BzmLshbJzxly-WBFGh2GJwKxbUeg90zbPnqyVYQc","pdfSize":"3448828"}
