  "abstract": "  With the rise of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in smart homes and the\nintegration of artificial intelligence (AI), ethical concerns have become\nincreasingly significant. This paper explores the ethical implications of\nAI-driven detection technologies in smart homes using the User Requirements\nNotation (URN) framework. In this paper, we thoroughly conduct thousands of\nrelated works from 1985 to 2024 to identify key trends in AI ethics, algorithm\nmethods, and technological advancements. The study presents an overview of\nsmart home and AI ethics, comparing traditional and AI-specific ethical issues,\nand provides guidelines for ethical design across areas like privacy, fairness,\ntransparency, accountability, and user autonomy, offering insights for\ndevelopers and researchers in smart homes.\n",
