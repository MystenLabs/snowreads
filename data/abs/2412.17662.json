We calculate the internal energy of the spin chain and\nthe system temperature using the R\\'{e}nyi distribution and postulate them to\nbe equal to their counterparts, obtained in the microcanonical ensemble. It\nallows us to self-consistently derive the R\\'{e}nyi $q$-index and the Lagrange\nparameter $T$ to relate them to the physically observed system temperature\n$T_{\\rm ph}$, and to show that the entropic phase transitions are possible in a\nbroad temperature domain. We have also studied the temperature dependence of\nthe internal energy $U(T_{\\rm ph})$ at constant $q$ and an influence of the\nsize related effects on the system thermodynamics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"O7Jx7zF4viNfbuHviYF9PpfggkBQa5ddBRX-aoBZ_Cg","pdfSize":"981929"}
