  "abstract": "  Inspired by Gansner's elegant $k$-trace generating function for rectangular\nplane partitions, we introduce two novel operators, $\\varphi_{z}$ and\n$\\psi_{z}$, along with their combinatorial interpretations. Through these\noperators, we derive a new formula for $P$-partitions of posets extended by\ntwo-rowed plane partitions. This formula allows us to compute explicit\nenumerative generating functions for various classes of $P$-partitions. Our\nfindings encompass skew plane partitions, diamond-related two-rowed plane\npartitions, an extended $V$-poset, and ladder poset extensions, enriching the\ntheory of $P$-partitions.\n",
