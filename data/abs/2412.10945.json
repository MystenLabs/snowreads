However, their\nhigh computational cost makes them impractical for applications requiring rapid\nresponses or iterative processes, such as optimization, uncertainty\nquantification, or inverse modeling. To address this challenge, this work\nintroduces the Dual-Stage Temporal Three-dimensional UNet Super-resolution\n(DST3D-UNet-SR) model, a highly efficient deep learning model for plume\ndispersion prediction. DST3D-UNet-SR is composed of two sequential modules: the\ntemporal module (TM), which predicts the transient evolution of a plume in\ncomplex terrain from low-resolution temporal data, and the spatial refinement\nmodule (SRM), which subsequently enhances the spatial resolution of the TM\npredictions. We train DST3DUNet- SR using a comprehensive dataset derived from\nhigh-resolution large eddy simulations (LES) of plume transport. We propose the\nDST3D-UNet-SR model to significantly accelerate LES simulations of\nthree-dimensional plume dispersion by three orders of magnitude. Additionally,\nthe model demonstrates the ability to dynamically adapt to evolving conditions\nthrough the incorporation of new observational data, substantially improving\nprediction accuracy in high-concentration regions near the source.\n  Keywords: Atmospheric sciences, Geosciences, Plume transport,3D temporal\nsequences, Artificial intelligence, CNN, LSTM, Autoencoder, Autoregressive\nmodel, U-Net, Super-resolution, Spatial Refinement.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DmnItXO0uuNsbCRl9GZvrq0iK-uQCItrXpPFRAXfQzU","pdfSize":"5880759"}
