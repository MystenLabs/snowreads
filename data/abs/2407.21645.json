The recent discovery of a 2D\nmultiferroic with strong magnetoelectric coupling in NiI$_2$ offers a promising\nplatform for the electrical control of spin-wave transport. In this work, using\nab initio calculations, we investigate how the magnonic properties of monolayer\nNiI$_2$ can be controlled using an external electric field. We show that the\nemergence of a ferroelectric polarization leads to an energy splitting in the\nmagnon spectrum, thus establishing a way to detect the electric polarization\nexperimentally. We also show the modulation of the magnon splitting and the\nenergy position of the singularities in magnon DOS by an electric field due to\nthe strong magnetoelectric coupling. Our results highlight the interplay\nbetween ferroelectricity and magnons in van der Waals multiferroics and pave\nthe way to design electrically tunable magnetic devices at the 2D limit.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"71PMG3fEbGdhEEvLPGAZ4jdMjs538GZWPB8kj8tNtDs","pdfSize":"17442568"}
