  "abstract": "  The self-diffusion process in a dense liquid is influenced by collective\nparticle movements. Extensive molecular dynamics simulations for liquid\naluminium and rubidium evidence a crossover in the diffusion coefficient at\nabout $1.4$ times the melting temperature $T_m$, indicating a profound change\nin the diffusion mechanism. The corresponding velocity auto-correlation\nfunctions demonstrate a decrease of the cage effect with a gradual set-in of a\npower-law decay, the celebrate {\\it long time tail}. This behavior is caused by\na competition of density fluctuations near the melting point with vortex-type\nparticle patterns from transverse currents in the hot fluid. The investigation\nof the velocity autocorrelation function evidences a gradual transition in\ndynamics with rising temperature. The competition between these two collective\nparticle movements, one hindering and one enhancing the diffusion process,\nleads to a non-Arrhenius-type behavior of the diffusion coefficient around\n$1.4~T_m$, which signals the transition from a dense to a fluid-like liquid\ndynamics in the potential energy landscape picture.\n",
