  "abstract": "  We revisit axion monodromy inflation in the context of UV-complete theories\nand point out that its cosmological observables are sensitive to heavy fields\nwith masses far above the Hubble scale, such as the moduli of flux\ncompactifications. By studying a string-inspired two-field extension of axion\nmonodromy, we reveal that the oscillatory modulation of the axion potential\nleads to continuous excitation of heavy fields during inflation when the\nmodulation frequency exceeds the field masses. This finding challenges the\nconventional single-field description, as heavy moduli cannot be simply\nintegrated out. Using a full bootstrap analysis, we demonstrate that this\nmechanism produces cosmological collider signals that bypass the usual\nBoltzmann suppression for heavy masses. Specifically, we identify detectably\nlarge signatures of heavy moduli in the primordial bispectrum, offering a\npromising avenue for probing high-energy physics through cosmological\nobservations.\n",
