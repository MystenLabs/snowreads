Great strides have been made\ntowards automated radiology report generation via AI, yet ensuring clinical\naccuracy in generated reports is a significant challenge, hindering deployment\nof such methods in clinical practice. In this work we propose a quality control\nframework for assessing the reliability of AI-generated radiology reports with\nrespect to semantics of diagnostic importance using modular auxiliary auditing\ncomponents (AC). Evaluating our pipeline on the MIMIC-CXR dataset, our findings\nshow that incorporating ACs in the form of disease-classifiers can enable\nauditing that identifies more reliable reports, resulting in higher F1 scores\ncompared to unfiltered generated reports. Additionally, leveraging the\nconfidence of the AC labels further improves the audit's effectiveness.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ucCB6zf_1jHwjyGAThxK3Z7FtgA8o_XNFaii5W3Lypg","pdfSize":"1555038"}
