By defining a Riemannian metric which increases with\ndecreasing probability density, shortest paths naturally follow the data\nmanifold and points are clustered according to the modes of the data. We show\nthat existing methods to estimate Fermat distances, a particular choice of DBD,\nsuffer from poor convergence in both low and high dimensions due to i)\ninaccurate density estimates and ii) reliance on graph-based paths which are\nincreasingly rough in high dimensions. To address these issues, we propose\nlearning the densities using a normalizing flow, a generative model with\ntractable density estimation, and employing a smooth relaxation method using a\nscore model initialized from a graph-based proposal. Additionally, we introduce\na dimension-adapted Fermat distance that exhibits more intuitive behavior when\nscaled to high dimensions and offers better numerical properties. Our work\npaves the way for practical use of density-based distances, especially in\nhigh-dimensional spaces.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6vlAlRRZZCh4JhRjs9EWy9LJ79o1wVqV_JD6XIMuHHI","pdfSize":"1180867"}
