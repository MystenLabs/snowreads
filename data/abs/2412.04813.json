The recent discovery of the magnetoelectric\neffect in the 2D stripy antiferromagnet CrOCl highlights this semiconductor as\na promising platform to explore electric field effects on magnetoresistance. In\nthis study, we systematically investigate the magnetoresistance in tunneling\njunctions of bilayer and monolayer CrOCl. We observe that the transition from\nantiferromagnetic to ferrimagnetic phases in both cases induces a positive\nmagnetoresistance at low bias voltages, which reverses to a negative value at\nhigher bias voltages. This polarity reversal is attributed to the additional\nelectric dipoles present in the antiferromagnetic state, as supported by our\ntheoretical calculations. These findings suggest a pathway for the electric\ncontrol of spintronic devices and underscore the potential of 2D magnets like\nCrOCl in advancing energy-efficient spintronic applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YGlpSeh08-T9o_7oQ5NeEsiuuB02rtVP7MiyM7EPm84","pdfSize":"2189968"}
