Here we\ndescribe an approach to teaching quantum formalism and postulates that can be\nused with first-year undergraduate students and even high school students. The\nonly pre-requisite is a familiarity with vector dot products. This approach\nenables students to learn Dirac notation and core postulates of quantum\nmechanics at a much earlier stage in their academic career, which can help\nstudents prepare for careers in quantum science and engineering and advance the\nSecond Quantum Revolution.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lcpUDjcZ4J3UtYx67lN41ChG6EXqIJbWgcivFaA5n1w","pdfSize":"2617484"}
