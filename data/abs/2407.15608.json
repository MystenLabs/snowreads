StylusAI is\nspecifically designed to adapt and integrate the stylistic nuances of one\nlanguage's handwriting into another, particularly focusing on blending English\nhandwriting styles into the context of the German writing system. This approach\nenables the generation of German text in English handwriting styles and German\nhandwriting styles into English, enriching machine-generated handwriting\ndiversity while ensuring that the generated text remains legible across both\nlanguages. To support the development and evaluation of StylusAI, we present\nthe \\lq{Deutscher Handschriften-Datensatz}\\rq~(DHSD), a comprehensive dataset\nencompassing 37 distinct handwriting styles within the German language. This\ndataset provides a fundamental resource for training and benchmarking in the\nrealm of handwritten text generation. Our results demonstrate that StylusAI not\nonly introduces a new method for style adaptation in handwritten text\ngeneration but also surpasses existing models in generating handwriting samples\nthat improve both text quality and stylistic fidelity, evidenced by its\nperformance on the IAM database and our newly proposed DHSD. Thus, StylusAI\nrepresents a significant advancement in the field of handwriting style\ngeneration, offering promising avenues for future research and applications in\ncross-linguistic style adaptation for languages with similar scripts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"I-lBMdlmyemPtnoJb0s5PkFyqe-z2EdbpbMrAxoxsb4","pdfSize":"1410663"}
