This method was proposed based on binary endpoint, limiting its\nwider application. This short communication proposed a generalized framework of\nusing P-value combination test to implement pruning and pooling process in\nbasket trials. Only P-values of any type of statistical testing from each\ncohort are needed for decision making, which provides great flexibility for\nbasket trial designs with P&P approach.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"C3Y01Q9FIu_SrEbYVKBRX4W0LmKoysmt72iOu3E91gg","pdfSize":"261407"}
