They\ndistribute quantum information services across commercial optical fiber links\nand are key ingredient in developing quantum repeaters architectures.\nCurrently, the most robust quantum light sources are Quantum Dots made of III-V\nmaterials. They emit highly indistinguishable photons on-demand and with high\nefficiency. Established devices work at near-infrared wavelengths (NIR) and\nfurther research is needed to develop devices working in telecommunication\nwavelengths O- and S-bands. In this contribution, we propose and model a\nbroadband optical antenna working in O-band. It exhibits high extraction\nefficiencies with small Purcell enhancement around 2. We also examine far field\nemission from these structures, ensuring Gaussian mode profile is observed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"q_UlgW3Fr_TK7cyKgEsUR8JNLagS-5EVFY9CFVwBpwI","pdfSize":"1006177"}
