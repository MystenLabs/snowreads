We investigate several subleading-power\ncorrections to these form factors at tree level, including the next-to-leading\npower contributions from the hard-collinear propagator, the subleading power\ncorrections from the effective current\n$\\bar{q}\\Gamma[i\\slashed{D}_{\\perp}/(2m_b)]h_v$, and four-body higher-twist\neffects. By utilizing the available leading-power results at\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s)$ and the power corrections from higher-twist $B$-meson\nlight-cone distribution amplitudes from our previous work, we further derive\nthe improved numerical predictions for $B\\to K^*$ form factors by applying the\nthree-parameter model for $B$-meson light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs).\nThe subleading-power contribution is about $30\\%$ relative to the corresponding\nleading-power result. Taking the well-adopted Bourrely-Caprini-Lellouch (BCL)\nparametrization, we then provide the numerical results of $B\\to K^*$ form\nfactors in the entire kinematic range, by adopting the combined fit to both\nLCSR predictions and lattice QCD results. Taking advantage of the newly\nobtained $B\\to K^*$ form factors, we analyse the rare exclusive decay $B \\to\nK^* \\nu_\\ell\\bar{\\nu}_\\ell$ and estimate the Standard Model predictions of\n$\\mathcal{BR}(\\bar{B}^0 \\to \\bar{K}^{*0} \\nu_\\ell\\bar{\\nu}_\\ell)=7.54(86)\\times\n10^{-6}$, $\\mathcal{BR}(\\bar{B}^+ \\to \\bar{K}^{*+}\n\\nu_\\ell\\bar{\\nu}_\\ell)=9.35(94)\\times 10^{-6}$ and longitudinal $K^*$\npolarization fraction $F_L=0.44(4)$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MVNyVKhsI38B_F0KJbtDTcYWbjCsdUptd4U4Ukt4Np8","pdfSize":"1484652"}
