This one establishes a framework and carries out the classification\nwork for arc-transitive maps with solvable automorphism groups, which\nillustrates how the edge number impacts on the Euler characteristic for maps.\nThe classification is involved with the constructions of various new and\ninteresting arc-regular maps.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"W6Ue7Ac1BNr6qpatHjY982rNSE7oOl1IyFuRK05D5HU","pdfSize":"259053"}
