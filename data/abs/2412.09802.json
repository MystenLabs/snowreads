We engineer the system to function\nas an engine by changing the magnetic field according to specific protocols.\nSubsequently, we analyze the engine's performance using various protocols and\nstochastic thermodynamics to compute average values of crucial quantities for\nquantifying engine performance. In the longtime limit of the engine cycle, we\nderive exact analytical expressions for work, heat, and efficiency in terms of\na generalized protocol. We then analyze the model in terms of optimization of\nefficiency and power. Additionally, we use different protocols and employ a\ngradient descent algorithm to best fit those to obtain optimal efficiency and\nthen optimal power for a finite cycle time. All the protocols converge to the\npiece-wise constant protocol during efficiency optimization. We then explore a\nmore general approach using the variational principle to determine the optimal\nprotocols for optimizing power and efficiency. During the optimization process\nfor both power and efficiency, the net entropy production decreases, which\nenhances the engine's performance. This approach demonstrates the superior\noptimization of efficiency and power in this system compared to the gradient\ndescent algorithm.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CNbcZvhUaEIHc738YpNPea5ycwrzXDlYM3OUYb5Buqk","pdfSize":"1969618"}
