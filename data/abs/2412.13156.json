While conventional\nstrategies -- such as domain-specific augmentation, specialized architectures,\nand tailored training procedures -- can alleviate these issues, they depend on\nthe availability and reliability of domain knowledge. When such knowledge is\nunavailable, misleading, or improperly applied, performance may deteriorate. In\nresponse, we introduce a novel, domain-agnostic, add-on, and data-driven\nstrategy inspired by image stacking in image denoising. Termed ``semantic\nstacking,'' our method estimates a denoised semantic representation that\ncomplements the conventional segmentation loss during training. This method\ndoes not depend on domain-specific assumptions, making it broadly applicable\nacross diverse image modalities, model architectures, and augmentation\ntechniques. Through extensive experiments, we validate the superiority of our\napproach in improving segmentation performance under diverse conditions.
