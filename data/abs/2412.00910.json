The Lax pair provides a description of the\nevolution of the poles. By considering a half-spin formulation, we use linear\nalgebra to derive a time evolution equation followed by the half-spins, in the\nmoving frame provided by the Lax pair. We then rewrite this formula using a\nToeplitz operator and $G$, the adjoint of the operator of multiplication by $x$\non the Hardy space $L_+^2(\\mathbb{R})$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"LmsjaG51r8DITRkUBj9wtfliDtC20bxxsKqIz8V7lqs","pdfSize":"258414"}
