However, the development of such intelligent digital assistants\npresents a formidable challenge. To address this, we introduce TOM, a\nconceptual architecture and software platform (https://github.com/TOM-Platform)\ndesigned to support the development of intelligent wearable assistants that are\ncontextually aware of both the user and the environment. This system was\ndeveloped collaboratively with AR/MR researchers, HCI researchers, AI/Robotic\nresearchers, and software developers, and it continues to evolve to meet the\ndiverse requirements of these stakeholders. TOM facilitates the creation of\nintelligent assistive AR applications for daily activities and supports the\nrecording and analysis of user interactions, integration of new devices, and\nthe provision of assistance for various activities. Additionally, we showcase\nseveral proof-of-concept assistive services and discuss the challenges involved\nin developing such services.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"x4bqDaOx5Ke0EKo9wWjOM1SeYZQO5FuvQktEUGHhwAQ","pdfSize":"3820488"}
