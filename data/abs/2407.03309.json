Recently, an extension of these\nresults to distance matrices of block graphs was given. In this work, we extend\nthese results to two additional distance-type matrices associated with trees:\nthe Min-4PC matrix and the 2-Steiner distance matrix. We show that the\nsequences of coefficients of the characteristic polynomials of these matrices\nare both unimodal and log-concave. Moreover, we find the peak location for the\ncoefficients of the characteristic polynomials of the Min-4PC matrix of any\ntree on $n$ vertices. Further, we show that the Min-4PC matrix of any tree on\n$n$ vertices is isometrically embeddable in $\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ equipped with\nthe $\\ell_1$ norm.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xyd7gxPiO7VtBDPFkyZX95-2dEvUpY6G88kbhDNcLwY","pdfSize":"411492"}
