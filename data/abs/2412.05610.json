Flat dispersion arises from\ndestructive interference between neighboring elements, resulting in a zero\ngroup velocity across all momenta. This unique condition enables the formation\nof wave modes that are not only highly localized in space and inherently\nnon-propagative-protected by the flatness of the dispersion relation-but also\nexceptionally sensitive to structural variations due to enhanced wave-structure\ninteraction. These features are first explored on a simple spring-mass lattice\nand later applied to a microelectromechanical (MEMS) system of oscillators. By\nexploring the role of flat-band dispersion in mechanics, this work provides new\ninsights into their fundamental dynamics while opening new opportunities for\napplications in vibration control and the sensitivity analysis of mechanical\nstructures.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xVr5DmNNtBQqiya3YIeLWXvCf1Cemb1ubQ-0GmqcTeQ","pdfSize":"3517188"}
