We also furnish a strategy to\ninvestigate the topology of the unitary dual of a crystallography group using\nsequences of matrices. All irreducible representations (up to unitary\nequivalence) of the dimension 3 crystallography group 90 and some calculations\ninvolving sequences of these irreducible representations are included as a\nproof of concept of this procedure and strategy.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GFDNlWJx8iMjrLABzcTS2l9WUqpt1WvYAXjImCRSX4s","pdfSize":"376004"}
