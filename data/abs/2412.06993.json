  "abstract": "  We present an approach of using AI to model and simulate biology and life.\nWhy is it important? Because at the core of medicine, pharmacy, public health,\nlongevity, agriculture and food security, environmental protection, and clean\nenergy, it is biology at work. Biology in the physical world is too complex to\nmanipulate and always expensive and risky to tamper with. In this perspective,\nwe layout an engineering viable approach to address this challenge by\nconstructing an AI-Driven Digital Organism (AIDO), a system of integrated\nmultiscale foundation models, in a modular, connectable, and holistic fashion\nto reflect biological scales, connectedness, and complexities. An AIDO opens up\na safe, affordable and high-throughput alternative platform for predicting,\nsimulating and programming biology at all levels from molecules to cells to\nindividuals. We envision that an AIDO is poised to trigger a new wave of\nbetter-guided wet-lab experimentation and better-informed first-principle\nreasoning, which can eventually help us better decode and improve life.\n",
