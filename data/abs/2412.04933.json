  "abstract": "  The Harer-Zagier (HZ) transform maps the HOMFLY-PT polynomial into a rational\nfunction. For some special knots and links, the latter admits a simple\nfactorised form, which is referred to as HZ factorisation. This property is\npreserved under full twists and concatenation with the Jucys-Murphy braid,\nwhich are hence used to generate infinite HZ-factorisable families. For such\nfamilies, the HOMFLY-PT polynomial can be fully encoded in two sets of\nintegers, corresponding to the numerator and denominator exponents, which turn\nout to be related to the Khovanov homology and its Euler characteristics.\nMoreover, a relation between the HOMFLY-PT and Kauffman polynomials, which was\noriginally found for torus knots, is now proven for several such families.\nInterestingly, this relation is equivalent to the vanishing of the two-crosscap\nBPS invariants in topological string theory. It is conjectured that the\nHOMFLY-PT-Kauffman relation provides a criterion for HZ factorisability.\n",
