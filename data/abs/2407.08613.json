Using bosonization, we derive an\neffective action coupling electronic and mechanical degrees of freedom.\nStikingly, at a quantum phase transition between straight and bent wire states,\nwe find a gapped phonon mode and a gapless mode with quadratic dispersion,\nsignaling the breaking of Lorentz invariance. We explore stability conditions\nfor general potentials and propose nano-mechanical back-action as a sensitive\ntool for detecting this transition, with implications for Sliding Luttinger\nLiquids and dimensional crossover studies.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"c92FJCFOR4MVre5qlnAsEAjuVC6c5TczqHEYgZ3mwF4","pdfSize":"844367"}
