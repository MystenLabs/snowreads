We find that VLMs produce competitive results\nafter two or less epochs of fine-tuning. We develop a novel approach that\nincorporates graphical data representations as images in conjunction with\nnumerical data. This approach is rooted in the hypothesis that graphical\nrepresentations can provide additional contextual information that numerical\ndata alone may not capture. Additionally, providing a graphical representation\ncan circumvent issues such as limited context length faced by LLMs. To further\nadvance this work, we implemented a scalable end-to-end pipeline for training\non different scenarios, allowing us to isolate the most effective strategies\nfor transferring learning capabilities from LLMs to Time Series Classification\n(TSC) tasks. Our approach works with univariate and multivariate time-series\ndata. In addition, we conduct extensive and practical experiments to show how\nthis approach works for time-series classification and generative labels.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qdb-4bJ4uaEp7a0-XcwK7OBCho3C50PoX6KIk6ANE3w","pdfSize":"592325"}
