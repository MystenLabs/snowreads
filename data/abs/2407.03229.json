In this model, we are given an oracle\nthat takes as its input a set of elements, and returns as its output the\nminimum of the ranks of the given set in the two matroids. For the unweighted\nmatroid intersection problem, we show how to construct a necessary part of the\nexchangeability graph, which enables us to emulate the standard augmenting path\nalgorithm. Furthermore, we reformulate Edmonds' min-max theorem only using the\nminimum rank function, providing a new perspective on this result. For the\nweighted problem, the tractability is open in general. Nevertheless, we\ndescribe several special cases where tractability can be achieved, and we\ndiscuss potential approaches and the challenges encountered. In particular, we\npresent a solution for the case where no circuit of one matroid is contained\nwithin a circuit of the other. Additionally, we propose a fixed-parameter\ntractable algorithm, parameterized by the maximum circuit size. We also show\nthat a lexicographically maximal common independent set can be found by the\nsame approach, which leads to at least $1/2$-approximation for finding a\nmaximum-weight common independent set.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hIecJXlStVIKMNZ1OkpFLoD9ufS92kh3lqSYQNiiDNY","pdfSize":"578935"}
