These include new decision procedures, new implementations of\nSMT theory solvers, and new software verifiers that rely on SMT solving for\nfinite fields. To support interoperability in this emerging ecosystem, we\npropose the SMT-LIB theory of finite field arithmetic (FFA). The theory defines\na canonical representation of finite field elements as well as definitions of\noperations and predicates on finite field elements.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jt5k5HrWHU-70xe77zTKy_7OEVbaHveOCjsy-gAyCx8","pdfSize":"827988"}
