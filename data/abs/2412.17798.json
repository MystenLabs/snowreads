In particular,\nwe give an ideal-theoretic characterization of generic absolute concentration\nrobustness, as well as conditions under which a network that admits multiple\nsteady states also has the capacity for nondegenerate multistationarity. The\nkey tools underlying our results come from the theory of vertically\nparametrized systems, and include a linear algebra condition that characterizes\nwhen the steady state system has positive nondegenerate zeros.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Molecular Networks","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CdrumHSz_zub1wk98_0MQoXvrT7ekw9eJa_LxnIPf3c","pdfSize":"662384"}
