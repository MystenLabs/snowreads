For proteins under 36\nresidues, our hybrid reservoir-based model combines fixed random projections\nwith trainable deep layers, achieving optimal conformations with 25% fewer\ntraining episodes. For longer sequences, we employ a long short-term memory\nnetwork with multi-headed attention, matching best-known energy values. Both\narchitectures leverage a stabilized Deep Q-Learning framework with experience\nreplay and target networks, demonstrating consistent achievement of optimal\nconformations while significantly improving training efficiency compared to\nexisting methods.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"2g2iMUZ0jjyp8y0hEet4JLEGHMGkoNJz3_J1_vgsaB0","pdfSize":"3465431"}
