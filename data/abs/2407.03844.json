Its rigorous derivation from the nonlocal aggregation equation,\nmotivated by the desire to link interacting particle systems and continuous\ndescriptions, has received much attention in recent years. In the recent\narticle, we showed how to treat the case of degenerate mobility for the first\ntime. Here, we discuss how to adapt the exploited tools to the case of the\nmobility $m(u)=u\\,(1-u)$ as in the original works of Giacomin-Lebowitz and\nElliott-Garcke. The main additional information is the boundedness of $u$,\nimplied by the form of mobility, which allows handling the nonlinear terms. We\nalso discuss the case of (mildly) singular kernels and a model of cell-cell\nadhesion with the same mobility.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"waHY1_qQHtjCfTFbu47Ukrh3PesA6zZlShlpHhqDnRw","pdfSize":"1712601"}
