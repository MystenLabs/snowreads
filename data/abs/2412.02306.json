  "abstract": "  Non-rigid shape deformations pose significant challenges, and most existing\nmethods struggle to handle partial deformations effectively. We present Partial\nNon-rigid Deformations and interpolations of the human body Surfaces (PaNDAS),\na new method to learn local and global deformations of 3D surface meshes by\nbuilding on recent deep models. Unlike previous approaches, our method enables\nrestricting deformations to specific parts of the shape in a versatile way and\nallows for mixing and combining various poses from the database, all while not\nrequiring any optimization at inference time. We demonstrate that the proposed\nframework can be used to generate new shapes, interpolate between parts of\nshapes, and perform other shape manipulation tasks with state-of-the-art\naccuracy and greater locality across various types of human surface data. Code\nand data will be made available soon.\n",
