Among\nthese, the control of magnetism through ion migration has emerged as a\npromising approach due to the inherent memory and nonlinearity of ionically\nconducting and magnetic materials. In this work, we present a lithium-ion-based\nmagneto-ionic device that uses applied voltages to control the magnetic domain\nstate of a perpendicularly magnetized ferromagnetic layer. This behavior\nemulates the analog and non-volatile properties of biological synapses and\nenables the creation of a simple reservoir computing system. To illustrate its\ncapabilities, the device is used in a waveform classification task, where the\nvoltage amplitude range and magnetic bias field are tuned to optimize the\nrecognition accuracy.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nYB8LPKzuebxNNlR2XnC5uSXW0C_twEVnO7hUbmq9Zw","pdfSize":"8732358"}
