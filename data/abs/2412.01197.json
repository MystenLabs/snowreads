They struggle to maintain consistency in both the foreground and\nbackground during concept swapping, especially when the shape difference is\nlarge between objects. Additionally, they either require time-consuming\ntraining processes or involve redundant calculations during inference. To\ntackle these issues, we introduce InstantSwap, a new CCS method that aims to\nhandle sharp shape disparity at speed. Specifically, we first extract the bbox\nof the object in the source image automatically based on attention map analysis\nand leverage the bbox to achieve both foreground and background consistency.\nFor background consistency, we remove the gradient outside the bbox during the\nswapping process so that the background is free from being modified. For\nforeground consistency, we employ a cross-attention mechanism to inject\nsemantic information into both source and target concepts inside the box. This\nhelps learn semantic-enhanced representations that encourage the swapping\nprocess to focus on the foreground objects. To improve swapping speed, we avoid\ncomputing gradients at each timestep but instead calculate them periodically to\nreduce the number of forward passes, which improves efficiency a lot with a\nlittle sacrifice on performance. Finally, we establish a benchmark dataset to\nfacilitate comprehensive evaluation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the\nsuperiority and versatility of InstantSwap.
