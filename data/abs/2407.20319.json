Shenker, we\nconsider non-perturbative effects of characteristic strength\n$\\mathcal{O}(e^{-1/g_{s}})$, with $g_{s}$ the closed string coupling constant,\nin supersymmetric critical heterotic string theories. We argue that in 10D such\neffects arise from heterotic \"D-instantons,\" i.e. heterotic disk diagrams,\nwhose existence relies on a non-trivial interplay between worldsheet and\nspacetime degrees of freedom. In compactifications of the\n$\\mathrm{SemiSpin}(32)$ heterotic string, we argue that similar effects can\narise from wrapped Euclidean non-BPS \"D-strings.\" Two general principles arise:\nThe first is that the consistency of those heterotic branes on which the\nfundamental string can end relies on an inflow mechanism for spacetime degrees\nof freedom. The second is that Shenker's argument, taken to its logical\nconclusion, implies that all closed string theories must exhibit open strings\nas well.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"W8PIBQMuWEkEoDoECFnYgF6w3Je4Vurbskq37XjkszA","pdfSize":"512230"}
