We derive explicit\nformulae for the leading order profiles of eleven types of stationary solutions\nto a one-dimensional two-layer thin-film liquid model considered with an\nintermolecular potential depending on both layer heights. The found solutions\nare composed of the repeated elementary blocks (bulk, contact line and\nultra-thin film ones) being consistently asymptotically matched together. We\nshow that once considered on a finite interval with Neumann boundary conditions\nthese stationary solutions are either dynamically stable or weakly\ntranslationally unstable. Other composite solutions are found to be numerically\nunstable and rather exhibit complex coarsening dynamics.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BrJUTHoNpHzU5O5sZVCN11y9o59P9u0GlPTqoasPAeQ","pdfSize":"2144909","objectId":"0x26a5a89f1954f48e6846a934c7b53aa87826d2aa5be083950f7c0ae4797fe28e","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
