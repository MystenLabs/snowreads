In particular, we establish the convergence of the velocity as $y\\cdot\nn \\rightarrow \\infty$. We obtain this convergence for arbitrary normals $n\\in\n\\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$. Moreover, we build an asymptotic expansion of Poisson's\nkernel for the periodically oscillating Stokes operator in the half-space.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"uvXFYtPO45Pn1e5wQT68G5YfktTfodnzsxE18ul36cQ","pdfSize":"1930860","objectId":"0xaf15a9191fb47e9825a7907653ed7b6736c3baeb85c2ec520b37feba65e8c780","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
