  "abstract": "  Variational quantum circuits have arisen as an important method in quantum\ncomputing. A crucial step of it is parameter optimization, which is typically\ntackled through gradient-descent techniques. We advantageously explore instead\nthe use of evolutionary algorithms for such optimization, specifically for\ntime-series forecasting. We perform a comparison, for diverse instances of\nreal-world data, between gradient-descent parameter optimization and\ncovariant-matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy. We observe that gradient\ndescent becomes permanently trapped in local minima that have been avoided by\nevolutionary algorithms in all tested datasets, reaching up to a six-fold\ndecrease in prediction error. Finally, the combined use of evolutionary and\ngradient-based techniques is explored, aiming at retaining advantages of both.\nThe results are particularly applicable in scenarios sensitive to gains in\naccuracy.\n",
