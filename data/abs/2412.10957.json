  "abstract": "  Exbodiment describes mind outsourced to engineered matter and how matter\nreeducates mind. The constraints of exbodied matter encode elements of thought,\nchannel decision-making, and constitute an important part of an extended\ncomputational phenotype. Here I provide an introduction and brief cultural\nhistory of exbodiment in music, natural history, cognition, and astrobiology.\nThe \"Helix of Exbodiment\" is introduced to illustrate continuous feedback\nbetween mind and matter.\n",
