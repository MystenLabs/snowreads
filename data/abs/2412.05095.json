  "abstract": "  Text-to-motion generation is essential for advancing the creative industry\nbut often presents challenges in producing consistent, realistic motions. To\naddress this, we focus on fine-tuning text-to-motion models to consistently\nfavor high-quality, human-preferred motions, a critical yet largely unexplored\nproblem. In this work, we theoretically investigate the DPO under both online\nand offline settings, and reveal their respective limitation: overfitting in\noffline DPO, and biased sampling in online DPO. Building on our theoretical\ninsights, we introduce Semi-online Preference Optimization (SoPo), a DPO-based\nmethod for training text-to-motion models using \"semi-online\" data pair,\nconsisting of unpreferred motion from online distribution and preferred motion\nin offline datasets. This method leverages both online and offline DPO,\nallowing each to compensate for the other's limitations. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that SoPo outperforms other preference alignment methods, with an\nMM-Dist of 3.25% (vs e.g. 0.76% of MoDiPO) on the MLD model, 2.91% (vs e.g.\n0.66% of MoDiPO) on MDM model, respectively. Additionally, the MLD model\nfine-tuned by our SoPo surpasses the SoTA model in terms of R-precision and MM\nDist. Visualization results also show the efficacy of our SoPo in preference\nalignment.
