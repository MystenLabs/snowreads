The evaluation of programs within this architecture is\ninherently highly parallel and localized, allowing for faster computation,\nreduced energy consumption, improved scalability, enhanced reliability, and\nincreased resistance to attacks. In this paper, we introduce the machine\nlanguage LambdaM, detail its compilation into KVY assembler code, and describe\nthe abstract machine Matrima. The best part of Matrima is its ability to\nexploit inherent parallelism and locality in combinator reduction, leading to\nsignificantly faster computations with lower energy consumption, scalability\nacross multiple processors, and enhanced security against various types of\nattacks. Matrima can be simulated as a software virtual machine and is intended\nfor future hardware implementation.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computer Science/Hardware Architecture","Computer Science/Performance","Computer Science/Programming Languages"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qvHMU_rj9YHntnLNwlIhYTQ552lA65oe_d-bfEZeeRw","pdfSize":"299644"}
