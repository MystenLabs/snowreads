However, group human-robot interaction (HRI)\nposes unique computational challenges often overlooked in the current HRI\nliterature. We conducted a scoping review including 44 group HRI papers from\nthe last decade (2015-2024). From these papers, we extracted variables related\nto perception and behaviour generation challenges, as well as factors related\nto the environment, group, and robot capabilities that influence these\nchallenges. Our findings show that key computational challenges in perception\nincluded detection of groups, engagement, and conversation information, while\nchallenges in behaviour generation involved developing approaching and\nconversational behaviours. We also identified research gaps, such as improving\ndetection of subgroups and interpersonal relationships, and recommended future\nwork in group HRI to help researchers address these computational challenges\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0PHklpIzMEg02S-DeGlQZmJFC92pr3NXHw3IwvLaLmg","pdfSize":"5787758"}
