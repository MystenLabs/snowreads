  "abstract": "  Intrinsic self-correction was proposed to improve LLMs' responses via\nfeedback prompts solely based on their inherent capability. However, recent\nworks show that LLMs' intrinsic self-correction fails without oracle labels as\nfeedback prompts. In this paper, we aim to interpret LLMs' intrinsic\nself-correction for different tasks, especially for those failure cases. By\nincluding one simple task and three complex tasks with state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nLLMs like ChatGPT families (o1, 4o, 3.5-turbo) and Llama families (2-7B, 3-8B,\nand 3.1-8B), we design three interpretation methods to reveal the dark side of\nLLMs' intrinsic self-correction. We identify intrinsic self-correction can (1)\ncause LLMs to waver both intermedia and final answers and lead to prompt bias\non simple factual questions; (2) introduce human-like cognitive bias on complex\ntasks. In light of our findings, we also provide two simple yet effective\nstrategies for alleviation: question repeating and supervised fine-tuning with\na few samples. We open-source our work at https://x-isc.info/.\n",
