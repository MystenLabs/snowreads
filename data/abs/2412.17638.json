  "abstract": "  Finite games in normal form and their mixed extensions are a corner stone of\nnoncooperative game theory. Often generic finite games and their mixed\nextensions are considered. But the properties which one expects in generic\ngames and the existence of games with these properties are often treated only\nin passing. The paper considers strong properties and proves that generic games\nhave these properties. The space of mixed strategy combinations is embedded in\na natural way into a product of real projective spaces. All relevant\nhypersurfaces extend to this bigger space. The paper shows that for all games\nin the complement of a semialgebraic subset of codimension at least one all\nrelevant hypersurfaces in the bigger space are smooth and maximally\ntransversal. The proof uses the theorem of Sard and follows an argument of\nKhovanskii.\n",
