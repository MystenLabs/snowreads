We introduce a novel\ncombinatorial approach to demonstrate that the tail probabilities\n$\\mathbb{P}(\\mathfrak{h}(M,N) \\ge r)$ are log-concave in a certain weak sense.\nWe prove further that for each $\\alpha>0$ the lower tail of\n$-\\mathfrak{h}(\\lfloor \\alpha N \\rfloor, N)$ satisfies a Large Deviation\nPrinciple (LDP) with speed $N^2$ and a rate function $\\Phi_\\alpha^{(-)}$, which\nis given by the infimal deconvolution between a certain energy integral and a\nparabola.\n  Our analysis begins with a distributional identity from BO17\n[arXiv:1608.01564], which relates the lower tail of the height function, after\na random shift, with a multiplicative functional of the Schur measure. Tools\nfrom potential theory allow us to extract the LDP for the shifted height\nfunction. We then use our weak log-concavity result, along with a deconvolution\nscheme from our earlier paper [arXiv:2307.01179], to convert the LDP for the\nshifted height function to the LDP for the stochastic six-vertex model height\nfunction.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PNjrkWFfIVzZ99L0BNdEOL-btrV_iZTEwQ0J9O_TvrQ","pdfSize":"989843"}
