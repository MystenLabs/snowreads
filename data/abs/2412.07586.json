  "abstract": "  Wasserstein distances greatly influenced and coined various types of\ngenerative neural network models. Wasserstein autoencoders are particularly\nnotable for their mathematical simplicity and straight-forward implementation.\nHowever, their adaptation to the conditional case displays theoretical\ndifficulties. As a remedy, we propose the use of two paired autoencoders. Under\nthe assumption of an optimal autoencoder pair, we leverage the pairwise\nindependence condition of our prescribed Gaussian latent distribution to\novercome this theoretical hurdle. We conduct several experiments to showcase\nthe practical applicability of the resulting paired Wasserstein autoencoders.\nHere, we consider imaging tasks and enable conditional sampling for denoising,\ninpainting, and unsupervised image translation. Moreover, we connect our image\ntranslation model to the Monge map behind Wasserstein-2 distances.\n",
