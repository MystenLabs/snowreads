Based on this concept,\nwe build a theory diagonal reduction of matrices over Bezout domain. In\nparticular we show that invariant Bezout domain is an elementary divisor ring\nif and only if it is a rings of simple range 2.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xRYgd89XyfKFC1t38qHK3fqWJb5WFeGPQcg7CP7Ckm8","pdfSize":"123812"}
