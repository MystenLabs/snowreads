However, most existing databases focus on distortions\ncommonly found in digital media and not in natural conditions. Affine\ntransformations are particularly relevant to study, as they are among the most\ncommonly encountered by human observers in everyday life. This Data Descriptor\npresents a set of human responses to suprathreshold affine image transforms\n(rotation, translation, scaling) and Gaussian noise as convenient reference to\ncompare with previously existing image quality databases. The responses were\nmeasured using well established psychophysics: the Maximum Likelihood\nDifference Scaling method. The set contains responses to 864 distorted images.\nThe experiments involved 105 observers and more than 20000 comparisons of\nquadruples of images. The quality of the dataset is ensured because (a) it\nreproduces the classical Pi\\'eron's law, (b) it reproduces classical absolute\ndetection thresholds, and (c) it is consistent with conventional image quality\ndatabases but improves them according to Group-MAD experiments.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0gtxpXNR22MK9akoibk8XrDMFiFRavER0XylzNzpvG0","pdfSize":"5606245"}
