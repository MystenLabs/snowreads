For simplicity, we focus on the Casimir\neffect between parallel planes for 3d conformal field theories and briefly\ncomment on the generalizations to other boundary shapes and higher dimensions.\nRemarkably, the ghost-free holographic models impose a universal lower bound of\nthe Casimir effect. We verify the holographic bound by free theories, Ising\nmodel, and $O(N)$ model with $N=2,3$ at critical points. Remarkably, the\nholographic bound is also obeyed by a general class of quantum field theories\nwithout conformal symmetries. It is interesting to find a field-theoretical\nproof or counterexample for the holographic bound of Casimir effect.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"770KNnKeTNvrHn4Jg_aG83puDAXn2JAq5B5gxmUnCI8","pdfSize":"638988"}
