The analyzing power $A_z$ is proposed as a measure of this\neffect. Theoretical descriptions to obtain $A_z$ based on an intuitive picture\nas well as a distorted wave impulse approximation are presented, showing that\nthe helicity of incident protons is coupled to the chirality of the orbital\nmotion of a single-particle wave function, resulting in the chirality of the\nfinal states and a large $A_z$ value.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JkfqX404YIdVJ8bEgWuesUClWX5hcMBHVFmRn7BGUpA","pdfSize":"571734"}
