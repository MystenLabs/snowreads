  "abstract": "  In this article, an active contours without edges (ACWE)-based algorithm has\nbeen proposed for the detection of solar filaments in H-alpha full-disk solar\nimages. The overall algorithm consists of three main steps of image processing.\nThese are image pre-processing, image segmentation, and image post-processing.\nHere in the work, contours are initialized on the solar image and allowed to\ndeform based on the energy function. As soon as the contour reaches the\nboundary of the desired object, the energy function gets reduced, and the\ncontour stops evolving. The proposed algorithm has been applied to few\nbenchmark datasets and has been compared with the classical technique of object\ndetection. The results analysis indicates that the proposed algorithm\noutperforms the results obtained using the existing classical algorithm of\nobject detection.\n",
