Specifically, as generative models'\npower further increases, will they eventually replace all human creatives'\njobs? We argue that the answer is \"no,\" even if existing generative AI models'\ncapabilities reach their theoretical limit. Our theory has a close analogy to a\nfamiliar insight in financial economics on the impossibility of an\ninformationally efficient market [Grossman and Stiglitz (1980)]: If generative\nAI models can provide all the content humans need at low variable costs, then\nthere is no incentive for humans to spend costly resources on content creation\nas they cannot profit from it. But if no human creates new content, then\ngenerative AI can only learn from stale information and be unable to generate\nup-to-date content that reflects new happenings in the physical world. This\ncreates a paradox.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0XN_D4yPULOBTEDCkqekymr0UjWHnpaJ9uCZSaHE4FE","pdfSize":"216049","objectId":"0xd03191921b28d8ce38e85626a24b934e420d0aa279bb42b55973de8d94ec3e7a","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
