In resource-limited fields where high-quality data is\nscarce, augmentation plays a crucial role in increasing the volume of training\ndata. This paper introduces a Bangla Text Data Augmentation (BDA) Framework\nthat uses both pre-trained models and rule-based methods to create new variants\nof the text. A filtering process is included to ensure that the new text keeps\nthe same meaning as the original while also adding variety in the words used.\nWe conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the framework's effectiveness in\nBangla text classification tasks. Our framework achieved significant\nimprovement in F1 scores across five distinct datasets, delivering performance\nequivalent to models trained on 100% of the data while utilizing only 50% of\nthe training dataset. Additionally, we explore the impact of data scarcity by\nprogressively reducing the training data and augmenting it through BDA,\nresulting in notable F1 score enhancements. The study offers a thorough\nexamination of BDA's performance, identifying key factors for optimal results\nand addressing its limitations through detailed analysis.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"GvkaEJ32vhU3idVAR1I_SPtWAUTXedFTJiunJXpwJIU","pdfSize":"437469"}
