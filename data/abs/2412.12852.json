  "abstract": "  Code explanation plays a crucial role in the software engineering domain,\naiding developers in grasping code functionality efficiently. Recent work shows\nthat the performance of LLMs for code explanation improves in a few-shot\nsetting, especially when the few-shot examples are selected intelligently.\nState-of-the-art approaches for such Selective Shot Learning (SSL) include\ntoken-based and embedding-based methods. However, these SSL approaches have\nbeen evaluated on proprietary LLMs, without much exploration on open-source\nCode-LLMs. Additionally, these methods lack consideration for programming\nlanguage syntax. To bridge these gaps, we present a comparative study and\npropose a novel SSL method (SSL_ner) that utilizes entity information for\nfew-shot example selection. We present several insights and show the\neffectiveness of SSL_ner approach over state-of-the-art methods across two\ndatasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic\nbenchmarking of open-source Code-LLMs while assessing the performances of the\nvarious few-shot examples selection approaches for the code explanation task.\n",
