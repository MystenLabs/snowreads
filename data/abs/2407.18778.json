However, executing quantum algorithms of\npractical computational advantage requires further improvements in the\nfidelities of qubit operations, which are currently limited by the energy\nrelaxation and dephasing times of the qubits. Here, we report our measurement\nresults of a high-coherence transmon qubit with energy relaxation and echo\ndephasing times surpassing those in the existing literature. We measure a qubit\nfrequency of 2.890 GHz, an energy relaxation time with a median of 502 us and a\nmaximum of (765 +/- 82.6) us, and an echo dephasing time with a median of 541\nus and a maximum of (1057 +/- 138) us. We report in detail our design,\nfabrication process, and measurement setup to facilitate the reproduction and\nwide adoption of high-coherence transmon qubits in the academia and industry.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"21iwQ9GG_-Ff0E3AoY4dpwV5M1C8oOx7lZkwqDTwLrs","pdfSize":"5175358"}
