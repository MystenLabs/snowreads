In\nservice of this goal, the isotropic modification of jets and high-energy\nhadrons has been studied in great detail at the leading-power (eikonal) level,\nwith effects originating from sub-eikonal $\\mathcal{O}(\\mu/E)$ anisotropic\ninteractions presumed to be small. We present the first investigation of\nsub-eikonal, collective-flow-induced asymmetric jet broadening (jet drift) in\nevent-by-event $\\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV PbPb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider\nusing the new Anisotropic Parton Evolution (APE) computational framework. We\nshow that jet drift imparts a sizeable enhancement of elliptic flow ($v_2$) and\nincreases the mean acoplanarity for low and intermediate energy particles ($p_T\n< 10$ GeV). Importantly, these novel modifications to hard probe observables\nare shown to survive averaging over events and collision geometry. They couple\nto the collective flow of the medium seen by the jet and encode information\nabout the QGP dynamics inaccessible to studies considering only isotropic,\neikonal level effects.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"1etswVXZc9wayHY-G_Mt8cJ6sIJczQq9D041uQ7xwlU","pdfSize":"2169768"}
