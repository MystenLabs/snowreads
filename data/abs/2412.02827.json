  "abstract": "  Quantum magnonics aims to exploit the quantum mechanical properties of\nmagnons for nanoscale quantum information technologies. Ferrimagnetic yttrium\niron garnet (YIG), which offers the longest magnon lifetimes, is a key material\ntypically grown on gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates for structural\ncompatibility. However, the increased magnetic damping in YIG/GGG systems below\n50$\\,$K poses a challenge for quantum applications. Here, we study the damping\nin a 97$\\,$nm-thick YIG film on a 500$\\,\\mu$m-thick GGG substrate at\ntemperatures down to 30$\\,$mK using ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy.\nWe show that the dominant physical mechanism for the observed tenfold increase\nin FMR linewidth at millikelvin temperatures is the non-uniform bias magnetic\nfield generated by the partially magnetized paramagnetic GGG substrate.\nNumerical simulations and analytical theory show that the GGG-driven linewidth\nenhancement can reach up to 6.7 times. In addition, at low temperatures and\nfrequencies above 18$\\,$GHz, the FMR linewidth deviates from the viscous\nGilbert-damping model. These results allow the partial elimination of the\ndamping mechanisms attributed to GGG, which is necessary for the advancement of\nsolid-state quantum technologies.\n",
