They are characterized by\na red color in the rest-frame optical band, compact morphology, and broad\nBalmer emission lines (${\\rm FWHM} \\gtrsim 1000~{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$) that suggest\nan AGN nature. Using a method of pixel-by-pixel color selection and relaxing\nthe compactness criteria, we identify three of the first dual LRD candidates in\nthe COSMOS-Web survey with projected separations of\n$0.\\!\\!^{\\prime\\prime}2-0.\\!\\!^{\\prime\\prime}4$ (1-2 pkpc at their photometric\nredshifts). A comparison between existing LRD samples and mock data reveals\nthat the projected separations of these dual LRD candidates are unlikely to\nresult from chance projections of objects at different redshifts. In one case\n(CW-B5-15958), the dual LRD includes two bright sources ($m_{\\rm F444W}=24.3$\nand $24.8$) with characteristic V-shape spectral energy distribution (SEDs) and\nphotometric redshifts consistent with each other. We find that CW-B5-15958 has\na faint off-centered component and a companion galaxy. In the other two dual\nsystems, the brighter LRD exhibits a V-shape SED, while the fainter LRD\n($m_{\\rm F444W}\\gtrsim26$) is undetected in both F115W and F150W. These\ndiscoveries suggest that the angular auto-correlation function (ACF) of LRDs\nexhibits a significant excess ($\\sim3\\times10^2$ times) on sub-arcsec\n(kilo-parsec) separations compared to the extrapolation of a power-law ACF of\nJWST-found AGNs measured over $10^{\\prime\\prime}-100^{\\prime\\prime}$. Follow-up\nspectroscopic confirmation of their redshifts and the construction of a larger\nsample are essential to advance our understanding of the evolution of\nsupermassive black holes and the importance of mergers in the early universe.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aWHKhsZX5vHTs2BP22EQdNy-p7PlvUqGbQWH5jkJeFI","pdfSize":"2401864"}
