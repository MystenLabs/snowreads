Motivated by Andrews's\nwork, scholars have established a number of congruences and identities\ninvolving $NT(r,m,n)$. In this paper, we strengthen and extend a recent work of\nMao on the transformation properties of the $NT$ function and provide an\nanalogy of Hickerson and Mortenson's work on the rank function. As an\napplication, we demonstrate how one can deduce from our results many identities\ninvolving $NT(r,m,n)$ and another crank-analog statistic $M_\\omega(r,m,n)$. As\na related result, some new properties of generalized Appell-Lerch series are\ngiven.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RLUvnQ4GXRjbE79n52ZGYYcQ9x6XbdvHcg16i8Hfmsk","pdfSize":"701901"}
