  "abstract": "  We analyzed mathematically a model describing flux jumps in superconductivity\nin a 1D configuration. Three effects occur from fastest to slowest: Joule\nheating, magnetic relaxation and temperature diffusion. Adimensionalising the\nequations showed that magnetic field fronts penetrate the material as\ninhomogeneous Burgers fronts. An additional nonlinear term affects the magnetic\nfield and is responsible for flux jumps. We considered a medium temperature for\nwhich the heat capacity of a sample can be assumed constant and a low\ntemperature where heat capacity depends on temperature causing a nonlinear\ntemperature evolution. We found that flux jumps occur for pulses of duration\nclose to the magnetic relaxation time and mostly at low temperature. Flux\ntrapping is maximal for medium amplitude long duration pulses and low to medium\ntemperatures.\n",
