  "abstract": "  We show that an anomalous pinch can occur in ultrarelativistic\nelectron-electron or positron-positron beam interaction, caused by the combined\ninterplay of collective beam motion (disruption) and strong-field quantum\nelectrodynamics (SF-QED). The locally created electron-positron pairs, from\nSF-QED effects, screen the self-fields of the beams and can invert the polarity\nof the Lorentz force resulting in a pinch of the beams. A theoretical model\npredicts the pinch condition and is confirmed by first-principles 3-dimensional\nparticle-in-cell simulations. This anomalous pinch enhances density\ncompression, increases the collision luminosity, and amplifies the local\nmagnetic fields and the quantum parameter of the beam particles by several\norders of magnitude.\n",
