The locally created electron-positron pairs, from\nSF-QED effects, screen the self-fields of the beams and can invert the polarity\nof the Lorentz force resulting in a pinch of the beams. A theoretical model\npredicts the pinch condition and is confirmed by first-principles 3-dimensional\nparticle-in-cell simulations. This anomalous pinch enhances density\ncompression, increases the collision luminosity, and amplifies the local\nmagnetic fields and the quantum parameter of the beam particles by several\norders of magnitude.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Accelerator Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3lFRqBgd6dAVe0ebNSSKW9WLc63p3B6gWICkNvsuumU","pdfSize":"419297"}
