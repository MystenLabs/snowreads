We give a\npurely combinatorial derivation of this result in the case of order one\ncatalytic equations (those involving only one univariate unknown series). In\nparticular our approach provides a tool to produce context-free specifications\nor bijections with simple multi-type families of trees for the derivation trees\nof combinatorial structures that are directly governed by an order one\ncatalytic decomposition.\n  This provides a simple unified framework to deal with various combinatorial\ninterpretation problems that were solved or raised over the last 50 years since\nthe first such catalytic equation was written by W.T. Tutte in the late 60's to\nenumerate rooted planar maps.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hnJgkUSYQ82V5HsuW1f-erGcB8myKvJhFIJ8v19rvsA","pdfSize":"855549"}
