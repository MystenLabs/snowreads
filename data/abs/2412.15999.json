The limiting random measures, characterized via a nonlinear\nconvolutional equation, form a family parameterized by a pair consisting of a\nlocally finite measure and a geometrically infinitely divisible probability\ndistribution on the positive real line. These measures can be interpreted as\ngeneralizations of the Feller diffusion and fractional Feller (CIR) processes,\nbut also allow for the \"driving noise\" associated to general L\\' evy-type\noperators of order at most $1$, including fractional derivatives of any order\n$\\alpha>0$ (formally corresponding to possibly negative Hurst parameters).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"N2Ore7q1-UZfEh6CxKNafk1MzcJKzJU0T7pBy63nkbo","pdfSize":"414482"}
