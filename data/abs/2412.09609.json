The resulting renormalization group (RG) procedure, tailored\nto capture the associated quantum critical phenomena, is controlled by a\n`small' parameter $\\epsilon=2-d_M$ and $1/N_f$, where $N_f$ is the number of\nidentical fermion copies (flavor number). When applied to three-dimensional\ninteracting general Weyl semimetals ($d_L=1$ and $d_M=2$), characterized by the\nAbelian monopole charge $n>1$, living at the shore of the axionic insulation\n($N_b=2$), a leading order RG analysis suggests Gaussian nature of the\nunderlying quantum phase transition, around which the critical exponents assume\nmean-field values. A traditional field theoretic RG analysis yields same\noutcomes for simple Weyl semimetals ($n=1$, $d_L=3$, and $d_M=0$).\nConsequently, emergent marginal Fermi liquids showcase only logarithmic\ncorrections to physical observables at intermediate scales of measurements.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OYpsaBkHQzZEyVV_vD5AN9YttR58IRNZGkMVEE0PQB4","pdfSize":"433491"}
