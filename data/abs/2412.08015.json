  "abstract": "  We consider the minimal model of the seesaw mechanism by introducing two\nright-handed neutrinos, whose masses are comparable to the electroweak scale.\nThis framework is attractive, since it is testable at terrestrial experiments.\nA critical consequence of this mechanism is the violation of lepton number\nconservation due to the Majorana masses of both active neutrinos and heavy\nneutral leptons. In particular, we investigate the impact of the radiative\ncorrections to Majorana masses of left-handed neutrinos on the lepton number\nviolating processes, such as the neutrinoless double beta decay: $(Z, A) \\to\n(Z+2,A) + 2 e^-$ and the inverse neutrinoless double beta decay: $e^- e^- \\to\nW^- W^-$. It is shown that the cross section of the inverse neutrinoless double\nbeta decay can increase by ${\\cal O}(10)$~% when the masses of heavy neutral\nleptons are ${\\cal O}(1)$~TeV, which has significant implications on future\nexperiments.\n",
