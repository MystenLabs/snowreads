If such approach\ncan build partitions of completely arbitrary shapes, for some applications, it\nis desirable to keep a certain level of regularity in the geometry of the\nobtained partitions. In this paper, we propose to build such partition using\nVoronoi diagrams. This solution allows us to keep a high level of adaptability\nwhile guaranteeing a minimum level of geometric regularity in the detected\npartition.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"sG3Lw7AVG3GtBAzj9FsrYHnQijL7Wrb8jGRE0olK1JU","pdfSize":"881750","objectId":"0xd811ea45f9cbd89345ee565cf7a97ef316c7d522c82b1a0dd2515560c31b5b9f","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
