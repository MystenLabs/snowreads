This leads to Morse-type inequalities between the Betti numbers\nof the real link of the hypersurface and the relative polar multiplicities of\nthe function.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_brqSEc3HJ_PD7w5mv2ZHBQNThHm9c4gejpYnlxGpVE","pdfSize":"126406"}
