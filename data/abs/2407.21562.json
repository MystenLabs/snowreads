We\nshow that $L[R]$, and similar inner models in the $\\alpha$-inaccessible\nhierarchy, can be generated by iterating a small \"machete\" mouse up through all\nthe ordinals, and then taking a generic extension by a hyperclass Magidor\niteration of Prikry forcings. We then show that such simple mice are themselves\nelements of $L[\\mathsf{Reg}]$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ntlxf_4EJJ4gm_LHFTyTycmkLzkPpqt5XVEIxVGz5YE","pdfSize":"315399"}
