While visual feedback from cameras can provide valuable\ninformation to the human operator, haptic feedback is essential for accessing\nspecific object properties that are difficult to be perceived by vision, such\nas stiffness. For the first time, we present a participant study demonstrating\nthat operators can perceive the stiffness of remote objects during real-world\ntelemanipulation with a dexterous robotic hand, when haptic feedback is\ngenerated from tactile sensing fingertips. Participants were tasked with\nsqueezing soft objects by teleoperating a robotic hand, using two methods of\nhaptic feedback: one based solely on the measured contact force, while the\nsecond also includes the squeezing displacement between the leader and follower\ndevices. Our results demonstrate that operators are indeed capable of\ndiscriminating objects of different stiffness, relying on haptic feedback alone\nand without any visual feedback. Additionally, our findings suggest that the\ndisplacement feedback component may enhance discrimination with objects of\nsimilar stiffness.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FzUtx1Zlz0p4FUIyGJadoWd71_j2I0XfGLLumPn6xCY","pdfSize":"1212529"}
