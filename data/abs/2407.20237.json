IoT contains various application domains and\nhealthcare is one of them indeed. It is receiving a lot of attention recently\nbecause of its seamless integration with electronic health (eHealth) and\ntelemedicine. IoT has the capability of collecting patient data incessantly\nwhich surely helps in preventive care. Doctors can diagnose their patients\nearly to avoid complications and they can suggest further modifications if\nneeded. As the whole process is automated, risk of errors is reduced.\nAdministrative paperwork and data entry tasks will be automated due to tracking\nand connectivity. As a result, healthcare providers can engage themselves more\nin patient care. In traditional healthcare services, an individual used to have\naccess to minimal insights into his own health. Hence, they were less conscious\nabout themselves and depended wholly on the healthcare facilities for\nunfortunate events. But they can track their vitals, activities and fitness\nwith the aid of connected devices now. Furthermore, they can suggest their\npreferred user interfaces. This paper describes several methods, practices and\nprototypes regarding IoT in the field of healthcare for women and children.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Cbm3frHKs_0HtaeFagFk3KZCzlvX5XwSHYyT0zsalyY","pdfSize":"528268"}
