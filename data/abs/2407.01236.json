This\nseemingly trivial combinatorial principle constitutes the basis of Ramsey's\ntheory, and plays a very important role in computability and proof theory. In\nthis article, we study the infinite pigeonhole principle at various levels of\nthe arithmetical hierarchy from both a computability-theoretic and reverse\nmathematical viewpoint. We prove that this hierarchy is strict\nover~$\\mathsf{RCA}_0$ using an elaborate iterated jump control construction,\nand study its first-order consequences. This is part of a large\nmeta-mathematical program studying the computational content of combinatorial\ntheorems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XjFUXrnSiuFaK_TGxkqxGWIDk4Jd4LB9YHAv5y17xko","pdfSize":"659625"}
