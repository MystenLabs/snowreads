However, the reuse of dependencies introduces\nsignificant supply chain security risks, as a single compromised package can\nhave cascading impacts. Existing supply chain attack taxonomies overlook\nlanguage-specific features that can be exploited by attackers to hide malicious\ncode. In this paper, we propose a novel taxonomy of 12 distinct attack vectors\ntailored for the Go language and its package lifecycle. Our taxonomy identifies\npatterns in which language-specific Go features, intended for benign purposes,\ncan be misused to propagate malicious code stealthily through supply chains.\nAdditionally, we introduce GoSurf, a static analysis tool that analyzes the\nattack surface of Go packages according to our proposed taxonomy. We evaluate\nGoSurf on a corpus of widely used, real-world Go packages. Our work provides\npreliminary insights for securing the open-source software supply chain within\nthe Go ecosystem, allowing developers and security analysts to prioritize code\naudit efforts and uncover hidden malicious behaviors.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"y20pIXkOtclzUgRQzza325NXimJIRbTSG982pWKKVQY","pdfSize":"730342"}
