  "abstract": "  Deep learning has advanced medical image classification, but interpretability\nchallenges hinder its clinical adoption. This study enhances interpretability\nin Chest X-ray (CXR) classification by using concept bottleneck models (CBMs)\nand a multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for report\ngeneration. By modeling relationships between visual features and clinical\nconcepts, we create interpretable concept vectors that guide a multi-agent RAG\nsystem to generate radiology reports, enhancing clinical relevance,\nexplainability, and transparency. Evaluation of the generated reports using an\nLLM-as-a-judge confirmed the interpretability and clinical utility of our\nmodel's outputs. On the COVID-QU dataset, our model achieved 81% classification\naccuracy and demonstrated robust report generation performance, with five key\nmetrics ranging between 84% and 90%. This interpretable multi-agent framework\nbridges the gap between high-performance AI and the explainability required for\nreliable AI-driven CXR analysis in clinical settings. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/tifat58/IRR-with-CBM-RAG.git.\n",
