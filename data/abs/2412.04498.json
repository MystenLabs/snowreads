  "abstract": "  The advancement of generative AI, particularly large language models (LLMs),\nhas a significant impact on politics and democracy, offering potential across\nvarious domains, including policymaking, political communication, analysis, and\ngovernance. This paper surveys the recent and potential applications of LLMs in\npolitics, examining both their promises and the associated challenges. This\npaper examines the ways in which LLMs are being employed in legislative\nprocesses, political communication, and political analysis. Moreover, we\ninvestigate the potential of LLMs in diplomatic and national security contexts,\neconomic and social modeling, and legal applications. While LLMs offer\nopportunities to enhance efficiency, inclusivity, and decision-making in\npolitical processes, they also present challenges related to bias,\ntransparency, and accountability. The paper underscores the necessity for\nresponsible development, ethical considerations, and governance frameworks to\nensure that the integration of LLMs into politics aligns with democratic values\nand promotes a more just and equitable society.\n",
