The free energy for simple fluids is extended\nto include a dependence on $(T, V, N, mgL)$, where $L$ represents the vertical\nsystem length in the direction of gravity. A central idea in this formulation\nis to uniquely fix the reference point of the gravitational potential, ensuring\na consistent thermodynamic framework. Using this framework, we derive the\nprobability density of thermodynamic quantities, which allows us to define a\nvariational function for determining equilibrium liquid-gas coexistence under\ngravity. The resulting free energy landscape, derived from the variational\nfunction, reveals the local stability of liquid-gas configurations.\nSpecifically, the liquid phase resides at the lower portion of the system due\nto gravity, while the inverted configuration (with liquid on top) is also\nlocally stable in this landscape. Furthermore, we characterize the transition\nbetween these liquid-gas configurations as a first-order phase transition using\nthe thermodynamic free energy of $(T,V,N,mgL)$. Finally, we validate the\npredictions of global thermodynamics through molecular dynamics simulations,\ndemonstrating the applicability and accuracy of the proposed framework.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ee-xlELT51baFJCAEZe4L78GdRE70Tl2t1v2el5hxfc","pdfSize":"3212732"}
