This study\nintroduces an approach that integrates dynamic knowledge graphs with LLMs to\noffer nuanced student assistance. By evaluating past and ongoing student\ninteractions, the system identifies and appends the most salient learning\ncontext to prompts directed at the LLM. Central to this method is the knowledge\ngraph's role in assessing a student's comprehension of topic prerequisites.\nDepending on the categorized understanding (good, average, or poor), the LLM\nadjusts its guidance, offering advanced assistance, foundational reviews, or\nin-depth prerequisite explanations, respectively. Preliminary findings suggest\nstudents could benefit from this tiered support, achieving enhanced\ncomprehension and improved task outcomes. However, several issues related to\npotential errors arising from LLMs were identified, which can potentially\nmislead students. This highlights the need for human intervention to mitigate\nthese risks. This research aims to advance AI-driven personalized learning\nwhile acknowledging the limitations and potential pitfalls, thus guiding future\nresearch in technology and data-driven education.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bGc1GgP1m98x84LpmGxw7nMr_8dPtcsXJCmOZAPFJqM","pdfSize":"3964618"}
