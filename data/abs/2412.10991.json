  "abstract": "  Social media platforms have become central to global communication, yet they\nalso facilitate the spread of hate speech. For underrepresented dialects like\nLevantine Arabic, detecting hate speech presents unique cultural, ethical, and\nlinguistic challenges. This paper explores the complex sociopolitical and\nlinguistic landscape of Levantine Arabic and critically examines the\nlimitations of current datasets used in hate speech detection. We highlight the\nscarcity of publicly available, diverse datasets and analyze the consequences\nof dialectal bias within existing resources. By emphasizing the need for\nculturally and contextually informed natural language processing (NLP) tools,\nwe advocate for a more nuanced and inclusive approach to hate speech detection\nin the Arab world.\n",
