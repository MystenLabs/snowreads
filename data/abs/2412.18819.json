  "abstract": "  As data retrieval demands become increasingly complex, traditional search\nmethods often fall short in addressing nuanced and conceptual queries. Vector\nsimilarity search has emerged as a promising technique for finding semantically\nsimilar information efficiently. However, its effectiveness diminishes when\nhandling intricate queries with contextual nuances. This paper explores a\nhybrid approach combining vector similarity search with Large Language Models\n(LLMs) to enhance search accuracy and relevance. The proposed two-step solution\nfirst employs vector similarity search to shortlist potential matches, followed\nby an LLM for context-aware ranking of the results. Experiments on structured\ndatasets demonstrate that while vector similarity search alone performs well\nfor straightforward queries, the LLM-assisted approach excels in processing\ncomplex queries involving constraints, negations, or conceptual requirements.\nBy leveraging the natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs, this\nmethod improves the accuracy of search results for complex tasks without\nsacrificing efficiency. We also discuss real-world applications and propose\ndirections for future research to refine and scale this technique for diverse\ndatasets and use cases.\n  Original article:\nhttps://engineering.grab.com/llm-assisted-vector-similarity-search\n",
