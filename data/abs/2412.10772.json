Differential Equations, 263 (2017), 88--148; 266 (2019),\n942--976]. In this paper, we prove that for any prescribed mass $m > 0$, there\nexist radially symmetric and positive initial data $(u_0,v_0)\\in\nC^0(\\overline{\\Omega})\\times C^2(\\overline{\\Omega})$ with $\\int_\\Omega u_0 = m$\nsuch that the corresponding solutions blow up in finite time.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"bQnrA5tvgOEWZg5sYWuFKWhuzadNo4gQdxJ8hFuaJrY","pdfSize":"290723"}
