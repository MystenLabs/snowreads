  "abstract": "  Data and metadata documentation requirements for explainable-AI-ready (XAIR)\nmodels and data in physics-based simulation technology are discussed by\nanalysing different perspectives from the literature on two core aspects:\nFirst, the scope of the simulation; this category is taken to include subject\nmatter, the objective with which the simulation is conducted, and the object of\nreference, i.e., the simulated physical system or process. Second, the\nartefacts that need to be documented in order to make data and models XAIR, and\nmodelling and simulation workflows explainable; two CEN workshop agreements,\nMODA and ModGra, are compared for this purpose. As a result, minimum\nrequirements for an ontologization of the scope of simulation artefacts are\nformulated, and the object-objective abstractness diagram is proposed as a tool\nfor visualizing the landscape of use cases for physics-based simulation.\n",
