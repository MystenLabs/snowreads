Despite\nMamba's stateful design and recent attention as a strong candidate to\noutperform Transformers, we have demonstrated that both Mamba and SSMs with\n$\\mathrm{poly}(n)$-precision and constant-depth layers reside within the\n$\\mathsf{DLOGTIME}$-uniform $\\mathsf{TC}^0$ complexity class. This result\nindicates Mamba has the same computational capabilities as Transformer\ntheoretically, and it cannot solve problems like arithmetic formula problems,\nboolean formula value problems, and permutation composition problems if\n$\\mathsf{TC}^0 \\neq \\mathsf{NC}^1$. Therefore, it challenges the assumption\nMamba is more computationally expressive than Transformers. Our contributions\ninclude rigorous proofs showing that Selective SSM and Mamba architectures can\nbe simulated by $\\mathsf{DLOGTIME}$-uniform $\\mathsf{TC}^0$ circuits, and they\ncannot solve problems outside $\\mathsf{TC}^0$.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computational Complexity","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0unOJWvMNWN1SqxxyPmLdCDyN1keW4td1EFZJkcA5Ik","pdfSize":"679145"}
