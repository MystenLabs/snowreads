In\nanalyzing multivariate data, it is imperative that the underlying modelling\nassumptions adequately reflect both the marginal behavior as well as the\nassociations between components. This work focuses specifically on developing a\nnew multivariate Poisson model appropriate for multi-dimensional count data.\nThe proposed formulation is based on convolutions of comonotonic shock vectors\nwith Poisson distributed components and allows for flexibility in capturing\ndifferent degrees of positive dependence. In this paper, the general model\nframework will be presented along with various distributional properties.\nSeveral estimation techniques will be explored and assessed both through\nsimulations and in a real data application involving extreme rainfall events.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"wtsf6UFepV8eqDPQJS8lgEDumeubfx1CRi_OIGhpop0","pdfSize":"1107169"}
