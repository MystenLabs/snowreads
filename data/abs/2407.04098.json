We consider time functions\ncorresponding to a foliation of asymptotically hyperboloidal hypersurfaces and\nrestrict to suitable Hilbert spaces of functions. These functions have finite\nSobolev regularity in bounded regions, but need to be Gevrey-regular at null\ninfinity. This framework is developed in the context of sub-extremal Kerr\nspacetimes, but also gives uniform-in-$\\Lambda$ resolvent estimates on Kerr--de\nSitter spacetimes with a small cosmological constant $\\Lambda$. As a corollary,\nwe also construct the meromorphic continuation (in a sector of the complex\nplane) of the cut-off resolvent in Kerr that is associated to the standard\nBoyer--Lindquist time function. The framework introduced in this paper bridges\ndifferent notions of quasinormal modes found in the literature. As further\napplications of our methods, we prove stability of quasinormal frequencies in a\nsector of the complex plane, with respect to suitably small perturbations and\nestablish convergence properties for Kerr--de Sitter quasinormal frequencies\nwhen the cosmological constant approaches zero.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3N7236ksKKd1-4OXuiZ4YlwxCY0mNj5UMIlG1u_axHc","pdfSize":"1333203"}
