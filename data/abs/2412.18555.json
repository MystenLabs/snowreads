  "abstract": "  The framework of this article is cell motility modeling. Approximating cells\nas rigid spheres we take into account for both non-penetration and adhesions\nforces. Adhesions are modeled as a memory-like microscopic elastic forces. This\nleads to a delayed and constrained vector valued system of equations. We prove\nthat the solution of these equations converges when {\\epsilon}, the linkages\nturnover parameter, tends to zero to the a constrained model with friction. We\ndiscretize the problem and penalize the constraints to get an uncon?strained\nminimization problem. The well-posedness of the constrained problem is obtained\nby letting the penalty parameter to tend to zero. Energy estimates `a la De\nGiorgi are derived accounting for delay. Thanks to these estimates and the\nconvexity of the constraints, we obtain compactness uniformly with respect to\nthe discretisation step and {\\epsilon}, this is the mathematically involved\npart of the article. Considering that the characteristic bonds lifetime goes to\nzero, we recover a friction model comparable to [Venel et al, ESAIM, 2011] but\nunder more realistic assumptions on the external load, this part being also one\nof the challenging aspects of the work\n",
