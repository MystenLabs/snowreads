  "abstract": "  Transitioning from Education 1.0 to Education 5.0, the integration of\ngenerative artificial intelligence (GenAI) revolutionizes the learning\nenvironment by fostering enhanced human-machine collaboration, enabling\npersonalized, adaptive and experiential learning, and preparing students with\nthe skills and adaptability needed for the future workforce. Our understanding\nof academic integrity and the scholarship of teaching, learning, and research\nhas been revolutionised by GenAI. Schools and universities around the world are\nexperimenting and exploring the integration of GenAI in their education systems\n(like, curriculum design, teaching process and assessments, administrative\ntasks, results generation and so on). The findings of the literature study\ndemonstrate how well GenAI has been incorporated into the global educational\nsystem. This study explains the roles of GenAI in the schooling and university\neducation systems with respect to the different stakeholders (students,\nteachers, researchers etc,). It highlights the current challenges of\nintegrating Generative AI into the education system and outlines future\ndirections for leveraging GenAI to enhance educational practices.\n",
