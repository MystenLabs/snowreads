An efficient approach known as \"circuit reusing,\"\nwhere each circuit is executed multiple times, reduces the cost compared to\nimplementing new circuits. This work investigates the optimal reusing parameter\nthat minimizes the variance of measurement outcomes for a given experimental\ncost. We establish a theoretical framework connecting the variance of\nexperimental estimators with the reusing parameter R. An optimal R is derived\nwhen the implemented circuits and their noise characteristics are known.\nAdditionally, we introduce a near-optimal reusing strategy that is applicable\neven without prior knowledge of circuits or noise, achieving variances close to\nthe theoretical minimum. To validate our framework, we apply it to randomized\nbenchmarking and analyze the optimal R for various typical noise channels. We\nfurther conduct experiments on a superconducting platform, revealing a\nnon-linear relationship between R and the cost, contradicting previous\nassumptions in the literature. Our theoretical framework successfully\nincorporates this non-linearity and accurately predicts the experimentally\nobserved optimal R. These findings underscore the broad applicability of our\napproach to experimental realizations of quantum learning protocols.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_cN8MNDvINtBB1XT7eBJhKZyDpeEiWWvNrtzIaGu_To","pdfSize":"1304042"}
