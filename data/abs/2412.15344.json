However, accurately modeling stress\ndistribution in these strut lattices poses significant computational challenges\ndue to its strong dependence on organizational patterns, boundary conditions,\nand collective effects. Leveraging two-dimensional strut lattices that enable\nvisualization of local elastic deformation, we investigate how graph theory\n(GT) provides a framework for stress prediction. We investigate how the\ngeometric features often neglected by GT play a crucial role in the behavior of\nanisotropic networks. We also address the challenge of topological continuity\nthat arises when applying discrete mathematics to physical structures. We show\nthat modified centrality parameters combining lattice topology with geometry\nmore accurately predict local stress, as validated through birefringence\nimaging and finite element modeling. Finally, we show how further improvements\nare made by incorporating strut lattice boundary conditions into the centrality\ndefinition, in a manner that simultaneously simplifies the computational cost.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ed6uunmwm_Lg1LbDt3Vdh1ORzSsgNZ_APtz9uHu7A4o","pdfSize":"1084761"}
