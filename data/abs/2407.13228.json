We fine-tune both established transformer models\n(BERT, RoBERTa, Longformer) and more recent large models (Mistral-7B), trained\na Support Vector Machine with feature engineering, and assessed GPT models\nthrough prompting. We observe that state-of-the-art models fail to enhance\nclassification outcomes compared to traditional machine learning methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Q3WeiTHuDn4rWU3aPCgAn97Sz546BeKEqdO0Nmb2bdw","pdfSize":"477911"}
