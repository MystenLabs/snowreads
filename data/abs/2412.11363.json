  "abstract": "  People with visual impairments struggle with urban mobility and independent\ntravel, opening up opportunities for technological advances to improve their\nquality of life. The Internet of Things (IoT) plays an essential role in\nbringing improvements and accessibility for visually impaired people. Although\nalternatives aimed to use IoT in urban mobility, those solutions are still in\nthe initial stages and do not supports urban mobility for people with visual\nimpairment. This paper proposed and evaluated a low-cost IoT architecture that\nuses Single-Border Computers (SBCs) to support urban mobility. A performance\nevaluation showcased that our low-cost architecture handles bus trace workload\nand is suitable for supporting impaired people to get information concerning\nbus location on Smart Cities scenarios.\n",
