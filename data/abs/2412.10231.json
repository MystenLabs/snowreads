While the vanilla Gaussian Splatting representation is\nmainly designed for view synthesis, more recent works investigated how to\nextend it with scene understanding and language features. However, existing\nmethods lack a detailed comprehension of scenes, limiting their ability to\nsegment and interpret complex structures. To this end, We introduce SuperGSeg,\na novel approach that fosters cohesive, context-aware scene representation by\ndisentangling segmentation and language field distillation. SuperGSeg first\nemploys neural Gaussians to learn instance and hierarchical segmentation\nfeatures from multi-view images with the aid of off-the-shelf 2D masks. These\nfeatures are then leveraged to create a sparse set of what we call\nSuper-Gaussians. Super-Gaussians facilitate the distillation of 2D language\nfeatures into 3D space. Through Super-Gaussians, our method enables\nhigh-dimensional language feature rendering without extreme increases in GPU\nmemory. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SuperGSeg outperforms prior\nworks on both open-vocabulary object localization and semantic segmentation\ntasks.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"pWYU7a2VqfWd4o4MH6sNctR4BKSSUzjfPHatUptZ-Is","pdfSize":"3177081"}
