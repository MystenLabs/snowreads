  "abstract": "  Multi-messenger observations of astrophysical transients provide powerful\nprobes of the underlying physics of the source as well as beyond the Standard\nModel effects. We explore transients that can occur in the vicinity of\nsupermassive black holes at the center of galaxies, including tidal disruption\nevents (TDEs), certain types of blazars, or even supernovae. In such\nenvironments, the dark matter (DM) density can be extremely high, resembling a\ndense spike or core. We study a novel effect of neutrino diffusion sustained\nvia frequent scatterings off DM particles in these regions. We show that for\ntransients occurring within DM spikes or cores, the DM-neutrino scattering can\ndelay the arrival of neutrinos with respect to photons, but this also comes\nwith a suppression of the neutrino flux and energy loss. We apply these effects\nto the specific example of TDEs, and demonstrate that currently unconstrained\nparameter space of DM-neutrino interactions can account for the sizable\n$O$(days) delay of the tentative high-energy neutrinos observed from some TDEs.\n",
