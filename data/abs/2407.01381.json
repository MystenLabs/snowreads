Despite recent developments\nin ab initio polaritonic methods for simulating polaritonic chemistry under\nelectronic strong coupling, their capabilities are limited, especially in cases\nwhere the molecule also features strong electronic correlation. To bridge this\ngap, we have developed a novel method for cavity QED calculations utilizing the\nDensity Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm in conjunction with the\nPauli-Fierz Hamiltonian. Our approach is applied to investigate the effect of\nthe cavity on the S0 -S1 transition of n-oligoacenes, with n ranging from 2 to\n5, encompassing 22 fully correlated {\\pi} orbitals in the largest pentacene\nmolecule. Our findings indicate that the influence of the cavity intensifies\nwith larger acenes. Additionally, we demonstrate that, unlike the full\ndeterminantal representation, DMRG efficiently optimizes and eliminates excess\nphotonic degrees of freedom, resulting in an asymptotically constant\ncomputational cost as the photonic basis increases.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hqvzpN2ogeYD3EjKPJ3yQJj4bXQXVRZnm60ikqnGa30","pdfSize":"507609","objectId":"0xdec45aa6acc49899fcc51e321c9728858086fdc711fa9fdab380317860e75ac8","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
