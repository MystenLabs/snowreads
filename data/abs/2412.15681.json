  "abstract": "  We study the distributed consensus of state vectors in a discrete-time\nmulti-agent network with matrix edge weights using stochastic matrix\nconvergence theory. We present a distributed asynchronous time update model\nwherein one randomly selected agent updates its state vector at a time by\ninteracting with its neighbors. We prove that all agents converge to same state\nvector almost surely when every edge weight matrix is positive definite. We\nstudy vector consensus in cooperative-competitive networks with edge weights\nbeing either positive or negative definite matrices and present a necessary and\nsufficient condition to achieve bipartite vector consensus in such networks. We\nstudy the network structures on which agents achieve zero consensus. We also\npresent a convergence result on nonhomogenous matrix products which is of\nindependent interest in matrix convergence theory. All the results hold true\nfor the synchronous time update model as well in which all agents update their\nstates simultaneously.\n",
