Nonetheless,\nthe potential of transformer-based diffusion models for effectively generating\nvideos with controllable motion remains an area of limited exploration. This\npaper introduces Tora, the first trajectory-oriented DiT framework that\nconcurrently integrates textual, visual, and trajectory conditions, thereby\nenabling scalable video generation with effective motion guidance.\nSpecifically, Tora consists of a Trajectory Extractor(TE), a Spatial-Temporal\nDiT, and a Motion-guidance Fuser(MGF). The TE encodes arbitrary trajectories\ninto hierarchical spacetime motion patches with a 3D video compression network.\nThe MGF integrates the motion patches into the DiT blocks to generate\nconsistent videos that accurately follow designated trajectories. Our design\naligns seamlessly with DiT's scalability, allowing precise control of video\ncontent's dynamics with diverse durations, aspect ratios, and resolutions.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate Tora's excellence in achieving high motion\nfidelity, while also meticulously simulating the intricate movement of the\nphysical world.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ikn0K5DNbfgrwaW_EWisiNuxbvywATYO6RjJQGmHpck","pdfSize":"28108384","objectId":"0xeddbce1b6ae7b665683fb6b935671c3b5a8304c06b0f9c065e99f3752ee93639","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
