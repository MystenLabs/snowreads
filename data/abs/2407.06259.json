In Bayesian terms,\nthis can be achieved by considering the evidence ratio, enabling choices\nbetween two competing models. We generalise this concept by constructing\nMarkovian random walks for exploring the entire model spaces governed by the\nlogarithmic evidence ratio, in analogy to the logarithmic likelihood ratio in\nparameter estimation problems. The theory of Markovian model exploration has an\nanalytical description with partition functions, which we derive for both the\ncanonical and macrocanonical case. We apply our methodology to selecting a\npolynomial for the dark energy equation of state function $w(a)$ fulfilling\nsensible physical priors, on the basis of data for the supernova\ndistance-redshift relation. We conclude by commenting on Jeffreys' scale for\nBayesian evidence ratios, choices of model priors and derived quantities like\nShannon entropies for posterior model probabilities.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SksfhMHyBMRwO6ElUO1k_I4bH831uQA-Qx_aK939djI","pdfSize":"894280"}
