  "abstract": "  In a recent article, Freitag, Moosa and the author showed that in\ndifferentially closed fields of characteristic zero, if two types are\nnonorthogonal, then their n+3 and m+3 Morley powers are not weakly orthogonal,\nwhere n and m are their respective Lascar ranks.\n  In this short note, we prove that the bound is tight: there are such types\nwith weakly orthogonal n+2 and m+2 Morley powers. The types in question were\nconstructed by Freitag and Moosa as examples of types with degree of\nnonminimality 2. As interesting as our result are our methods: we rely mostly\non Galois theory and some descent argument for types, combined with the failure\nof the inverse Galois problem over constant parameters.\n",
