The first step\ndiffers for the two tasks generating either a piecewise-affine or a Dubins\nreference path. The second step leverages a transformation of vehicle dynamics\nfrom the time domain into the spatial domain and linear programming. Benefits\nsuch as a hyperparameter-free objective function and spatial constraints useful\nfor area coverage gaps avoidance and precision path planning are discussed. The\nmethod, which is a deterministic optimisation-based method, is evaluated on a\nreal-world field solving 3 instances of the first task and 16 instances of the\nsecond task.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"-vTj1J9IPJUE1D2ZfTxlaGDQseMUn374yaou4vKfMrQ","pdfSize":"1809028"}
