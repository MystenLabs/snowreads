Our analysis reveals: When\npriors align, relative patience determines optimal disclosure -- impatient\nagents induce gradual revelation, while impatient principals cause delayed,\nabrupt revelation. When priors disagree, catering to the bias often emerges,\nwith the principal initially providing signals aligned with the agent's bias.\nWith private agent beliefs, we observe two phases: one engaging both agents,\nfollowed by catering to one type. Comparing personalized and non-personalized\nstrategies, we find faster information revelation in the non-personalized case,\nbut higher quality information in the personalized case.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Col8s47vc1qIWYAtzNcPlRiVpwvNMRW4MFWzpUJ6ny0","pdfSize":"1342074"}
