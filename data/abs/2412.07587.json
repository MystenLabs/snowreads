A novel sentiment score equation is proposed to\nrepresent the impact of intraday news on forecasting next-period stock return\nand volatility for selected U.S. semiconductor tickers, a very vibrant industry\nsector. This work improves the forecast accuracy by addressing news bias,\nmemory, and weight, and incorporating shifts in sentiment direction. More\nimportantly, it extends the use of the remarkable tool of change of Probability\nMeasure developed in the finance of Asset Pricing to NLP forecasting by\nconstructing a Hype-Adjusted Probability Measure, obtained from a\nredistribution of the weights in the probability space, meant to correct for\nexcessive or insufficient news.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5XF_PVCxUhEFn03oAR85AbV3AoH4acpzaOglYvfLfP0","pdfSize":"1308065"}
