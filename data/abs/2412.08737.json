This capability is crucial for applications in areas such as robotics,\nmedical image analysis, and manufacturing. In this paper, we first introduce\nGeoperception, a benchmark designed to evaluate an MLLM's ability to accurately\ntranscribe 2D geometric information from an image. Using this benchmark, we\ndemonstrate the limitations of leading MLLMs, and then conduct a comprehensive\nempirical study to explore strategies for improving their performance on\ngeometric tasks. Our findings highlight the benefits of certain model\narchitectures, training techniques, and data strategies, including the use of\nhigh-fidelity synthetic data and multi-stage training with a data curriculum.\nNotably, we find that a data curriculum enables models to learn challenging\ngeometry understanding tasks which they fail to learn from scratch. Leveraging\nthese insights, we develop Euclid, a family of models specifically optimized\nfor strong low-level geometric perception. Although purely trained on synthetic\nmultimodal data, Euclid shows strong generalization ability to novel geometry\nshapes. For instance, Euclid outperforms the best closed-source model,\nGemini-1.5-Pro, by up to 58.56% on certain Geoperception benchmark tasks and\n10.65% on average across all tasks.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"b2rgYgjQeZv1F7oxpwDJ2vKkwI_QPZ2-Tpr_BYmIuN0","pdfSize":"4454546"}
