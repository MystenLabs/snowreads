  "abstract": "  We investigate the topological properties of multiple exceptional points in\nnon-Hermitian two-level systems, emphasizing vorticity as a topological\ninvariant arising from complex energy structures. We categorize EP pairs as\nfundamental building blocks of larger EP assemblies, distinguishing two types:\ntype-I pairs with opposite vorticities and type-II pairs with identical\nvorticities. By analyzing the branch cut formation in a two-dimensional\nparameter space, we reveal the distinct topological features of each EP pair\ntype. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to configurations with multiple EPs,\ndemonstrating the cumulative vorticity and topological implications. To\nillustrate these theoretical structures, we model complex energy bands within a\ntwo-dimensional photonic crystal composed of lossy materials, identifying\nvarious EP pairs and their branch cuts. These findings contribute to the\nunderstanding of topological characteristics in non-Hermitian systems.\n",
