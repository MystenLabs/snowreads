  "abstract": "  Two recent searches for heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) performed with\nproton-proton collision data recorded at 13 TeV by the CMS experiment are\npresented. A prompt search in the trilepton final state analyses events with\nexactly three charged leptons originating from the primary proton-proton\ninteraction vertex, targeting HNL masses between 10 GeV and 1.5 TeV. A\ndisplaced search in the dilepton final state analyses events with exactly one\nprompt charged lepton and a second nonprompt charged lepton associated with a\njet and a secondary vertex, targeting HNL masses between 1 and 20 GeV. In both\nsearches, machine-learning methods are applied to separate the HNL signal from\nthe standard model background. Exclusion limits are set on the HNL coupling\nstrength as a function of the HNL mass, covering different mass ranges and HNL\nscenarios. In several cases, the results exceed previous limits.\n",
