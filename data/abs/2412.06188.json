  "abstract": "  In this paper, we propose a hypothesis regarding the travel and movement of\nchemicals between locations. We introduce six distinct methods to explain this\nprocess. The chemicals referred to in this article are those that we detect by\nthe nose and can travel through the air. These are generally known as odorants\nor volatile compounds. Method 1 involves decomposing chemicals and transmitting\ntheir formulas digitally. Method 2 embeds chemicals in water, freezes it into\nice, and transports it to the receiver, where the chemicals are extracted upon\nmelting. Method 3 transfers chemicals via water logistics, with the receiver\nextracting them from the water. Method 4 uses airtight pipelines to transport\nchemicals in water, which are then extracted by the receiver. Method 5 projects\nchemical odors into the air, where the receiver captures them using suction.\nMethod 6 draws from optical fiber technology to transmit chemical odors through\na cable, ensuring the chemical composition remains intact. Each method ensures\nthe receiver experiences the same scent as the sender.\n",
