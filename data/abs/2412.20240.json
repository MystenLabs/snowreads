From the pioneer Alexander polynomial, the\nrevolutionary Jones polynomial, to the collectively discovered HOMFLYPT\npolynomial, just to mention a few, these algebraic expressions have been\ncentral to the understanding of knots and links. The introduction of Khovanov\nhomology has sparked significant interest in the categorification of these\npolynomials, offering deeper insights into their topological and algebraic\nproperties. In this work, we revisit two prominent polynomial invariants, the\nAlexander-Conway and the Kauffman bracket polynomials, and focus specifically\non the polynomials associated with the family of three strand pretzel links\n$P(1,1,n)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Sc30GWsICpxjVhV15NvCRikP_XqwwjCPyT44IqoKO5A","pdfSize":"755266"}
