  "abstract": "  The experimental measurement of collective charge fluctuations in metals and\nsuperconductors is a preferential tool to benchmark fundamental interactions in\nsolids. Recent experiments in multicomponent systems, from superconducting\nlayered cuprates to multiband metals, highlighted striking effects due to the\ninterplay between different degrees of freedom. In this paper we provide a\nphysical explanation for the existence of a \"ghost\" Josephson plasmon in\nbilayer superconductors, layered systems with two layers per unit cells that\ninteract with two different Josephson couplings. We show that one of the two\nplasmons that emerge after the breaking of the translational symmetry along the\nout-of-plane direction is connected to counterflowing current fluctuations\npolarized perpendicularly to the planes. This effect makes it a staggered mode\nthat is virtually transverse at small out-of-plane momenta qc, explaining why\nit is hidden in the density response at small qc. Our work offers an additional\nperspective on the understanding of collective excitations in systems with\nmultiple intertwined degrees of freedom.\n",
