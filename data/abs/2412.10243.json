  "abstract": "  The traditional industrial communication networks may not meet the\nrequirements of the main smart factory applications together, such as Remote\ncontrol and safety applications (which considered as strict real time\napplications) and augmented reality (which consumes wide bandwidth). This work\nsuggests an enhanced communication network to serve an optimum case for the\nsmart factory includes heavy data applications and real-time applications in\none hand using the concepts of time sensitive networks (TSN) to address the\nlimitation of real-time applications and the edge computing to assimilate the\nheavy data applications. The current work submits an experimental scenario to\nexploit H.265 compression method based on edge computing concept to mitigate\nconsuming the capacity on overall network performance for augmented reality\napplication. The results of enhanced communication network indicated that the\nlatency of real time applications was less than 1msec while the packet data\ndelivery of rest applications was 99.999%.\n",
