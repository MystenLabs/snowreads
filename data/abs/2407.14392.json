It\nis known that the resulting field equations describe an integrable system in\ntwo dimensions which can also be obtained by a dimensional reduction of the\nself-dual Yang-Mills equations in four dimensions. We use this relation to\nconstruct a single copy prescription for classes of gravitational solutions in\nWeyl-Lewis-Papapetrou coordinates. In contrast with previous proposals, we find\nthat the gauge group of the Yang-Mills single copy carries non-trivial\ninformation about the gravitational solution. We illustrate our single copy\nprescription with various examples that include the extremal Reissner-Nordstrom\nsolution, the Kaluza-Klein rotating attractor solution, the Einstein-Rosen wave\nsolution and the self-dual Kleinian Taub-NUT solution.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FrFC-Lyh19jdm-kyw6iy0LhTh_eksVtIaATsyjyHi9I","pdfSize":"813624"}
