  "abstract": "  We construct a new fifth-order flux globalization based well-balanced (WB)\nalternative weighted essentially non-oscillatory (A-WENO) scheme for general\nnonconservative systems. The proposed scheme is a higher-order extension of the\nWB path-conservative central-upwind (PCCU) scheme recently proposed in [A.\nKurganov, Y. Liu and R. Xin, J. Comput. Phys., 474 (2023), Paper No. 111773].\nWe apply the new scheme to the nozzle flow system and the two-layer shallow\nwater equations. We conduct a series of numerical experiments, which clearly\ndemonstrate the advantages of using the fifth-order extension of the flux\nglobalization based WB PCCU scheme.\n",
