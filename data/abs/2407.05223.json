We\ndemonstrate that, with constant weights, there exists a unique invariant\nidempotent probability. Utilizing Secelean's approach to countable IFSs, we\nintroduce partially finite idempotent IFSs and prove that the sequence of\ninvariant idempotent measures for these systems converges to the invariant\nmeasure of the original countable IFS. We then apply these results to\napproximate such measures with discrete systems, producing, in the\none-dimensional case, data series whose Higuchi fractal dimension can be\ncalculated. Finally, we provide numerical approximations for two-dimensional\ncases and discuss the application of generalized Higuchi dimensions in these\nscenarios.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"KMrS0Sm1ha1Hhwg5YNBIYLU-1vjsLQAkbzheEv9yDGU","pdfSize":"1094657"}
