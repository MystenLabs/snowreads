  "abstract": "  In this work, we present a semi-discrete scheme to approximate solutions to\nthe scalar LWR traffic model with spatially discontinuous flux, described by\nthe equation $u_t + (k(x)u(1-u))_x = 0$. This approach is based on the\nLagrangian-Eulerian method proposed by E. Abreu, J. Francois, W. Lambert, and\nJ. Perez [J. Comp. Appl. Math. 406 (2022) 114011] for scalar conservation laws.\nWe derive a non-uniform bound on the growth rate of the total variation for\napproximate solutions. Since the total variation can explode only at $x=0$, we\ncan provide a convergence proof for our scheme in $BV_{loc}(\\mathbb{R}\\setminus\n\\lbrace 0 \\rbrace)$ by using Helly's compactness theorem.\n",
