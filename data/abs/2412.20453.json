  "abstract": "  MUDEHaR is an on-going multi-epoch photometric survey with two narrow filters\nin H$\\alpha$ and the calcium triplet window that uses the T80Cam wide-field\nimager at the JAST/T80 telescope at Spanish Javalambre astronomical\nobservatory. It is obtaining 100 epochs/year per field for 20 fields in the\nGalactic disk, each of 2\\,deg$^2$, for a total of 40\\,deg$^2$. Focused on\nstellar clusters and HII regions including bright stars, its main objective is\nto detect tens of thousands OB stars that present emission variability in\nH$\\alpha$ on days-months-years scale. The observed targets include magnetic\nmassive stars, pulsating stars, and all kinds of variable stars. Among our\ndriving scientific objectives of MUDEHaR observations is to identify potential\nmagnetic candidates in massive stars. Only 10--20\\,\\% of OB stars display a\nmeasurable magnetic field, and its origin is still in debate. We outline here\nthe multi-step process involved in identifying OB magnetic stars, highlighting\nthe significance of MUDEHaR observations in this process.\n",
