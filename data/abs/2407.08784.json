Previous\nstudies have established that the CPT model exhibits odd-frequency triplet\nsuperconductivity and order fractionalization. Through asymptotic analyses in\nthe small $J$ and large $J$ Kondo coupling limits, we identify a quantum\ncritical point at $J_c$, marking a transition from a superconductor to a Kondo\ninsulator. By estimating the vison gap energy to account for thermal gauge\nfluctuations, we determine the energy scales governing the thermal breakdown of\norder fractionalization. Moreover, at large $J$ the Kondo insulator undergoes\norbital decoupling, leading to the formation of a decoupled Kitaev orbital\nliquid. These findings and analogies with the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauged $XY$ model\nlead us to propose a tentative phase diagram for the CPT model at half-filling.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HyGm2UjfKnSYU1GP1TV2rIWB_g6KjFHVEL-UKqVZ3UM","pdfSize":"3377154"}
