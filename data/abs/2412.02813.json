Using site-specific substitutional doping, we first determine the\nposition of the atomic sites within STM images, establishing that the maximum\nelectronic density of states at the $K$-point lies between the atoms. In\ncontrast, the maximum density of states at the $\\Gamma$ point is at the atomic\nsites. This signifies that WSe$_2$ is a topologically obstructed atomic\ninsulator, which cannot be adiabatically transformed to the trivial atomic\ninsulator limit.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XJd7tIvhcAgKZ0JcL4rwEPVMcf2MPd47c7x6sEP3gek","pdfSize":"8544034"}
