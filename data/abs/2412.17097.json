  "abstract": "  Extensions of one-parameter operator semigroups on Archimedean vector\nlattices to their order/ru-completions are studied. Existence and uniqueness of\nthe extension to the ru-completion is established in the class of positive\nsemigroups. An extension theorem for positive ru-continuos semigroups on vector\nlattices with property (R) is proved. This theorem allows one to abandon the\nrequirement of ru-completeness in various results concerning positive\nru-continuous semigroups.\n",
