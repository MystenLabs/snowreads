  "abstract": "  Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to objectively identify latent\ncharacteristics in large datasets due to their reliance on pre-trained\nknowledge rather than actual data patterns. To address this data grounding\nissue, we propose Data Scientist AI (DSAI), a framework that enables unbiased\nand interpretable feature extraction through a multi-stage pipeline with\nquantifiable prominence metrics for evaluating extracted features. On synthetic\ndatasets with known ground-truth features, DSAI demonstrates high recall in\nidentifying expert-defined features while faithfully reflecting the underlying\ndata. Applications on real-world datasets illustrate the framework's practical\nutility in uncovering meaningful patterns with minimal expert oversight,\nsupporting use cases such as interpretable classification.\n  The title of our paper is chosen from multiple candidates based on\nDSAI-generated criteria.\n",
