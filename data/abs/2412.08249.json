Using the Ernst\nformalism and Weyl coordinates, we analyze the non-linear tidal deformation of\nrotating black holes and demonstrate that their static tidal Love numbers\nvanish at all orders of the external tidal field. We also show that this result\nis intimately related to the presence of underlying non-linear symmetries. Our\nanalysis generalizes previous findings for Schwarzschild black holes and\nconfirms the robustness of four-dimensional black holes against tidal forces.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"rv8nnuFY9abp4cL23hG5O1d-K2LCTxFqvUHw4vUA6Fo","pdfSize":"253628"}
