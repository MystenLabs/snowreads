We focus on the\nhyperhoneycomb magnet $\\beta$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$, a promising candidate for being in\nproximity to a three-dimensional Kitaev quantum spin liquid. The Raman response\nin $\\beta$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$ notably displays a distinctive asymmetric Fano\nlineshape in the 24 meV Raman-active optical phonon. This asymmetry arises from\nthe interaction between the discrete phonon mode and the spin excitation\ncontinuum, which could be fractionalized if the material is indeed near a\nquantum spin-liquid phase. Our theoretical model considers the coupling of this\noptical phonon to Majorana fermions in the Kitaev model on the hyperhoneycomb\nlattice. Our findings reveal that the temperature-dependent Fano lineshape is\nconsistent with the fractionalization of spins into Majorana fermions and\n$\\mathbb{Z}{_2}$ fluxes.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zrvWe5iYWbajctJTVTFt-KN5OVwqSzs9aYhBP7KP9LQ","pdfSize":"2226235"}
