We assess\nconstraints from these datasets using next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO)\ntheoretical predictions, accounting for a range of uncertainties from scale\ndependence and numerical integration. From the scale choices available for the\ncalculations, our analysis shows that the central predictions for inclusive jet\nproduction show a smaller scale dependence than dijet production. We examine\nthe relative constraints on the gluon distribution provided by the inclusive\njet and dijet distributions and also explore the phenomenological implications\nfor inclusive $H$, $t\\bar{t}$, and $t\\bar{t}H$ production at the LHC at 14 TeV.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"N058hh94X9yehHCG3ugDdPWKO3NtOGM5Bm88HhqJsuM","pdfSize":"3194622"}
