Many planets have been discovered in such multiple systems (such as\nstellar binaries), and understanding their stability is important in exoplanet\nsearches and characterization. In this chapter, we focus on the orbital\nstability of planets in stellar binaries. We review key results based on\nsemi-analytical secular (long term) methods, as well as results based on N-body\nsimulations and more recent Machine Learning methods. We discuss planets\norbiting one of the stellar binary components (S-type) and those orbiting both\nstars (P-type) separately.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ATgYC2PX5qdcYmbbiSXxuA-TzeyH11KxeqH6b71AFfw","pdfSize":"4026116","objectId":"0xbabcf881d155a528e04b38b71aef90980bbf83a9e03ac9cdbd6de3c1d9e65582","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
