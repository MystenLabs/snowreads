In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the\nrovibrational spectrum of the (anti-)hydrogen molecular ion in a low-energy\neffective theory incorporating Lorentz and CPT violation. The focus is on the\nspin-independent couplings in this theory, for which the best current bounds\ncome from measurements of the 1S-2S transition in atomic hydrogen and\nantihydrogen. We show that in addition to the improvement in these bounds from\nthe increased precision of the transition frequencies, potentially reaching 1\npart in $10^{17}$, rovibrational transitions have an enhanced sensitivity to\nLorentz and CPT violation of $O(m_p/m_e)$ in the proton (hadron) sector\ncompared to atomic transitions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NVREFwjClHMPp_j6KcTAoiO3kJoplz3kq6ypu2oxA0g","pdfSize":"883656"}
