  "abstract": "  Understanding user intentions is challenging for online platforms. Recent\nwork on intention knowledge graphs addresses this but often lacks focus on\nconnecting intentions, which is crucial for modeling user behavior and\npredicting future actions. This paper introduces a framework to automatically\ngenerate an intention knowledge graph, capturing connections between user\nintentions. Using the Amazon m2 dataset, we construct an intention graph with\n351 million edges, demonstrating high plausibility and acceptance. Our model\neffectively predicts new session intentions and enhances product\nrecommendations, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods and showcasing\nthe approach's practical utility.\n",
