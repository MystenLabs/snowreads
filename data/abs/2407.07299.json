More precisely, we prove\nthat, for any $\\epsilon>0$ and positive integers $n$ and $k$, with high\nprobability, random Reed--Solomon codes of length $n$ and dimension $k$ can\ncorrect $(1-\\varepsilon)n-2k+1$ adversarial insdel errors over alphabets of\nsize $n+2^{\\mathsf{poly}(1/\\varepsilon)}k$. This significantly improves upon\nthe alphabet size demonstrated in the work of Con, Shpilka, and Tamo (IEEE TIT,\n2023), who showed the existence of Reed--Solomon codes with exponential\nalphabet size $\\widetilde O\\left(\\binom{n}{2k-1}^2\\right)$ precisely achieving\nthe half-Singleton bound.\n  Our methods are inspired by recent works on list-decoding Reed-Solomon codes.\nBrakensiek-Gopi-Makam (STOC 2023) showed that random Reed-Solomon codes are\nlist-decodable up to capacity with exponential-sized alphabets, and Guo-Zhang\n(FOCS 2023) and Alrabiah-Guruswami-Li (STOC 2024) improved the alphabet-size to\nlinear. We achieve a similar alphabet-size reduction by similarly establishing\nstrong bounds on the probability that certain random rectangular matrices are\nfull rank. To accomplish this in our insdel context, our proof combines the\nrandom matrix techniques from list-decoding with structural properties of\nLongest Common Subsequences.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BSH4KAHmD-x9BR4YQvWfHAviT7PAjqufkCAnAagjZ6Q","pdfSize":"475228"}
