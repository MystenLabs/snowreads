This study\nproposes a two-stage framework that decouples classification and grounding to\naddress the inherent challenges posed by traditional Multi-Task Learning\nmodels, which jointly optimizes classification and segmentation. Our approach\nseparates these tasks to achieve targeted optimization for each. The model\nfirst classifies images as bleeding or non-bleeding, thereby isolating\nsubsequent grounding from inter-task interference and label heterogeneity. To\nfurther enhance performance, we incorporate Stochastic Weight Averaging and\nTest-Time Augmentation, which improve model robustness against domain shifts\nand annotation inconsistencies. Our method is validated on the Auto-WCEBleedGen\nChallenge V2 Challenge dataset and achieving second place. Experimental results\ndemonstrate significant improvements in classification accuracy and\nsegmentation precision, especially on sequential datasets with consistent\nvisual patterns. This study highlights the practical benefits of a two-stage\nstrategy for medical image analysis and sets a new standard for GI bleeding\ndetection and segmentation.
