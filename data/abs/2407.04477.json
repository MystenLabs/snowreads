However, the inherent birefringence in\nsilicon waveguides requires efficient polarization management. Here, we report\na reconfigurable polarization rotator (PR) using a Sb2Se3/Si waveguide\noperating at datacom wavelengths (1310 nm), providing nonvolatile switching\nwith zero static power consumption. The polarization conversion relies on the\ninterference of hybrid electric-magnetic (EH) modes, which can be reconfigured\nby changing the Sb2Se3 state between amorphous and crystalline. Our\nexperimental device exhibits a polarization conversion efficiency (PCE) and a\npolarization extinction ratio (PER) as high as -0.08 dB and 17.65 dB,\nrespectively, in a compact footprint of just 21$\\mu$m length. Therefore, the\nproposed reconfigurable PR offers a compact and energy-efficient solution for\npolarization management in silicon photonics, with potential applications in\ndata communication networks and emerging applications benefiting from\npolarization information encodings, such as optical neural networks and quantum\ncomputing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DDxPDF-0ZTuoELOb8_l3xweThxjIvVuIBWaYd0jbfqw","pdfSize":"4784296"}
