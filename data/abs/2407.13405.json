We present the first lattice simulation\nof this system using a novel hybrid numerical scheme. This approach solves the\nfully nonlinear dynamics of the axion-gauge sector while treating the\ngravitational interaction between the axion and inflaton linearly. Initially,\nwe test the validity of the WKB approximation in the linear regime. We then\ninvestigate strong backreaction dynamics within the axion-gauge sector. Our\nfindings reveal that backreaction significantly suppresses the growth of the\ngauge field and the amplitude of scalar perturbations. The simulation also\nallows us to analyze the non-Gaussianity of scalar fluctuations, including\nhigher-order statistics. We show that, although non-Gaussianity is suppressed\nby strong backreaction, it remains higher than in the minimal model where the\naxion coincides with the inflaton. Our results highlight the need for\nsimulations to make robust predictions to test against data from gravitational\nwave interferometers and large-scale structure surveys.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-Tlr6Bmt22a3YQqkirrUXKhhSTkEz5yt08RLyLWGu14","pdfSize":"6578358"}
