  "abstract": "  In the category \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) of unital archimedean vector lattices, four\nnotions of uniform completeness obtain. In all cases completeness requires the\nconvergence of uniformly Cauchy sequences; the completions are distinguished by\nthe manner in which the convergence is regulated. Ordinary uniform convergence\nis regulated by the canonical unit \\(1\\). Inner relative uniform convergence,\nhere termed iru-convergence, is regulated by an arbitrary positive element.\nOuter relative uniform convergence, here termed oru-convergence, is regulated\nby an arbitrary positive element of a vector lattice containing the given\nobject as a sub-vector lattice. *-convergence is equivalent to ordinary uniform\nconvergence on certain specified quotients of the vector lattice. In each case\nthe complete objects form a full monoreflective subcategory of \\(\\mathbf{V}\\),\ndenoted respectively \\(\\mathbf{ucV}\\), \\(\\mathbf{irucV}\\), \\(\\mathbf{orucV}\\),\nand \\(\\mathbf{*cV}\\). In this article we provide a unified development of these\ncompletions by means of a novel pointfree variant of the classical Yosida\nadjunction.\n",
