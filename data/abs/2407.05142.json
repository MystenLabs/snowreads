In this note we\nderive the subleading $O(T)$ correction to this implied volatility, using an\nasymptotic expansion for the Hartman-Watson distribution. The result is used to\ncompute subleading corrections to Asian options prices in a small maturity\nexpansion, sharpening the leading order result obtained using large deviations\ntheory. We demonstrate good numerical agreement with precise benchmarks for\nAsian options pricing in the Black-Scholes model.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"blyQDK3r1tlLKKXoK068xh44amHpXzqdTHeVULhAMgM","pdfSize":"285683"}
