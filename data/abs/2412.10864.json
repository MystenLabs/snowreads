We achieve the manifest\ncancellation of divergences in the $\\hbar \\to 0$ limit at the integrand level\nbeyond one loop by employing the Schwinger parametrisation to rewrite both cut\nand uncut propagators in a wordline-like representation before they are\ncombined. The resulting finite classical integrand takes the same form as the\ncounterpart in the worldline quantum field theory (WQFT) formalism of Mogull et\nal., and in fact exactly coincides with the latter in various examples, showing\nexplicitly the equivalence between scattering amplitude and worldline\nformalisms. The classical causality flow, as expressed by the retarded\npropagator prescription, appears as an emergent feature. Examples are presented\nfor impulse observables in electrodynamics and a scalar model at two loops, as\nwell as certain subclasses of diagrams to higher orders and all orders.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"l4jNG_FU4318wTkVvSYV95Jjpnv5Pbya1BWblF7_GX8","pdfSize":"1234060"}
