Although Airy beams are now routinely realized with\nelectromagnetic waves and electrons, the implementation with neutrons has\nremained elusive due to small transverse coherence lengths, low fluence rates,\nand the absence of neutron lenses. In this work, we overcome these challenges\nthrough a holographic approach and present the first experimental demonstration\nof neutron Airy beams. The presented techniques pave the way for fundamental\nphysics studies with Airy beams of non-elementary particles, the development of\nnovel neutron optics components, and the realization of neutron Airy-vortex\nbeams.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RkbGInNmi4ALrLCrcTVygpnbFwbgj-Goblvc4FmN7GA","pdfSize":"6192912"}
