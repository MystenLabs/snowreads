Second, we identify the\n$d$-dimensional permuton limit for $d$-separable permutations, a\npattern-avoiding class of $d$-dimensional permutations generalizing ordinary\nseparable permutations.\n  Both high-dimensional permuton limits are random and connected to previously\nstudied universal 2-dimensional permutons, such as the Brownian separable\npermutons and the skew Brownian permutons, and share interesting connections\nwith objects arising from random geometry, including the continuum random tree,\nSchramm--Loewner evolutions, and Liouville quantum gravity surfaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MvuQ0rWvrnxzm3Zjgt6ssJFi7pro4h9ZpC4e73wYC7o","pdfSize":"2698400"}
