We establish data label guidelines and find that 11.7% of the\ndataset is improperly annotated and should either have an unknown label or a\ncorrected label, and 16.7% of samples in the dataset have multiple valid\nlabels. We then analyze the mistakes of a top-performing model and find that\n35% of the model's mistakes can be directly attributed to these label issues,\nhighlighting the inherent problems with using a noisily labeled dataset as a\nbenchmark.
