The dipole gives rise to an oscillatory signal in the\nmultipole moments of the observed power spectrum which we indicate as the\nfinger-of-the-observer (FOTO) effect. Using a suite of large mock catalogues\nmimicking ongoing and future $\\textrm{H}\\alpha$- and\n$\\textrm{H}\\scriptstyle\\mathrm{I}$-selected surveys, we demonstrate that the\noscillatory features can be measured with a signal-to-noise ratio of up to 7\n(depending on the sky area coverage and provided that observational systematics\nare kept under control on large scales). We also show that the FOTO effect\ncannot be erased by correcting the individual galaxy redshifts. On the\ncontrary, by leveraging the power of the redshift corrections, we propose a\nnovel method to determine both the magnitude and the direction of our peculiar\nvelocity. After applying this technique to our mock catalogues, we conclude\nthat it can be used to either test the kinematic interpretation of the\ntemperature dipole in the cosmic microwave background or to extract\ncosmological information such as the matter density parameter and the equation\nof state of dark energy.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"N7iR2O3tgZ50gcMlndEsZLDuI_d2tXwv8OP5U7Jc0dE","pdfSize":"1968073"}
