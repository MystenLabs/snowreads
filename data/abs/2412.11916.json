  "abstract": "  The problem of decentralized multi-robot patrol has previously been\napproached primarily with hand-designed strategies for minimization of\n'idlenes' over the vertices of a graph-structured environment. Here we present\ntwo lightweight neural network-based strategies to tackle this problem, and\nshow that they significantly outperform existing strategies in both idleness\nminimization and against an intelligent intruder model, as well as presenting\nan examination of robustness to communication failure. Our results also\nindicate important considerations for future strategy design.\n",
