Using this technique, we achieve\nimproved convergence properties without the need for contour deformation, which\nis known to significantly increase the complexity of the integrand by\nintroducing, for example, derivatives of the $\\mathscr{F}$ polynomial and\ncomplicated Jacobians. We highlight that while we have only tested the approach\non selected one-, two- and three-loop massless and one-loop massive examples,\nit shows promise for practical applications, offering potential benefits over\nthe traditional approach. Evaluation times are compared with existing contour\ndeformation implementations to illustrate the performance of this alternative\nmethod.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Q4YkB7emC5Twxj78CKt4xV57dM5EmaRx6_7ZD6CiPIU","pdfSize":"1512010"}
