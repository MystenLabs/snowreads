By employing\ndimensional regularization and bosonization techniques, we uncover several\nunprecedented boundary universality classes. These include the boundary\nGross-Neveu-Yukawa critical point and the special\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, both resulting from the\ninterplay between edge modes and bulk bosons. We present a comprehensive sketch\nof the phase diagram that accommodates these boundary criticalities and\ndelineate their critical exponents. Additionally, we explore a 1+1D conformal\ndefect decorated with fermions, where a defect BKT transition is highlighted.\nWe conclude with a discussion on potential experimental realizations of these\nphenomena.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"G03_MyHtq7rxdAKTxB9wfN5tIJDHfQfLPpxpjhYqYgk","pdfSize":"952166","objectId":"0xe7446708d6186d5fd18c53557555ce0c7e8312b85969e5c75587129d1fd308ff","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
