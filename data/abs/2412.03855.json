Based\non the photometric, spectral, and astrometric data of TESS, LAMOST, and Gaia\nsurveys, we have found 286 new slowly pulsating B-type stars (SPB stars) and 21\ncandidates. Among these, 20 are Be stars or candidates with emission line\nprofiles. It is shown that these SPB stars have luminosities between 40 and\n2850 $L_{\\odot}$ and effective temperatures ranging from 10000K to 21000K.\nTheir pulsation periods are from 0.14 to 6.5 days with amplitude ranges of\n0.2-20 mmag in TESS band. It is indicated that these targets follow the\ndistribution of the SPB stars in the period-luminosity (P-L) and the\nperiod-temperature (P-T) diagrams. Their positions on the H-R diagram reveal\nthat most of these pulsators are distributed in the instability region of SPB\nstars, in the main-sequence evolutionary stage, and with mass ranges of 2.5-7\n$M_{\\odot}$. However, there are some targets beyond the red edge of the\ntheoretical instability region, which should be caused by the rapid rotation\nreducing the measured effective temperature. The discovery of these new SPB\nstars increases the total number by over 60\\%, which are significant samples\nfor further investigating the structure and evolution of intermediate-mass and\neven massive stars by asteroseismology.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7M4-avKzcIx5Yj7oU4jDxOgVWt86DvTeEw33Etjm2Gw","pdfSize":"1792258"}
