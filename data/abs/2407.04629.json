Recent works have demonstrated that large language\nmodels (LLMs) can achieve strong performance in this task. While previous works\nfocus on proprietary LLMs, we investigate how open NER LLMs, trained\nspecifically for entity recognition, perform in clinical NER. In this paper, we\naim to improve them through a novel framework, entity decomposition with\nfiltering, or EDF. Our key idea is to decompose the entity recognition task\ninto several retrievals of sub-entity types. We also introduce a filtering\nmechanism to remove incorrect entities. Our experimental results demonstrate\nthe efficacy of our framework across all metrics, models, datasets, and entity\ntypes. Our analysis reveals that entity decomposition can recognize previously\nmissed entities with substantial improvement. We further provide a\ncomprehensive evaluation of our framework and an in-depth error analysis to\npave future works.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-5b-bWHkd-PqLTqZQpN2j5mzNCM-UHgLfmmS0YTMbDs","pdfSize":"2025541"}
