An efficient and lower-cost alternative\nis to develop machine learning models to globally monitor earth observation\ndata to pinpoint regions impacted by these natural disasters. However, due to\nthe small amount of historically recorded earthquakes, this becomes a low-data\nregime problem requiring algorithmic improvements to achieve peak performance\nwhen learning to regress earthquake magnitude. In this paper, we propose to\npose the estimation of earthquake magnitudes as a metric-learning problem,\ntraining models to not only estimate earthquake magnitude from Sentinel-1\nsatellite imagery but to additionally rank pairwise samples. Our experiments\nshow at max a 30%+ improvement in MAE over prior regression-only based methods,\nparticularly transformer-based architectures.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8sMEh4Ja3RNQmWbgqLLc_zJXAC3JdDDhstnD9X3pGSE","pdfSize":"5367172","objectId":"0x98ef9bd80c713b9ac8b4f522cee2f5118f8d49f032d25841adfdbb2e54684bd1","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
