Our approach integrates concepts of randomness, multipartite\nentanglement and quantum chaos. Furthermore, the QFI proves to be highly\ndependent on the dimension of the Krylov space confining the chaotic dynamics:\nit ranges from $N^2/3$ for $N$ qubits in the permutation-symmetric subspace\n(e.g. for chaotic kicked top models with long-range interactions), to $N$ when\nthe dynamics extend over the full Hilbert space with or without bit reversal\nsymmetry or parity symmetry (e.g. in chaotic models with short-range Ising-like\ninteractions). In the former case, the QFI reveals multipartite entanglement\namong $N/3$ qubits. Interestingly this result can be related to isotropic\nsubstructures in the Wigner distribution of chaotic states and demonstrates the\nefficacy of quantum chaos for Heisenberg-scaling quantum metrology. Finally,\nour general expression for the QFI agrees with that obtained for random states\nand, differently from out-of-time-order-correlators, it can also distinguish\nchaotic from integrable unstable spin dynamics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eiPBiIN-uP04UcOXazWmCjcX-MV_cEH--QrRlFu6Wpc","pdfSize":"3034239"}
