To zeroth order, the metamaterial\nbehaves as a micropolar continuum with both displacement and rotation degrees\nof freedom, but exhibits linear-elastic fracture mechanics scaling and\ntherefore no size effect. To higher order, the overall energetics of the\nmetastructure can be characterized explicitly in terms of the solution of the\nzeroth-order continuum problem by the method of {\\Gamma}-expansion. We present\nexplicit expressions of the second-order correction for octet frames. As an\napplication, we evaluate the compliance of double-cantilever octet specimens to\nsecond order and use the result to elucidate the dependence of the apparent\ntoughness of the specimen on cell size. The analysis predicts the discreteness\nof the metamaterial lattice to effectively shield the crack-tip, a mechanism\nthat we term lattice shielding. The theory specifically predicts\nanti-shielding, i. e., coarser is weaker, in agreement with recent experimental\nobservations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"h3GVk8XsIuedae18d2KRrrbkJJw04hrHrPDFu4UJex4","pdfSize":"1351008"}
