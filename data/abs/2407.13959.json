We discuss a\nconjecture which states that this equivalence relation has only one equivalence\nclass, and show that the conjecture is equivalent with the so called twin-star\nhypothesis. We check the conjecture in the case $d=4$ and disuses how this\nrelates to the determinant-like map $det^{S^2}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SjD8WL280DYsDP6r2w_T2HX-2uXafELaiCR3QloZkW8","pdfSize":"356017"}
