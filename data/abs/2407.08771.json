Along the way, we\nanswer in the negative a question of Falgas-Ravry, Pikhurko, Vaughan and Volec\n[J. London Math. Soc., 2023] about whether\n$\\pi_{\\therefore}(F)\\leq\\pi_{\\mathrm{co}}(F)$ always holds. In particular, we\nconstruct counterexamples $F$ with positive but arbitrarily small\n$\\pi_{\\mathrm{co}}(F)$ while having $\\pi_{\\therefore}(F)\\ge 4/27$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"4cbft8cInhpmIgSdCyVbB9NvFQxapGUzthjrjy5I4WY","pdfSize":"525281"}
