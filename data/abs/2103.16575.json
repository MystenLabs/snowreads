Some argue that their\nsize and host environment (the biscuit aisle) should make them a biscuit in\ntheir own right. Others consider that their physical properties (e.g. they\nharden rather than soften on becoming stale) suggest that they are in fact\ncake. In order to finally put this debate to rest, we re-purpose technologies\nused to classify transient events. We train two classifiers (a Random Forest\nand a Support Vector Machine) on 100 recipes of traditional cakes and biscuits.\nOur classifiers have 95 percent and 91 percent accuracy respectively. Finally\nwe feed two Jaffa Cake recipes to the algorithms and find that Jaffa Cakes are,\nwithout a doubt, cakes. Finally, we suggest a new theory as to why some believe\nJaffa Cakes are biscuits.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"v6_2SR24Ui5udlq8SDj1aIowwx9hplK1RJVPhsjSN34","pdfSize":"13513409"}
