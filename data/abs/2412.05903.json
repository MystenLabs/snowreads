  "abstract": "  Let $F$ be a non-degenerate integral ternary quadratic form and let\n$m_0\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{\\neq 0}$. We study growth of rational points on the affine\nquadric $(F=m_0)$ and show that they are equidistributed in the adelic space\noff a finite place. This is closely related to Linnik's problem. Our approach\nis based on the $\\delta$-variant of the Hardy--Littlewood circle method\ndeveloped by Heath-Brown.\n",
