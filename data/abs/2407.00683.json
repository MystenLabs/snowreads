In this Letter, we propose a formalism for quantum state\ntransfer using coupling strengths comparable to the channel's free spectral\nrange ($g\\sim\\Delta_{\\text{fsr}}$). Our scheme merges features of both the\nSTIRAP-based methods for single-model cavities and the pitch-and-catch protocol\nfor long waveguides, integrating their advantage of low loss and high speed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HPdlN0icndkApJwwPrLI8hCwI8sVMTmix534ilWqEIg","pdfSize":"2428711","objectId":"0xc54caca33b249f7248045a83b2404cad870678fb7a9253118e6c89f586c7516e","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
