We study the complete\naging scenario, which incorporates aging to both mechanisms of interaction:\nherding and idiosyncratic behavior, and compare it with the partial aging case,\nwhere aging affects only the herding mechanism. Analytical mean-field equations\nare derived, finding excellent agreement with agent-based simulations on a\ncomplete graph. We observe that complete aging enhances consensus formation,\nshifting the critical point to higher values compared to the partial aging\ncase. However, when the aging probability decays asymptotically to zero for\nlarge $\\tau$, a steady state is not always attained for complete aging.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"d2NANTnLBBhR_iFDACDXM2kdPzUm8BQy91uz38-aDws","pdfSize":"860843"}
