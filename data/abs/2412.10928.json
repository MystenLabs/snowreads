Such\ncontrolled 3D assembly is desired for the design of adaptive materials that\nexploit structure-function relationships, but has remained challenging. We\npresent a non-equilibrium assembly of colloidal particles mediated by\nlaser-induced local heating and continuous heat dissipation. These 3D\nout-of-equilibrium structures, assembled in a matter of a few minutes, were\nhighly ordered and exhibited tunable photonic stopbands. We quantify the\nparticle fluxes from the underlying assembly processes and report the growth\ndynamics of the assembled structures. Furthermore, we demonstrate the\nmodulation of the photonic stopband achieved by modulating the particle fluxes,\nhighlighting the prospects of such thermofluidic assembly for creating\nreconfigurable functional structures.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"I85BJS5VmdzQPQ7Yzf66IOCCFV6mUPu0JZs3Q1yGKIM","pdfSize":"5844398"}
