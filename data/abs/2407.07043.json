The order of these corrections imprints a universal curvature\ndependence on observations while the coupling constant controls the deviation\nstrength. In this Letter, we leverage the theory-independent expectation that\nmodifications to the action of a given order in spacetime curvature (Riemann\ntensor and contractions) lead to observational deviations that scale with the\nsystem length-scale to a corresponding power. Focusing on gravitational wave\nobservations, the relevant scale is the binary total mass, and deviations scale\nas a power of mass $p$ related to the action order. For example, $p=4,6$ arise\nin effective field theory for cubic and quartic theories respectively. We\nincorporate this universal scaling into theory-agnostic tests of General\nRelativity with current gravitational-wave observations, thus enabling\nconstraints on the curvature scaling without compromising the agnostic nature\nof these tests. This introduces a flexible yet highly interpretable new\nparadigm for tests of General Relativity with gravitational-wave catalogs.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"z75Swosa-1FeUsDlp9_LbojFQSc_xu39UiLu1lnptA8","pdfSize":"1204760"}
