It is also known that such\nevaluators are vulnerable to biases, such as favoring longer responses. While\nit is important to overcome this problem, the specifics of these biases remain\nunder-explored. In this work, we qualitatively identify six types of biases\ninherent in various judge models. We propose EvalBiasBench as a meta-evaluation\ncollection of hand-crafted test cases for each bias type. Additionally, we\npresent de-biasing dataset construction methods and the associated preference\ndataset OffsetBias. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning on our\ndataset significantly enhances the robustness of judge models against biases\nand improves performance across most evaluation scenarios. We release our\ndatasets and the fine-tuned judge model to public.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"S1XJRSouXyWniUlMKTOXFWOLf78SyjkgBp7z-NyNfn8","pdfSize":"6963588"}
