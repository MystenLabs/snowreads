We propose a novel method, FACTTRACK, for\ntracking atomic facts and addressing factual contradictions. Crucially,\nFACTTRACK also maintains time-aware validity intervals for each fact, allowing\nfor change over time. At a high level, FACTTRACK consists of a four-step\npipeline to update a world state data structure for each new event: (1)\ndecompose the event into directional atomic facts; (2) determine the validity\ninterval of each atomic fact using the world state; (3) detect contradictions\nwith existing facts in the world state; and finally (4) add new facts to the\nworld state and update existing atomic facts. When we apply FACTTRACK to\ncontradiction detection on structured story outlines, we find that FACTTRACK\nusing LLaMA2-7B-Chat substantially outperforms a fair baseline using\nLLaMA2-7B-Chat, and achieves performance comparable to a GPT4 baseline.\nMoreover, when using GPT4, FACTTRACK significantly outperforms the GPT4\nbaseline.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"nYQnnn22J_m_YX1VFq9iTYKSVYUGCampg2xsHKBLcrc","pdfSize":"1709547"}
