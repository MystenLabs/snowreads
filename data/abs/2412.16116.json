Specifically, we show that a coupling\nnetwork of linear inductors results in a static Hamiltonian composed of the\nstabilizers of a bit flip code. Thereby, without detuning from the Kramers'\npoint, reflectometry off a single coupled resonator accomplishes a projective\nmeasurement of multiple stabilizers. We further show how circuit-mediated spin\ncouplings enable error correction operations and a complete set of logical\nquantum gates. The concept is experimentally feasible.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3U-wxde-H9EFX_63B5M2RX0W0YN37y6qFtUtHMbZoh4","pdfSize":"1029833"}
