  "abstract": "  We investigate the emergence of topological features in the charge\nexcitations of Mott insulators in the Chern-Hubbard model. In the strong\ncorrelation regime, treating electrons as the sum of holons and doublons\nexcitations, we compute the topological phase diagram of Mott insulators at\nhalf-filling using composite operator formalism. The Green function zeros\nmanifest as the tightly bound pairs of such elementary excitations of the Mott\ninsulators. Our analysis examines the winding number associated with the\noccupied Hubbard bands and the band of Green's function zeros. We show that\nboth the poles and zeros show gapless states and zeros, respectively, in line\nwith bulk-boundary correspondence. The gapless edge states emerge in a junction\ngeometry connecting a topological Mott band insulator and a topological Mott\nzeros phase. These include an edge electronic state that carries a charge and a\ncharge-neutral gapless zero mode. Our study is relevant to several twisted\nmaterials with flat bands where interactions play a dominant role.\n",
