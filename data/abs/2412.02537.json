  "abstract": "  The tetragonal heavy fermion compound CeRh2As2 exhibits unconventional\nsuperconductivity accompanied by other broken symmetry phases that have been\nidentified as presumably small moment intrinsic antiferromagnetism at low\nmagnetic fields and induced quadrupolar order at higher in-plane fields. The\nlatter may extend to very large pulsed-field range. The phase boundaries can be\ninvestigated by following thermodynamic anomalies like specific heat,\nmagnetocaloric coefficient, thermal expansion and magnetostriction. We\ncalculate their discontinuities and identify the influence of the field induced\nquadrupole on them. Furthermore we investigate the elastic constant anomalies\nwhich are determined by the static homogeneous quadrupolar RPA response\nfunctions. We present a calculation of these anomalies for the appropriate\nsymmetry mode both in the disordered and ordered regime and investigate their\nchange with applied field. In addition we consider the dynamical momentum\ndependent magnetic susceptibility and the associated dispersion of low energy\nmagnetic modes and how their characteristics change across the phase boundary.\n",
