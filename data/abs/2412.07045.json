  "abstract": "  Human-centered design, a theoretical ideal, is sometimes compromised in\nindustry practice. Technology firms juggle competing priorities, such as\nadopting new technologies and generating shareholder returns, which may\nconflict with human-centered design values. This study sought to identify the\ntypes of workplace situations that present barriers for human-centered design,\ngoing beyond the views and behaviors of individual professionals. Q methodology\nwas used to analyze the experiences of 14 UX professionals based in the United\nStates. Five factors were identified, representing workplace situations in\nwhich human-centered design is inhibited, despite the involvement of UX\nprofessionals: Single-Minded Arrogance, Competing Visions, Moving Fast and\nBreaking Things, Pragmatically Getting By, and Sidestepping Responsibility.\nUnderpinning these five factors are the dimensions of speed and clarity of\nvision. This paper demonstrates connections between the literature on UX ethics\nand human-centered design practice, and its findings point toward opportunities\nfor education and intervention to better enable human-centered and ethical\ndesign in practice.\n",
