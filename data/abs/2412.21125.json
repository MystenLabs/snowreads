A good player's strategy\nresults in an effective statistical test that rejects the null hypothesis as\nsoon as sufficient evidence arises. Building on recent advances, we address the\nquestion of restricting the pool of e-variables to simplify strategy design\nwithout compromising effectiveness. We extend the results of Clerico(2024), by\ncharacterising optimal sets of e-variables for a broad class of non-parametric\nhypothesis tests, defined by finitely many regular constraints. As an\napplication, we discuss optimality in algorithmic mean estimation, including\nthe case of heavy-tailed random variables.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Jz3ssqck1w6dLGzx8YtZrE2VCh0JUQJfZGEzcYTjQU0","pdfSize":"410072"}
