Rather than viewing them as\ncompeting approaches, here we consider how these two methods can work in\ntandem. We introduce a novel algorithm that combines tensor networks and\nquantum computation to produce results that are more accurate than what could\nbe achieved by either method used in isolation. Our algorithm is based on\nmultiproduct formulas (MPF) - a technique that linearly combines Trotter\nproduct formulas to reduce algorithmic error. Our algorithm uses a quantum\ncomputer to calculate the expectation values and tensor networks to calculate\nthe coefficients used in the linear combination. We present a detailed error\nanalysis of the algorithm and demonstrate the full workflow on a\none-dimensional quantum simulation problem on $50$ qubits using two IBM quantum\ncomputers: $ibm\\_torino$ and $ibm\\_kyiv$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mL46ALeot7KfTGbFlffecNs4MvojNWAUUydUepW2gpA","pdfSize":"1473638","objectId":"0x1bd37a27f135f5ba54fe3089a9da0706c8e6a479cf803738bee2283d2078fc8a","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
