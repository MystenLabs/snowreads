  "abstract": "  This paper presents a physics-informed deep learning approach for predicting\nthe replicator equation, allowing accurate forecasting of population dynamics.\nThis methodological innovation allows us to derive governing differential or\ndifference equations for systems that lack explicit mathematical models. We\nused the SINDy model first introduced by Fasel, Kaiser, Kutz, Brunton, and\nBrunt 2016a to get the replicator equation, which will significantly advance\nour understanding of evolutionary biology, economic systems, and social\ndynamics. By refining predictive models across multiple disciplines, including\necology, social structures, and moral behaviours, our work offers new insights\ninto the complex interplay of variables shaping evolutionary outcomes in\ndynamic systems\n",
