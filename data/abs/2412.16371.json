  "abstract": "  Incorporation of manganese impurities into II-VI semiconductors results in a\ndramatic change in their properties due to strong exchange interactions between\nthe Mn ion and the semiconductor host. In colloidal quantum dots (QDs), these\ninteractions result in a rapid bidirectional energy transfer between the\nmagnetic impurity and the QD intrinsic states, which is characterized by an\nextremely high energy transfer rate of more than ~5 eV/ps. This rate is higher\nthan the rate of energy loss due to phonon emission (typically, ~1 eV/ps or\nless), so Mn-QD interactions could in principle be used to capture and utilize\nthe kinetic energy of the hot carrier before it is lost to phonons. Here, we\ndemonstrate that by using Mn-doped CdSe/HgSe core/shell QDs, we can efficiently\nconvert the kinetic energy of a hot exciton into an additional electron-hole\npair (exciton). This carrier multiplication process occurs through rapid\ncapture of a hot exciton by a Mn ion, which then undergoes spin flip\nrelaxation, producing two excitons near the QD band edge. Due to the inverted\ngeometry of the CdSe/HgSe QDs, both electrons and holes resulting from carrier\nmultiplication occupy the QD shell, allowing them to be easily extracted from\nthe QD for potential use in electro-optical devices or chemical reactions.\n",
