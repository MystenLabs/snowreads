We argue that the trivial contribution to the $S$-matrix should\nbe accounted for by another, complementary $L_\\infty$-algebra, such that a\nperturbative field theory is described by a cyclic relative $L_\\infty$-algebra.\nWe further demonstrate that this construction reproduces Witten diagrams that\narise in AdS/CFT including, in particular, the trivial Witten diagrams\ncorresponding to CFT two-point functions. We also discuss Chern-Simons theory\nand Yang-Mills theory on manifolds with boundaries using this approach.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4PqUdjhW9IlljvXywjYtszXqHhJog9A1gz5YLJvlsAs","pdfSize":"405393"}
