  "abstract": "  The increasing integration of artificial intelligence into various domains,\nincluding design and creative processes, raises significant ethical questions.\nWhile AI ethics is often examined from the perspective of technology\ndevelopers, less attention has been paid to the practical ethical\nconsiderations faced by technology users, particularly in design contexts. This\npaper introduces a framework for addressing ethical challenges in creative\nproduction processes, such as the Double Diamond design model. Drawing on six\nmajor ethical theories - virtue ethics, deontology, utilitarianism, contract\ntheory, care ethics, and existentialism - we develop a \"compass\" to navigate\nand reflect on the ethical dimensions of AI in design. The framework highlights\nthe importance of responsibility, anticipation, and reflection across both the\nAI lifecycle and each stage of the creative process. We argue that by adopting\na playful and exploratory approach to AI, while remaining anchored in core\nethical principles, designers can responsibly harness the potential of AI\ntechnologies without overburdening or compromising their creative processes.\n",
