  "abstract": "  Boolean combinations allow combining given combinatorial objects to obtain\nnew, potentially more complicated, objects. In this paper, we initiate a\nsystematic study of this idea applied to graphs. In order to understand\nexpressive power and limitations of boolean combinations in this context, we\ninvestigate how they affect different combinatorial and structural properties\nof graphs, in particular $\\chi$-boundedness, as well as characterize the\nstructure of boolean combinations of graphs from various classes.\n",
