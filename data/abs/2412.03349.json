Generative AI addresses privacy by creating fictitious identities,\nbut fairness problems remain. Using the existing DCFace SOTA framework, we\nintroduce a new controlled generation pipeline that improves fairness. Through\nclassical fairness metrics and a proposed in-depth statistical analysis based\non logit models and ANOVA, we show that our generation pipeline improves\nfairness more than other bias mitigation approaches while slightly improving\nraw performance.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"zp-gWr5YU-xIXdtor8rBKNwrAzF3jgX6xcn9GnOHrBQ","pdfSize":"12572971"}
