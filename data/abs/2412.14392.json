  "abstract": "  Machine learning (ML) systems that guarantee security and privacy often rely\non Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) as a cornerstone technique, enabling\ncomputations on encrypted data without exposing sensitive information. However,\na critical limitation of FHE is its computational inefficiency, making it\nimpractical for large-scale applications. In this work, we propose\n\\textit{Nemesis}, a framework that accelerates FHE-based systems without\ncompromising accuracy or security. The design of Nemesis is inspired by Rache\n(SIGMOD'23), which introduced a caching mechanism for encrypted integers and\nscalars. Nemesis extends this idea with more advanced caching techniques and\nmathematical tools, enabling efficient operations over multi-slot FHE schemes\nand overcoming Rache's limitations to support general plaintext structures. We\nformally prove the security of Nemesis under standard cryptographic assumptions\nand evaluate its performance extensively on widely used datasets, including\nMNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10. Experimental results show that Nemesis\nsignificantly reduces the computational overhead of FHE-based ML systems,\npaving the way for broader adoption of privacy-preserving technologies.\n",
