Our strategy is based on the authors'\nprevious works establishing the possibility and stability of controlling\nacoustic fields using an array of almost non-radiating coupling sources and\npresents a detailed Fourier synthesis approach towards a time-domain effect. We\nrequire that the array of acoustic sources creates the desired fields on the\ncontrol regions while maintaining a zero field beyond a larger circumscribed\nsphere. This paper recalls the main theoretical results then presents the\nunderlying Fourier synthesis paradigm and show, through relevant simulations,\nthe performance of our strategy.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Sound","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"gWx96FrIvdvKONms4F_McMNd-uP0dnRmlHe1cnvLsjo","pdfSize":"4238040"}
