The proposed\nDeepManifold (DM)-ROM methodology is computationally efficient, avoids\npixelation or interpolation of flow field data, and is adaptable to various\ngrids and geometries. The framework consists of four main steps: First, a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN)-based parameterization network extracts\nnonlinear shape modes directly from aerodynamic geometries. Next, manifold\nlearning is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the high-fidelity output\nflow fields. A multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based regression network is then\ntrained to map the nonlinear input and output modes. Finally, a back-mapping\nprocess reconstructs the full flow field from the predicted low-dimensional\noutput modes. DM-ROM is rigorously tested on a transonic RAE2822 airfoil test\ncase, which includes shock waves of varying strengths and locations. Metrics\nare introduced to quantify the model's accuracy in predicting shock wave\nstrength and location. The results demonstrate that DM-ROM achieves a field\nprediction error of approximately 3.5% and significantly outperforms reference\nROM techniques, such as POD-ROM and ISOMAP-ROM, across various training sample\nsizes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"nvfaQh-zro1HSM1UuToOkntjJvTpygpVjTRdEHYclKQ","pdfSize":"24633237"}
