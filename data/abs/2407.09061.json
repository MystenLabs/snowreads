In this paper,\nwe propose a self-supervised graph-based approach for unsupervised feature\nselection. Our method's core involves computing robust pseudo-labels by\napplying simple processing steps to the graph Laplacian's eigenvectors. The\nsubset of eigenvectors used for computing pseudo-labels is chosen based on a\nmodel stability criterion. We then measure the importance of each feature by\ntraining a surrogate model to predict the pseudo-labels from the observations.\nOur approach is shown to be robust to challenging scenarios, such as the\npresence of outliers and complex substructures. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method through experiments on real-world datasets, showing\nits robustness across multiple domains, particularly its effectiveness on\nbiological datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zOy_N_Jl97WG2ij3_IatpFmqu40ugKcYPbthF26yAV0","pdfSize":"7155746"}
