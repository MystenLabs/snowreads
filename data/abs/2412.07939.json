We show how actions can be\nused for decision-making algorithms from simple axioms. We describe the\nencodings of typical data structures as actions, and provide a method of\nanalysis for algorithms on the basis of data mutation.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Symbolic Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QTXEm4F-uQ7ezYQNMi8C2L67sX2Sws6QqQbCAbMDDvE","pdfSize":"165956"}
