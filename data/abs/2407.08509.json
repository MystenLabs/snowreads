To date, low-rank based models have garnered significant\ninterest in this field. This paper proposes a novel low-rank regularization\nterm, named the Haar nuclear norm (HNN), for efficient and effective remote\nsensing image restoration.\n  It leverages the low-rank properties of wavelet coefficients derived from the\n2-D frontal slice-wise Haar discrete wavelet transform, effectively modeling\nthe low-rank prior for separated coarse-grained structure and fine-grained\ntextures in the image. Experimental evaluations conducted on hyperspectral\nimage inpainting, multi-temporal image cloud removal, and hyperspectral image\ndenoising have revealed the HNN's potential. Typically, HNN achieves a\nperformance improvement of 1-4 dB and a speedup of 10-28x compared to some\nstate-of-the-art methods (e.g., tensor correlated total variation, and\nfully-connected tensor network) for inpainting tasks.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rgt2b5b4O14lpAqu4-CMwyVbr7ChYBYI454F1CnnJ7U","pdfSize":"7834699"}
