  "abstract": "  This paper introduces an extension to the Python Neutrosophic Sets (PYNS)\nframework, originally detailed in Nordo et al. 2024, with the addition of the\nNSfamily class for constructing and manipulating neutrosophic topologies.\nBuilding on existing classes like NSuniverse and NSset, the NSfamily class\nenables the definition and testing of neutrosophic families as basis and\nsub-basis for neutrosophic topological spaces. This extension provides tools\nfor verifying closure properties under union and intersection, and for\ndetermining whether a given family constitutes a neutrosophic topology. Through\nimplemented algorithms, the framework automates the generation of topologies\nfrom families of neutrosophic sets, offering an efficient tool for advancing\nresearch in neutrosophic topology. Practical applications are demonstrated with\ndetailed examples, showcasing how this class enhances the scope and flexibility\nof neutrosophic modeling within the PYNS framework.\n",
