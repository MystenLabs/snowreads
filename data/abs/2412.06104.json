However,\nto date all demonstrations have been performed over single-mode and static\nchannels, while the transmission over fluctuating and turbulent channels has\nnot been addressed. We propose and demonstrate a novel approach that leverages\nfield-widened interferometers to decode frequency-bins transmitted over\nfree-space channels without any adaptive optics or modal filtering. Moreover,\nwe investigate the phase stability requirements so that frequency-bin encoding\ncould be feasible for satellite to ground quantum links. Our passive approach\nexpands the versatility of frequency-bin encoding, paving the way towards\nlong-range and fluctuating channels.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2STQwiHP1KR86PDU1g7Dpi192dh6DpDvr7qjHWS6dZs","pdfSize":"1901172"}
