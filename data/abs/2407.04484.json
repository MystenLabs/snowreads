This work studies the effect of different infrared\nprocessing pipelines on the performance of a pedestrian detection in an urban\nenvironment, similar to autonomous driving scenarios. Detection on infrared\nimages is shown to outperform that on visible images, but the infrared\ncorrection pipeline is crucial since the models cannot extract information from\nraw infrared images. Two thermal correction pipelines are studied, the shutter\nand the shutterless pipes. Experiments show that some correction algorithms\nlike spatial denoising are detrimental to performance even if they increase\nvisual quality for a human observer. Other algorithms like destriping and, to a\nlesser extent, temporal denoising, increase computational time, but have some\nrole to play in increasing detection accuracy. As it stands, the optimal\ntrade-off for speed and accuracy is simply to use the shutterless pipe with a\ntonemapping algorithm only, for autonomous driving applications within varied\nenvironments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"wAC06IgpaCh0Xp02ce_Lxwu7kZ0BYPxo3Sc-7GJwn24","pdfSize":"1645952"}
