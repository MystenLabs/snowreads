Our analysis reveals\nthat while single-photon loss does not stabilize the intrinsic instability in\nthe model, the inclusion of two-photon loss restores stability, leading to the\nemergence of superradiant states which coexist with the normal vacuum states.\nUsing a second-order cumulant expansion for the photons, we derive an\nanalytical description of the system in the thermodynamic limit which agrees\nwell with the exact calculation results. Additionally, we present the Wigner\nfunction for the system, shedding light on the breaking of the Z4-symmetry\ninherent in the model. These findings offer valuable insights into\nstabilization mechanisms in open quantum systems and pave the way for exploring\ncomplex nonlinear dynamics in two-photon Dicke models.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7Bt4MoC8J9UeWM6Pmx31gh1I8sdWkwg8y9lzBB0KO9Q","pdfSize":"5116982"}
