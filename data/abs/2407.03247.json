FedType introduces small identical proxy models for clients, serving as\nagents for information exchange, ensuring model security, and achieving\nefficient communication simultaneously. To transfer knowledge between large\nprivate and small proxy models on clients, we propose a novel uncertainty-based\nasymmetrical reciprocity learning method, eliminating the need for any public\ndata. Comprehensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate the\nefficacy and generalization ability of FedType across diverse settings. Our\napproach redefines federated learning paradigms by bridging model\nheterogeneity, eliminating reliance on public data, prioritizing client\nprivacy, and reducing communication costs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kPf_9DleuWX-rigyulv8EegOP10Sqh05B8ZakaI0bI0","pdfSize":"2052324"}
