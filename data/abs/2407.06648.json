Using modern machine\nlearning approaches, identity and attribute inferences attacks have proven high\naccuracy. Anonymizations aim to mitigate such disclosures by modifying data in\na way that prevents identification. However, the effectiveness of some\nanonymizations is unclear. Therefore, improvements of the corresponding\nevaluation methodology have been proposed recently. In this paper, we introduce\nSEBA, a framework for strong evaluation of biometric anonymizations. It\ncombines and implements the state-of-the-art methodology in an easy-to-use and\neasy-to-expand software framework. This allows anonymization designers to\neasily test their techniques using a strong evaluation methodology. As part of\nthis discourse, we introduce and discuss new metrics that allow for a more\nstraightforward evaluation of the privacy-utility trade-off that is inherent to\nanonymization attempts. Finally, we report on a prototypical experiment to\ndemonstrate SEBA's applicability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"t4qos4s-HQ5aEvXBVL_XNGRQdkO3a1LAlrno2OPBOYw","pdfSize":"1033766"}
