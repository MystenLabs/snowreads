LHAASO recently observed the most luminous one: GRB 221009A, and\nunveiled its TeV light curve. The light curve exhibits a distinct jet break at\naround 670 seconds, enabling the derivation of the viewing angle based on the\nsmoothness of the jet break. We constructed two models with or without\nconsidering the high-latitude radiation, where the viewing angle was treated as\na free parameter, to fit the TeV light curve. We obtained the viewing angles\nbeing 9.4 $\\times 10^{-4}$ radians and 5.9 $\\times 10^{-3}$ radians,\nrespectively. These values closely resemble an on-axis scenario, given the\nopening angle is 1.4 $\\times 10^{-2}$ radians.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BuKTJNrU5mEd36iJLTQNF0HCJRNrW-t_kEj9PIZUJyg","pdfSize":"934866"}
