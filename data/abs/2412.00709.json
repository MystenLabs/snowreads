  "abstract": "  For a fixed projective scheme X, a property P of line bundles is satisfied by\nsufficiently ample line bundles if there exists a line bundle L_0 on X such\nthat P(L) holds for any L with (L - L_0) ample. As an example, sufficiently\nample line bundles are very ample, moreover, for a normal variety X, the\nembedding corresponding to sufficiently ample line bundle is projectively\nnormal. The grandfather of such properties and a basic ingredient used to study\nthis concept is Fujita vanishing theorem, which is a strengthening of Serre\nvanishing to sufficiently ample line bundles. The r-th cactus variety of X is\nan analogue of secant variety and it is defined using linear spans of finite\nschemes of degree r. In this article we show that cactus varieties of\nsufficiently ample embeddings of X are set-theoretically defined by minors of\nmatrices with linear entries. The topic is closely related to conjectures of\nEisenbud-Koh-Stillman, which was proved by Ginensky in the case X a smooth\ncurve. On the other hand Sidman-Smith proved that the ideal of sufficiently\nample embedding of any projective scheme X is generated by 2 x 2 minors of a\nmatrix with linear entries.\n",
