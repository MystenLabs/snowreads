  "abstract": "  We propose a scheme to detect the Unruh effect in a circularly rotated\nUnruh-DeWitt detector enclosed within a cylindrical cavity. This technique\nrelies on the enhanced atomic spontaneous emission rate related to the\ncounter-rotating coupling between the detector and massless scalar fields. Our\nanalysis demonstrates that the integration of a cylindrical cavity, coherent\nlight excitation, and multi-atom super-radiation significantly enhances the\nsignal strength, as the radiation rate associated with the standard\nrotating-wave coupling can be greatly suppressed within the cavity. Compared to\nlinear acceleration, circular motion can significantly reduce the atomic\nacceleration path length, leading to increased detection efficiency and lower\nexperimental difficulty. Our method provides a novel avenue for exploring\nrelativistic effects on a compact, tabletop platform.\n",
