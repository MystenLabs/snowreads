It\nimplements efficient algorithms, both existing and novel, for a rich variety of\nfrequently used circuit tasks such as satisfiability, synthesis, and\nminimization. We tested the tool on a wide range of practically relevant\ncircuits (computing, in particular, symmetric and arithmetic functions) that\nhave been optimized intensively by the community for the last three years. The\ntool helped us to win the IWLS 2024 Programming Contest. In 2023, it was Google\nDeepMind who took the first place in the competition. We were able to reduce\nthe size of the best circuits from 2023 by 12\\% on average, whereas for some\nindividual circuits, our size reduction was as large as 83\\%.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Logic in Computer Science","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kP15zvvdy15fSMxlzkIbuKal07X56tMH6tv7x4BT2W4","pdfSize":"384063"}
