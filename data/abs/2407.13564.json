In this paper, we obtain convergence results for the gradient-push\nalgorithm with constant stepsize whose range is sharp in terms the order of the\nsmoothness constant $L>0$. Precisely, under the two settings: 1) Each local\ncost $f_i$ is strongly convex and $L$-smooth, 2) Each local cost $f_i$ is\nconvex quadratic and $L$-smooth while the aggregate cost $f$ is strongly\nconvex, we show that the gradient-push algorithm with stepsize $\\alpha>0$\nconverges to an $O(\\alpha)$-neighborhood of the minimizer of $f$ for a range\n$\\alpha \\in (0, c/L]$ with a value $c>0$ independent of $L>0$. As a benefit of\nthe result, we suggest a hybrid algorithm that performs the gradient-push\nalgorithm with a relatively large stepsize $\\alpha>0$ for a number of\niterations and then go over to perform the Push-DIGing algorithm. It is\nverified by a numerical test that the hybrid algorithm enhances the performance\nof the Push-DIGing algorithm significantly. The convergence results of the\ngradient-push algorithm are also supported by numerical tests.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0z7y8a47GBii5lm10jPHCCs5NrBce3v140SIhk4vWXU","pdfSize":"795420"}
