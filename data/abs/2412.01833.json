We demonstrate\nthat linear or approximately linear stochastic systems near a dynamical\nattractor exhibit transient repulsive dynamics - termed pseudo-bifurcations -\nwhen interacting components are sufficiently asymmetric and hierarchically\norganized, i.e., non-normal. These pseudo-bifurcations produce early-warning\nsignals commonly linked to bifurcations, such as dimension reduction, critical\nslowing down, and increased variance. Furthermore, we show that, as actual\nbifurcations approach, non-normal transients also emerge, complicating their\ndistinction and potentially creating a bias that suggests the system is much\ncloser to a critical point than it actually is. We support our analytical\nderivations by empirically demonstrating that the brain exhibits clear signs of\nsuch non-normal transients during epileptic seizures. Many systems suspected of\napproaching critical bifurcation points should be reconsidered, as non-normal\ndynamics offer a more generic explanation for the observed phenomena across\nnatural, physical, and social systems.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FHsdG6RHNy7GQHp--j_YsOTL1iWvrNEr6IB0Zy3DeyQ","pdfSize":"2883224"}
