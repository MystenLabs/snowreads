Victims in distress often\nstruggle to convey critical information due to panic, speech disorders, and\nbackground noise, further complicating dispatchers' ability to assess\nsituations accurately. Staffing shortages in emergency centers exacerbate\ndelays in coordination and assistance. This paper proposes leveraging Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to address these challenges by reconstructing incomplete\nspeech, filling contextual gaps, and prioritizing calls based on severity. The\nsystem integrates real-time transcription with Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) to generate contextual responses, using Twilio and AssemblyAI APIs for\nseamless implementation. Evaluation shows high precision, favorable BLEU and\nROUGE scores, and alignment with real-world needs, demonstrating the model's\npotential to optimize emergency response workflows and prioritize critical\ncases effectively.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Sound","Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"f3NfQ2SjjGigFydi-M78iapycZ4zQg1LTkDwdsr-wOs","pdfSize":"4798024"}
