This study qualitatively explores the\nimpact of 4IR on the SME sector in Bangladesh. Initially, secondary data\nsources are reviewed to establish the context and to prepare the questionnaire\nfor primary data collection. Then, the primary data is collected through Key\nInformant Interviews and Focus Group Discussions with different stakeholders\nincluding SME owners, association representatives, and government officials.\nThe study reveals that while most of the participants have only a superficially\nawareness of 4IR, they view it as a blessing for the SME sector. Despite being\nin early adoption stages in Bangladesh, SMEs anticipate numerous benefits\nincluding enhanced customer experiences, reduced production times, improved\nquality, etc. Regarding employment, most participants believe that adopting 4IR\nin the SME sector of Bangladesh will create new job opportunities. However,\nparticipants express concern about challenges during the transition to 4IR,\nincluding a lack of technical knowledge, financial constraints, inadequate\ntraining, safety and security issues, etc. To fully harness 4IR's potential\nbenefits for SMEs in Bangladesh, several key recommendations emerge that\ninclude analyzing of the current SME landscape, establishing a collaborative\ninformation sharing platform, organizing effective training and workshops,\npromoting resource sharing, encouraging local innovation, attracting foreign\nclients, ensuring proper policy implementation and fostering collaboration\namong government, associations, and academia. By addressing these challenges\nand implementing the recommended strategies, Bangladesh can effectively embrace\nthe transformative benefits of 4IR, simultaneously improving its SME sector.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"hm0nrkzvJWKYj_f-PbpEuvDQ5Z2IAtOT8s_hKBXvYfA","pdfSize":"678228"}
