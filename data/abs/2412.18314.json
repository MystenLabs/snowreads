Nonetheless, proton nuclear elastic\nscattering plays a significant role also in proton dosimetry applications, for\nwhich the new model necessitated an explicit validation. Therefore, in this\nwork a benchmark has been carried out against a recent measurement of\nradial-depth maps of absorbed dose in a water phantom under irradiation with\nprotons of 100 MeV, 160 MeV, and 225 MeV. Two FLUKA versions have been employed\nto simulate these dose maps: v4-3.4, relying on a legacy model for proton\nnuclear elastic scattering, and v4-4.0, relying on the new model. The enhanced\nagreement with experimental absorbed doses obtained with FLUKA v4-4.0 is\ndiscussed, and the role played by proton nuclear elastic scattering, among\nother interaction mechanisms, in various regions of the radial-depth dose map\nis elucidated. Finally, the benchmark reported in this work is sensitive enough\nto showcase the importance of accurately characterizing beam parameters and the\nscattering geometry for Monte Carlo simulation purposes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Medical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fZEwc2il9Dg0JPPSVCdPuKuOThWWwCtdANb78ml3n-w","pdfSize":"7295777"}
