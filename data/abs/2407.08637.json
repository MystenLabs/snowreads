In\nthe case where $P$ has an integer root of multiplicity $1$, we show that if $A\n\\subseteq [N]^2$ does not contain any nontrivial $P$-polynomial corners, then\n$$|A| \\ll_P \\frac{N^2}{(\\log\\log\\log N)^c}$$ for some absolute constant $c>0$.\nThis simultaneously generalizes a result of Shkredov about corner-free sets and\na recent result of Peluse, Sah, and Sawhney about sets without $3$-term\narithmetic progressions of common difference $z^2-1$. The main ingredients in\nour proof are a multidimensional quantitative concatenation result from our\ncompanion paper arXiv:2407.08636 and a novel degree-lowering argument for box\nnorms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TQ3LdWhBo9oA4r9PctSsB-RzjrYzo6R8xW6tc58KZyk","pdfSize":"693932"}
