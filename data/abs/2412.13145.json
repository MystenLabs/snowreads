{"id":"2412.13145","title":"Agnosticism About Artificial Consciousness","authors":"Tom McClelland","authorsParsed":[["McClelland","Tom",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2024 18:11:12 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-18","timestamp":1734459072000,"abstract":"  Could an AI have conscious experiences? Any answer to this question should\nconform to Evidentialism - that is, it should be based not on intuition, dogma\nor speculation but on solid scientific evidence. I argue that such evidence is\nhard to come by and that the only justifiable stance on the prospects of\nartificial consciousness is agnosticism. In the current debate, the main\ndivision is between biological views that are sceptical of artificial\nconsciousness and functional views that are sympathetic to it. I argue that\nboth camps make the same mistake of over-estimating what the evidence tells us.\nScientific insights into consciousness have been achieved through the study of\nconscious organisms. Although this has enabled cautious assessments of\nconsciousness in various creatures, extending this to AI faces serious\nobstacles. AI thus presents consciousness researchers with a dilemma: either\nreach a verdict on artificial consciousness but violate Evidentialism; or\nrespect Evidentialism but offer no verdict on the prospects of artificial\nconsciousness. The dominant trend in the literature has been to take the first\noption while purporting to follow the scientific evidence. I argue that if we\ntruly follow the evidence, we must take the second option and adopt\nagnosticism.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BUqYx_5kJnJto1MPdrPKxtCpXtIOjFJlJ8wjTtW4wO8","pdfSize":"523039"}
