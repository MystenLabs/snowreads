In this study, we present the observation of spiral waves in a Xenopus\nlaevis frog egg extract reconstituting periodic cell cycle transitions. We find\nthat the emergence of these spiral waves accelerates the cell division cycle\nnearly twofold. Using two distinct computational models, we demonstrate that\nthis behavior arises from generic principles and is driven primarily by\ntime-scale separation in the cell cycle oscillator. Additionally, we\ninvestigate the interplay between these spiral waves and the more commonly\nobserved target pattern waves in the frog cytoplasm, providing new insights\ninto their dynamic interactions.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons","Physics/Biological Physics","Quantitative Biology/Cell Behavior"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"08az1F3XR87dtoP-I_ZaZ6mYqTDVKMUiNu6M4WWLsiY","pdfSize":"2739903"}
