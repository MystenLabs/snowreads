  "abstract": "  We consider a first order operator with a periodic 3x3 matrix potential on\nthe real line. This operator appears in the problem of the periodic vector NLS\nequation. The spectrum of the operator covers the real line, it is union of the\nspectral bands of multiplicity 3, separated by spectral intervals of\nmultiplicity 1. The main results of this work are the following: The Lyapunov\nfunction on the corresponding 2 or 3-sheeted Riemann surface is described.\nNecessary and sufficient conditions are given when the Riemann surface is\n2-sheeted. The asymptotics of 2-periodic eigenvalues are determined. One\nconstructs an entire function, which is positive on the spectrum of\nmultiplicity 3 and is negative on its gaps. The Borg type results about inverse\nproblems are solved.\n",
