As AI systems become more capable,\naccessible, and integrated into critical services, the dual nature of their\npotential is increasingly clear. While AI can enhance defensive capabilities in\nareas like threat detection, risk assessment, and automated security\noperations, it also presents avenues for malicious exploitation and large-scale\nsocietal harm, for example through automated influence operations and cyber\nattacks. Understanding the dynamics that shape AI's capacity to both cause harm\nand enhance protective measures is essential for informed decision-making\nregarding the deployment, use, and integration of advanced AI systems. This\npaper builds on recent work on offense-defense dynamics within the realm of AI,\nproposing a taxonomy to map and examine the key factors that influence whether\nAI systems predominantly pose threats or offer protective benefits to society.\nBy establishing a shared terminology and conceptual foundation for analyzing\nthese interactions, this work seeks to facilitate further research and\ndiscourse in this critical area.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YKntevskBnPvK4w5jplzDPYCMo8QL5ciTgedBf0ayws","pdfSize":"184824"}
