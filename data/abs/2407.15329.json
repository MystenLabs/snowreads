MDT features a multi-branch structure, with each branch\nutilising independent disparity self-attention (DSA) to target specific\ndisparity ranges, effectively reducing computational complexity and\ndisentangling disparities. Building on this architecture, we present LF-MDTNet,\nan efficient LFSR network. Experimental results demonstrate that LF-MDTNet\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by 0.37 dB and 0.41 dB PSNR at\nthe 2x and 4x scales, achieving superior performance with fewer parameters and\nhigher speed.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"rxY78hqjj3_56WNusUuzfvYwoslsqUB5xWaR4TLBgjo","pdfSize":"9285340"}
