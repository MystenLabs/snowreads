An open question concerns whether data-driven methods enhance outreach\nprograms that target at-risk tenants to mitigate their risk of eviction. We\npropose a novel active geospatial search (AGS) modeling framework for this\nproblem. AGS integrates property-level information in a search policy that\nidentifies a sequence of rental units to canvas to both determine their\neviction risk and provide support if needed. We propose a hierarchical\nreinforcement learning approach to learn a search policy for AGS that scales to\nlarge urban areas containing thousands of parcels, balancing exploration and\nexploitation and accounting for travel costs and a budget constraint.\nCrucially, the search policy adapts online to newly discovered information\nabout evictions. Evaluation using eviction data for a large urban area\ndemonstrates that the proposed framework and algorithmic approach are\nconsiderably more effective at sequentially identifying eviction cases than\nbaseline methods.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"oWteVpU6k7qG1Y3U7fdKqcRoKKf0u4Z1zUhAOVWa0hI","pdfSize":"2291314"}
