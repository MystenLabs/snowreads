  "abstract": "  We consider a massive vector Boson in a static patch of $D$-dimensional de\nSitter space (dS$_D$). We argue that this field is controlled by an effective\nphysical (squared) mass $\\mu_{\\mathrm{v}}^2 = m_{\\mathrm{v}}^2 +\n2(D-1)\\ell_{\\mathrm{dS}}^{-2}$ which differs from the naive \"Lagrangian\"\n(squared) mass $m_{\\mathrm{v}}^2$ that appears in the usual form of the Proca\nLagrangian/action. In particular, we conjecture that the theory remains\nwell-defined in the naively tachyonic Lagrangian mass range $-2(D-1) <\nm_{\\mathrm{v}}^2\\ell_{\\mathrm{dS}}^2 < 0$. We identify several interesting\nphysical features of the \"edge of stability\"\n$m_{\\mathrm{v}}^2\\ell_{\\mathrm{dS}}^2 = -2(D-1)$. Fixing a static patch breaks\nthe $D$-dimensional de Sitter isometries down to a \"static patch subgroup\",\nwhich explains why our theory may continue to be well-defined in the above mass\nrange despite not fitting into a unitary irreducible representation of\nSO$(D,1)$. We conjecture that for situations such as ours, the usual\n$\\mathrm{SO}(D,1)$ \"Higuchi bound\" on unitarity is replaced by the concept of\nthe edge of stability. In $D = 3$ spacetime dimensions, the $s$-wave sector of\nour theory remarkably simplifies, becoming equivalent to the $p$-wave sector of\nan ordinary massive scalar. In this case we can explicitly check that the $D =\n3$ $s$-wave sector remains well-defined -- both classically and quantum\nmechanically -- in the above mass range. In the course of our analysis, we will\nderive the general classical solution and the quasinormal frequency spectrum\nfor the massive vector Boson in the static patch of dS$_D$, generalizing\nprevious work by Higuchi [1], which was done for the special case $D = 4$.\nWhile this work was being completed, we became aware of upcoming work by\nGrewal, Law, and Lochab [2] which will contain a similar derivation.\n",
