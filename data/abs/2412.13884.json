In practical medical\nscenarios, physicians and surgeons may lack the specialized expertise required\nfor accurate X-ray interpretation, highlighting the need for machine vision to\nenhance diagnostic accuracy. However, conventional recognition techniques face\nchallenges in discerning subtle differences in X-rays when classifying wrist\npathologies, as many of these pathologies, such as fractures, can be small and\nhard to distinguish. This study tackles wrist pathology recognition as a\nfine-grained visual recognition (FGVR) problem, utilizing a limited,\ncustom-curated dataset that mirrors real-world medical constraints, relying\nsolely on image-level annotations. We introduce a specialized FGVR-based\nensemble approach to identify discriminative regions within X-rays. We employ\nan Explainable AI (XAI) technique called Grad-CAM to pinpoint these regions.\nOur ensemble approach outperformed many conventional SOTA and FGVR techniques,\nunderscoring the effectiveness of our strategy in enhancing accuracy in wrist\npathology recognition.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"07EP8tvdDTWS1m7d_YjKcIe7Wigp2QDHr3LH16Ikzko","pdfSize":"2753444"}
