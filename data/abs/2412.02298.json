  "abstract": "  We construct {\\it Topological Elliptic Genera}, homotopy-theoretic\nrefinements of the elliptic genera for $SU$-manifolds and variants including\nthe Witten-Landweber-Ochanine genus. The codomains are genuinely\n$G$-equivariant Topological Modular Forms developed by Gepner-Meier, twisted by\n$G$-representations. As the first installment of a series of articles on\nTopological Elliptic Genera, this issue lays the mathematical foundation and\ndiscusses immediate applications. Most notably, we deduce an interesting\ndivisibility result for the Euler numbers of $Sp$-manifolds.\n",
