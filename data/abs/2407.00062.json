We\ndemonstrate that item-rating information is more influential than other\ninformation types in a collaborative filtering approach. The trust graph-based\napproaches were found to be more robust to network adversarial attacks due to\nhard-to-manipulate trust structures. Intra-item information, although\nsub-optimal in isolation, enhances the consistency of predictions and lower-end\nperformance when fused with other information forms. Additionally, the Weighted\nAverage framework is introduced, enabling the construction of recommendation\nsystems around any user-to-user similarity metric.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ApLMBjC0VUqyhsfTB_E6vNlUW9ByE2Cms8npuO37vxc","pdfSize":"724309"}
