Here we show that this\nset is also connected via 2-3 and 3-2 moves alone, if we ignore those\ntriangulations for which no 2-3 move results in an essential triangulation. If\nwe also allow V-moves and their inverses then the full set of essential ideal\ntriangulations of $M$ is once again connected. These results also hold if we\nreplace essential triangulations with $L$-essential triangulations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"aThOCOy3JfeGuEG68180pZgRGmxXv2ucWQ8Vu40juhA","pdfSize":"4802782","objectId":"0x05c5b53470d7ea407619d8c7ce0e838fe60b94f036c4d6e420bb1c51746050a5","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
