We show that, conversely, every norm that\ncan be written as a sum of absolute values of linear functionals with rational\ncoefficients is the nonvanishing Thurston norm of some graph manifold, with\nrespect to a rational basis on its second real homology. Moreover, we can\nchoose such graph manifold either to fiber over the circle or not. In\nparticular, every symmetric polygon with rational vertices is the unit polygon\nof the nonvanishing Thurston norm of a graph manifold fibering over the circle.\nIn dimension $\\ge 3$ many symmetric polyhedra with rational vertices are not\nrealizable as nonvanishing Thurston norm ball of any graph manifold. However,\ngiven such a polyhedron, we show that there is always a graph manifold whose\nnonvanishing Thurston norm ball induces a finer partition into cones over the\nfaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Rx9gRohSV9wDN8xZ1JMQqYevr7Jr7IRyoZ3N830siL4","pdfSize":"653499"}
