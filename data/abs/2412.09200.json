  "abstract": "  Given a bounded domain, we deal with the problem of estimating the distance\nfunction from the internal points of the domain to the boundary of the domain.\nConvolutional and differential distance estimation schemes are considered and,\nfor both the schemes, accuracy improvements are proposed and evaluated.\nAsymptotics of Laplace integrals and Taylor series extrapolations are used to\nachieve the improvements.\n",
