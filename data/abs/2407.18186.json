The rank of such sequence is defined to be $\\ell-2k+1$.\nLet $u(m,n)$ denote the number of sequences $\\{a_i\\}_{i=1}^\\ell$ with rank $m$\nand $\\sum_{i=1}^{\\ell} a_i=n$. Bringmann, Jennings-Shaffer, Mahlburg and\nRhoades conjectured that $\\{u(m,n)\\}_m$ is strongly log-concave for any fixed\n$n$. Motivated by this conjecture, in this paper we prove the strongly\nunimodality of $\\{u(m,n)\\}_m$, that is $u(m,n)>u(m+1,n)$ for $m\\ge 0$ and $n\\ge\n\\max\\{6,{m+2\\choose 2}\\}$. This result gives supportive evidence for the above\nconjecture. Moreover, we find a combinatorial interpretation of $u(m,n)$, which\nleads to a new combinatorial interpretation of ${\\rm ospt}(n)$. Furthermore,\nusing this new combinatorial interpretation, a lower bound and an asymptotic\nformula on ${\\rm ospt}(n)$ will be presented.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5_JLORqLpYY7gwCQtuF4VAooD9e0hV_pzJ_6iWI-ScY","pdfSize":"306714","objectId":"0xec23be931523452da506c80ff302618e9c7305684829ed147f55a9dbedef98e4","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
