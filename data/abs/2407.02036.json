The Hamiltonians are chosen at\nthe outset to be self-adjoint with respect to a PT inner product. The quantum\nmechanical time evolution is based on a modified CPT inner product constructed\nin terms of a suitable C operator. The resulting quantum mechanical evolution\nis shown to be unitary and probability is conserved by the oscillations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MhDp3J5pvDdiR0Fkbql-h1kmcSczA_xmdm4b_3LL11M","pdfSize":"263778"}
