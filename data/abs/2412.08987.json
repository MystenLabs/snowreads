  "abstract": "  Computational efficiency is essential for enhancing the accuracy and\npracticality of pricing complex financial derivatives. In this paper, we\ndiscuss Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) for valuing financial derivatives, modeled\nby two nonlinear Black-Scholes PDEs: the Leland model for European call with\ntransaction costs and the AFV model for convertible bonds with default options.\nWe compare the solutions of IGA with finite difference methods (FDM) and finite\nelement methods (FEM). In particular, very accurate solutions can be\nnumerically calculated on far less mesh (knots) than FDM or FEM, by using\nnon-uniform knots and weighted cubic NURBS, which in turn reduces the\ncomputational time significantly.\n",
