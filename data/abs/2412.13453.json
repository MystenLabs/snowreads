Extrapolating extreme\nevents beyond the range of the data is not obvious and requires advanced tools\nbased on extreme value theory. Furthermore, the complexity of risk assessments\noften requires the inclusion of multiple variables. Extreme value theory\nprovides very important tools for the analysis of multivariate or spatial\nextreme events, but these are not easily accessible to professionals without\nappropriate expertise. This article provides a minimal background on\nmultivariate and spatial extremes and gives simple yet thorough instructions to\nanalyse high-dimensional extremes using the R package ExtremalDep. After\nbriefly introducing the statistical methodologies, we focus on road testing the\npackage's toolbox through several real-world applications.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EojonFvSqzuJkf0UFwVy9_Ya6zPuufmJzSUgqWKG3AE","pdfSize":"2402111"}
