However, if a\nstationary current flows through a resistive wire, static electric charges\nappear on the surface of the wire, and this will lead to an additional electric\nforce between the wires. This article discusses the ratio of electric over\nmagnetic forces in the asymptotic limit of infinitely thin wires, which is not\naccessible by numerical methods. The electric force between the two wires\ndepends also on the choice of the common ground node. For extremely thin or\nextremely long resistive wires the electric force dominates over the magnetic\none.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6MEGpSIPf-YGxfA0HY2L1dCti--XiifTtQPX567EbCk","pdfSize":"660168"}
