However, their manual creation is often labor-intensive,\nerror-prone, and lacks robust mechanisms for error detection and correction.\nWhile recent advancements in Generative AI, particularly Large Language Models\n(LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), have demonstrated significant\npotential across various domains, their application in automating generation of\nengineering workflows remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel\ncopilot for automating the generation of P&IDs from natural language\ndescriptions. Leveraging a multi-step agentic workflow, our copilot provides a\nstructured and iterative approach to diagram creation directly from Natural\nLanguage prompts. We demonstrate the feasibility of the generation process by\nevaluating the soundness and completeness of the workflow, and show improved\nresults compared to vanilla zero-shot and few-shot generation approaches.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"BpgqVJ4TsaulklocF2alHBiq2J4KF3Isl5Y_AA0mO4I","pdfSize":"3533251"}
