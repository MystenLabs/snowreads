  "abstract": "  FDA's Project Optimus initiative for oncology drug development emphasizes\nselecting a dose that optimizes both efficacy and safety. When an inferentially\nadaptive Phase 2/3 design with dose selection is implemented to comply with the\ninitiative, the conventional inverse normal combination test is commonly used\nfor Type I error control. However, indiscriminate application of this overly\nconservative test can lead to substantial increase in sample size and timeline\ndelays, which undermines the appeal of the adaptive approach. This, in turn,\nfrustrates drug developers regarding Project Optimus.\n  The inflation of Type I error depends on the probability of selecting a dose\nwith better long-term efficacy outcome at end of the study based on limited\nfollow-up data at dose selection. In this paper, we discuss the estimation of\nthis probability and its impact on Type I error control in realistic settings.\nIncorporating it explicitly into the two methods we have proposed result in\nimproved designs, potentially motivating drug developers to adhere more closely\nto an initiative that has the potential to revolutionize oncology drug\ndevelopment.\n",
