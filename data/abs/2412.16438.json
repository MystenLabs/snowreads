Here we consider a\nrecently developed physically based rational mathematical model for the\ngeneration of wind-driven particle flow fields from otherwise static particle\nbeds, one application of which is the scenario considered here. We introduce a\ndirectional opacity measure, defined for each observation angle from the\nhelicopter cockpit, and show how visibility may vary in the model as certain\nparameters are varied. In particular, we demonstrate a counterintuitive result\nsuggesting that, with specific yet potentially realistic parameter choices,\npilot visibility may be improved in some viewing directions if the helicopter\nwere hovering at a lower altitude. We also calculate the associated deformation\nof the upper surface of the particle bed, and show how certain surface\ndeformation features may be sensitive to variation of key parameters.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"V6e6Ek9YuUDobBVUB0-dONX5eQ1OlgqEvg4M5AtzVkk","pdfSize":"1929263"}
