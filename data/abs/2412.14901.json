Quivers are\nobtained by studying M2 branes wrapping holomorphic disks with Lagrangian\nboundary conditions on an M5 brane, through their identification with a\ndistinguished sector of BPS kinky vortices in the 3d-3d dual QFT. Our proposal\nsuggests that holomorphic disks with Lagrangian boundary conditions are mirror\nto calibrated 1-chains on the associated augmentation curve, whose\nintersections encode the linking of boundaries.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5eMPa7XZH9qF-HWptAbGfOugjeyGf_Uk4Ya2kRrQZQs","pdfSize":"1890747"}
