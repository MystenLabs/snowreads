The QD\nbiexciton system exhibits interplay between first and third-order nonlinear\nsusceptibility between two orthogonal circular polarisation transitions. Three\nQD transitions are coupled with one applied weak and two strong control orbital\nangular momentum (OAM) carrying fields. Therefore, the applied field\nexperiences absorption, and a new field with the desired OAM is generated via\nfour-wave mixing (FWM). These two orthogonal field superpositions produce VB at\nthe QD medium end. We have also demonstrated the polarization rotation of a VB\nby changing only the relative control field phase. Additionally, we have\nanalyzed the effect of temperature on the VB generation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pE6eEcPf1YbqmZwqqyI4VC4uwHDMzOLs37gTQoAFH40","pdfSize":"1861249"}
