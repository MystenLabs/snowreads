The\nincreasing demand for personalised applications motivated the design of\nconversational agents (CAs) to possess distinct personas. This paper commences\nby examining the rationale and implications of imbuing CAs with unique\npersonas, smoothly transitioning into a broader discussion of the\npersonalisation and anthropomorphism of CAs based on LLMs in the LLM era. We\ndelve into the specific applications where the implementation of a persona is\nnot just beneficial but critical for LLM-based CAs. The paper underscores the\nnecessity of a nuanced approach to persona integration, highlighting the\npotential challenges and ethical dilemmas that may arise. Attention is directed\ntowards the importance of maintaining persona consistency, establishing robust\nevaluation mechanisms, and ensuring that the persona attributes are effectively\ncomplemented by domain-specific knowledge.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XaBQBAGwReMrsLGg6VqwxUEqAI9bMQeic7qgomMErqA","pdfSize":"597004","objectId":"0x6166163becac3b0e1d7c2119d3e29ca1e8bdb37e25c6b0574a99d9c0deb9dbc1","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
