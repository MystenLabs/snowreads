  "abstract": "  We employ a linear stability analysis approach to explore the dynamics of\nmatter and curvature-driven dark energy interactions within the framework of\ntwo types of viable $f(R)$ gravity models. The interaction is modeled via a\nsource term in the continuity equations, $\\mathcal{Q} = \\alpha\n\\tilde{\\rho}_{\\rm m} \\Big{(}\\frac{3H^3}{\\kappa^2 \\rho_{\\rm curv}} +\n\\frac{\\kappa^2 }{3H}\\rho_{\\rm curv} \\Big{)}$. Our results reveal significant\nmodifications to the fixed points and their stability criteria compared to\ntraditional $f(R)$ gravity analyses without matter-curvature coupling. We\nidentify constraints on model and coupling parameters necessary for critical\npoint stability, illustrating how the interaction influences cosmic dynamics\nwithin specific parameter ranges. The findings are consistent with observed\ncosmic evolution, supporting stable late-time acceleration. Moreover, we\nhighlight the coupling parameter's potential role in addressing the cosmic\ncoincidence problem.\n",
