  "abstract": "  We investigate the potential of using the signature of mono-Higgs plus large\nmissing energies to constrain on two new physics models, namely the model of an\naxion-like particle (ALP) and the model of sterile neutrinos. We focus on the\nHiggs-ALP interactions starting at dimension-six and the Higgs-sterile neutrino\ninteractions starting at dimension-five, via the processes $pp \\to h a a$ for\nALP production and $pp \\to h N N$ for sterile neutrinos at the LHC and High\nLuminosity LHC (HL-LHC), followed by the Higgs decay $h \\to b \\bar{b}$. We\nestablish bounds on the ALP-Higgs coupling $\\frac{C_{aH}}{\\Lambda^2}$ and\nsterile neutrino-Higgs coupling $\\frac{\\lambda_3}{M_*}$, respectively, for ALP\nand sterile-neutrino mass ranging from 1 to 60 GeV, using the recent ATLAS data\non mono-Higgs plus missing energies at the LHC $(\\sqrt{s} = 13\\;{\\rm TeV}\\;\n{\\rm and}\\; \\mathcal{L} = 139\\; {\\rm fb}^{-1})$. The most stringent constraint\noccurs in the missing transverse energy $M_{ET}$ range $200 < M_{ET} \\leq 350$\nGeV. We also estimate the sensitivities that we can achieve at the HL-LHC\n($\\sqrt{s} = 14$ TeV and $\\mathcal{L} = 3000$ fb$^{-1}$). We obtain improved\nsensitivities across various missing energy regions. The ALP model exhibits\nbetter sensitivities, particularly at lower mass range, compared to the sterile\nneutrino model, which shows weaker sensitivities across similar mass and energy\nranges. Our results underscore the potential of the mono-Higgs signature as a\nrobust probe for physics beyond the Standard Model.\n",
