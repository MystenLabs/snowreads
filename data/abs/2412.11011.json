The category\nof convergence spaces is well-suited for Algebraic Topology, one of the reasons\nis the existence of exponential objects provided by continuous convergence. In\nthis work, we use a net-theoretic approach to convergence spaces. The goal is\nto simplify the description of continuous convergence and apply it to problems\nrelated to homotopy theory. We present methods to develop the basis of homotopy\ntheory in limit spaces, define the fundamental groupoid, and prove the groupoid\nversion of the Seifert-van Kampen Theorem for limit spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3X-VGZl9n-oonp1PTwvF-GM0xCvboW0_AfgDxFkydk4","pdfSize":"1407682"}
