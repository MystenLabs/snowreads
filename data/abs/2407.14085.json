While recent methods have proven to\nbe quite effective in the extraction of keywords, the identification of\n$\\textit{class-specific}$ keywords, or only those pertaining to a predefined\nclass, remains challenging. In this work, we propose an improved method for\nclass-specific keyword extraction, which builds upon the popular\n$\\textbf{KeyBERT}$ library to identify only keywords related to a class\ndescribed by $\\textit{seed keywords}$. We test this method using a dataset of\nGerman business registry entries, where the goal is to classify each business\naccording to an economic sector. Our results reveal that our method greatly\nimproves upon previous approaches, setting a new standard for\n$\\textit{class-specific}$ keyword extraction.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kHwMCI6ZAdNCbZA6h7Twg9vHL5k3DI9_7_67kLaNBdg","pdfSize":"401863"}
