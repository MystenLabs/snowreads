  "abstract": "  What is appropriateness? Humans navigate a multi-scale mosaic of interlocking\nnotions of what is appropriate for different situations. We act one way with\nour friends, another with our family, and yet another in the office. Likewise\nfor AI, appropriate behavior for a comedy-writing assistant is not the same as\nappropriate behavior for a customer-service representative. What determines\nwhich actions are appropriate in which contexts? And what causes these\nstandards to change over time? Since all judgments of AI appropriateness are\nultimately made by humans, we need to understand how appropriateness guides\nhuman decision making in order to properly evaluate AI decision making and\nimprove it. This paper presents a theory of appropriateness: how it functions\nin human society, how it may be implemented in the brain, and what it means for\nresponsible deployment of generative AI technology.\n",
