Cybersecurity threats and\nrisks have increased in recent years, due to the increasing number of devices\nand networks connected. This has led to the development of new cyberattack\npatterns, such as ransomware, data breaches, and advanced persistent threats\n(APT). Consequently, defending such complicated attacks needs to stay up to\ndate with the latest system vulnerabilities and weaknesses to set a proper\ncybersecurity defense strategy. This paper aims to propose a defense strategy\nfor the presented security threats by determining and prioritizing which\nsecurity control to put in place based on combining the MITRE ATT&CK framework\nwith multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques. This approach helps\norganizations achieve a more robust and resilient cybersecurity posture.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"bu87Emec8NQEUqA_neaVy5aIjJwSHyH6wgTpoBkGjG0","pdfSize":"629300"}
