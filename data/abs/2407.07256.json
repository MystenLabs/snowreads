This type of cost function arises in an optics\napplication which we call the point-to-point reflector problem. We define basic\nhypotheses on the cost functions with preferential direction that will allow\nfor the Ma-Trudinger-Wang (MTW) conditions to hold and construct a regularity\ntheory for such cost functions. For the point-to-point reflector problem, we\nshow that the negative cost-sectional curvature condition does not hold. We\nwill nevertheless prove the existence of a unique solution of the\npoint-to-point reflector problem, up to a constant, provided that the source\nand target intensity are \"close enough\".\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"k_F-eNRCHrJ7YtY0BWMppMhMG-tpQgAtqoBPp__4VkY","pdfSize":"708953"}
