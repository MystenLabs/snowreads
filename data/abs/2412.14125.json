Weak $f$-structures on\na smooth manifold $M^{2n+s}\\ (s>1)$ have been introduced by V. Rovenski and R.\nWolak as a generalization of $f$-structures by K. Yano. In this paper, we\nintroduce new structures of this kind called weak $\\beta$-Kenmotsu\n$f$-structures as a generalization of the concept by K. Kenmotsu (and its\nextensions by other geometers) and explore their properties and geometrical\ninterpretations. The paper demonstrates that a weak $\\beta$-Kenmotsu\n$f$-manifold is locally a twisted/warped product of $\\mathbb{R}^s$ and a weak\nK\\\"{a}hlerian manifold. It also shows that such manifolds with constant $\\beta$\nand an $\\eta$-Ricci soliton structure have constant scalar curvature and can be\n$\\eta$-Einstein manifolds.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fSbdfJCWEbpINzUQZBr8huPazCQo6hiUDwpYfuSvKrE","pdfSize":"204243"}
