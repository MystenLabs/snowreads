We show that a reservoir\ncomputer can be trained to predict a system parameter from the time series\ndata. Subsequently, a control signal based on the predicted parameter can be\nused as feedback to the dynamical system to lead it to a target state. Our\nresults show that the dynamical system can be controlled throughout a wide\nrange of attractor types. One set of training data consisting of only a few\ntime series corresponding to the known parameter values enables our scheme to\ncontrol a dynamical system to an arbitrary target attractor starting from any\nother initial attractor. In addition to numerical results, we implement our\nscheme in real-world systems like on a R\\\"{o}ssler system realized in an\nelectronic circuit to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"9OxyyQhk3BYDp3b0X1z-36xdwx8q6UGyQnebFhYeHyI","pdfSize":"1470837"}
