The resulting equation represents in\nthe conserved case the equivalent of the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation\nobtained in the nonconserved case as amplitude equation for the standard Hopf\nbifurcation. Considering first the case of a relatively simple symmetric\nCahn-Hilliard model with purely nonreciprocal coupling, we derive the nonlinear\nnonlocal amplitude equation with real coefficients and show that its\nbifurcation diagram and time evolution well agree with results for the full\nmodel. The solutions of the amplitude equation and their stability are\nanalytically obtained thereby showing that in oscillatory phase separation the\nsuppression of coarsening is universal. Second, we lift the two restrictions\nand obtain the amplitude equation in the generic case that has complex\ncoefficients, that also shows very good agreement with the full model as\nexemplified for some transient dynamics that converges to traveling wave\nstates.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-iEcZx9hf_WCAyIb9T7HqhdSFBLqHuw1uzbRboz30Kg","pdfSize":"7015809"}
