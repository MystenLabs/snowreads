While disease ontologies aid in biological\ndata annotation, codified categories (SNOMED-CT, ICD10, CPT) may not capture\npatient condition nuances or rare diseases. Multiple disease definitions across\ndata sources complicate ontology mapping and disease clustering. We propose\ncreating patient knowledge graphs using large language model extraction\ntechniques, allowing data extraction via natural language rather than rigid\nontological hierarchies. Our method maps to existing ontologies (MeSH,\nSNOMED-CT, RxNORM, HPO) to ground extracted entities.\n  Using a large ambulatory care EHR database with 33.6M patients, we\ndemonstrate our method through the patient search for Dravet syndrome, which\nreceived ICD10 recognition in October 2020. We describe our construction of\npatient-specific knowledge graphs and symptom-based patient searches. Using\nconfirmed Dravet syndrome ICD10 codes as ground truth, we employ LLM-based\nentity extraction to characterize patients in grounded ontologies. We then\napply this method to identify Beta-propeller protein-associated\nneurodegeneration (BPAN) patients, demonstrating real-world discovery where no\nground truth exists.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"F3bRVZBbaKqKGzmvzTOrFrc8Xc-OC_Bvxix2vy7aZnU","pdfSize":"2886504"}
