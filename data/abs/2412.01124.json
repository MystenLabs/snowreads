  "abstract": "  Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) is a method that captures spatial gene\nexpression profiles within histological sections. The discrete spatial\ndistribution and the super-high dimensional sequencing results make ST data\nchallenging to be modeled effectively. In this paper, we manage to model ST in\na continuous and compact manner by the proposed tool, SUICA, empowered by the\ngreat approximation capability of Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that\ncan improve both the spatial resolution and the gene expression. Concretely\nwithin the proposed SUICA, we incorporate a graph-augmented Autoencoder to\neffectively model the context information of the unstructured spots and provide\ninformative embeddings that are structure-aware for spatial mapping. We also\ntackle the extremely skewed distribution in a regression-by-classification\nfashion and enforce classification-based loss functions for the optimization of\nSUICA. By extensive experiments of a wide range of common ST platforms, SUICA\noutperforms both conventional INR variants and SOTA methods for ST\nsuper-resolution regarding numerical fidelity, statistical correlation, and\nbio-conservation. The prediction by SUICA also showcases amplified gene\nsignatures that enriches the bio-conservation of the raw data and benefits\nsubsequent analysis.
