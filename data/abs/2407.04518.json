Compared to composition-level attribute\nunderstanding such as key or genre, we identify a knowledge gap in\nperformance-level music understanding, and address three critical tasks:\nexpertise ranking, difficulty estimation, and piano technique detection,\nintroducing a comprehensive Pianism-Labelling Dataset (PLD) for this purpose.\nWe leverage pre-trained audio encoders, specifically Jukebox, Audio-MAE, MERT,\nand DAC, demonstrating varied capabilities in tackling downstream tasks, to\nexplore whether domain-specific fine-tuning enhances capability in capturing\nperformance nuances. Our best approach achieved 93.6\\% accuracy in expertise\nranking, 33.7\\% in difficulty estimation, and 46.7\\% in technique detection,\nwith Audio-MAE as the overall most effective encoder. Finally, we conducted a\ncase study on Chopin Piano Competition data using trained models for expertise\nranking, which highlights the challenge of accurately assessing top-tier\nperformances.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7RqyINxL_9oJ1WFmk7r8zqxN71UlRBAkdeYqFva00jI","pdfSize":"696356"}
