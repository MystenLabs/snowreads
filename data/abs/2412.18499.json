As a\nspecial subalgebra of the augmented Chow ring of the matroid, it plays an\nimportant role in the recent proof of the Dowling-Wilson Top Heavy Conjecture.\nRecently, Mastroeni and McCullough proved that the Chow ring and the augmented\nChow ring of a matroid are Koszul. We study when graded M\\\"obius algebras are\nKoszul. We characterize the Koszul graded M\\\"obius algebras of cycle matroids\nof graphs in terms of properties of the graphs. Our results yield a new\ncharacterization of strongly chordal graphs via edge orderings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ii5mgQUMvrLmkhHCFo8EHaCW1K6LrbHPLvzKonZn2Vo","pdfSize":"379907"}
