We describe a swimmer (either pusher or puller) as a distribution of\npoint forces, representing the swimmer's flagellum and body, with only the\nlatter subjected to no-slip boundary conditions with respect to the surrounding\nfluid. In particular, our model swimmer consists of only three beads (two for\nthe body and one for the flagellum) connected by inextensible and rigid links.\nWhen the beads are collinear, standard straight swimming is realized and, in\nthe absence of propulsion, we demonstrate that the swimmer's body behaves as an\ninfinitely thin rod. Conversely, by imposing an angle between body and\nflagellum the swimmer moves on circular orbits. We then discuss how two\nswimmers, in collinear or non-collinear geometry, scatter upon encounter.\nFinally, we explore the dynamics of a large number of swimmers reacting to one\nanother only via hydrodynamic interactions, and exemplify their complex\ncollective dynamics in both straight and circular swimmers.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"Fx7_iklQT68bp-vw3Xc66HkK9P1VsZrnJquB3w5RPJo","pdfSize":"926247"}
