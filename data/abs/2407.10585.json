The size of the simulation is dictated by the\nlargest scales one aims to probe, while the resolution is determined by the\nsmallest dark matter haloes capable of hosting the first stars. We present a\nhybrid approach where the density and tidal fields of a large-volume,\nlow-resolution simulation are combined with small haloes from a small-volume,\nhigh-resolution box. By merging these two boxes of relatively lower dynamic\nrange, we achieve an effective high-dynamic range simulation using only 13% of\nthe computational resources required for a full high-dynamic range simulation.\nOur method accurately reproduces the one- and two-point statistics of the halo\nfield, its cross-correlation with the dark matter density field, and the\ntwo-point statistics of the HI field computed using a semi-numerical code, all\nwithin 10% accuracy at large scales and across different redshifts. Our\ntechnique, combined with semi-numerical models of reionization, provides a\nresource-efficient tool for modeling the HI distribution at high redshifts.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XG5HPhNLmrP56k_k2LvRPzol8iPtNoco5_MxW8WFnk0","pdfSize":"2739425"}
