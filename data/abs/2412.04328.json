The\nremaining graph obtained when there is no leaf left is called the Karp--Sipser\ncore. When the underlying graph is the classical sparse Erd\\H{o}s--R\\'enyi\nrandom graph $ \\mathrm{G}[n, \\lambda/n]$, it is known to exhibit a phase\ntransition at $\\lambda = \\mathrm{e}$. We show that at criticality, the\nKarp--Sipser core has size of order $n^{3/5}$, which proves a conjecture of\nBauer and Golinelli. We provide the asymptotic law of this renormalized size as\nwell as a description of the distribution of the core as a graph. Our approach\nrelies on the differential equation method, and builds up on a previous work on\na configuration model with bounded degrees.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"od0UkAWIKA7nxK2YpUfJgvhizSKHJB94Nv5EpnfzZY8","pdfSize":"727507"}
