Despite progress in understanding ASD,\nits diagnosis and treatment continue to pose significant challenges due to the\nvariability in symptomatology and the necessity for multidisciplinary care\napproaches. This paper investigates the potential of Artificial Intelligence\n(AI) to augment the capabilities of healthcare professionals and caregivers in\nmanaging ASD. We have developed a sophisticated algorithm designed to analyze\nfacial and bodily expressions during daily activities of both autistic and\nnon-autistic children, leading to the development of a powerful deep\nlearning-based autism detection system. Our study demonstrated that AI models,\nspecifically the Xception and ResNet50V2 architectures, achieved high accuracy\nin diagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This research highlights the\ntransformative potential of AI in improving the diagnosis, treatment, and\ncomprehensive management of ASD. Our study revealed that AI models, notably the\nXception and ResNet50V2 architectures, demonstrated high accuracy in diagnosing\nASD.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"VoRiTGtAMeHTFjkCdKZQZ9P8EjzHdClauGhuJjHpd0Y","pdfSize":"435632"}
