We realize the Goresky-Hingston\ncoproduct as a map of spectra, and show that the failure of $f$ to entwine the\nspectral coproducts can be characterized by Chas-Sullivan multiplication with\n$[T]$. In particular, when $f$ is a simple homotopy equivalence, the spectral\ncoproducts of $M$ and $N$ agree.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0GQ0W5H75uNKzUzbn2O9jwcowxyozV8Jl47l9pWQA80","pdfSize":"736690","objectId":"0xbfbe46d9eab3eb3a71687fb351f4bbcfaed9a76d539c6fa184984eaf673d2ea7","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
