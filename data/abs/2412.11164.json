Imputation, i.e., filling in the missing values,\nis a common way to deal with this issue. In this study, we compare imputation\nmethods, including Multiple Imputation with Random Forest (MICE-RF) and\nadvanced deep learning approaches (SAITS, BRITS, Transformer) for noisy,\nmissing time series data in terms of MAE, F1-score, AUC, and MCC, across\nmissing data rates (10 % - 80 %). Our results show that MICE-RF can effectively\nimpute missing data compared to deep learning methods and the improvement in\nclassification of data imputed indicates that imputation can have denoising\neffects. Therefore, using an imputation algorithm on time series with missing\ndata can, at the same time, offer denoising effects.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"s6PXatFD2lWatztE9QtsaDP6SRkJlN76AmZMlqyyHfY","pdfSize":"864781"}
