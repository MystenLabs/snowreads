These tests rely on distinct test statistics and critical values. To\napply them, researchers are forced to take a stance on the asymptotic behavior\nof the number of IVs, which can be ambiguous when the number is moderate. In\nthis paper, we propose a bootstrap-based, dimension-agnostic AR test. By\nderiving strong approximations for the test statistic and its bootstrap\ncounterpart, we show that our new test has a correct asymptotic size regardless\nof whether the number of IVs is fixed or increasing -- allowing, but not\nrequiring, the number of IVs to exceed the sample size. We also analyze the\npower properties of the proposed uniformly valid test under both fixed and\nincreasing numbers of IVs.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Qp0iAIY3tZf91mLCMDtl_XuYg87Vx2NzbDqiBdrIxtw","pdfSize":"1015223"}
