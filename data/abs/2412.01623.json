We consider spectroscopic data obtained with the low resolution\nPRISM/CLEAR NIRSpec configuration. Studying the correlation of beta with M_UV\nwe find a decreasing trend of beta = (-0.056 +- 0.017) M_UV - (3.01 +- 0.34),\nconsistent with brighter galaxies having redder beta as found in previous\nworks. However, analysing the trend in separate redshift bins, we find that at\nhigh redshift the relation becomes much flatter, consistent with a flat slope.\nFurthermore, we find that beta decreases with redshift with an evolution as\nbeta = (-0.075 +- 0.010) z - (1.496 +- 0.056), consistent with most previous\nresults that show a steepening of the spectra going at higher z. We then select\na sample of galaxies with extremely blue slopes (beta < -2.6): such slopes are\nsteeper than what is predicted by stellar evolution models, even for dust free,\nyoung, metal poor populations, when the contribution of nebular emission is\nincluded. We select 51 extremely blue galaxies (XBGs) and we investigate the\npossible physical origin of their steep slopes, comparing them to a sub-sample\nof redder galaxies (matched in redshift and M_UV). We find that XBGs have\nyounger stellar populations, stronger ionization fields, lower dust\nattenuation, and lower but not pristine metallicity (~ 10% solar) compared to\nred galaxies. However, these properties alone cannot explain the extreme beta\nvalues. By using indirect inference of Lyman continuum escape, using the most\nrecent models, we estimate escape fractions f_esc > 10% in at least 25% of\nXBGs, while all the red sources have smaller f_esc. A reduced nebular continuum\ncontribution as due to either a high escape fraction or to a bursty\nstar-formation history is likely the origin of the extremely blue slopes.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zvMDG2iqggqB2wqrtWimcWgT0ruxJkBo4GuVEZS7k-U","pdfSize":"969949"}
