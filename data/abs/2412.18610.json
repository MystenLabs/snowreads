To address this, quench dynamics starting from nonthermal states have\nbeen extensively studied, leading to significant progress. In this paper, we\npropose a novel quench protocol, termed the \"crosscap quench\", to investigate\nhow highly structured thermal pure states relax into typical ones. We begin by\nanalyzing conformal field theories (CFTs) and derive universal features in the\ntime evolution of the entanglement entropy. Furthermore, leveraging the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence, we study holographic CFTs, providing an analytically tractable\nexample in chaotic CFTs. Finally, we validate these findings through numerical\nsimulations in both nonintegrable and integrable quantum spin systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PiUP0B-1Eq0Is-sk3eFzNMAb3XmbNXoh4RRc5hVzAps","pdfSize":"517878"}
