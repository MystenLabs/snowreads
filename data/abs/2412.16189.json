  "abstract": "  Although neuron models have been well-studied for their rich dynamics and\nbiological properties, limited research has been done on the complex geometries\nthat emerge from the basins of attraction and basin boundaries of multistable\nneuron systems. In this paper, we investigate the geometrical properties of the\nstrange attractors, four-dimensional basins, and fractal basin boundaries of an\nasymmetrically electrically coupled system of two identical non-chaotic Rulkov\nneurons. We discover a quasi-multistability in the system emerging from the\nexistence of a chaotic spiking-bursting pseudo-attractor, and we classify and\nquantify the system's basins of attraction, which are found to have complex\nfractal geometries. Using the method of uncertainty exponents, we also find\nthat the system exhibits extreme final state sensitivity, which results in a\ndynamical uncertainty that could have important applications in neurobiology.\n",
