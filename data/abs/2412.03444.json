  "abstract": "  Fidelity is crucial for characterizing transformations of quantum states\nunder various quantum channels, which can be served as a fundamental tool in\nresource theories. Firstly, we define an $\\alpha$-$z$-fidelity as a significant\nquantity in quantum information theory and give the properties of the fidelity\nwith orders $\\alpha$ and $z$. Secondly, by analyzing the $\\alpha$-$z$-fidelity\nunder the evolution of different types of quantum channels (single orbit, all\nquantum channels, unitary quantum channels, and mixed unitary quantum\nchannels), we propose a limit formula for the maximum and the minimum of the\n$\\alpha$-$z$-fidelity. In addition, we have extended the $\\alpha$-$z$-R\\'enyi\nrelative entropy, providing new insights into its relevance for resource\nquantification. Finally, we offer a geometric interpretation for measuring the\ndistance between quantum states, contributing to the broader understanding of\nthe operational and transformative power of dynamical quantum resources across\nvarious physical settings.\n",
