We treat data\nfrom perceptual modalities, such as images, as a language-agnostic\nrepresentation of meaning. Hence, we can quantify the function--form\nrelationship between images and captions across languages. Inspired by\ninformation theory, we define \"groundedness\", an empirical measure of\ncontextual semantic contentfulness (formulated as a difference in surprisal)\nwhich can be computed with multilingual multimodal language models. As a proof\nof concept, we apply this measure to the typology of word classes. Our measure\ncaptures the contentfulness asymmetry between functional (grammatical) and\nlexical (content) classes across languages, but contradicts the view that\nfunctional classes do not convey content. Moreover, we find universal trends in\nthe hierarchy of groundedness (e.g., nouns > adjectives > verbs), and show that\nour measure partly correlates with psycholinguistic concreteness norms in\nEnglish. We release a dataset of groundedness scores for 30 languages. Our\nresults suggest that the grounded typology approach can provide quantitative\nevidence about semantic function in language.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"-In-FloQ5WpFzblN1CyZL_URWkDeR3ezqtRTYqdP14E","pdfSize":"3697246"}
