QSP allows one to transform a signal embedded in a given unitary using\npolynomials. Characterizing which polynomials can be achieved with QSP\nprotocols is an important part of the power of this technique, and while such a\ncharacterization is well-understood in the case of univariate signals, it is\nunclear which multivariate polynomials can be constructed when the signal is a\nvector, rather than a scalar. This work uses a slightly different formalism\nthan what is found in the literature, and uses it to find simpler necessary\nconditions for decomposability, as well as a sufficient condition - the first,\nto the best of our knowledge, proven for a (generally inhomogeneous)\nmultivariate polynomial in the context of quantum signal processing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TTyZIMZEE6EEXOwsESFUnJ9z0G54ynoG4WB4gDmA-IA","pdfSize":"261405"}
