Overall, the MULTIMODAL UNIVERSE contains hundreds of\nmillions of astronomical observations, constituting 100\\,TB of multi-channel\nand hyper-spectral images, spectra, multivariate time series, as well as a wide\nvariety of associated scientific measurements and \"metadata\". In addition, we\ninclude a range of benchmark tasks representative of standard practices for\nmachine learning methods in astrophysics. This massive dataset will enable the\ndevelopment of large multi-modal models specifically targeted towards\nscientific applications.
