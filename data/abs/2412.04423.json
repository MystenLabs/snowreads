Following treatment with different\nsurface passivation agents, we show that trEFM probes dynamics directly related\nto surface recombination velocity and carrier lifetimes correlated with\ntime-resolved photoluminescence. Our results reveal nanoscale variations in\nrecombination dynamics following surface passivation. We also observe\nheterogeneity in surface potential equilibration times dependent on perovskite\nfilm morphology. We combine wavelength- and intensity-dependent measurements\nwith drift-diffusion simulations to disentangle the influence of carrier\nrecombination and ion migration on surface potential equilibration. These\nresults demonstrate that we can use mechanical detection to image electronic\ncarrier recombination dynamics in perovskites below the optical diffraction\nlimit while also showing the potential for future improvements in heterogeneity\nof surface passivation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DMPdvl4OU17Gx4mYF3GUJzsVDebQ6EhzFZtrDygJ9NY","pdfSize":"2847650"}
