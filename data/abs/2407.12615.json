Here, we present\na quantum oscillations study up to 45 T in the high-$T_c$ phase of tetragonal\nFeSe$_{0.82}$S$_{0.18}$ up to 22 kbar. Under applied pressure, the quasi-two\ndimensional multiband Fermi surface expands and the effective masses remain\nlarge, whereas the superconductivity displays a three-fold enhancement.\nComparing with chemical pressure tuning of FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$, the Fermi surface\nenlarges in a similar manner but the effective masses and $T_c$ are suppressed.\nThese differences may be attributed to the changes in the density of states\ninfluenced by the chalcogen height, which could promote stronger spin\nfluctuations pairing under pressure. Furthermore, our study also reveals\nunusual scattering and broadening of superconducting transitions in the\nhigh-pressure phase, indicating the presence of a complex pairing mechanism.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Wbx9QFx4lWVP2RmPy75NBYNEnPNpEqL7PaXNaPff-l0","pdfSize":"13737139"}
