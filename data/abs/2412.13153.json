These measurements provide unique insights\ninto the initial state of protons and ions, with great sensitivity for both\ngluon saturation and shadowing. Furthermore, we will discuss the prospects for\nthese measurements using the Run 3 and Run 4 data.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qvn9-7dGwvvrSBdzIGjtR7O6cN82XKvSI9ujS3Hji3E","pdfSize":"811077"}
