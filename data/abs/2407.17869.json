However, solving the inverse problem of ellipsometry\nis time-consuming since it involves human expertise to apply the data fitting\ntechniques. Many studies use traditional machine learning-based methods to\nmodel the complex mathematical fitting process. In our work, we approach this\nproblem from a deep learning perspective. First, we introduce a large-scale\nbenchmark dataset to facilitate deep learning methods. The proposed dataset\nencompasses 98 types of thin film materials and 4 types of substrate materials,\nincluding metals, alloys, compounds, and polymers, among others. Additionally,\nwe propose a deep learning framework that leverages residual connections and\nself-attention mechanisms to learn the massive data points. We also introduce a\nreconstruction loss to address the common challenge of multiple solutions in\nthin film thickness prediction. Compared to traditional machine learning\nmethods, our framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on our\nproposed dataset. The dataset and code will be available upon acceptance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"igXzsBBmdCjvBQsAu-cyUQ9vlbrm1elQ6RyCo1gfMAg","pdfSize":"4327638"}
