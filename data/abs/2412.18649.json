However, vehicle vibrations and\naccelerations perturb finger movements and cause erroneous touchscreen inputs\nby users. Furthermore, unlike physical buttons, touchscreens cannot be operated\nby touch alone and always require users' visual focus. Hence, despite their\nnumerous benefits, touchscreens are not inherently suited for use in vehicles,\nwhich results in an increased risk of accidents. In a recently awarded research\nproject titled \"Right Touch Right Time: Future In-vehicle Touchscreens (FITS)\",\nwe aim to address these problems by developing novel in-vehicle touchscreens\nthat actively predict and correct perturbed finger movements and simulate\nphysical touch interactions with artificial tactile feedback.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction","Computer Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"horEeJgIrc3HFk4DVpT2r3PADDytG6lcec_y6Y_p8oY","pdfSize":"2114194"}
