  "abstract": "  A college education historically has been seen as method of moving upward\nwith regards to income brackets and social status. Indeed, many colleges\nrecognize this connection and seek to enroll talented low income students.\nWhile these students might have their education, books, room, and board paid;\nthere are other items that they might be expected to use that are not part of\nmost college scholarship packages. One of those items that has recently\nsurfaced is access to generative AI platforms. The most popular of these\nplatforms is ChatGPT, and it has a paid version (ChatGPT4) and a free version\n(ChatGPT3.5). We seek to explore differences in the free and paid versions in\nthe context of homework questions and data analyses as might be seen in a\ntypical introductory statistics course. We determine the extent to which\nstudents who cannot afford newer and faster versions of generative AI programs\nwould be disadvantaged in terms of writing such projects and learning these\nmethods.\n",
