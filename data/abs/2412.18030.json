  "abstract": "  The 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to John Hopfield and Geoffrey\nHinton, \"for foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine\nlearning with artificial neural networks.\" As noted by the Nobel committee,\ntheir work moved the boundaries of physics. This is a brief reflection on\nHopfield's work, its implications for the emergence of biological physics as a\npart of physics, the path from his early papers to the modern revolution in\nartificial intelligence, and prospects for the future.\n",
