  "abstract": "  We study the symmetry of the coupling between surface acoustic waves and\nferromagnetic resonance in a thin magnetic film of CoFeB deposited on top of a\npiezoelectric Z-cut LiNbO3 substrate. We vary the orientation of the applied\nmagnetic field with respect to the wavevector of the surface acoustic wave.\nExperiments indicate an unexpected 2-fold symmetry of the absorption of the SAW\nenergy by the magnetic film. We discuss whether this symmetry can arise from\nthe magnetoelastic torque of the longitudinal strain and the magnetic\nsusceptibility of ferromagnetic resonance. We find that one origin of the\n2-fold symmetry can be the weak in-plane uniaxial anisotropy present within the\nmagnetic film. This phenomena adds to the previously identified other source of\n2-fold symmetry but shall persist for ultrathin films when the dipolar\ninteractions cease to contribute to the anisotropy of the slope of the spin\nwave dispersion relation.\n",
