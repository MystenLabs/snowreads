Simple-sub is an alternative inference algorithm which can be\nimplemented efficiently and is easier to understand. MLsub supports explicitly\ntyped records which are not extensible. Here we extend Simple-sub with\nextensible records, meaning that we can add new fields to a previously defined\nrecord. For this we add row variables to our type language and extend the type\nconstraint solving method of our type inference algorithm accordingly, keeping\nthe decidability of type inference.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4iijm4zEi7CS1XO8SVQkgSnDFycsl-xuiJWE4iFkT6M","pdfSize":"99308"}
