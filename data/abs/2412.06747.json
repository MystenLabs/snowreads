The theory is valid when velocity\ngradients are small compared to the inverse size of the object. Working within\nthe EFT eliminates the need to solve a boundary value problem by turning all\ninteractions between the fluid and the object into a source term in the action.\nWe use the EFT to derive the relativistic equations of motion for a compact\nobject immersed in a viscous fluid in a curved background.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"bj0vew7WlS43OKN3ByFOw1dvESE3i50fjcGrtDzQRhY","pdfSize":"597291"}
