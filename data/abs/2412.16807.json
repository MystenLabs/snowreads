This influence extends to various aspects of\nlife, notably food consumption and selection. In our study, we employed various\nmodels to extract different attributes from the environmental images.\nSpecifically, we identify five key attributes and employ an ensemble model\nIMVB7 based on five distinct models for some of their detection resulted 0.85\nmark. In addition, we conducted surveys to discern patterns in food preferences\nin response to visual stimuli. Leveraging the insights gleaned from these\nsurveys, we formulate recommendations using decision tree for dishes based on\nthe amalgamation of identified attributes resulted IMVB7t 0.96 mark. This study\nserves as a foundational step, paving the way for further exploration of this\ninterdisciplinary domain.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"J5MkBoJXc5oDCZGS-iBJEF3WKPVNlG7wea9UwXsnWHg","pdfSize":"584740"}
