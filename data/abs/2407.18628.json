Here we analyze the same problem, but in constant curvature spaces\nalong the examples of curved Kepler-Coulomb and Harmonic Oscillator systems. We\nalso show how this procedure can also be directly extended to the curved\nSmorodinsky-Winternitz (SW) and Evans systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Z1F2KoFlZiQ2V6IpfnX0rmX_BttLIZ7GeH4dfHS1cG0","pdfSize":"484446"}
