In this study, we investigated the diffusion properties of\nhydrogen isotopes at the {\\alpha}-Al2O3(0001)/{\\alpha}-Cr2O3(0001) interfaces\nusing first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. In the\n{\\alpha}-Al2O3 region near the interfaces, O-H covalent bonds, which are not\nobserved in the bulk {\\alpha}-Al2O3, are formed, and hydrogen isotopes become\nstable. Such chemical bonds induced by the interfaces are the origin of\nhydrogen isotope trapping and result in a larger diffusion barrier than in the\n{\\alpha}-Al2O3 and the {\\alpha}-Cr2O3. It was also found that the suppression\nof hydrogen isotope diffusion does not occur at the interface site but at sites\nadjacent to the interfaces. In addition, the interface enhances the oxygen\nvacancies, which may also suppress hydrogen isotope permeation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"CSA20PpHrAXo5Cy2z4G8mtZSq97SzQJnDfqv5uJb2a4","pdfSize":"1351945"}
