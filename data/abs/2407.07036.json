The title reflects the fact that generalized estimators provide\nmore than simply another method to find point estimators, and that the methods\nto assess generalized estimators differ from those for point estimators. By\ngeneralized estimation we mean the use of generalized estimators together with\nan extended definition of information to assess their inferential properties.\nWe show that Fisher information provides an upper bound for the information\nutilized by an estimator and that the score attains this bound.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"r8-tK0FsfzxAmUa7EMu0xUlN0_M14_jopTnXrmx_OBs","pdfSize":"1141286"}
