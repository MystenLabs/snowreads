While recent studies in image generation have advanced the\nfield, they often struggle with the dual challenges of coherent image\ntransformation and context preservation. In response, our work introduces\nprompt augmentation, a method amplifying a single input prompt into several\ntarget prompts, strengthening textual context and enabling localised image\nediting. Specifically, we use the augmented prompts to delineate the intended\nmanipulation area. We propose a Contrastive Loss tailored to driving effective\nimage editing by displacing edited areas and drawing preserved regions closer.\nAcknowledging the continuous nature of image manipulations, we further refine\nour approach by incorporating the similarity concept, creating a Soft\nContrastive Loss. The new losses are incorporated to the diffusion model,\ndemonstrating improved or competitive image editing results on public datasets\nand generated images over state-of-the-art approaches.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"HBld8EUZBVEItCJUrI54WiUlOe3Kioem0MRDTuFDnec","pdfSize":"18005280"}
