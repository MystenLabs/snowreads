As a result, we\nobtain the equality \\begin{align} \\frac{ \\Delta_G ( h ) }{ \\Delta_{ G / N } ( h\nN ) } = \\frac{ \\Delta_H ( h ) }{ \\Delta_{ H / N } ( h N ) } \\end{align} on the\nmodular functions for any closed subgroups $ N $ and $ H $ of a locally compact\ngroup $ G $ with $ N \\lhd G $ and $ N \\subset H \\subset G $ and any $ h \\in H\n$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ur3M0d0hJFflh5AHGfBfdeH0XFa_AWHIjk5DiVEQ__U","pdfSize":"128191"}
