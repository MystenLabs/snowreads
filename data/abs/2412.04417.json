  "abstract": "  We discuss how to understand the asymptotic resurgence number of a pair of\ngraded families of ideals from combinatorial data of their associated convex\nbodies. When the families consist of monomial ideals, the convex bodies being\nconsidered are the Newton-Okounkov bodies of the families. When ideals in the\nsecond family are classical invariant ideals, for instance, determinantal\nideals or ideals of Pfaffians, these convex bodies are constructed from the\nassociated Rees packages.\n",
