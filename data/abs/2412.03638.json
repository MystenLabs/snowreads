We illustrate the mechanism in the context of a solvable model\non a Lieb lattice in which doped electrons have 1D mobility. Such 1D motion is\nshown to induce only multi-spin ring exchanges of even parity, which mediate\nferromagnetism and result in a unique half-metallic ground state. In contrast\nto the Nagaoka mechanism of ferromagnetism, this result pertains to any doped\nelectron density in the {\\it thermodynamic} limit. We explore various\nmicroscopic routes to such (approximate) 1D dynamics, highlighting two\nexamples: doped holes in the strong-coupling limit of the Emery model and\nvacancies in a two-dimensional Wigner crystal. Finally, we demonstrate an\nintriguing exact equivalence between the bosonic and fermionic versions of\nthese models, which implies a novel mechanism for the conjectured Bose metallic\nphase.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"miUKNgPYuN4ilbKd-tv_9OIGfJwhNv1zrnL1_sE6sFw","pdfSize":"2378694"}
