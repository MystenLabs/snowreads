Interestingly, these problems can be equivalently\nformulated as classical graph problems on induced subgraphs of powers of\npartially-defined hypercubes.\n  In this paper, we follow up on this recent direction by investigating the\nIndependent Set problem on this graph class, which has been studied in the data\nscience setting under the name Diversity. We obtain a comprehensive picture of\nthe problem's parameterized complexity and establish its fixed-parameter\ntractability w.r.t. the solution size plus the power of the hypercube.\n  Given that several such FO-definable problems have been shown to be\nfixed-parameter tractable on the considered graph class, one may ask whether\nfixed-parameter tractability could be extended to capture all FO-definable\nproblems. We answer this question in the negative by showing that FO model\nchecking on induced subgraphs of hypercubes is as difficult as FO model\nchecking on general graphs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xmLWO3tcnqwTSQWGybqZl_Y94GvnrIpySnwj-4hTRZk","pdfSize":"580428","objectId":"0x2f3709381570723a92b38bffa0229d60b729cfed302ce07cc7e77c29d52a9eef","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
