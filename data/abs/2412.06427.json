Recent studies have shown that complex\npropagation in scattering media can be harnessed to manipulate broadband light\nwave packets in space-time for focusing, imaging, and computing applications.\nInterestingly, while many proposed methodologies operate on intensity-based\nassessment of scattered fields, often in the spectral domain, from a pure\ntransmission-function perspective, scattering operates as a linear field-level\ncombinatory process, i.e., the superposition of transformation of unit\nexcitations. As a result, we recently demonstrated that gaining experimental\naccess to instantaneous scattered fields, as available through time-domain\nspectroscopy in the terahertz spectral range, in conjunction with sparse light\nexcitation typical of ghost imaging, provides a key advantage in enabling the\nfunctionalisation of scattering, exposing a novel modelling paradigm. In this\npaper, we provide experimental proof of reconstructing 1-dimensional object\nfeatures through a scattering medium using a fully broadband time-domain\nterahertz approach.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CK0KjcxTWv85nvnz-t1QttTGciUuKfhQaz5eRjz9NAw","pdfSize":"5025517"}
