To study bounds on the\n$U(1)_X$ gauge coupling $(g_X)$ and new gauge boson mass $(M_{Z^\\prime})$, from\nDM-electron scattering, we consider several direct search experiments like\nCDMS, DAMIC, SENSEI, PandaX-II, DarkSide-50 and XENON1T-S2 for different\n$U(1)_X$ charges. In this set-up we consider DM production via freeze-in both\nin radiation dominated and modified cosmological background to project\nsensitivities on $g_X-M_{Z^\\prime}$ plane satisfying observed relic abundance.\nDM-electron scattering could provide comparable, or even stronger bounds than\nthose obtained from the electron/ muon $(g-2)$, low energy scattering and\nintensity frontier experiments within 0.01 GeV $\\lesssim M_{Z^\\prime} \\lesssim$\n0.1 GeV. Constrains from freeze-in could provide stronger sensitivities for\n$M_{Z^\\prime}\\gtrsim \\mathcal{O}(1)$ GeV, however, these limits are comparable\nto those obtained from LHCb, LEP experiments for $\\mathcal{O}(10)$ GeV\n$\\lesssim M_{Z^\\prime} \\lesssim 150$ GeV. In future, electron-muon scattering\n(MUonE), proton (FASER, DUNE) and electron/positron (ILC) beam dump experiments\ncould probe these parameters.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"W44KAonN_-Fie-rezEl5NA27ATUAZKxrjVf_UeYTNY8","pdfSize":"4636051"}
