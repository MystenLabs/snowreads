  "abstract": "  We study the injectivity of normed ideals of weighted holomorphic mappings.\nTo be more precise, the concept of injective hull of normed weighted\nholomorphic ideals is introduced and characterized in terms of a domination\nproperty. The injective hulls of those ideals -- generated by the procedures of\ncomposition and dual -- are described and these descriptions are applied to\nsome examples of such ideals. A characterization of the closed injective hull\nof an operator ideal in terms of an Ehrling-type inequality -- due to Jarchow\nand Pelczy\\'nski -- is established for weighted holomorphic mappings.\n",
