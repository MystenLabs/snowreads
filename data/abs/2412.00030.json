  "abstract": "  We propose a discrete time formulation of the semi-martingale optimal\ntransport problem based on multi-marginal entropic transport. This approach\noffers a new way to formulate and solve numerically the calibration problem\nproposed by [17], using a multi-marginal extension of Sinkhorn algorithm as in\n[6, 10, 7]. When the time step goes to zero we recover, as detailed in the\ncompanion paper [8], a continuous semi-martingale process, solution to a\nsemi-martingale optimal transport problem, with a cost function involving the\nso-called 'specific entropy' , introduced in [13], see also [12] and [2].\n",
