To this end,\nresearchers have developed wearable devices that can record audio at\nfrequencies as low as 1250 Hz to mitigate the automatic extraction of the\nverbal content of speech that may contain private details. This paper\ninvestigates the validity of this hypothesis, examining the degree to which\nlow-frequency speech ensures verbal privacy. It includes simulating a potential\nprivacy attack in various noise environments. Further, it explores the\ntrade-off between the performance of voice activity detection, which is\nfundamental for understanding social behavior, and privacy-preservation. The\nevaluation incorporates subjective human intelligibility and automatic speech\nrecognition performance, comprehensively analyzing the delicate balance between\neffective social behavior analysis and preserving verbal privacy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rAcpLjS8ieRmlpgbELg6ookq62NmKTulbmVt6jG19DM","pdfSize":"513586","objectId":"0x35bcbcf4c827774689574cdc09984619ceb7c8c66cd733244a44d9fa7cfd565c","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
