Hindman proved that for every\nfinite coloring of $\\mathbb{N}$, there exists a color that contains both\nadditive and multiplicative $IP$ sets. Later, in $1993$, V. Bergelson and N.\nHindman found an elementary proof. In this article, we prove that the partial\nproduct of these two $IP$ sets also lies in the same color. As an immediate\nconsequence, we have the equation $a+b=c\\cdot d$ partition regular. This was a\nconjecture of P. Csikv\\'{a}ri, K. Gyarmati, and A. S\\'{a}rk\\\"{o}zy, which was\nsolved by V. Bergelson and N. Hindman independently. In this article, we\nseparately give a very short proof of this conjecture. Then we extend our\ntechniques to deduce systems of nonlinear equations that are partition regular.\nWe prove that a relatively weak version of the nonlinear Rado systems is\npartition regular.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rASmB4SsgJs9cSUuJxZf6VOK6xo3EbvISgR1DyNm3TE","pdfSize":"223961"}
