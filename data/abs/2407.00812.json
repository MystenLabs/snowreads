Along other results, we prove the\nfinite termination of generic algorithms under the KL property with lower\nexponents. Specifications are given to convergence rates of some particular\nalgorithms including inexact reduced gradient methods and the boosted algorithm\nin DC programming. It revealed, e.g., that the lower exponent KL property in\nthe DC framework is incompatible with the gradient Lipschitz continuity for the\nplus function around a local minimizer. On the other hand, we show that the\nabove inconsistency observation may fail if the Lipschitz continuity is\nreplaced by merely the gradient continuity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"aspq01ut6UoiHLFvjqCHvbZJ9ZcUGebHTGjfUttMdsY","pdfSize":"243362"}
