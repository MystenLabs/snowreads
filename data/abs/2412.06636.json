To address this problem, we introduce Neo-FREE: a control\narchitecture inspired by the Thousand Brains Theory and Free Energy Principle\nfrom cognitive sciences. In accordance with the neocortical (Neo) processes\npostulated by the Thousand Brains Theory, Neo-FREE consists of functional units\nreturning control primitives. These are linearly combined by a gating mechanism\nthat minimizes the variational free energy (FREE). The problem of finding the\noptimal primitives' weights is then recast as a finite-horizon optimal control\nproblem, which is convex even when the cost is not and the environment is\nnonlinear, stochastic, non-stationary. The results yield an algorithm for\nprimitives composition and the effectiveness of Neo-FREE is illustrated via\nin-silico and hardware experiments on an application involving robot navigation\nin an environment with obstacles.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computer Science/Robotics","Computer Science/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"FnI7aVK2Gyxvc5UezO9535FYDwiMSh0IKzhsvwllx0A","pdfSize":"834025"}
