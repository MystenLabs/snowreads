The associated four-dimensional phase space\nis identified with the similitude group SIM(2), representing transformations of\nthe plane composed of translations, rotations, and dilations. Near the\npunctured point, we observe that the topology influencing quantum fluctuations\ngives rise to an affine vector potential, which can be interpreted as the\nAharonov-Bohm (AB) gauge potential generated by an infinite coil. This finding\nsuggests that the AB effect originates from the topology enforced by the\nimpenetrable coil, rather than from a classical gauge potential. Our results\noffer a novel perspective on the AB effect, emphasizing the fundamental role of\ntopology in quantum mechanics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"44GQiy5xdNVrHkEIYouAjIfP9TJYEm-9gPyFkO2OTAQ","pdfSize":"249610"}
