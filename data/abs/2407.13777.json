Real-time MPPE on mobile devices with\nlow-performance computing is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a\nlightweight neural network, DIR-BHRNet, for real-time MPPE on smartphones. In\nDIR-BHRNet, we design a novel lightweight convolutional module, Dense Inverted\nResidual (DIR), to improve accuracy by adding a depthwise convolution and a\nshortcut connection into the well-known Inverted Residual, and a novel\nefficient neural network structure, Balanced HRNet (BHRNet), to reduce\ncomputational costs by reconfiguring the proper number of convolutional blocks\non each branch. We evaluate DIR-BHRNet on the well-known COCO and CrowdPose\ndatasets. The results show that DIR-BHRNet outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods in terms of accuracy with a real-time computational cost. Finally, we\nimplement the DIR-BHRNet on the current mainstream Android smartphones, which\nperform more than 10 FPS. The free-used executable file (Android 10), source\ncode, and a video description of this work are publicly available on the page 1\nto facilitate the development of real-time MPPE on smartphones.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"L8hXSlLwWlhGkvnVNO5wEEtrAhkeQA7PHlBaWLCHUT8","pdfSize":"13985270"}
