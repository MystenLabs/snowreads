Despite the recent\nfocus on dynamic analysis of their transaction histories in both industry and\nacademia, no open-source tool currently offers comprehensive tracking of\ncomplete transaction information to extract user-desired data such as\ninvariant-related data. This paper introduces OpenTracer, designed to address\nthis gap. OpenTracer guarantees comprehensive tracking of every execution step,\nproviding complete transaction information. OpenTracer has been employed to\nanalyze 350,800 Ethereum transactions, successfully inferring 23 different\ntypes of invariant from predefined templates. The tool is fully open-sourced,\nserving as a valuable resource for developers and researchers aiming to study\ntransaction behaviors or extract and validate new invariants from transaction\ntraces.
