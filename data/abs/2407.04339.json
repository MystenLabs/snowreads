An approximated black hole\nsolution is obtained up to the third order of perturbation coefficient. A\nthermodynamic investigation in canonical ensemble shows that the behavior of a\nVan der Waals fluid is not seen in this model. Nevertheless, the study of\nthermodynamic potentials and other related quantities suggests that the\nthermodynamic phase transitions of the first and second types can occur in this\nmodel. The forms of the phase transitions are more similar to the Hawking-Page\nphase transitions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iFBEI6zv4-PmbR_wBBypus39MipHFz2IvebFwOvP8MY","pdfSize":"2085157"}
