  "abstract": "  Social media constitutes a rich and influential source of information for\nqualitative researchers. Although computational techniques like topic modelling\nassist with managing the volume and diversity of social media content,\nqualitative researcher's lack of programming expertise creates a significant\nbarrier to their adoption. In this paper we explore how BERTopic, an advanced\nLarge Language Model (LLM)-based topic modelling technique, can support\nqualitative data analysis of social media. We conducted interviews and hands-on\nevaluations in which qualitative researchers compared topics from three\nmodelling techniques: LDA, NMF, and BERTopic. BERTopic was favoured by 8 of 12\nparticipants for its ability to provide detailed, coherent clusters for deeper\nunderstanding and actionable insights. Participants also prioritised topic\nrelevance, logical organisation, and the capacity to reveal unexpected\nrelationships within the data. Our findings underscore the potential of\nLLM-based techniques for supporting qualitative analysis.\n",
