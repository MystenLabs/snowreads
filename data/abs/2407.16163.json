As an application, in the second part, we construct example of\nsmooth surface of degree $d\\geq 19$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ whose complements is\nhyperbolically embedded in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. This improves the previous\nconstruction of Shirosaki where the degree bound $d=31$ was gave. In the last\npart, for a Fermat-Waring type hypersurface $D$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ defined by\nthe homogeneous polynomial \\[ \\sum_{i=1}^m h_i^d, \\] where $m,n,d$ are positive\nintegers with $m\\geq 3n-1$ and $d\\geq m^2-m+1$, where $h_i$ are homogeneous\ngeneric linear forms on $\\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$, for a nonconstant holomorphic\nfunction $f\\colon\\mathbb{C}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{CP}^n$ whose image is not\ncontained in the support of $D$, we establish a Second Main Theorem type\nestimate: \\[ \\big(d-m(m-1)\\big)\\,T_f(r)\\leq N_f^{[m-1]}(r,D)+S_f(r). \\] This\nquantifies the hyperbolicity result due to Shiffman-Zaidenberg and Siu-Yeung.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"38jEdGqc27nS3NxxvbnA5iipSYMfNJaHDMormmX_chI","pdfSize":"244792"}
