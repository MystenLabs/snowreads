We deduce closed-form expressions\nfor traces of Hecke operators corresponding to primes of degree 1 and provide\nalgorithms for primes of higher degree. We improve the Ramanujan bound and\ndeduce the decomposition of cusp forms of level $\\Gamma_0(T)$ into oldforms and\nnewforms, as conjectured by Bandini-Valentino, under the hypothesis that each\nHecke eigenvalue has multiplicity less than $p$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8M9fpqgZtnfE9RzMZzODVWm05J_10cFY3FIl_y-LWCk","pdfSize":"706775"}
