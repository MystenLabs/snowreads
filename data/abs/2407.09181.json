To train\nmodels for this task, the Multi-Session Chat dataset was translated into\nRussian using multiple translation models, resulting in improved data quality.\nA metric based on the F-score concept is presented to evaluate the\neffectiveness of the extraction models. The metric uses a trained classifier to\nidentify the dialogue participant to whom the persona belongs. Experiments were\nconducted on MBart, FRED-T5, Starling-7B, which is based on the Mistral, and\nEncoder2Encoder models. The results demonstrated that all models exhibited an\ninsufficient level of recall in the persona extraction task. The incorporation\nof the NCE Loss improved the model's precision at the expense of its recall.\nFurthermore, increasing the model's size led to enhanced extraction of\npersonas.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BJ6zmWKBlciyXS6Q7pgdL0xi5Hn1B1ZA5AyMvJxl1-w","pdfSize":"447006"}
