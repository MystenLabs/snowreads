However, there is limited research examining the behavior of these\nDRL algorithms. This paper aims to investigate their tendencies towards holding\nor trading financial assets as well as purchase diversity. By analyzing their\ntrading behaviors, we provide insights into the decision-making processes of\nDRL models in finance applications. Our findings reveal that each DRL algorithm\nexhibits unique trading patterns and strategies, with A2C emerging as the top\nperformer in terms of cumulative rewards. While PPO and SAC engage in\nsignificant trades with a limited number of stocks, DDPG and TD3 adopt a more\nbalanced approach. Furthermore, SAC and PPO tend to hold positions for shorter\ndurations, whereas DDPG, A2C, and TD3 display a propensity to remain stationary\nfor extended periods.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Trading and Market Microstructure","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"V5MIKg0spdrBYraDfuiIn-17XdmUp2ipel87YB-bRAg","pdfSize":"718356"}
