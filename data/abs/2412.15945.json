Our motivation comes from high doping levels achieved\nin graphene and Bernal bilayer graphene by interacalation. We present phase\ndiagrams in doping and temperature for a moderate Hubbard interaction. The\nmagnetic states we find are classified systematically based on the dominant\nFourier components of their spin patterns, their average magnetization and spin\nincommensurabilities. The dominant spin patterns are N\\'eel order and various\ntypes of stripes. Around Van Hove filling, we resolve the competition between\nstripe and chiral spin density waves in the symmetry-broken regime. We also\ninvestigate the effect of an applied external displacement field on the spin\npatterns of BBG.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qeuG1lHIkedxpiuNOVx-1Ck7O7cldExKiERMJBtc6h8","pdfSize":"4236783"}
