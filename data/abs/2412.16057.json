We\nanalyse in detail four-dimensional Kerr black hole and show that in the\nnear-extremal limit a branch of long-lived modes arises. We prove that the\ncontribution of these modes accounts for a $(s-1/2)\\log T_{\\text{Hawking}}$\ncorrection to the entropy for massless particles of spin $s=1,2$. We show that\nin the full calculation performed in the exact Kerr background the leading\ncontribution actually is sourced by the near-horizon region only, and as such\nhas a universal validity for any asymptotic behavior at infinity.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kM4k4l4S7ZLGdFPwt1S02sSfaqB2t8n8ufGcB12-nPE","pdfSize":"293993"}
