Theoretical and phenomenological\naspects of the density matrix of one-point correlators are discussed in the\ncontext of the states produced by a chiral current, as in the decay of a\npolarized electroweak boson. Densities of some non-conserved charges such as\nenergy with arbitrary non-negative powers, despite their incalculability, are\nshown to obey an infinite set of consistency constraints. QCD is observed to\nlive near a kink in the allowed parameter space of one-point correlators.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8G6Xse70WUVS_ulTO9q2ygMxxvcTGKsgRbmiWSDGlBg","pdfSize":"716302"}
