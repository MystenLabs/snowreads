The relative frequency density of this\nsample converges to a well-defined function, prompting us to explore its\ndistribution. Through rigorous mathematical proof, we demonstrate that the\nprobability density function follows a Cauchy distribution. Additionally, a new\nmethod to generate a uniform distribution is proposed. To further confirm our\nfindings, we employed statistical tests, including the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test\nand Anderson-Darling test, which showed high p-values. Furthermore, we show\nthat the distribution of the distance between two successive outputs can be\nobtained through a transformation method applied to the Cauchy distribution.\n","subjects":["Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability","Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Lx-7uDzsfjidvd_rmpR80gkE-1k_1luIB1Vo7mcrXYc","pdfSize":"774572"}
