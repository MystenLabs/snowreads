By selecting host materials with\nsuitable, controllable properties, we introduce new parameters that can be used\nto tailor the Er3+ emission spectrum. PbTiO3 is a well-studied ferroelectric\nmaterial with known methods of engineering different domain configurations\nthrough epitaxial strain. By distorting the structure of Er3+-doped PbTiO3 thin\nfilms, we can manipulate the crystal fields around the Er3+ dopant. This is\nresolved through changes in the Er3+ resonant fluorescence spectra, tying the\noptical properties of the defect directly to the domain configurations of the\nferroelectic matrix. Additionally, we are able to resolve a second set of peaks\nfor films with in-plane ferroelectric polarization. We hypothesize these\nresults to be due to either the Er3+ substituting different sites of the PbTiO3\ncrystal, differences in charges between the Er3+ dopant and the original\nsubstituent ion, or selection rules. Systematically studying the relationship\nbetween the Er3+ emission and the epitaxial strain of the ferroelectric matrix\nlays the pathway for future optical studies of spin manipulation by altering\nferroelectric order parameters\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"i_eNdU1X-dK_r6HtUUS07JtgfaV_xuE6dSpx4-lBbQo","pdfSize":"2575407"}
