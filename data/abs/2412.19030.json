The obtained\nsignatures satisfy current phenomenological bounds reported by PLANCK and\nBICEP3. Furthermore, two of the model solutions $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$ seem\nto favor a much lower value for the tensor-to-scalar ratio\n$0.0005<r_{\\sigma_1}<0.0015$ and $r_{\\sigma_2}<0.00015$ than the current\nreported experimental bounds. The results we obtained are quantitatively\nsimilar to those presented in previous studies for $R^3$ models.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PgjyA0ZqgrOFEdcRRfy2zGofBlmJbP3016BOqQqqlTY","pdfSize":"691494"}
