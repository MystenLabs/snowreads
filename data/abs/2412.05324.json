For example,\ncomputing the zeros of a given map, or the reduction of some cost function\nduring an optimization process are such situations. In this note, we discuss\nthe existence of a curve $t\\mapsto x(t)$ in the domain of the nonlinear map\n$\\mathcal{F}$ leading from some initial value $x_0$ to a value $u$ such that we\nare able to control the residual $\\mathcal{F}(x(t))$ based on the value\n$\\mathcal{F}(x_0)$. More precisely, we slightly extend an existing result from\nJ.W. Neuberger by proving the existence of such a curve, assuming that the\ndirectional derivative of $\\mathcal{F}$ can be represented by $x \\mapsto\n\\mathcal{A}(x)\\mathcal{F}(x_0)$, where $\\mathcal{A}$ is a suitable defined\noperator. The presented approach covers, in case of $\\mathcal{A}(x) =\n-\\mathsf{Id}$, some well known results from the theory of so-called continuous\nNewton methods. Moreover, based on the presented results, we discover an\napproximate inverse function result.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gt4Tu0eaS5b1qiVPUFwqCG1mVrKZzRdBilTgxdAs-0w","pdfSize":"163965"}
