  "abstract": "  A recent development in extreme value modeling uses the geometry of the\ndataset to perform inference on the multivariate tail. A key quantity in this\ninference is the gauge function, whose values define this geometry. Methodology\nproposed to date for capturing the gauge function either lacks flexibility due\nto parametric specifications, or relies on complex neural network\nspecifications in dimensions greater than three. We propose a semiparametric\ngauge function that is piecewise-linear, making it simple to interpret and\nprovides a good approximation for the true underlying gauge function. This\nlinearity also makes optimization tasks computationally inexpensive. The\npiecewise-linear gauge function can be used to define both a radial and an\nangular model, allowing for the joint fitting of extremal pseudo-polar\ncoordinates, a key aspect of this geometric framework. We further expand the\ntoolkit for geometric extremal modeling through the estimation of high radial\nquantiles at given angular values via kernel density estimation. We apply the\nnew methodology to air pollution data, which exhibits a complex extremal\ndependence structure.\n",
