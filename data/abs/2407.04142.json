The key approach is to incorporate the\nlatent individual effects, which influence the structured mediators, as\nunobserved confounders in the outcome model, thereby potentially debiasing the\nmediation effects. We develop BAyesian Structured Mediation analysis with\nUnobserved confounders (BASMU) framework, and establish its model\nidentifiability conditions. Theoretical analysis is conducted on the asymptotic\nbias of the Natural Indirect Effect (NIE) and the Natural Direct Effect (NDE)\nwhen the unobserved confounders are omitted in mediation analysis. For BASMU,\nwe propose a two-stage estimation algorithm to mitigate the impact of these\nunobserved confounders on estimating the mediation effect. Extensive\nsimulations demonstrate that BASMU substantially reduces the bias in various\nscenarios. We apply BASMU to the analysis of fMRI data in the Adolescent Brain\nCognitive Development (ABCD) study, focusing on four brain regions previously\nreported to exhibit meaningful mediation effects. Compared with the existing\nimage mediation analysis method, BASMU identifies two to four times more voxels\nthat have significant mediation effects, with the NIE increased by 41%, and the\nNDE decreased by 26%.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"EOhd6F6qSu4Y8UUwRSURJF-P7NAxH0dHK5JQMqXTL3s","pdfSize":"1148861"}
