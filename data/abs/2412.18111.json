  "abstract": "  Tabular data, which accounts for over 80% of enterprise data assets, is vital\nin various fields. With growing concerns about privacy protection and\ndata-sharing restrictions, generating high-quality synthetic tabular data has\nbecome essential. Recent advancements show that large language models (LLMs)\ncan effectively gener-ate realistic tabular data by leveraging semantic\ninformation and overcoming the challenges of high-dimensional data that arise\nfrom one-hot encoding. However, current methods do not fully utilize the rich\ninformation available in tables. To address this, we introduce AI Generative\nTable (AIGT) based on prompt enhancement, a novel approach that utilizes meta\ndata information, such as table descriptions and schemas, as prompts to\ngenerate ultra-high quality synthetic data. To overcome the token limit\nconstraints of LLMs, we propose long-token partitioning algorithms that enable\nAIGT to model tables of any scale. AIGT achieves state-of-the-art performance\non 14 out of 20 public datasets and two real industry datasets within the\nAlipay risk control system.\n",
