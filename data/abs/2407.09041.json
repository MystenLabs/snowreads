We perform accurate launch power and Raman pump\noptimization. We show a potential 4x throughput increase over legacy C-band\nsystems in 1000 km links, using moderate S-only Raman amplification. We\nsimultaneously achieve extra-flat GSNR, within +/-0.5 dB across the whole C+L+S\nspectrum.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"al3tQUhjQmbwSoQVZwWPWp_6PuRMxhiItbqyxmHzjpw","pdfSize":"1086381"}
