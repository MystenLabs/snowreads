About a decade ago, there were only a handful of platform\ndriven companies operating on the market. Zipcar, BlaBlaCar and Couchsurfing\namong them. Then Airbnb and Uber revolutionized the transportation and\nhospitality industries with a presence in virtually every major city. Access\nover ownership is the paradigm shift from the traditional business model that\ngrants individuals the use of products or services without the necessity of\nbuying them. Digital platforms, data and algorithm-driven companies as well as\ndecentralized blockchain technologies have tremendous potential. But they are\nalso changing the rules of the game. One of such technologies challenging the\nlegal system are AI systems that will also reshape the current legal framework\nconcerning the liability of operators, users and manufacturers. Therefore, this\nintroductory chapter deals with explaining and describing the legal issues of\nsome of these disruptive technologies. The chapter argues for a more\nforward-thinking and flexible regulatory structure.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ectb9ihG8Vtoa4CNm2m404qFfB-2E4fra-xz_89p0Wg","pdfSize":"257627"}
