This was evident in the recent COVID-19 pandemic. However, not\nall individuals are affected by shock events in the same way. Among other\nfactors, the consequences can vary depending on the wealth class. In our\npresented work, the approach typical of kinetic theory is used to analyze the\ndynamics of a closed-market society exposed to various types of shock events.\nTo achieve this, we introduce non-conservative equations, incorporating\nproliferative and destructive binary interactions as well as external actions.\nSpecifically, the latter term reproduces the shock events, and to accomplish\nthis, we introduce an appropriate external force field into the kinetic\nframework, modeled using Gaussian functions. Several numerical simulations\nexploring different scenarios are presented to illustrate the behavior of the\nsolution predicted by the model and to gain some insights when complex\nsituations are investigated.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"EQ8XHzXPAewlopNentchww9qqUbIgm_VcKAaQAXH-Bw","pdfSize":"1714501"}
