Types in homotopy type theory with\ntheir higher identity types form weak omega-groupoids, so they are in\nparticular weak omega-categories. In this article, we show that this principle\nmakes homotopy type theory into a model of CaTT, by defining a translation\nprinciple that interprets an operation on the cell of an omega-category as an\noperation on higher identity types. We then illustrate how this translation\nallows to leverage several mechanisation principles that are available in CaTT,\nto reduce the proof effort required to derive results about the structure of\nidentity types, such as the existence of an Eckmann-Hilton cell.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Logic in Computer Science","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pZfEBJ8vYpbDaT5eeJHPUoe96mYbWtj5J4znA2KZgzE","pdfSize":"311209"}
