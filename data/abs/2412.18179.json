This system exhibits a\nplethora of phases, with the particular spin-valley order parameters chosen by\nthe system depending sensitively on the short-range anisotropic couplings, the\nZeeman field, and the sublattice symmetry breaking field. A subset of order\nparameters related to lattice symmetry-breaking have been observed by scanning\ntunneling microscopy. However, other order parameters, particularly those which\nsuperpose spin and valley, are more elusive, making it difficult to pin down\nthe nature of the phase. We propose a solution this problem by examining two\ntypes of experimentally measurable quantities; transport gaps and collective\nmode dispersions. We find that the variation of the transport gap with the\nZeeman and sublattice symmetry breaking fields, in conjunction with the number\nof Larmor and gapless modes, provides a unique signature for each theoretically\npossible phase.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WDZnHuSvpanaOIyQjEOwoiVWYLidHFEMp4EgLqLA2CQ","pdfSize":"3760949"}
