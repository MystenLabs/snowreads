This paper considers the\nquestion of its dimensionality in biological information as the helical coil\ngoes through recursive coiling as happens to DNA and RNA molecules in\nchromatin. It has been shown that the dimensionality of coiled coils is\nvirtually equal to e. Of the three forms of DNA, the dimensionality of the\nB-form is nearest to the optimal value and this might be the reason why it is\nmost common.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YkzUGVcyFcxaqSLHyZXxT838s_MmtxJ9rMZGLFuGiF4","pdfSize":"558691"}
