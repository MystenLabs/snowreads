A common and effective solution is to generate synthetic data that\nsimulates realistic interactions. However, although various methods have been\nproposed, the existing literature still lacks generators that are fully\nadaptable and allow easy manipulation of the underlying data distributions and\nstructural properties. To address this issue, the present work introduces\nGenRec, a novel framework for generating synthetic user-item interactions that\nexhibit realistic and well-known properties observed in recommendation\nscenarios. The framework is based on a stochastic generative process based on\nlatent factor modeling. Here, the latent factors can be exploited to yield\nlong-tailed preference distributions, and at the same time they characterize\nsubpopulations of users and topic-based item clusters. Notably, the proposed\nframework is highly flexible and offers a wide range of hyper-parameters for\ncustomizing the generation of user-item interactions.
