Synthetic relationships are defined as \"continuing\nassociations between humans and AI tools that interact with one another wherein\nthe AI tool(s) influence(s) humans' thoughts, feelings, and/or actions.\"\n(Starke et al., 2024). These relationships can potentially improve health,\neducation, and the workplace, but they also bring the risk of subtle\nmanipulation and privacy and autonomy concerns. To harness the opportunities of\nsynthetic relationships and mitigate their risks, we outline a methodological\napproach that complements existing findings. We propose longitudinal research\ndesigns with self-assembled AI agents that enable the integration of detailed\nbehavioural and self-reported data.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VAJelFn6heuNUc7l-lbWkgk-utF50s527TvtfD082tc","pdfSize":"346575"}
