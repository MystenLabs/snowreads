First-order optimality conditions for the resulting finite-horizon\noptimal control problems are derived. The analysis allows for the incorporation\nof convex control constraints and sparse regularization. Then, to mitigate the\ncomputational burden of the MPC procedure, we employ Galerkin reduced-order\nmodeling (ROM) techniques to obtain a low-dimensional surrogate for the\nstate-adjoint systems. We derive recursive a-posteriori estimates for the ROM\nfeedback law and the ROM-MPC closed-loop state and show that the ROM-MPC\ntrajectory evolves within a neighborhood of the true MPC trajectory, whose size\ncan be explicitly computed and is controlled by the quality of the ROM. Such\nestimates are then used to formulate two ROM-MPC algorithms with closed-loop\ncertification.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Nf4I3PpN90WCxy1ZTe3s-cUYR0QReWGs1MfcMXCJddM","pdfSize":"1160662"}
