CTNCF represents a significant advancement over the traditional\nNeural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) model by seamlessly integrating\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer layers. This sophisticated\nintegration enables the model to adeptly capture and understand complex\ninteraction patterns inherent in recommendation systems. Specifically, CNNs are\nemployed to extract local features from user and item embeddings, allowing the\nmodel to capture intricate spatial dependencies within the data. Furthermore,\nthe utilization of Transformer layers enables the model to capture long-range\ndependencies and interactions among user and item features, thereby enhancing\nits ability to understand the underlying relationships in the data. To validate\nthe effectiveness of our proposed CTNCF framework, we conduct extensive\nexperiments on two real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that CTNCF\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting its\nefficacy in improving recommendation system performance.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"t6LQaCYk28DKhKm4ZvcZ_LUoSkXgC4UcF693Il5XwWk","pdfSize":"702756"}
