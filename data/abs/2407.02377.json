The approximation rate can be arbitrarily high,\nproportional to the degree of the interpolation functions, tempered only by\nnumerical instability. Moreover, the mechanical energy of the system is\nconserved. Consequently, all significant drawbacks of existing algorithms, such\nas the limitations imposed by the Dahlqvist Barrier theorem and the need for\nintroduction of numerical damping, have been overcome.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"H15XX27rdQqCBRBGyXYs3OTRgn3YXIDBn4_5APoOTHI","pdfSize":"2169965","objectId":"0x95c205d2c26e215d584a5acee5fdc77f2ee5926024383321f3f2388b2e457d19","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
