However, two very different\nhistories of water on Venus have been proposed: one where Venus had a temperate\nclimate for billions of years, with surface liquid water, and the other where a\nhot early Venus was never able to condense surface liquid water. Here we offer\na novel constraint on Venus's climate history by inferring the water content of\nits interior. By calculating the present rate of atmospheric destruction of\nH$_2$O, CO$_2$ and OCS, which must be restored by volcanism to maintain\natmospheric stability, we show Venus's interior is dry. Venusian volcanic gases\nhave at most a 6% water mole fraction, substantially drier than terrestrial\nmagmas degassed at similar conditions. The dry interior is consistent with\nVenus ending its magma ocean epoch desiccated and thereafter having had a\nlong-lived dry surface. Volcanic resupply to Venus's atmosphere therefore\nindicates that the planet has never been `liquid-water' habitable.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"W_v0LWsVjZvIMzSId0bnkmLQg1E8uAo-JyupM96Se1g","pdfSize":"576889"}
