We find a lack of studies exploring how such texts express their\nsentiment towards each entity of interest, and how these sentiments can be\nmodelled. In order to better understand how sentiment regarding persons and\norganizations (each entity in our scope) is expressed in longer texts, we have\ncollected a dataset of expert annotations where the overall sentiment regarding\neach entity is identified, together with the sentence-level sentiment for these\nentities separately. We show that the reader's perceived sentiment regarding an\nentity often differs from an arithmetic aggregation of sentiments at the\nsentence level. Only 70\\% of the positive and 55\\% of the negative entities\nreceive a correct overall sentiment label when we aggregate the\n(human-annotated) sentiment labels for the sentences where the entity is\nmentioned. Our dataset reveals the complexity of entity-specific sentiment in\nlonger texts, and allows for more precise modelling and evaluation of such\nsentiment expressions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"G3UtPM_x6bLYb9qG3h2N_bpTTlAOublNKcmB45KovKw","pdfSize":"1290635"}
