Verlinde independently conjectured a holographic\nduality between the double-scaled SYK model at infinite temperature and\ndimensionally reduced $(2+1)$-dimensional de Sitter space [1]-[8]. Beyond the\nstatement that such a duality exists there was deep disagreement between the\ntwo proposals [9]. In this note, we trace the origin of the disagreement to a\nsuperficial similarity between two q-deformed algebraic structures: the algebra\nof \"chords\" in DSSYK, and the algebra of line operators in the Chern-Simons\nformulation of 3D de Sitter gravity. Assuming that these two structures are the\nsame requires an identification of parameters [7][10] which leads to a collapse\nof the separation of scales [9] -- the separation being required by the\nsemiclassical limit [3][9]. Dropping that assumption restores the separation of\nscales but leaves unexplained the relation between chords and Chern-Simons line\noperators. In this note we point out the existence of a third q-deformed\nalgebra that appears in DSSYK: the algebra of ``wee-chords.\" Identifying the\nChern-Simons line operators with wee-chords removes the discrepancy and leads\nto a satisfying relation between the two sides of the duality.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jxN3AWOoSAs8iz05hToRWtz_YtOrstu31vfarsuOQnY","pdfSize":"568108"}
