  "abstract": "  Using LLMs as rerankers requires experimenting with various hyperparameters,\nsuch as prompt formats, model choice, and reformulation strategies. We\nintroduce PyTerrier-GenRank, a PyTerrier plugin to facilitate seamless\nreranking experiments with LLMs, supporting popular ranking strategies like\npointwise and listwise prompting. We validate our plugin through HuggingFace\nand OpenAI hosted endpoints.\n",
