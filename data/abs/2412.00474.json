In doing\nso, we assume the new object having spin-0 and test the CP-even (scalar) and\nCP-odd (pseudoscalar) hypotheses as well superpositions of these in its\n$\\tau^+\\tau^-$ decays. We prove that the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) will be\nin a position to disentangle the CP nature of such a new particle.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WIcF_M40sYfhvwiOJqybLmmY-ciJDfFIMb1dU-ihkVg","pdfSize":"1705794"}
