  "abstract": "  Euclidean Steiner trees are relevant to model minimal networks in real-world\napplications ubiquitously. In this paper, we study the feasibility of a\nhierarchical approach embedded with bundling operations to compute multiple and\nmutually disjoint Euclidean Steiner trees that avoid clutter and overlapping\nwith obstacles in the plane, which is significant to model the decentralized\nand the multipoint coordination of agents in constrained 2D domains. Our\ncomputational experiments using arbitrary obstacle configuration with convex\nand non-convex geometries show the feasibility and the attractive performance\nwhen computing multiple obstacle-avoiding Steiner trees in the plane. Our\nresults offer the mechanisms to elucidate new operators for obstacle-avoiding\nSteiner trees.\n",
