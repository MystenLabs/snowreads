In this note\nwe observe that the sequence of run lengths in such a sequence, as well as the\nstarting and ending positions of the $n$'th run, is $2$-synchronized and hence\ncomputable by a finite automaton. As a specific consequence, we obtain the\nrecent results of Bunder, Bates, and Arnold, in much more generality, via a\ndifferent approach. We also prove results about the critical exponent and\nsubword complexity of these run-length sequences.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computer Science/Discrete Mathematics","Computer Science/Formal Languages and Automata Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AMdwC5zrwz9ljD2aW76Of8fLpamdY-wRm7we66xsmic","pdfSize":"390290"}
