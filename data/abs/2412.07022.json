This novel architecture integrates the dense connectivity principle\nof DenseNet with the ensemble learning strategy, incorporating intermediate\ncross-connections between different DenseNet paths to facilitate extensive\nfeature sharing and integration. The DCC-ECNN architecture leverages DenseNet's\nefficient parameter usage and depth while benefiting from the robustness of\nensemble learning, ensuring a richer and more resilient feature representation.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2zopC8gL5Q_CvUI-_yoyMZDD8b8_ppHX5U9WB0zmttI","pdfSize":"261158"}
