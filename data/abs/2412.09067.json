For\nsmall parameters all examples up to equivalence are determined by computer\ncalculations. Known properties of automorphisms of symmetric designs are\nextended to autotopies of $\\mathcal{P}$-cubes, while counterexamples are found\nfor $\\mathcal{C}$-cubes. An algorithm for the classification of\n$\\mathcal{P}$-cubes with prescribed autotopy groups is developed and used to\nconstruct more examples. A linear bound on the dimension of difference sets for\n$\\mathcal{P}$-cubes is proved and shown to be tight in elementary abelian\ngroups. The construction is generalized to arbitrary groups by introducing\nregular sets of (anti)automorphisms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"j4eJ8ziwd_eQPDyWco5t_yw6AV-PM8Cjln1RkkvOACw","pdfSize":"2556855"}
