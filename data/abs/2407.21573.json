This paper is\ndevoted to completing the Noether procedure. Specifically, we: (i) describe the\nunique off-shell primary extensions of the conformal higher-spin supercurrents;\n(ii) embed the off-shell superconformal prepotentials given in arXiv:2104.10416\ninto primary unconstrained isotwistor multiplets; and (iii) present the unique\ngauge transformations of the hypermultiplet and the isotwistor prepotentials.\nAn extension of the Noether procedure beyond the cubic level is also sketched,\nfollowing the earlier ${\\mathcal N}=1$ superconformal approach of\narXiv:2208.07783. Our construction is based on making use of the polar\nhypermultiplet within the projective-superspace setting.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RneklIDyMe7TaeCXjxyFAL-y69JV462TG-2kvPVrpnw","pdfSize":"361773"}
