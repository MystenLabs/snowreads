This paper presents a cost-effective,\nunsupervised UAV detection method using spatial-temporal sequence processing to\nfuse multiple LiDAR scans for accurate UAV tracking in real-world scenarios.\nOur approach segments point clouds into foreground and background, analyzes\nspatial-temporal data, and employs a scoring mechanism to enhance detection\naccuracy. Tested on a public dataset, our solution placed 4th in the CVPR 2024\nUG2+ Challenge, demonstrating its practical effectiveness. We plan to\nopen-source all designs, code, and sample data for the research community\ngithub.com/lianghanfang/UnLiDAR-UAV-Est.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"W9whYWGuDzjXjiodnTrW7zka3WYuLlUu70yynH3wKHs","pdfSize":"1829186"}
