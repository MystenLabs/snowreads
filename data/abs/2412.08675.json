Then, from the Unruh effect point of view and using the\nGelfand-Naimark-Segal construction, we construct an operator as a quanta of\nacceleration that we call quantum acceleration operator (QAO). Thereupon, we\ninvestigate the relation between the vacuum of two different frames in the\nMinkowski space. Also, we show that the vacuum of each accelerated frame in the\nMinkowski space can be obtained by applying such a QAO to the Minkowski vacuum.\nFurthermore, utilizing these QAOs, we augment the Hilbert space and then\nextract the metric field of a general frame of the Minkowski spacetime. In this\napproach, these concepts emerge from the Hilbert space through the constructed\nQAOs. Accordingly, such an augmented Hilbert space includes quantum field\ntheory in a general frame and can be considered as a fundamental concept\ninstead of the classical metric field and the standard Hilbert space.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EN5JiAPH2HYuEA-DSs_aAVWJX3_m3pBHp80-MM5uyKo","pdfSize":"151992"}
