Instead of\nconstructing gate-based quantum computers, our focus centers on designing\nvariational quantum algorithms within the analog paradigm. This involves\noptimizing parameters that directly control pulses, driving quantum states\ntowards target states without the necessity of compiling a quantum circuit. In\nthis work, we introduce pulse-based variational quantum optimization (PBVQO) as\na hardware-level framework. We illustrate the framework by optimizing external\nfluxes on superconducting quantum interference devices, effectively driving the\nwave function of this specific quantum architecture to the ground state of an\nencoded problem Hamiltonian. Given that the performance of variational\nalgorithms heavily relies on appropriate initial parameters, we introduce a\nglobal optimizer as a meta-learning technique to tackle a simple problem. The\nsynergy between PBVQO and meta-learning provides an advantage over conventional\ngate-based variational algorithms.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"k46Kceol55lZLQ7jYCgHj0f1vjprtPxyA7adGuF9jvw","pdfSize":"1137893","objectId":"0x2ac2b55210278636f6a93ed2bc9f75a50aec8027c479a7aeb66e989ef5885a84","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
