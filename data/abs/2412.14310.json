  "abstract": "  For manifolds equipped with group actions, we have the following natural\nquestion: To what extent does the equivariant cohomology determine the\nequivariant diffeotype? We resolve this question for Hamiltonian circle actions\non compact, connected symplectic four-manifolds. They are equivariantly\ndiffeomorphic if and only if their equivariant cohomology rings are isomorphic\nas algebras over the equivariant cohomology of a point. In fact, we prove a\nstronger claim: each isomorphism between their equivariant cohomology rings is\ninduced by an equivariant diffeomorphism.\n",
