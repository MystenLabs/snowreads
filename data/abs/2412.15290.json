  "abstract": "  Invariant integration of vectors and tensors over manifolds was introduced\naround fifty years ago by V.N. Folomeshkin, though the concept has not\nattracted much attention among researchers. Although it is a sophisticated\nconcept, the operation of the invariant integration of vectors is actually\nrequired to correctly solve some problems in mechanics. Two such problems are\ndiscussed in the present exposition, in the context of a two-dimensional\nEuclidean space covered by a polar coordinate system. The notion of invariant\nintegration becomes necessary when the space is described without any reference\nto a Cartesian coordinate system.\n",
