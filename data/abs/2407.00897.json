The key rate, however, is\nlimited by the repeaterless capacity to distribute multiparticle entangled\nstates across the network. Currently, in the finite-size regime, no feasible\nschemes utilizing existing experimental techniques can overcome the fundamental\nrate-distance limit of quantum conferencing in quantum networks without\nrepeaters. Here, we propose a practical, multi-field scheme that breaks this\nlimit, involving virtually establishing Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states\nthrough post-measurement coincidence matching. This proposal features a\nmeasurement-device-independent characteristic and can directly scale to support\nany number of users. Simulations show that the fundamental limitation on the\ngroup key rate can be overcome in a reasonable running time of sending\n$10^{14}$ pulses. We predict that it offers an efficient design for\nlong-distance broadcast communication in future quantum networks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sKdzFpUsbW7_ooEKCU8cpgtdwu6QnYf9er9vH4cYkEU","pdfSize":"3137011","objectId":"0xe800f80877ac89f9c6fb8516efd79f7cda2bfa171841816b2f272eba0bf8cd37","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
