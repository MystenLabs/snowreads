  "abstract": "  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable proficiency in both\ncode generation and comprehension across multiple programming languages.\nHowever, the mechanisms underlying this proficiency remain underexplored,\nparticularly with respect to whether distinct programming languages are\nprocessed independently or within a shared parametric region. Drawing an\nanalogy to the specialized regions of the brain responsible for distinct\ncognitive functions, we introduce the concept of Coding Spot, a specialized\nparametric region within LLMs that facilitates coding capabilities. Our\nfindings identify this Coding Spot and show that targeted modifications to this\nsubset significantly affect performance on coding tasks, while largely\npreserving non-coding functionalities. This compartmentalization mirrors the\nfunctional specialization observed in cognitive neuroscience, where specific\nbrain regions are dedicated to distinct tasks, suggesting that LLMs may\nsimilarly employ specialized parameter regions for different knowledge domains.\n",
