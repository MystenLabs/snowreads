  "abstract": "  We study the single photon purity of a resonantly driven single-photon source\nin the realistic scenario where the excitation laser can leak into the\ndetection path. We find that the duration of the excitation pulse strongly\ninfluences the quality of the single-photon source. We calculate the influence\nof this on the effective parameters describing the most relevant properties,\nincluding the two-photon component and Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) visibility.\nFurthermore, we analyze how these properties can be strongly affected by\nfrequency filtering of the outgoing field. Our results highlight that the\nrelation between the two-photon component of the emission and the HOM\nvisibility is more complicated than typically assumed in the literature, and\ndepends on the specific details of the source.\n",
