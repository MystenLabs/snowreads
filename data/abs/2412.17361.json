  "abstract": "  This study investigates the performance of three popular tokenization tools:\nMeCab, Sudachi, and SentencePiece, when applied as a preprocessing step for\nsentiment-based text classification of Japanese texts. Using Term\nFrequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorization, we evaluate two\ntraditional machine learning classifiers: Multinomial Naive Bayes and Logistic\nRegression. The results reveal that Sudachi produces tokens closely aligned\nwith dictionary definitions, while MeCab and SentencePiece demonstrate faster\nprocessing speeds. The combination of SentencePiece, TF-IDF, and Logistic\nRegression outperforms the other alternatives in terms of classification\nperformance.\n",
