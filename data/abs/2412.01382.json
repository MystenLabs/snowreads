The resonator, composed of a yttrium iron\ngarnet (YIG) film coupled with a CoFeB nanostripe, operates through dynamic\ndipolar coupling, leading to wavelength downconversion and the formation of a\nmagnonic cavity. Using super-Nyquist sampling magneto-optical Kerr effect\n(SNS-MOKE) microscopy and micromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate that these\nresonators can induce a $\\pi$ phase shift in the transmitted spin wave. The\nphase shift is highly sensitive to the magnetization alignment within the\nresonator, allowing for on-demand control via magnetic switching. This feature,\ncombined with low-loss transmission, positions the magnonic Fabry-P\\'erot\nresonator as a promising component for reconfigurable magnonic circuits and\nspin-wave computing devices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oADg1gIAJnXoWQpJmc9CS1kmhi-8nkBkLyABMkjY774","pdfSize":"1449241"}
