Building upon the recent Elliptica\ncode update, we can now construct initial data using not only piecewise\npolytropic equations of state, but also tabulated equations of state for these\nbinary systems. Furthermore, the code allows us to endow neutron stars within\nthe binary system with spins. These spins can have a magnitude close to the\nmass shedding limit and can point in any direction.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1NruxDekLiyK8iqUQgAyL8SxBAevOu71-CPqDIPUjPo","pdfSize":"2316170"}
