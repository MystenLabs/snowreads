{"id":"2407.05073","title":"Generalization of Cantor Pairing Polynomials (Bijective Mapping Among\n  Natural Numbers) from N02 to N0 to Z2 to N0 and N03 to N","authors":"Sandor Kristyan","authorsParsed":[["Kristyan","Sandor",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jul 2024 13:32:16 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-09","timestamp":1720272736000,"abstract":"  The Cantor pairing polynomials are extended to larger 2D sub-domains and more\ncomplex mapping, of which the most important property is the bijectivity. If\ncorners are involved inside (but not the borders of) domain, more than one\nconnected polynomials are necessary. More complex patterns need more complex\nsubsequent application of math series to obtain the mapping polynomials which\nare more and more inconvenient, although elementary. A tricky polynomial fit is\nintroduced (six coefficients are involved like in the original Cantor\npolynomials with rigorous but simple restrictions on points chosen) to buy out\nthe regular treatment of math series to find the pairing polynomials instantly.\nThe original bijective Cantor polynomial C1(x,y)= (x2+2xy+y2+3x+y)/2: N02 to N0\n(=positive integers) which is 2-fold and runs in zig - zag way along lines\nx+y=N is extended e.g. to the bijective P(x,y)=\n2x2+4sgn(x)sgn(y)xy+2y2-2H(x)sgn(y)x-y+1: Z2 to N0 (with sign and Heaviside\nfunctions, Z is integers) running in spiral way along concentric rhombuses, or\nto the bijective P3D(x,y,z)= [x3+y3+z3 +3(xz2+yz2 +zx2+2xyz +zy2+yx2+xy2)\n+3(2x2+2y2 +z2+2xz +2yz+4xy) +5x+11y+2z]/6: N03 to N0 which is 6-fold and runs\nalong plains x+y+z=N. Storage device for triangle matrices is also commented as\ncutting the original Cantor domain to half along with related Diophantine\nequations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-Xh7MsKQ6brLLbqhAPN2Wi7fd60tDhqk9b8_7LvdEk0","pdfSize":"862883"}
