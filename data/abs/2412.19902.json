Brillouin light scattering and ferromagnetic resonance\nmeasurements revealed that depositing at room temperature followed by annealing\nat 300 deg C for 1 hour produces the best results for maximizing magnetization,\nexchange stiffness, and minimizing spin-dynamic dissipation in the films, which\nare desirable characteristics for high-speed spintronic devices. Additionally,\nstrong hybridization of spin waves in the Damon-Eshbach geometry was observed,\nwhich is attractive for applications in magnonic signal processing circuits.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MMJkd1Wh3kyeS4sniQj21aBgpYI6LShUx5AML6Dql1Q","pdfSize":"5173598"}
