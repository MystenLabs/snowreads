  "abstract": "  We study the performance of the Thompson Sampling algorithm for logistic\nbandit problems. In this setting, an agent receives binary rewards with\nprobabilities determined by a logistic function, $\\exp(\\beta \\langle a, \\theta\n\\rangle)/(1+\\exp(\\beta \\langle a, \\theta \\rangle))$, with slope parameter\n$\\beta>0$, and where both the action $a\\in \\mathcal{A}$ and parameter $\\theta\n\\in \\mathcal{O}$ lie within the $d$-dimensional unit ball. Adopting the\ninformation-theoretic framework introduced by Russo and Van Roy (2016), we\nanalyze the information ratio, a statistic that quantifies the trade-off\nbetween the immediate regret incurred and the information gained about the\noptimal action. We improve upon previous results by establishing that the\ninformation ratio is bounded by $\\tfrac{9}{2}d\\alpha^{-2}$, where $\\alpha$ is a\nminimax measure of the alignment between the action space $\\mathcal{A}$ and the\nparameter space $\\mathcal{O}$, and is independent of $\\beta$. Using this\nresult, we derive a bound of order $O(d/\\alpha\\sqrt{T \\log(\\beta T/d)})$ on the\nBayesian expected regret of Thompson Sampling incurred after $T$ time steps. To\nour knowledge, this is the first regret bound for logistic bandits that depends\nonly logarithmically on $\\beta$ while being independent of the number of\nactions. In particular, when the action space contains the parameter space, the\nbound on the expected regret is of order $\\tilde{O}(d \\sqrt{T})$.\n",
