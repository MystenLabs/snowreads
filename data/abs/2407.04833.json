In this paper, we introduce the 3D\nAdaptive Structural Convolution Network (3D-ASCN), a cutting-edge framework for\n3D point cloud recognition. It combines 3D convolution kernels, a structural\ntree structure, and adaptive neighborhood sampling for effective geometric\nfeature extraction. This method obtains domain-invariant features and\ndemonstrates robust, adaptable performance on a variety of point cloud\ndatasets, ensuring compatibility across diverse sensor configurations without\nthe need for parameter adjustments. This highlights its potential to\nsignificantly enhance the reliability and efficiency of self-driving vehicle\ntechnology.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"IlIAW70aD89SACf-rbHev-hm_kuD3CeIgN4rZEGmm1E","pdfSize":"1375018"}
