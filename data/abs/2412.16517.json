We show that the power\nseries with coefficients ${\\nu}_q(n)$, respectively ${\\nu}_p(n)(\\mathrm{ mod\\;}\nk)$, are non-holonomic and not algebraic in characteristic 0. We find\ninfinitely many rational numbers and infinitely many algebraic irrational\nnumbers for which the values of these series are transcendental. We apply these\nresults to some $p$-automatic sequences, one of them being the period-doubling\nsequence.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YF70lDGot-iCuLduBNxGtH4lfIE5hZtsi9K2BbFUh04","pdfSize":"220163"}
