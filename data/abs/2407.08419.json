They\nhave been heavily studied since their introduction and complete classification\nin the 1950s by Shephard and Todd, due to their many applications to\ncombinatorics, representation theory, knot theory, and mathematical physics, to\nname a few examples. For each given complex reflection group G, we explain a\nnew recipe for producing an integrable system of linear differential equations\nwhose differential Galois group is precisely G. We exhibit these systems\nexplicitly for many (low-rank) irreducible complex reflection groups in the\nShephard-Todd classification.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Symbolic Computation","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WO3kf5R8tLmJHpHv0ZOi5B6ElArvgWFvhj6BFFIKA2Y","pdfSize":"135475","objectId":"0x2bb7b8d9fd3e77b642bd6a0d6eff5241d363366f3db207412f9786ddd1e61caf","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
