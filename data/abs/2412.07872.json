The Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs) perform accurately in the disease prediction considering the\nimage capture of the crop leaf, being extensively enhanced in the literature.\nThese machine learning techniques fall short in data privacy, as they require\nsharing the data in the training process with a central server, disregarding\ncompetitive or regulatory concerns. Thus, Federated Learning (FL) aims to\nsupport distributed training to address recognized gaps in centralized\ntraining. As far as we know, this paper inaugurates the use and evaluation of\nFL applied in maize leaf diseases. We evaluated the performance of five CNNs\ntrained under the distributed paradigm and measured their training time\ncompared to the classification performance. In addition, we consider the\nsuitability of distributed training considering the volume of network traffic\nand the number of parameters of each CNN. Our results indicate that FL\npotentially enhances data privacy in heterogeneous domains.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HSAhGKyyHQAyzCF99io4dbXfB3__gPjeHCR6UBbAGdE","pdfSize":"986307"}
