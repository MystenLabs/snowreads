  "abstract": "  We have analytically examined the integral form of Gauss' law for arbitrarily\nmoving charges inside and outside an arbitrarily expanding (or contracting) and\ndeforming Gaussian surface with explicit use of the motion of the Gaussian\nsurface and the Maxwell equations under consideration. We have obtained a\nsimple-looking differential equation\n$\\frac{\\text{d}}{\\text{d}\\text{t}}\\oint_{s(t)}\\vec{E}\\cdot\\text{d}\\vec{s}(t)=\\frac{I^{(s)}_{\\text{in}}(t)}{\\epsilon_0}$\nfor time-dependent Gauss' flux-integral. We have explicitly calculated\ntime-dependent Gauss' flux-integral for the moving surface and have found no\nchanges in the original result which was obtained without explicit use of the\nmotion. Our explicit derivation of Gauss' flux-integral for the moving surface\ncan be directly useful in an undergraduate/postgraduate physics class for a\nbetter understanding of Gauss' law for electrodynamics.\n",
