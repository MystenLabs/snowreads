  "abstract": "  The rate coefficients of various isotopic variations of the H2+ + H2 and H3+\n+ H2 reactions in the 10-250 K temperature range were measured using a\ncryogenic 22 pole radio frequency ion trap. The processes involving diatomic\nions were found to behave close to the Langevin rate, whereas\ntemperature-dependent rate coefficients were obtained for the four isotopic\nexchange processes with triatomic ions. Fitting the experimental data using a\nchemical code allowed us in specific cases to constrain rate coefficients that\nwere not directly measured in the ion trap. The reported rate coefficients\nsuggest a more efficient hydrogenation of deuterated H3+ forms than usually\nassumed in astrochemical models, which might affect deuteration rates in warmer\nenvironments.\n",
