In\nequilibrium, increasing the staggered potential in the Mott regime reduces the\nMott gap and broadens the Hubbard bands, creating favorable conditions for\nimpact ionization. After laser excitation, impact ionization is observed, with\nits occurrence depending on both the staggered potential and the laser pump\nfrequency. By analyzing the time evolution of the kinetic, ionic, and Coulomb\ninteraction energies, we identify a novel mechanism for impact ionization, in\nwhich excess ionic potential energy is converted into additional double\noccupancy-distinct from the conventional mechanism where excess kinetic energy\ndrives this process. We further show that impact ionization arises from\ninterference between excited states driven by photon excitation of the same\norder. These results present a new pathway for realizing impact ionization in\nstrongly correlated electron systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HEkaSg6aHKZcG-DwFVS4wIAz5r8mdylRJrx1y3D5rLI","pdfSize":"794370"}
