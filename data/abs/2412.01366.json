Several\nprocesses have been proposed to interpret the association, electron\ndistribution, and emission. We present the observation of a unique type V event\nobserved by e-CALLISTO on 7 May 2021. The type V radio emission follows a group\nof U bursts. Unlike the unpolarized U bursts, the type V burst is circularly\npolarized, leaving room for a different emission process. Its starting edge\ndrifts to higher frequency four times slower than the descending branch of the\nassociated U burst. The type V processes seem to be ruled by electrons of lower\nenergy. The observations conform to a coherent scenario where a dense electron\nbeam drives the two-stream instability (causing type III emission) and, in the\nnonlinear stage, becomes unstable to another instability, previously known as\nthe electron firehose instability (EFI). The secondary instability scatters\nsome beam electrons into velocities perpendicular to the magnetic field and\nproduces, after particle loss, a trapped distribution prone to electron\ncyclotron masering (ECM). A reduction in beaming and the formation of an\nisotropic halo are predicted for electron beams continuing to interplanetary\nspace, possibly observable by Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QW5RLaq7u9YbzHQz4PJDYLRXOL8oGhuLYUsqSpdcxFQ","pdfSize":"1021651"}
