This\npaper introduces a new medical regression and classification problem -\nautomatically estimating SYNTAX score from coronary angiography. Our study\npresents a comprehensive dataset of 1,844 patients, featuring a balanced\ndistribution of individuals with zero and non-zero scores. This dataset\nincludes a first-of-its-kind, complete coronary angiography samples captured\nthrough a multi-view X-ray video, allowing one to observe coronary arteries\nfrom multiple perspectives. Furthermore, we present a novel, fully automatic\nend-to-end method for estimating the SYNTAX. For such a difficult task, we have\nachieved a solid coefficient of determination R2 of 0.51 in score predictions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OOUu_3gAwHcRLuMsPL3NL-5qqXQ-QJk4zR0yA0eIkL8","pdfSize":"9907319"}
