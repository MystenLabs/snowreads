This survey reviews the progress in\nRS inclusively from 2017 to 2024, effectively connecting theoretical advances\nwith practical applications. We explore the development from traditional RS\ntechniques like content-based and collaborative filtering to advanced methods\ninvolving deep learning, graph-based models, reinforcement learning, and large\nlanguage models. We also discuss specialized systems such as context-aware,\nreview-based, and fairness-aware RS. The primary goal of this survey is to\nbridge theory with practice. It addresses challenges across various sectors,\nincluding e-commerce, healthcare, and finance, emphasizing the need for\nscalable, real-time, and trustworthy solutions. Through this survey, we promote\nstronger partnerships between academic research and industry practices. The\ninsights offered by this survey aim to guide industry professionals in\noptimizing RS deployment and to inspire future research directions, especially\nin addressing emerging technological and societal trends\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"c1dznQ8x9loi6y_PFmfnPgdoEVVqWAKcqrdWQEYUE1s","pdfSize":"2016080"}
