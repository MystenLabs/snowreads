Under some assumptions, we also classify\nprojective bundles over projective spaces which has a smooth blow up structure\nover some arbitrary smooth projective variety, not necessarily a projective\nspace. We verify which of the globally generated vector bundles over projective\nspace of first Chern class at most five has the property that their\nprojectivisation has a smooth blow up structure, with no additional assumption.\nIn the way, we get some new examples of varieties with both projective bundle\nand smooth blow up structures.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wT6ZzBfT879uVVwbsEd4H0-gCR5qgJmaeoWA13mIXdI","pdfSize":"281291"}
