The explicit contribution of induced dipole interaction in the\nasymptotic behavior of the wave function components has been incorporated into\nFM formalism. Elastic and inelastic cross sections have been calculated with\nhigh energy resolution in the vicinity of $n=2,3$ exited states thresholds of\nrespective atoms. The Gailitis-Dumburg oscillations are discovered in some of\ncalculated cross sections.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-OV0NjXMG1a9QxizOVq5QvTtANUzXJWubz1JB-Xrez4","pdfSize":"294580"}
