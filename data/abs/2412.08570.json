  "abstract": "  In this note, we present the directed flow $v_1$ measurements of protons from\nXe+Cs(I) collisions at 3.8 AGeV (BM@N run8). We show the datasets, event and\ntrack selection cuts, centrality definition, event plane reconstruction and\nresolution. The $v_1$ results are presented as function of transverse momentum\n($p_T$) and rapidity ($y_{cm}$) for 10-30\\% central Xe+Cs(I) collisions. The\nsystematic uncertainty study will also be presented and discussed. The $v_1$\nmeasurements are compared with results of JAM transport model calculations and\npublished data from other experiments.\n",
