  "abstract": "  We offer an insight into our mathematical endeavors, which aim to advance the\nfoundational understanding of energy systems in a broad context, encompassing\nfacets such as charge transport, energy storage, markets, and collective\nbehavior. Our working techniques include a combination of well-posed\nmathematical models (both deterministic and stochastic), mathematical analysis\narguments (mostly concerned with model dimension reduction and averaging,\nperiodic homogenization), and simulation tools (numerical approximation\ntechniques, computational statistics, high-performance computing).\n",
