  "abstract": "  We present a novel parametric finite element approach for simulating the\nsurface diffusion of curves and surfaces. Our core strategy incorporates a\npredictor-corrector time-stepping method, which enhances the classical\nfirst-order temporal accuracy to achieve second-order accuracy. Notably, our\nnew method eliminates the necessity for mesh regularization techniques, setting\nit apart from previously proposed second-order schemes by the authors (J.\nComput. Phys. 514 (2024) 113220). Moreover, it maintains the long-term mesh\nequidistribution property of the first-order scheme. The proposed techniques\nare readily adaptable to other geometric flows, such as (area-preserving) curve\nshortening flow and surface diffusion with anisotropic surface energy.\nComprehensive numerical experiments have been conducted to validate the\naccuracy and efficiency of our proposed methods, demonstrating their\nsuperiority over previous schemes.\n",
