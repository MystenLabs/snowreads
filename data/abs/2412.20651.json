Also,\nfinetuning on pre-trained general models has been a challenge due to the\ndistribution shift between the medical domain and the pre-trained models. Here,\nwe propose Latent Drift (LD) for diffusion models that can be adopted for any\nfine-tuning method to mitigate the issues faced by the distribution shift or\nemployed in inference time as a condition. Latent Drifting enables diffusion\nmodels to be conditioned for medical images fitted for the complex task of\ncounterfactual image generation, which is crucial to investigate how parameters\nsuch as gender, age, and adding or removing diseases in a patient would alter\nthe medical images. We evaluate our method on three public longitudinal\nbenchmark datasets of brain MRI and chest X-rays for counterfactual image\ngeneration. Our results demonstrate significant performance gains in various\nscenarios when combined with different fine-tuning schemes.
