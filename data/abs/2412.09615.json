  "abstract": "  We measure the out-of-plane shear modulus of few-layer graphene (FLG) by a\nblister test. During the test, we employed a monolayer molybdenum disulfide\n(MoS2) membrane stacked onto FLG wells to facilitate the separation of FLG from\nthe silicon oxide (SiOx) substrate. Using the deflection profile of the\nblister, we determine an average shear modulus G of 0.97 +- 0.15 GPa, and a\nfree energy model incorporating the interfacial shear force is developed to\ncalculate the adhesion energy between FLG and SiOx substrate. The experimental\nprotocol can be extended to other two-dimensional (2D) materials and layered\nstructures (LS) made from other materials (WS2, hBN, etc.) to characterize\ntheir interlayer interactions. These results provide valuable insight into the\nmechanics of 2D nano devices which is important in designing more complex\nflexible electronic devices and nanoelectromechanical systems.\n",
