  "abstract": "  Bias significantly undermines both the accuracy and trustworthiness of\nmachine learning models. To date, one of the strongest biases observed in image\nclassification models is texture bias-where models overly rely on texture\ninformation rather than shape information. Yet, existing approaches for\nmeasuring and mitigating texture bias have not been able to capture how\ntextures impact model robustness in real-world settings. In this work, we\nintroduce the Texture Association Value (TAV), a novel metric that quantifies\nhow strongly models rely on the presence of specific textures when classifying\nobjects. Leveraging TAV, we demonstrate that model accuracy and robustness are\nheavily influenced by texture. Our results show that texture bias explains the\nexistence of natural adversarial examples, where over 90% of these samples\ncontain textures that are misaligned with the learned texture of their true\nlabel, resulting in confident mispredictions.\n",
