We prove a pressure distribution\nprinciple for Pesin topological pressure and a Billingsley type theorem for\npacking topological pressure. We then obtain a variational principle for\npacking topological pressure, which reveals a variational relation between the\npacking pressure and measure-theoretic upper local pressure. We further examine\nthe applicability of our findings to a typical nonautonomous dynamical system,\nwherein the sequence of continuous selfmaps preserves the same Borel\nprobability measures. In addition, we derive an upper bound for the packing\ntopological pressure on the set of generic points.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"AsNOuz4j_-PjrDMoTbPkknM3YkMWdqDOO5kOwZFL_K0","pdfSize":"337643"}
