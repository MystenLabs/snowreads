  "abstract": "  Theoretical predictions for high-energy collision processes at particle\ncolliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), rely on calculations in\nperturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), which are often computationally\nchallenging. In these conference proceedings, we explore the possibility of\nusing quantum computers to simulate QCD processes in the perturbative QCD\nregime. In particular, as a first step towards that goal, we present quantum\ncircuits to simulate the colour part of perturbative QCD. The circuits are\nvalidated by implementing them on a simulated quantum computer and verifying\nthe colour factors for several example Feynman diagrams.\n",
