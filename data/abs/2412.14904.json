  "abstract": "  Let $I$ be a monomial ideal in a polynomial ring. In this paper, we study the\nasymptotic behavior of the set of associated radical ideals of the (symbolic)\npowers of $I$. We show that both $\\asr(I^s)$ and $\\asr(I^{(s)})$ need not\nstabilize for large value of $s$. In the case $I$ is a square-free monomial\nideal, we prove that $\\asr(I^{(s)})$ is constant for $s$ large enough. Finally,\nif $I$ is the cover ideal of a balanced hypergraph, then $\\asr(I^s)$\nmonotonically increases in $s$.\n",
