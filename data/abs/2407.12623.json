A distributed datastore storing critical data sits at the core of many\nservices; a prime example being etcd in Kubernetes. Trusted execution\nenvironments can secure this data from cloud providers during execution, but it\nis complex to build trustworthy data storage systems using such mechanisms. We\npresent the design and evaluation of the Ledger-backed Secure Key-Value\ndatastore (LSKV), a distributed datastore that provides an etcd-like API but\ncan use trusted execution mechanisms to keep cloud providers outside the trust\nboundary. LSKV provides a path to transition traditional systems towards\nconfidential execution, provides competitive performance compared to etcd, and\nhelps clients to gain trust in intermediary services. LSKV forms a foundational\ncore, lowering the barriers to building more trustworthy systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VVa6-HkF6f61YBNxUbIOq2UeG3332Rk9BGhtFWcPLkY","pdfSize":"1431468"}
