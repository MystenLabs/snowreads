We prove that the linear threshold of the\ncomplete bipartite subdivision graph $K_{s,t}'$ is at most $\\sigma_s = 2 -\n1/s$. Moreover, we show that any $\\sigma < \\sigma_s$ is less than the linear\nthreshold of $K_{s,t}'$ for sufficiently large $t$ (depending on $s$ and\n$\\sigma$).\n  Some geometric applications of this result are given: we show that any $n$\npoints and $n$ lines in the complex plane without an $s$-by-$s$ grid determine\n$O(n^{4/3 - c})$ incidences for some constant $c > 0$ depending on $s$; and for\ncertain pairs $(p,q)$, we establish nontrivial lower bounds on the number of\ndistinct distances determined by $n$ points in the plane under the condition\nthat every $p$-tuple of points determines at least $q$ distinct distances.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gBD2MgEY7Cpj8DeuG25s-mD57mPXIsVp1v0sc4CVQSU","pdfSize":"549168"}
