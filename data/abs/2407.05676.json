The\nresonant transition frequency of two adjacent Rydberg states 78$S_{1/2}$ and\n78$P_{1/2}$ is tuned based on AC Stark effect of 70~MHz Radio frequency (RF)\nfield that is applied outside the vapor cell. Meanwhile, the Rydberg states\nalso exhibit Floquet even-order sidebands that are used to extend the\nbandwidths further. We achieve microwave electric field measurements over\n1.172~GHz of continuous frequency range. The sensitivity of the Rydberg\nreceiver with heterodyne technique in the absence of RF field is\n280.2~nVcm$^{-1}$Hz$^{-1/2}$, while it is dramatically decreased with tuning\nthe resonant transition frequency in the presence of RF field. Surprisingly,\nthe sensitivity can be greatly improved if the microwave field couples the\nFloquet sideband transition. The achieving of continuous frequency and high\nsensitivity microwave detection will promote the application of Rydberg\nreceiver in the radar technique and wireless communication.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CLcPu3Q0-_Ch037uAPJHVET_2oxUf5lbwwqQLl1TIiY","pdfSize":"574550"}
