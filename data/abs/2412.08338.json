  "abstract": "  A graph $G$ with $p$ vertices and $q$ edges is said to be edge-graceful if\nits edges can be labeled from $1$ through $q$, in such a way that the labels\ninduced on the vertices by adding over the labels of incident edges modulo $p$\nare distinct. A known result under this topic is Lo's Theorem, which states\nthat if a graph $G$ with $p$ vertices and $q$ edges is edge-graceful, then\n$p\\Big|\\Big(q^{2}+q-\\dfrac{p(p-1)}{2}\\Big)$.\n  This paper presents novel results on the edge-gracefulness of the usual fan\ngraphs. Using Lo's Theorem, the concepts of divisibility and Diophantine\nequations, and a computer program created, we determine all edge-graceful usual\nfan graphs $F_{1,n}$ with their corresponding edge-graceful labels.\n",
