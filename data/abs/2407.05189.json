Consisting of\n548,000 parallel sentences and approximately 9 million words per language, this\ndataset is derived from diverse sources such as news articles and holy texts,\naiming to enhance natural language processing (NLP) applications and language\neducation technology. This corpus marks a significant step forward in the realm\nof linguistic resources, particularly for Turkic languages, which have lagged\nin the neural machine translation (NMT) revolution. By presenting the first\ncomprehensive case study for the English-Azerbaijani (Arabic Script) language\npair, this work underscores the transformative potential of NMT in low-resource\ncontexts. The development and utilization of this corpus not only facilitate\nthe advancement of machine translation systems tailored for specific linguistic\nneeds but also promote inclusive language learning through technology. The\nfindings demonstrate the corpus's effectiveness in training deep learning MT\nsystems and underscore its role as an essential asset for researchers and\neducators aiming to foster bilingual education and multilingual communication.\nThis research covers the way for future explorations into NMT applications for\nlanguages lacking substantial digital resources, thereby enhancing global\nlanguage education frameworks.
