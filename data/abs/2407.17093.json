Our bounds depend on the degree, the bitsize of $f$, and the\npolynomials defining $\\mathscr{X}$, and are single exponential with respect to\nthe number of variables. They generalize the single exponential bounds from\nJeronimo, Perrucci, and Tsigaridas (SIAM Journal on Optimization,\n23(1):241--255, 2013) for the minimum of a polynomial function on a compact\nconnected component of a basic closed semi-algebraic set.\n  The tools that we use allow us to obtain specialized bounds and dedicated\nalgorithms for two large families of polynomial optimization problems in which\nthe optimum value might not be attained. The first family forms a dense set of\nreal polynomial functions with a fixed collection of Newton polytopes; we\nprovide the best approximation yet for the bifurcation set, which contains the\noptimal value, and we deduce an effective method for computations. As for the\nsecond family, we consider any unconstrained polynomial optimization problem;\nwe present more precise bounds, together with a better bit complexity estimate\nof an algorithm to compute the optimal value.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cQSYpMWV6p7KA47vgO9KV7J94K0GTAJ2WHFPBYyZ6w4","pdfSize":"390006"}
