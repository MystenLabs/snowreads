  "abstract": "  The duality between a class of the Davey-Stewartson type coupled systems and\na class of two-dimensional Toda type lattices is discussed. A new coupled\nsystem related to the recently found lattice is presented. A method for\neliminating nonlocalities in coupled systems by virtue of special finite\nreductions of the lattices is suggested. An original algorithm for constructing\nexplicit solutions of the coupled systems based on the finite reduction of the\ncorresponding lattice is proposed. Some new solutions for coupled systems\nrelated to the Volterra lattice are presented as illustrative examples.\n",
