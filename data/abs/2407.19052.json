While a wide array of target production\ntechniques are available at CATS, new methods that must be explored invariably\narise. One such technique, the High-Intensity Vibrational Powder Plating\n(HIVIPP), was first reported in 1997 by Isao Sugai. It was developed to produce\ntargets and stripper foils that were difficult to make by standard methods. At\nArgonne National Laboratory (ANL), we have successfully constructed and tested\na simple system for this purpose. We have produced targets of carbon and\ntitanium on various metal backings using the HIVIPP method. We are currently in\nthe exciting phase of exploring the production of other elements, including\nisotopically enriched and radioactive material. This work is in progress and\nwill be further detailed with specific examples.\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rj_eQRNMspY8u568xzVueqGVHM3jX3T0nogpsDqfVp0","pdfSize":"670532"}
