Unforced jets\nwith various momentum flux ratios (q) are studied. Proper Orthogonal\nDecomposition (POD) analysis is used to examine the high-speed instantaneous\nimages and characterize spatio-temporal behavior the reacting jets. Further,\njet is acoustically forced with various frequencies and the effect of forcing\nfrequency and momentum flux ratio is studied in detail. Instantaneous images,\nPOD mode shapes and Power Spectral Density (PSD) plots are used to assess the\nresponse of jet to forcing function, and the influence of crossflow. It is\nobserved that the jet does not equally respond to all frequencies and the\npreferred frequency range is identified. It is also observed that higher\nmomentum ratio produces stronger interaction with the crossflow which dampens\nthe effect of forcing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"anyhrb5bKBWs2qQ7UOTTVlg9WTo4f1pa0CuzyOFAImU","pdfSize":"1832390"}
