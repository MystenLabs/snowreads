Here, we prepare high Fock states in a\nhigh-overtone bulk acoustic wave resonator (HBAR) by coupling it to a\nsuperconducting qubit and applying microwave pulses designed using quantum\noptimal control. We characterize the experimentally realized states by\nemploying a criterion for genuine quantum non-Gaussianity (QNG) designed to\nreveal multiphonon contributions. Although energy relaxation and decoherence\nlimit the achievable fidelities, we demonstrate genuine QNG features compatible\nwith Fock state $\\vert 6\\rangle$, confirming that the prepared states cannot be\ngenerated through Gaussian operations on states with up to Fock state $\\vert\n5\\rangle$ contributions. We further investigate the robustness of these QNG\nfeatures to losses and their utility in sensing displacement amplitudes. In\nparticular, we introduce a hierarchy based on the quantum Fisher information\nand show that, despite decoherence and measurement imperfections, the prepared\nstates achieve a displacement sensitivity surpassing that of an ideal Fock\nstate $\\vert 3\\rangle$. Our results have immediate applications in quantum\nsensing and simulations with HBAR devices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"WlW4QH7b2i132eSDc1ZxCHvZValAjDKQLpf8soS8WKc","pdfSize":"3716350"}
