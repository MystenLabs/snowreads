The infinite state space\nposes technical challenges, and the boundary of the quadrant can have a\ndramatic effect on the long term behavior of these Markov chains. For instance,\nthe boundary can slow down the convergence speed of an ergodic Markov chain\ntowards its stationary distribution due to the extinction or the lack of an\nentity. In this paper, we quantify this slow-down for a class of stochastic\nreaction networks and for more general Markov chains on the non-negative\nquadrant. We establish general criteria for such a Markov chain to exhibit a\npower-law lower bound for its mixing time. The lower bound is of order\n$|x|^\\theta$ for all initial state $x$ on a boundary face of the quadrant,\nwhere $\\theta$ is characterized by the local behavior of the Markov chain near\nthe boundary of the quadrant. A better understanding of how these lower bounds\narise leads to insights into how the structure of chemical reaction networks\ncontributes to slow-mixing.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Quantitative Biology/Molecular Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"ZSQSlBTN8O3Y9HYB9yQv-jwKqBpalTceZULoCcoD2WE","pdfSize":"1154176"}
