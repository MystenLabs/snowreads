We take the 3D planes as\nthe main objective due to their compactness and structural expressiveness in\nindoor scenes, and develop an explicit optimization framework that learns to\nfit the expected surface of indoor scenes by splatting the 3D planes into 2.5D\ndepth and normal maps. As our PlanarSplatting operates directly on the 3D plane\nprimitives, it eliminates the dependencies on 2D/3D plane detection and plane\nmatching and tracking for planar surface reconstruction. Furthermore, the\nessential merits of plane-based representation plus CUDA-based implementation\nof planar splatting functions, PlanarSplatting reconstructs an indoor scene in\n3 minutes while having significantly better geometric accuracy. Thanks to our\nultra-fast reconstruction speed, the largest quantitative evaluation on the\nScanNet and ScanNet++ datasets over hundreds of scenes clearly demonstrated the\nadvantages of our method. We believe that our accurate and ultrafast planar\nsurface reconstruction method will be applied in the structured data curation\nfor surface reconstruction in the future. The code of our CUDA implementation\nwill be publicly available.
