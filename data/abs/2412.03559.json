We further extract a\nbilateral matrix inverse from Dougall's ${}_2H_2$ summation which we use, in\ncombination with the Pfaff--Saalsch\\\"utz summation, to derive a summation for a\nparticular bilateral hypergeometric $_3H_3$ series. We finally provide\nmultivariate extensions of the bilateral matrix inverse and the $_3H_3$\nsummation in the setting of hypergeometric series associated to the root system\n$A_r$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rc5iXZ9DebGKnBOz_NMACyfQF8PJbC5fOlsX9gB3tuY","pdfSize":"232687"}
