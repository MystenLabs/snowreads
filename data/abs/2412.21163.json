  "abstract": "  The hot interiors of massive stars in the later stages of their evolution\nprovide an ideal place for the production of heavy axion-like particles (ALPs)\nwith mass up to O(100 keV) range. We show that a fraction of these ALPs could\nstream out of the stellar photosphere and subsequently decay into two photons\nthat can be potentially detected on or near the Earth. In particular, we\nestimate the photon flux originating from the spontaneous decay of heavy ALPs\nproduced inside Horizontal Branch and Wolf-Rayet stars, and assess its\ndetectability by current and future $X$-ray and gamma-ray telescopes. Our\nresults indicate that current and future telescopes can probe axion-photon\ncouplings down to $g_{a\\gamma} \\sim 4\\times 10^{-11}$ GeV${}^{-1}$ for $m_a\\sim\n10-100$ keV, which covers new ground in the ALP parameter space.\n",
