  "abstract": "  This set of notes guided a 2 hour lecture on \"Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals in\nFundamental Fields for the New Horizons for Psi School and Workshop\", hosted at\nInstituto Superior Tecnico, University of Lisbon, between 1 - 5 July 2024. It\nintroduces how to model asymmetric mass-ratio binaries evolving while immersed\nin an environment constituted by an ultralight (complex) scalar field using\ntechniques of black hole perturbation theory, and focusing on the simpler\nexample of a spherically symmetric cloud around a non-rotating black hole. A\nMathematica notebook with the derivation and solver of the equations of motion\nof the system is also provided.\n",
