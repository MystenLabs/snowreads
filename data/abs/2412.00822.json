  "abstract": "  We construct and study the ideal Poisson--Voronoi tessellation of the product\nof two hyperbolic planes $\\mathbb{H}_{2}\\times \\mathbb{H}_{2}$ endowed with the\n$L^{1}$ norm. We prove that its law is invariant under all isometries of this\nspace and study some geometric features of its cells. Among other things, we\nprove that the set of points at equal separation to any two corona points is\nunbounded almost surely. This is analogous to a recent result of\nFr\\k{a}czyk-Mellick-Wilkens for higher rank symmetric spaces.\n",
