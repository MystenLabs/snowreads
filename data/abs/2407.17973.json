While it appears to\nbe used as voting method in corporate governance and has some political\napplications, to the best of our knowledge, no formal analysis of the rule\nexists to date. We provide such an analysis here, prompted by a request for\nadvice about this voting rule by a health insurance company in the Netherlands,\nwhich uses it to elect its work council. We study conditions under which LV\nwould improve representation over standard approval voting and when it would\nnot. We establish the extent of such an improvement, or lack thereof, both in\nterms of diversity and proportionality notions. These results help us\nunderstand if, and how, LV may be used as a low-effort fix of approval voting\nin order to enhance representation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HSNEYA-468oKDS7LNh2M3P_j2_BaturJAlruGuHjTS0","pdfSize":"4004282"}
