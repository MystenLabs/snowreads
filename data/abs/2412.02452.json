  "abstract": "  This study employs an event study methodology to investigate the market\nimpact of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) classification of\ncrypto assets as securities. It explores how SEC interventions influence asset\nreturns and trading volumes, focusing on explicitly named crypto assets. The\nempirical analysis highlights significant adverse market reactions, notably\nreturns plummeting 12% over one week post-announcement, persisting for a month.\nWe demonstrate that the severity of market reaction depends on sentiment and\nasset characteristics such as market size, age, volatility, and illiquidity.\nFurther, we identify significant ex-ante trading volume effects indicative of\npre-announcement informed trading.\n",
