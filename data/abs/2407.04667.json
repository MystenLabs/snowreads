In any applied modelling, it is critical to assess how robust the\ninferences on certain target variables are to changes in the model. In Bayesian\nnetworks, these analyses fall under the umbrella of sensitivity analysis, which\nis most commonly carried out by quantifying dissimilarities using\nKullback-Leibler information measures. In this paper, we argue that robustness\nmethods based instead on the familiar total variation distance provide simple\nand more valuable bounds on robustness to misspecification, which are both\nformally justifiable and transparent. We introduce a novel measure of\ndependence in conditional probability tables called the diameter to derive such\nbounds. This measure quantifies the strength of dependence between a variable\nand its parents. We demonstrate how such formal robustness considerations can\nbe embedded in building a Bayesian network.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IwDxj77_eZplH9Z60BTXyFRQkygsy6jF59FsmP6a8i4","pdfSize":"1095592"}
