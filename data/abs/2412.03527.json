This paper introduces FANAL (Financial Activity News\nAlerting Language Modeling Framework), a specialized BERT-based framework\nengineered for real-time financial event detection and analysis, categorizing\nnews into twelve distinct financial categories. FANAL leverages silver-labeled\ndata processed through XGBoost and employs advanced fine-tuning techniques,\nalongside ORBERT (Odds Ratio BERT), a novel variant of BERT fine-tuned with\nORPO (Odds Ratio Preference Optimization) for superior class-wise probability\ncalibration and alignment with financial event relevance. We evaluate FANAL's\nperformance against leading large language models, including GPT-4o, Llama-3.1\n8B, and Phi-3, demonstrating its superior accuracy and cost efficiency. This\nframework sets a new standard for financial intelligence and responsiveness,\nsignificantly outstripping existing models in both performance and\naffordability.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"8g9PSYx5OxdZvtVadRnrncq_9eBeWojL3QOaLpWp5_Y","pdfSize":"900913"}
