This requires splitting these triangle Artin groups as\ngraphs of groups and then proving that each of these graphs of groups has\nfinite stature with respect to its vertex groups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sQ1-kHYpNO0kVaBDrnR0gWAhKroiN9mJj-ZSD15RDRU","pdfSize":"3500313"}
