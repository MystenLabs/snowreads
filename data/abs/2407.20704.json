Our goal in this work is to map out the\nQPT-CPT diagram of the $\\phi^4$ QFT, and study its relation to the well-known\nQPT-CPT phase diagram of the Ising model. To do this, we propose a modification\nof the usual finite-temperature Renormalization Group (RG) approach by relating\nthe temperature parameter to the running RG scale, $T \\equiv k_T = \\tau k$\nwhere $k_T$ is the running cutoff for thermal, and $k$ is for the quantum\nfluctuations. In this case, the temperature is related to the dimensionless\nquantity $\\tau$. We apply this new thermal RG approach for the $\\phi^4$ model\nin lower dimensions and construct its QPT-CPT phase diagram. We formulate\nrequirements for the QPT-CPT phase diagram of the $\\phi^4$ theory based on\nknown properties of the QPT-CPT phase diagram of the Ising model. Finally, we\nuse these requirements to check the viability of the thermal RG method proposed\nin this work.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"T1slbxsn7Jq3naml4xlA8C_4otsRNTKV4sDIuktKIR8","pdfSize":"547455"}
