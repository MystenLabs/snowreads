We cover the techniques to perform the\nexact gravitational path integral of two-dimensional dilaton-gravity, and\nsupergravity, over spacetimes with arbitrary topology, with an application to\nblack holes. We discuss the connection with random matrix models and moduli\nspaces of hyperbolic surfaces briefly, since those concepts were covered in\nother lectures of the school.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EjF0q0nDoaMTFdo0U5hJcZClti479j9RUOSCU4j-src","pdfSize":"1158626"}
