The dynamic nature of data in these areas underscores the need\nfor models that can continuously adapt to new video data without losing\npreviously acquired knowledge, highlighting the critical role of advanced\ncontinual action recognition. To address these challenges, we propose Decoupled\nPrompt-Adapter Tuning (DPAT), a novel framework that integrates adapters for\ncapturing spatial-temporal information and learnable prompts for mitigating\ncatastrophic forgetting through a decoupled training strategy. DPAT uniquely\nbalances the generalization benefits of prompt tuning with the plasticity\nprovided by adapters in pretrained vision models, effectively addressing the\nchallenge of maintaining model performance amidst continuous data evolution\nwithout necessitating extensive finetuning. DPAT consistently achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across several challenging action recognition\nbenchmarks, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of our model in the domain of\ncontinual action recognition.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mgWxJV-yMZMMABRVCfxDTLSwPkOCLel6ZBWXw_XrrrQ","pdfSize":"642573"}
