  "abstract": "  Due to its inherent intertwinement with irreversibility, entropy production\nis a prime observable to monitor in systems of active particles. In this\nnumerical study, entropy production in the liquid, hexatic and solid phases of\na two-dimensional system of active Brownian particles is examined at both\naverage and fluctuation level. The trends of averages as functions of density\nshow no singularity and marked changes in their derivatives at the\nhexatic-solid transition. Distributions show instead peculiar tail structures\ninterpreted by looking at microscopic configurations. Particles in regions of\nlow local order generate tail values according to different dynamical\nmechanisms: they move towards empty regions or bounce back and forth into close\nneighbours. The tail structures are reproduced by a simple single-particle\nmodel including an intermittent harmonic potential.\n",
