  "abstract": "  In image reconstruction, an accurate quantification of uncertainty is of\ngreat importance for informed decision making. Here, the Bayesian approach to\ninverse problems can be used: the image is represented through a random\nfunction that incorporates prior information which is then updated through\nBayes' formula. However, finding a prior is difficult, as images often exhibit\nnon-stationary effects and multi-scale behaviour. Thus, usual Gaussian process\npriors are not suitable. Deep Gaussian processes, on the other hand, encode\nnon-stationary behaviour in a natural way through their hierarchical structure.\nTo apply Bayes' formula, one commonly employs a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nmethod. In the case of deep Gaussian processes, sampling is especially\nchallenging in high dimensions: the associated covariance matrices are large,\ndense, and changing from sample to sample. A popular strategy towards\ndecreasing computational complexity is to view Gaussian processes as the\nsolutions to a fractional stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE). In\nthis work, we investigate efficient computational strategies to solve the\nfractional SPDEs occurring in deep Gaussian process sampling, as well as MCMC\nalgorithms to sample from the posterior. Namely, we combine rational\napproximation and a determinant-free sampling approach to achieve sampling via\nthe fractional SPDE. We test our techniques in standard Bayesian image\nreconstruction problems: upsampling, edge detection, and computed tomography.\nIn these examples, we show that choosing a non-stationary prior such as the\ndeep GP over a stationary GP can improve the reconstruction. Moreover, our\napproach enables us to compare results for a range of fractional and\nnon-fractional regularity parameter values.\n",
