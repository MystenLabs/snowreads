We\nintegrate this circuit with a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) to transport the\nelectrons on helium and characterize its performance. We show that this circuit\nhas a Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) of $\\thicksim$ 2$\\frac{e}{\\sqrt{Hz}}$ at 102\nkHz, an order of magnitude improvement from previous implementations and\nprovides a compelling alternative to few electron sensing with high frequency\nresonators.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"l0Aun9_ICTOah3GQGx-wtNCfdtC61IvV6qyFU6WuA9s","pdfSize":"2222031"}
