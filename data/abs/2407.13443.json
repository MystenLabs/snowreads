When restricted to the divisor of curves with an odd semicanonical\npencil $\\mathcal{T}_6^o$, it is still generically finite, but of degree\nstrictly smaller. In this paper, we prove that $\\mathcal{P}_6$ restricted to\n$\\mathcal{T}_6^o$ is birational and that the monodromy group over the image of\n$\\mathcal{T}_6^o$ is the Weyl group $WD_5$. Thus, there are two other\nirreducible divisors in the moduli space of Prym curves $\\mathcal{R}_6$ and the\ndegree of $\\mathcal{P}_6$ restricted to them is 10 and 16. Moreover, we study\nthe geometry of the divisor where $\\mathcal{P}_6$ has degree 10.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"2MQkPA6jBKFglzqqcFNJ6VJnKqCdZhG7LdTcdMQGWvc","pdfSize":"250138"}
