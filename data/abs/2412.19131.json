  "abstract": "  This letter demonstrates how synthetic inertia can be obtained with the\ncontrol of flexible discrete devices to keep the power balance of power\nsystems, even if the system does not include any synchronous generator or\nconventional grid-forming converter. The letter also discusses solutions to\ncycling issues, which can arise due to the interaction of uncoordinated\ndiscrete inertia controllers. The effectiveness, dynamic performance, and\nchallenges of the proposed approach are validated through simulations using\nmodified versions of the WSCC 9-bus test system and of the all-island Irish\ntransmission system.\n",
