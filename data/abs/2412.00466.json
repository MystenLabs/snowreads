We analyze the sufficient number of tests needed for approximate set\nidentification, i.e., for identifying almost all the defective and\nnon-defective items with high confidence. To this end, we view the group\ntesting problem as a function learning problem and develop our analysis using\nthe probably approximately correct (PAC) framework. Using this formulation, we\nderive sufficiency bounds on the number of tests for three popular binary group\ntesting algorithms: column matching, combinatorial basis pursuit, and definite\ndefectives. We compare the derived bounds with the existing ones in the\nliterature for exact recovery theoretically and using simulations. Finally, we\ncontrast the three group testing algorithms under consideration in terms of the\nsufficient testing rate surface and the sufficient number of tests contours\nacross the range of the approximation and confidence levels.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bmbZWjGG8c1dN2qR0UT1kVZTkUWOIqOv45YQ0btbBDA","pdfSize":"1523704"}
