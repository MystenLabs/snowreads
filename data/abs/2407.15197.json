The integral Hardy inequality for $1<p\\leq q<\\infty$ is playing\na key role in the proof. Moreover, we also prove the fractional Hardy-Sobolev\ntype inequality on metric measure spaces. In addition, logarithmic\nHardy-Sobolev and fractional Nash type inequalities on metric measure spaces\nare presented. In addition, we present applications on homogeneous groups and\non the Heisenberg group.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"-eknIsokkOhLzkD0KqjGqy8UOcWZlTtaV6MEyyuZftk","pdfSize":"242253"}
