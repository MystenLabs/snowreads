In this paper, we first give the path\nsequences of some graphs and show that the number of paths with length $h$ in a\nstarlike tree is completely determined by its branches of length not more than\n$h-2$. And then we consider whether the path sequence characterizes a graph\nfrom a different point of view and find that any two graphs in some graph\nfamilies are isomorphic if and only if they have the same path sequence.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"g3wx4UKTK3-Sj2n00F7XKuvZSaQHSoKOaMjr1ZREN9s","pdfSize":"192512"}
