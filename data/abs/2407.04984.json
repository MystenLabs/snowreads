These unexpected phases\nare capable of remixing again in the dark under the entropic driving force, the\nprocess of which are now being exclusively studied after mixed-halide\nperovskites have arrived at the final stage of complete phase segregation. Here\nwe show that after the removal of laser excitation from a solid film of\nmixed-halide perovskite nanocrystals with partial phase segregation, the\niodide- and bromide-rich regions can continuously grow in the dark for a\nprolonged time period of several minutes. We propose that this dark phase\nsegregation is sustained by the local electric fields associated with the\nsurface-trapped charge carriers, whose slow dissipation out of mixed-halide\nperovskite nanocrystals causes a delayed occurrence of the reversal phase\nremixing process.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AiYhk7ko3bIt9_rSqh9dVxcYGB_-gYGOfAT2AJK6X9Y","pdfSize":"1263678"}
