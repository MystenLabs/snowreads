However, most rely on a\nlarge number of expert trajectories to increase generalisation and human\nintervention to capture key aspects of the problem, such as domain constraints.\nIn this paper, we propose Continuous Imitation Learning from Observation\n(CILO), a new method augmenting imitation learning with two important features:\n(i) exploration, allowing for more diverse state transitions, requiring less\nexpert trajectories and resulting in fewer training iterations; and (ii) path\nsignatures, allowing for automatic encoding of constraints, through the\ncreation of non-parametric representations of agents and expert trajectories.\nWe compared CILO with a baseline and two leading imitation learning methods in\nfive environments. It had the best overall performance of all methods in all\nenvironments, outperforming the expert in two of them.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"w2K0QmJdZE6ij1cTL0MBTb6_N1D_M6E2tObr8DbvF5E","pdfSize":"938583"}
