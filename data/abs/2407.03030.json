For a metrizable space $X$ and a closed subset $A$\nof it, we construct a map $E$ from the space of metrics on $A$ into the space\nof metrics on $X$ such that $E$ is an extension of metrics and preserves the\nsupremum metrics between metrics.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-sZYVXt1wx_1OXtUUlsQShqj_wVtQnt6uu2zN7ciE98","pdfSize":"350931"}
