  "abstract": "  In this work we compare the SuSAv2 model, based on the superscaling\nphenomenon and the relativistic mean field theory, with charged-current\ninclusive neutrino cross sections from the NOvA and MicroBooNE experiments,\nwhose targets are composed primarily by 12 C and 40 Ar, respectively. The\nneutrino energy in these experiments covers a kinematic range from tens of MeV\nto roughly 20 GeV. Thus, we consider the different reaction mechanisms that\ncontribute significantly to these kinematics, namely quasielastic, two-particle\ntwo-hole meson exchange currents, resonances and deep inelastic scattering\ncontributions.\n",
