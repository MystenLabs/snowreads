  "abstract": "  Deep learning-based image generation has undergone a paradigm shift since\n2021, marked by fundamental architectural breakthroughs and computational\ninnovations. Through reviewing architectural innovations and empirical results,\nthis paper analyzes the transition from traditional generative methods to\nadvanced architectures, with focus on compute-efficient diffusion models and\nvision transformer architectures. We examine how recent developments in Stable\nDiffusion, DALL-E, and consistency models have redefined the capabilities and\nperformance boundaries of image synthesis, while addressing persistent\nchallenges in efficiency and quality. Our analysis focuses on the evolution of\nlatent space representations, cross-attention mechanisms, and\nparameter-efficient training methodologies that enable accelerated inference\nunder resource constraints. While more efficient training methods enable faster\ninference, advanced control mechanisms like ControlNet and regional attention\nsystems have simultaneously improved generation precision and content\ncustomization. We investigate how enhanced multi-modal understanding and\nzero-shot generation capabilities are reshaping practical applications across\nindustries. Our analysis demonstrates that despite remarkable advances in\ngeneration quality and computational efficiency, critical challenges remain in\ndeveloping resource-conscious architectures and interpretable generation\nsystems for industrial applications. The paper concludes by mapping promising\nresearch directions, including neural architecture optimization and explainable\ngeneration frameworks.\n",
