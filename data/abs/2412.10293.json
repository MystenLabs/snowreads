We show\nthat virtual RAAGs of the form $A_{\\phi} = A_{\\Gamma} \\rtimes_{\\phi}\n\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z}$ are $\\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ when $\\phi \\in\n\\mathrm{Aut}(A_{\\Gamma})$ is length-preserving, and so have solvable conjugacy\nproblem. The geometry of these groups, namely the existence of contracting\nelements, allows us to show that the conjugacy growth series of these groups is\ntranscendental. Examples of virtual RAAGs with decidable conjugacy problem for\nnon-length preserving automorphisms are also studied. Finally, we solve the\ntwisted conjugacy problem in RAAGs with respect to length-preserving\nautomorphisms, and determine the complexity of this algorithm in certain cases.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nSQnmBlvzDKieaECMavYrHkhYmVDKGPJJ4rgTIh1A-k","pdfSize":"337677"}
