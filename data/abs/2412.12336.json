In this sense, the electroweak gauge symmetry is restored:\n$(i)$ the physics of the transverse gauge bosons and fermions is described by a\nmassless theory in the unbroken phase; $(ii)$ the longitudinal gauge bosons\nbehave like the Goldstone bosons and join the Higgs boson to restore the\nunbroken $O(4)$ symmetry in the original Higgs sector. Using the unique feature\nof the radiation amplitude zeros in gauge theory, we propose to study the\nelectroweak symmetry restoration quantitatively by examining the processes for\nthe gauge boson pair production $W^\\pm \\gamma,\\ W^\\pm Z$ and $W^\\pm H$ at the\nLHC and a future muon collider.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"08hFZ6QehX-abWEerGMcGDzGYnlurPxVv3mh-bui-6k","pdfSize":"602007"}
