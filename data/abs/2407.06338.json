In this\npaper, we enumerate the set of permutations $\\pi \\in \\mathcal{S}_n$ that avoids\na pattern $\\sigma \\in \\mathcal{S}_3$, whose image $\\theta(\\pi)$ also avoids\n$\\sigma$. We additionally consider what happens under repeated iterations of\n$\\theta$; in particular, we enumerate permutations $\\pi \\in \\mathcal{S}_n$ that\nhave the property that $\\pi$ and its first $k$ iterations under $\\theta$ all\navoid a pattern $\\sigma$. Finally, we consider permutations with the property\nthat $\\pi=\\theta^2(\\pi)$ that avoid a given pattern $\\sigma$, and end the paper\nwith some directions for future study.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"f6PdN7FkK0LT_Wo1MJ3SqEyWIHIPm8bLnC0GOcKgG-E","pdfSize":"222249"}
