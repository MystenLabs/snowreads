This limit has typically been regarded as incalculable. However, in\nseveral highly non-trivial cases, we demonstrate that the dimension can in fact\nbe calculated explicitly. Specifically, the dimension is expressed as the\nsolution to an infinite-degree equation with explicit coefficients, which also\ncorresponds to the spectral radius of a certain linear operator. Our result\nprovides the first non-trivial calculation of the exact Hausdorff dimension of\nsofic sets in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. This is achieved by developing a new technique\ninspired by the work of Kenyon and Peres (1998).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"J0Ct9HXX--kpHZxg-Afe1im_TNKbdprsAYBPt_G1SRQ","pdfSize":"451769"}
