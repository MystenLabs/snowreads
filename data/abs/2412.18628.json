  "abstract": "  We study the problem of allocating the revenues raised via paid subscriptions\nto music streaming platforms among participating artists. We show that the main\nmethods to solve streaming problems (pro-rata, user-centric and families\ngeneralizing them) can be seen as specific (well-known) rules to solve\n(multi-issue) claims problems. Our results permit to provide strong links\nbetween the well-established literature on claims problems and the emerging\nliterature on streaming problems.\n",
