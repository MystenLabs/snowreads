The Novelty-Routine Hypothesis (NRH) states that\nthe right and left hemispheres are used to perform novel and routine tasks\nrespectively, enabling us to learn a diverse range of novel tasks while\nperforming the task capably. Drawing on the NRH, we develop a reinforcement\nlearning agent with specialised hemispheres that can exploit generalist\nknowledge from the right-hemisphere to avoid poor initial performance on novel\ntasks. In addition, we find that this design has minimal impact on its ability\nto learn novel tasks. We conclude by identifying improvements to our agent and\nexploring potential expansion to the continual learning setting.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BRDCzNUJ9MRxqR5J7Q1166uTt6SIU2jpBE4M0eLF2Zc","pdfSize":"2933469"}
