Using the\nnetworked sector-coupled model PyPSA-Eur, we explored the impacts of imposing\nnet-zero emissions globally for the entire EU versus imposing carbon neutrality\nfor each country. Under a global CO2 target, some countries remain net CO2\nemitters, while others become net CO2 absorbers. Forcing net-zero emissions in\nevery country increases system cost by 1.4%, demands varied CO2 prices, and\ntriggers higher investment in direct air capture and renewable capacities. In\nboth scenarios, a significant portion of the captured CO2 is transported across\nEurope either directly in CO2 pipelines or indirectly via solid biomass or\nsynthetic methane gas, methanol, and oil.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Q97Xq9U6ffWCjri8mw_0bGGCA8qH6uiR3PvPFgTKZ5U","pdfSize":"18283451","objectId":"0x0f2600dfd88d2eafbe05ea2f0d78211749fd0b8e0ca22c14cf7f0cd5da5f0e8e","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
