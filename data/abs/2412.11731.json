For this, it employs a sociotechnical software\nsystem that evolves with changing requirements and medical standards. The\ncurrent practice is to manually test CRN's system to prevent faults and ensure\nits dependability. This paper focuses on automatically testing GURI, the CRN's\nmedical rule engine, using a system-level testing tool, EvoMaster, in both its\nblack-box and white-box modes, and a novel CRN-specific EvoMaster-based tool,\nEvoGURI. We empirically evaluate the tools' effectiveness regarding code\ncoverage, errors found, domain-specific rule coverage, and ability to identify\nartificial faults ten versions of GURI. Our results show that all the tools\nachieve similar code coverage and identified a similar number of errors. For\nrule coverage, EvoGURI and EvoMaster's black-box mode produce test suites that\ncover the highest number of rules with Pass, Fail, and Warning results. The\ntest suites of EvoGURI and two EvoMaster white-box tools identify the most\nfaults in a mutation testing experiment. Based on our findings, we recommend\nusing EvoGURI in CRN's current practice. Finally, we present key takeaways and\noutline open research questions for the research community.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"U4sAE3RxA99yJKS7_6xbq-0x70HwnwSpBNTkiwyfV0w","pdfSize":"1625071"}
