Most methods in previous studies learn the semantics and\nsyntax of molecular structures by analyzing molecular graphs or simplified\nmolecular input line entry system (SMILES) strings; however, they do not take\ninto account the drug responses of the biological systems consisting of genes\nand proteins. In this study we propose a deep generative model, Gx2Mol, which\nutilizes gene expression profiles to generate molecular structures with\ndesirable phenotypes for arbitrary target proteins. In the algorithm, a\nvariational autoencoder is employed as a feature extractor to learn the latent\nfeature distribution of the gene expression profiles. Then, a long short-term\nmemory is leveraged as the chemical generator to produce syntactically valid\nSMILES strings that satisfy the feature conditions of the gene expression\nprofile extracted by the feature extractor. Experimental results and case\nstudies demonstrate that the proposed Gx2Mol model can produce new molecules\nwith potential bioactivities and drug-like properties.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qIf9StTwPw9T13PW6CrogsFP32wVJdx6JSNjxotjEyc","pdfSize":"3013925"}
