The\nconstruction produces global C*-correspondences from compatible collections of\nlocal C*-correspondences. When applied to the collection of C*-correspondences\ncapturing local parabolic induction, the construction produces a global\nC*-correspondence that captures adelic parabolic induction.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VgUCdXdXxRAR3UoIMHdYlVLL18KtP6aOK_paLix0kRc","pdfSize":"297776"}
