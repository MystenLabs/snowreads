  "abstract": "  Assuming the equilibrium of the QCD system, we have investigated the critical\nbehavior of sixth-, eighth- and tenth-order susceptibilities of net-baryon\nnumber, through mapping the results in the three-dimensional Ising model to\nthat of QCD. Both the leading critical contribution as well as sub-leading\ncritical contribution from the Ising model are discussed. When considering only\nthe leading critical contribution, the density plots for susceptibilities of\nthe same order demonstrate a consistent general pattern independent on values\nof mapping parameters. As the critical point is approached from the crossover\nside, a negative dip followed by a positive peak is observed in the $\\mu_B$\ndependence of the three different orders of susceptibilities. When sub-leading\ncritical contribution is taken into account, modifications become apparent in\nthe density plots of the susceptibilities. The emergence of negative dips in\nthe $\\mu_B$ dependence of the susceptibilities is not an absolute phenomenon,\nwhile the positive peak structure is a more robust feature of the critical\npoint.\n",
