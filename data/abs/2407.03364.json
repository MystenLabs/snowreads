Rev. B 109, 184409(2024)], Manchon and Pezo\ndevelop a linear (in magnetization) theory, in order to investigate high-order\nharmonic generation (HHG). Here, we show that such linear theory cannot\ndescribe HHG, which, by definition is a nonlinear process.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"i9VPOeB3a1FPWqXqEnw727erzq4yxWJPDWjgEOn3Dsg","pdfSize":"275424"}
