  "abstract": "  The co-occurrence of multiple long-term conditions (MLTC), or multimorbidity,\nin an individual can reduce their lifespan and severely impact their quality of\nlife. Exploring the longitudinal patterns, e.g. clusters, of disease accrual\ncan help better understand the genetic and environmental drivers of\nmultimorbidity, and potentially identify individuals who may benefit from early\ntargeted intervention. We introduce $\\textit{probabilistic modelling of onset\ntimes}$, or $\\texttt{ProMOTe}$, for clustering and forecasting MLTC\ntrajectories. $\\texttt{ProMOTe}$ seamlessly learns from incomplete and\nunreliable disease trajectories that is commonplace in Electronic Health\nRecords but often ignored in existing longitudinal clustering methods. We\nanalyse data from 150,000 individuals in the UK Biobank and identify 50\nclusters showing patterns of disease accrual that have also been reported by\nsome recent studies. We further discuss the forecasting capabilities of the\nmodel given the history of disease accrual.\n",
