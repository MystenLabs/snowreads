  "abstract": "  Fourier pricing methods such as the Carr-Madan formula or the COS method are\nclassic tools for pricing European options for advanced models such as the\nHeston model. These methods require tuning parameters such as a damping factor,\na truncation range, a number of terms, etc. Estimating these tuning parameters\nis difficult or computationally expensive. Recently, machine learning\ntechniques have been proposed for fast pricing: they are able to learn the\nfunctional relationship between the parameters of the Heston model and the\noption price. However, machine learning techniques suffer from error control\nand require retraining for different error tolerances. In this research, we\npropose to learn the tuning parameters of the Fourier methods (instead of the\nprices) using machine learning techniques. As a result, we obtain very fast\nalgorithms with full error control: Our approach works with any error tolerance\nwithout retraining, as demonstrated in numerical experiments using the Heston\nmodel.\n",
