  "abstract": "  Explicit formulas to calculate MV functions in a basis-free representation\nare presented for an arbitrary Clifford geometric algebra Cl(p,q). The formulas\nare based on analysis of the roots of minimal MV polynomial and covers\ndefective MVs, i.e. the MVs that have non-diagonalizable matrix\nrepresentations. The method may be generalized straightforwardly to matrix\nfunctions and to finite dimensional linear operators. The results can find wide\napplication in Clifford algebra analysis.\n",
