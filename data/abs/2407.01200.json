Recently, diverse algorithms have been employed to\ndetect tool wear using single or multiple sources of measurements. In this\nstudy, a deep learning approach is proposed for estimating tool wear,\nconsidering cutting parameters. The model's accuracy and transferability in\ntool wear estimation were assessed with milling experiments conducted under\nvarying cutting parameters. The results indicate that the proposed method\noutperforms conventional methods in terms of both transferability and rapid\nlearning capabilities.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"iW-vQd7_P4yeLCoRBmhqdWzNn2wnAGjnznTEfq0I_sc","pdfSize":"1214053"}
