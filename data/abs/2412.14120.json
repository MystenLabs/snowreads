These give direct combinatorial proofs of several counting\nidentities for these objects.\n  Our method mainly uses two ingredients. First, a slit-slide-sew operation,\nwhich consists in slightly sliding a map along a well-chosen path. Second, the\nstudy of the orbits of natural rerooting operations on the considered classes\nof oriented maps.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8IBg7T13nezlODZIy-VY1uTxJwUeltlMcaiKMpCq9Uo","pdfSize":"1059491"}
