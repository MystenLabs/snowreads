Using MnF$_2$ as a\nrepresentative material, exhibiting non-relativistic spin splitting in its\nelectronic bands, we identify an equivalent $d$-wave splitting in magnon modes\nof specific handedness. Our study reveals a direct correlation between magnonic\nand electronic splittings, showing that the energy splitting in both magnon and\nelectronic bands can be tuned by jointly modulating the A$_{2u}$ and A$_{1g}$\nphonon modes with frequencies of 8.52 and 9.74 THz, respectively. These\nfindings highlight the intricate interplay between charge, spin, and lattice\ndegrees of freedom in spin-split antiferromagnets, offering new pathways for\nphonon-driven control in magnonic applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3Hs14sHD-v_3UmjTrsyuyZHbhflWAwLIaavj0JVM6Ps","pdfSize":"1472033"}
