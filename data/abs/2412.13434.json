We introduce the asymptotic domain $D_{\\infty}$ for\nthe domain $D$. Then under acceptable assumptions on $D$, we show that for\nlocalized initial data, the velocity of particles is asymptotically supported\nin the (closure of the) asymptotic domain $\\overline{D_{\\infty}}$ and the\nsolutions exhibit the asymptotics of modified scattering.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Gyf7QFjbNu72owo17pZnyS0lAuZcRrc44bm62LBPqxQ","pdfSize":"693190"}
