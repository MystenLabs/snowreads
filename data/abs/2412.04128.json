  "abstract": "  We propose a Lorentzian wormhole geometry characterized by a closed string\nmassless sector with nontrivial $H$-flux and a scalar dilaton. In the string\nframe, the dilaton exhibits a negative kinetic term, enabling the existence of\nthe wormhole. The geometry consists of three distinct regions. The middle\nregion contains the throat, and its boundaries with the other two regions form\nnon-Riemannian two-spheres, where a fundamental string becomes chiral, akin to\na non-relativistic string. While point-particle geodesics are complete within\neach region and non-traversable across regions, strings perceive the geometry\ndifferently, allowing a chiral string to traverse freely.\n",
