We carry out the analysis for urban scenarios, where\nthe considered blocking elements are buildings that are primarily parallel to\nthe streets. We also present numerical simulations based on actual building\nfeatures of the city of Chicago to validate the obtained expressions.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"V5prgf38WN6mj_zbKC-eiOlX_INQdLjZmE5OaAjpEJY","pdfSize":"852112"}
