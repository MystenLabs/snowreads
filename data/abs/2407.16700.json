Quarks are presented as elastic modulations of the\nvacuum crystal. The complementing modes are identified with colors, and\ndistinctions between flavors are attributed to asymmetries of the vacuum\nlattice. Repercussion of the theory include insights into the nature of quantum\nuncertainty and dark matter and energy.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4pU7Lb2ilfk7Ie81BWZxFLBFIvb89SmGTCLv-L8sSXw","pdfSize":"98345"}
