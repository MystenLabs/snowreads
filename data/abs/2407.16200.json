Typically, operational constraints imposed on the mine site are\nsatisfied by heuristic controllers or human operators independent of the\ndispatch planning. This article incorporates operational constraint\nsatisfaction into the dispatch planning by utilising the MCTS based dispatch\nplanner Flow-Achieving Scheduling Tree (FAST). Operational constraint violation\nand satisfaction are modelled as opportunity costs in the combinatorial\noptimisation problem of dispatch. Explicit cost formulations are avoided by\nutilising MCTS generator models to derive opportunity costs. Experimental\nstudies with four types of operational constraints demonstrate the success of\nutilising opportunity costs for constraint satisfaction, and the effectiveness\nof integrating constraints into dispatch planning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"09hulBahDQNqzzJTTcg_IyCexeMjjTOKWJyFzO1pqAQ","pdfSize":"1477254","objectId":"0x827c39517a422368e49c5ed5ccb2e7c8757996ae70d49b8d01eca94756782b99","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
