Timely detection and\nintervention are crucial for reducing healthcare expenses and improving patient\noutcomes. This paper examines the limitations of traditional sepsis screening\ntools like Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome, Modified Early Warning\nScore, and Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, highlighting the need for\nadvanced approaches. We propose using machine learning techniques - Random\nForest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Decision Tree models - to predict sepsis\nonset. Our study evaluates these models individually and in a combined\nmeta-ensemble approach using key metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall,\nF1 score, and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve. Results\nshow that the meta-ensemble model outperforms individual models, achieving an\nAUC-ROC score of 0.96, indicating superior predictive accuracy for early sepsis\ndetection. The Random Forest model also performs well with an AUC-ROC score of\n0.95, while Extreme Gradient Boosting and Decision Tree models score 0.94 and\n0.90, respectively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"_CmUPzKBUrCIW3e0qIEmR9s9_Pt9DM1d6WHc7qqKysc","pdfSize":"395146"}
