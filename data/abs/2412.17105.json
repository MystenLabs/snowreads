  "abstract": "  We propose a method for detecting the electrode positions in lithium-ion\nbatteries. The process begins by identifying the region of interest (ROI) in\nthe battery's X-ray image through corner point detection. A convolutional\nneural network is then used to regress the pole positions within this ROI.\nFinally, the regressed positions are optimized and corrected using corner point\npriors, significantly mitigating the loss of localization accuracy caused by\noperations such as feature map down-sampling and padding during network\ntraining. Our findings show that combining traditional pixel gradient analysis\nwith CNN-based heatmap regression for keypoint extraction enhances both\naccuracy and efficiency, resulting in significant performance improvements.\n",
