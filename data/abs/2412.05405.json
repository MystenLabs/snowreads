In this article, we\npresent the design and implementation of a device for real-time monitoring of\nrespiratory system movements. When breathing, the circumference of the abdomen\nand thorax changes; therefore, we used a Force Sensing Resistor (FSR) attached\nto the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) to measure this variation as the patient\ninhales and exhales. The mechanical strain this causes changes the FSR\nelectrical resistance accordingly. Also, for streaming this variable resistance\non an Internet of Things (IoT) platform, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 5 is\nutilized due to the adequate throughput, high accessibility, and possibility of\npower consumption reduction. Furthermore, this device presents features such as\nlow power consumption (0.4 mW), high precision, and ease of use.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9dTbwi6HKauN6tMzceaerqRTHhSR_USBFFHGMVhj2Cc","pdfSize":"545127"}
