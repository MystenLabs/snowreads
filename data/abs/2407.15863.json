While this\noccurrence is thoroughly documented for many forms of supervised learning, it\nis not well examined in the context of unsupervised learning. In this work we\nexamine the nature of overfitting in unsupervised contrastive learning. We show\nthat overfitting can indeed occur and the mechanism behind overfitting.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PPm-JPbkVgqz8no7TFEk1A1V2qbQ-ByxL6KA9Nv3ER0","pdfSize":"216434"}
