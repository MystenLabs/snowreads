  "abstract": "  A new architecture of CNN hardware accelerator is presented. Convolutional\nNeural Networks (CNNs) are a subclass of neural networks that have demonstrated\noutstanding performance in a variety of computer vision applications, including\nobject detection, image classification, and many more.Convolution, a\nmathematical operation that consists of multiplying, shifting and adding a set\nof input values by a set of learnable parameters known as filters or kernels,\nwhich is the fundamental component of a CNN.The Karatsuba Ofman multiplier is\nknown for its ability to perform high-speed multiplication with less hardware\nresources compared to traditional multipliers. This article examines the usage\nof the Karatsuba Ofman Multiplier method on FPGA in the prominent CNN designs\nAlexNet, VGG16, and VGG19.\n",
