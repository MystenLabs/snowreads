Our spectropolarimetric\nanalysis indicates that a non-thermal double power-law (PL) spectral model can\nfit the phase-averaged intensity data well, with the soft and hard components\ndominating below and above around 5 keV, respectively. We find that the soft PL\nexhibits a polarization degree (PD) of about 20% while the hard X-ray PL\ndisplays a PD of about 50%; both components have a polarization angle (PA)\ncompatible with 0 degree. These results are supported through model-independent\npolarization analysis which shows an increasing PD from about 15% to 70% in the\n2-3 keV and 6-8 keV ranges, respectively, while the PA remains consistent with\n0 degree. We find marginal evidence for variability in the polarization\nproperties with pulse phase, namely a higher PD at spin phases coinciding with\nthe peak in the hard X-ray pulse. We compare the hard X-ray PL to the\nexpectation from direct resonant inverse Compton scattering (RICS) and\nsecondary pair cascade synchrotron radiation from primary high-energy RICS\nphotons, finding that both can provide reasonable spectropolarimetric agreement\nwith the data, yet, the latter more naturally. Finally, we suggest that the\nsoft power law X-ray component may be emission emanating from a Comptonized\ncorona in the inner magnetosphere.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"w3F1yaxaj1My2efzEFHbPMHwB7367qRza7Wgv6sIqpI","pdfSize":"1021384"}
