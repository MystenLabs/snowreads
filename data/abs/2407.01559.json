In this paper, we\npresent three data-driven reconstruction methods for EIT imaging. These three\napproaches were originally submitted to the Kuopio tomography challenge 2023\n(KTC2023). First, we introduce a post-processing approach, which achieved first\nplace at KTC2023. Further, we present a fully learned and a conditional\ndiffusion approach. All three methods are based on a similar neural network as\na backbone and were trained using a synthetically generated data set, providing\nwith an opportunity for a fair comparison of these different data-driven\nreconstruction methods.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_fQtCl84qxsIdHOrvMwkg9a3wR3AdCFhmsbuGgu7e3s","pdfSize":"3555842"}
