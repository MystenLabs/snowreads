The traditional agent\nthen learns to maximize these outputs in a hierarchical manner, conditioning\neach level on the maximization of the preceding level. We derive an equation\nthat orders these scalar values and the global reward by priority, inducing a\nhierarchy of needs that informs goal formation. Experimental results on the\nPendulum v1 environment demonstrate superior performance compared to a baseline\nimplementation.We achieved state of the art results.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JTa73PIL03rrVKICG9UQ5ZE7IUKy0Ys056BNLF3n5xM","pdfSize":"260382"}
