  "abstract": "  Multi-class semantic segmentation remains a cornerstone challenge in computer\nvision. Yet, dataset creation remains excessively demanding in time and effort,\nespecially for specialized domains. Active Learning (AL) mitigates this\nchallenge by selecting data points for annotation strategically. However,\nexisting patch-based AL methods often overlook boundary pixels critical\ninformation, essential for accurate segmentation. We present OREAL, a novel\npatch-based AL method designed for multi-class semantic segmentation. OREAL\nenhances boundary detection by employing maximum aggregation of pixel-wise\nuncertainty scores. Additionally, we introduce one-vs-rest entropy, a novel\nuncertainty score function that computes class-wise uncertainties while\nachieving implicit class balancing during dataset creation. Comprehensive\nexperiments across diverse datasets and model architectures validate our\nhypothesis.\n",
