Moreover it does not suffer from the\nstrong regime limitations of the previous distinguishers or structure recovery\nalgorithms: in particular, it applies to the codes used in the Classic McEliece\ncandidate for postquantum cryptography standardization. The invariants that\nallow us to distinguish are graded Betti numbers of the homogeneous coordinate\nring of a shortening of the dual code.\n  Since its introduction in 1978, this is the first time an analysis of the\nMcEliece cryptosystem breaks the exponential barrier.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4ImxFnREh0nagzml8vlnskDamqoPQvlRJ-PD8QkULeQ","pdfSize":"401725"}
