In this setting, the language of\nuncertainty quantification (UQ) provides quantitative metrics of assessing\noverlaps and discrepancies between models. We leverage recent machine learning\n(ML) developments in evidential deep learning (EDL) for UQ to separate data\n(aleatoric) and knowledge (epistemic) uncertainties in a model discrimination\nsetting. In this study, we construct several potentially BSM-motivated\nscenarios for the anomalous electroweak interaction (AEWI) of neutrinos with\nnucleons in deep inelastic scattering ($\\nu$DIS). These scenarios are then\nquantitatively mapped, as a demonstration, alongside Monte Carlo replicas of\nthe CT18 PDFs used to calculate the $\\Delta \\chi^{2}$ statistic for a typical\nmulti-GeV $\\nu$DIS experiment, CDHSW. Our framework effectively highlights\nareas of model agreement and provides a classification of out-of-distribution\n(OOD) samples. By offering the opportunity to identify unexplored regions of\nparameter space while understanding domains of model overlap, the approach\npresented in this work can help facilitate efficient BSM model exploration and\nexclusion for future New Physics searches.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"siEK3Nfnei-gCsAcQhBZ-muy-pggybn_XVVZMh6_C68","pdfSize":"3748001"}
