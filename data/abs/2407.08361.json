Firstly, we formulate\nan optimization problem to obtain a linear representation of a nonlinear vector\nfield based on a system's trajectory. We also prove that its cost function is\nstrictly convex, given the trajectory is persistently exciting. Under certain\nobservability conditions, we provide results that guarantee the Hurwitz\nstability of the global minimizer. Secondly, we present a novel algorithm based\non point-wise geometric flows to estimate the boundary of the region of\nattraction. We show that the algorithm converges to the exact boundary of the\nregion of attraction under certain assumptions on the system dynamics. Finally,\nwe validate the results using simulations on various nonlinear autonomous\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"BvWlewP56hgpO_aVV8DwCA5J8aKgBDtILskoLKTrJ04","pdfSize":"471160"}
