Yet, integrating these two fields in a\nsingular system has remained challenging. Here, we introduce the concept of van\nder Waals (vdW) heterostructure metasurfaces, where ultrathin multilayer vdW\nmaterial stacks are shaped into precisely engineered resonant nanostructures\nfor boosting light-matter interactions. By leveraging quasi-bound states in the\ncontinuum to create intrinsic cavities from WS$_2$ monolayers encapsulated in\nhexagonal boron nitride, we observe room-temperature strong coupling and\npolaritonic luminescence, which further unveils a saturation of the\nstrong-coupling regime at ultralow fluences <1 nJ/cm2, more than three orders\nof magnitude smaller than in previous 2D-cavity systems. Our approach,\nseamlessly merging metasurfaces and vdW materials, unlocks new avenues for\nultrathin optical devices with atomic-scale precision and control.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"tPYL5O3s_BM3f9VChA54_bC_NmJYvnpaN6JqIqLqdDk","pdfSize":"2126818","objectId":"0x021aa88c8a73b904f04cbaa976f440822f5371edaf275b828221d257fe2b7481","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
