Structural and mechanical properties of the flat\n(F), low-buckled (LB), high-buckled (HB), full dumbbell (FD), trigonal dumbbell\n(TD), honeycomb dumbbell (HD) and large honeycomb dumbbell (LHD) monolayer tin\n(stanene) phases, were gained by means of the density functional theory (DFT)\nand molecular statics (MS) calculations with ten different Tersoff, modified\nembedded atom method (MEAM) and machine-learning-based (ML-IAP) interatomic\npotentials. A systematic quantitative comparison and discussion of the results\nare reported.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wclx5oJhSeBoU1qi06Mz7I5uV54Z108VvaZiiYsKIZ4","pdfSize":"1100800"}
