This invites us to study them with the\ntools of invariant theory. Applying this technology, we spotlight three classes\nof accidental symmetries that hold to all orders for non-derivative\ninteractions. They are broken by derivative interactions and become ordinary\nfinite-order accidental symmetries. To systematically understand the origin and\nthe patterns of accidental symmetries, we introduce a novel mathematical\nconstruct - a (non-transitive) binary relation between subgroups that we call\n$friendship$. Equipped with this, we derive new criteria for all-order\naccidental symmetries in terms of $friends$, and criteria for finite-order\naccidental symmetries in terms of $friends\\ ma\\ non\\ troppo$. They allow us to\nverify and identify accidental symmetries more efficiently without computing\nthe Hilbert series. We demonstrate the success of our new criteria by applying\nthem to a variety of sample accidental symmetries, including the custodial\nsymmetry in the Higgs sector of the Standard Model effective field theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3rhimgRb7_rvjSRjbU6B56ujVgpZRsIR9pHwlKpgeRM","pdfSize":"1524584"}
