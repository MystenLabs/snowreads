Differential $p$-forms of degrees $p=1,2,n-1,n$ with constant\ncoefficients on a smooth $n$-dimensional manifold $M$ are characterized. In the\ncontravariant case, the obstruction for a $q$-vector field $V_q$ to have\nconstant coefficients is proved to be the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket of $V_q$\nwith itself. The $q$-vector fields with constant coefficients of degrees\n$q=1,2,n-1,n$ are also characterized. The notions of differential $p$-forms and\n$q$-vector fields with conformal constant coefficients are introduced. For\narbitrary degrees $p$ and $q$, such differential $p$-forms and $q$-vector\nfields are seen to be the solutions to two second-order partial differential\nsystems on $J^2(M,\\mathbb{R}^n)$, which are reducible to two first-order\npartial differential systems by adding variables. Computational aspects in\nsolving these systems are discussed and examples and applications are also\ngiven.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"OvBWSSAstEvWhfaPc4NtaJWKhGW3a8aMYNL_yvDgYow","pdfSize":"230412"}
