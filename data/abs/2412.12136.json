We propose a novel theorem demonstrating how nonlinear dynamics\nwithin a single mapping can induce chaos across a collective system, even when\nother components lack sensitivity. To validate these insights, we introduce\nadvanced computational algorithms implemented in MATLAB, capable of detecting\nand visualizing key chaotic features such as transitivity, sensitivity, and\nperiodic points. The results unveil new behaviors in higherdimensional systems,\nbridging theoretical advances with practical applications in physics, biology,\nand economics. By uniting rigorous mathematics with computational innovation,\nthis study lays a foundation for future exploration of nonlinear dynamics in\ncomplex systems, offering transformative insights into the interplay between\nstructure and chaos.
