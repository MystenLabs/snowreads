The equations yield two candidates for\neffective Hamiltonian constraints dependent on a quantum parameter. The\nresulting quantum modified black hole spacetimes are analyzed. Particularly,\nour models show improvement by casting off the known limitations of previous\nworks with similar results.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NZnGVM9L5U8daFGCnQDUhiL8zV-NUymEnjVIb3SqBCA","pdfSize":"1342629"}
