However,\nthose ratings have recently been criticized for being hard to understand and\nnearly impossible to reproduce.\n  An independent way to find out about the sustainability practices of\ncompanies lies in the rich landscape of news article data. In this paper, we\nexplore a different approach to identify key opportunities and challenges of\ncompanies in the sustainability domain. We present a novel dataset of more than\n840,000 news articles which were gathered for major German companies between\nJanuary 2023 and September 2024. By applying a mixture of Natural Language\nProcessing techniques, we first identify relevant articles, before summarizing\nthem and extracting their sustainability-related sentiment and aspect using\nLarge Language Models (LLMs). Furthermore, we conduct an evaluation of the\nobtained data and determine that the LLM-produced answers are accurate.
