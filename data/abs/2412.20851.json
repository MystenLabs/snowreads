  "abstract": "  The article is devoted to the study of neural networks with one hidden layer\nand a modified activation function for solving physical problems. A rectified\nsigmoid activation function has been proposed to solve physical problems\ndescribed by the ODE with neural networks. Algorithms for physics-informed\ndata-driven initialization of a neural network and a neuron-by-neuron\ngradient-free fitting method have been presented for the neural network with\nthis activation function. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of\nneural networks with a rectified sigmoid function over neural networks with a\nsigmoid function in the accuracy of solving physical problems (harmonic\noscillator, relativistic slingshot, and Lorentz system).\n",
