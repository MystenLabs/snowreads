It focuses on how nonlinearities induce bifurcations and\nchaotic dynamics. By using Lyapunov functions, bifurcation theory, and\nnumerical simulations, we identify critical transitions that lead to complex\nbehaviors like strange attractors and chaos. The findings provide a theoretical\nframework for applications in optimization, machine learning, and biological\nmodeling. Key contributions include stability conditions, characterization of\nchaotic regimes, and methods for managing nonlinear instabilities in\ninterdisciplinary systems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Xm3_pBZhdZ7evYObZ4HbxXIc9oMwLq6Vc8LhAm4qw48","pdfSize":"637126"}
