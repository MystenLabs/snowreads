{"id":"2412.15993","title":"Fearful Falcons and Angry Llamas: Emotion Category Annotations of\n  Arguments by Humans and LLMs","authors":"Lynn Greschner and Roman Klinger","authorsParsed":[["Greschner","Lynn",""],["Klinger","Roman",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Dec 2024 15:41:47 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-23","timestamp":1734709307000,"abstract":"  Arguments evoke emotions, influencing the effect of the argument itself. Not\nonly the emotional intensity but also the category influence the argument's\neffects, for instance, the willingness to adapt stances. While binary\nemotionality has been studied in arguments, there is no work on discrete\nemotion categories (e.g., \"Anger\") in such data. To fill this gap, we\ncrowdsource subjective annotations of emotion categories in a German argument\ncorpus and evaluate automatic LLM-based labeling methods. Specifically, we\ncompare three prompting strategies (zero-shot, one-shot, chain-of-thought) on\nthree large instruction-tuned language models (Falcon-7b-instruct,\nLlama-3.1-8B-instruct, GPT-4o-mini). We further vary the definition of the\noutput space to be binary (is there emotionality in the argument?),\nclosed-domain (which emotion from a given label set is in the argument?), or\nopen-domain (which emotion is in the argument?). We find that emotion\ncategories enhance the prediction of emotionality in arguments, emphasizing the\nneed for discrete emotion annotations in arguments. Across all prompt settings\nand models, automatic predictions show a high recall but low precision for\npredicting anger and fear, indicating a strong bias toward negative emotions.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"6KMK4Qrrae7emJg5tDRNQEb-0VZArnPz8PEDDTm3SgU","pdfSize":"784057"}
