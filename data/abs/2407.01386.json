We extend previous theoretical work\non the topic to handle real-world complications, namely unknown valve\ncharacteristics and hysteresis. We generate two datasets in the Smart Water\nInfrastructure laboratory in Aalborg, Denmark, on which we evaluate the\nproposed procedure. In the first data set the system is controlled in such a\nway to excite all operational modes in terms of combinations of valve\nset-points. Here the best performing model predicted volume flow rates within\nroughly 5 and 10 \\% deviation from the mean volume flow rate for the consumer\nwith the highest and lowest mean volume flow rates respectively. This\nperformance was met in the majority of the operational region. In the second\ndata set, the system was controlled in order to mimic real load curves. The\nmodel trained on this data set performed similarly well when evaluated on data\nin the operational range represented in the training data. However, the model\nperformance deteriorated when evaluated on data which was not represented in\nthe training data.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EfYswvLOUpJXmpCEHSQlsse2IcDj8OD4AyM9CTI0Mfg","pdfSize":"6241447"}
