  "abstract": "  Accurate channel modeling plays a pivotal role in optimizing communication\nsystems, especially as new frequency bands come into play in next-generation\nnetworks. In this regard, fitting field measurements to stochastic models is\ncrucial for capturing the key propagation features and to map these to\nachievable system performances. In this work, we shed light onto what's the\nmost appropriate alternative for channel fitting, when the ultimate goal is\nperformance analysis. Results show that average-error metrics should be used\nwith caution, since they can largely fail to predict outage probability\nmeasures. We show that supremum-error fitting metrics with tail awareness are\nmore robust to estimate both ergodic and outage performance measures, even when\nthey yield a larger average-error fitting.\n",
