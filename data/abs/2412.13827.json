In a recent paper, Dar et al. \\cite{RD} proved\nthat the zeros of a quaternionic polynomial and the left eigenvalues of the\ncorresponding companion matrix are identical. Building on this, we employ\nvarious newly developed matrix techniques to establish several results\nconcerning the location of the zeros of regular polynomials of a quaternionic\nvariable with quaternionic coefficients. These findings significantly enhance\nthe understanding of quaternionic polynomials and their eigenvalues, offering a\nbroader perspective on their mathematical properties.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uGyaKuowqa-6Dw1oNVrOoxFVRbHaxpRwBMt5W5YM4PQ","pdfSize":"169826"}
