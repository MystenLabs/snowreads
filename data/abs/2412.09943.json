  "abstract": "  We prove the low Mach number limit of non-isentropic ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations with general initial data in the half-space\nwhose boundary satisfies the perfectly conducting wall condition. By observing\na special structure contributed by Lorentz force in vorticity analysis, we\nestablish uniform estimates in suitable anisotropic Sobolev spaces with weights\nof Mach number determined by the number of material derivatives. We also\nobserve that the entropy has the enhanced regularity in the direction of the\nmagnetic field. These two observations help us get rid of the loss of\nderivatives and weights of Mach number in vorticity analysis caused by the\nsimultaneous appearance of entropy, general initial data and the magnetic\nfield, which is one of the major difficulties that do not appear in Euler\nequations or the isentropic problems. By utilizing the technique of Alinhac\ngood unknowns, the anti-symmetric structure is preserved in the tangential\nestimates for the system differenetiated by high-order material derivatives.\n",
