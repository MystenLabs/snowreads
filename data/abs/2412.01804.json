  "abstract": "  In this paper, we discuss the Baikov representation of Feynman integrals in\nits standard and loop-by-loop variants. The Baikov representation is a\nparametric representation, which has as its defining feature the fact that the\nintegration variables are the propagators of the Feynman integral. For the\nloop-by-loop Baikov representation, we discuss in detail a strategy for how to\nmake an optimal parametrization which is one that minimizes the number of extra\nintegration variables that have to be introduced for a given Feynman integral.\nFurthermore, we present a Mathematica implementation, named BaikovPackage, that\nis able to generate the Baikov representation in its standard and loop-by-loop\nvarieties. We also discuss some subtleties and open problems regarding Baikov\nrepresentations.\n",
