Here we extend\nour earlier results for the charges associated to these superphaserotations to\nall orders in the coupling and prove that their conservation is exactly the\nclassical logarithmic soft photon theorem discovered by Saha, Sahoo and Sen in\n1912.06413. We furthermore generalize the formulae for the associated\nelectromagnetic displacement memory and its tail from particles to scalar\nmatter fields. This completes the classical superphaserotation infrared\ntriangle.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZSXBEM6-OZGtSkvevmrvASEZb7vFaEkj1JYz99fBt8c","pdfSize":"906831"}
