Rev. C 110, 014623 (2024)], we,\nin this work, propose to study charge-changing and interaction cross sections\nfor the said isotopes on 12C at a wider range of incident energies (200-1050\nMeV/nucleon), involving different density distributions; the calculations also\nassess the importance of nuclear medium effects. Working within the framework\nof Glauber model, we involve two-parameter Fermi (2pF) and three-parameter\nFermi (3pF) shapes of density distributions, and use the in-medium as well as\nfree behavior of the nucleon-nucleon (NN) amplitude. The results provide enough\nground in support of the matter radii of exotic isotopes obtained using SDHO\ndensities.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6k7Xcn-qx0wxLUWjYLBRZnoBnhZam25v_8iEnPOcXSU","pdfSize":"1483022"}
