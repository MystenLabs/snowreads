  "abstract": "  In order to demonstrate the limitations of assistive robotic capabilities in\nnoisy real-world environments, we propose a Decision-Making Scenario analysis\napproach that examines the challenges due to user and environmental\nuncertainty, and incorporates these into user studies. The scenarios highlight\nhow personalization can be achieved through more human-robot collaboration,\nparticularly in relation to individuals with visual, physical, cognitive,\nauditory impairments, clinical needs, environmental factors (noise, light\nlevels, clutter), and daily living activities. Our goal is for this\ncontribution to prompt reflection and aid in the design of improved robots\n(embodiment, sensors, actuation, cognition) and their behavior, and we aim to\nintroduces a groundbreaking strategy to enhance human-robot collaboration,\naddressing the complexities of decision-making under uncertainty through a\nScenario analysis approach. By emphasizing user-centered design principles and\noffering actionable solutions to real-world challenges, this work aims to\nidentify key decision-making challenges and propose potential solutions.\n",
