A particularly intriguing\nproperty of IFSs, especially relevant to cosmology, is that they violate the\nNull Energy Condition (NEC). In this paper, we begin to explore their\ncosmological effects. We find that NEC violation by IFSs is significantly\nsuppressed in an expanding universe, leading to a universe that resembles our\nown, comprising matter, radiation, and dark energy. Upon closer examination,\nthese components exhibit subtle, nonstandard traits that could be\nexperimentally tested in the future. Notably, the origin of dark energy stems\nnot only from the potential, as is usually the case, but also from the\nderivative of the potential with respect to the dilaton. This paves the way for\na new approach to realizing inflation within string theory, addressing the\nDine-Seiberg problem associated with dilaton stabilization, and perhaps even\nhinting at a novel mechanism to tackle the cosmological constant problem.\nConversely, in a contracting universe, the effects of IFSs are amplified,\nmaking bouncing cosmologies a natural and prevalent outcome.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JsW70QkviFR-ozDK_SmMYPIMqr2aKE73SIcbU8Q6a3U","pdfSize":"1459772"}
