Rigorous developments in this area include the\nsemiclassical noise and dissipation kernels which are obtained in terms of\nquantum stress energy tensor composed of scalar fields. The present article\nforms an important step in an effort to extend the theory in the decoherence\nlimit and hydrodynamic approximation of the scalar fields. Such extensions will\nmake it possible to analyse the extended structure formation around the\ndecoherence era of the inflaton field in cosmology. On the other hand,\nmodelling dissipation in fluids and effective fluids is a challenge and long\nstanding mathematical physics related hurdles have posed difficulties for\nprogress in this direction.The present article marks the beginning of a new way\nto model dissipation in an effective fluid using the widely accepted\ncorrespondence between the semiclassical fields and effective fluid\napproximation. A similar approach has been recently carried out for noise\n(fluctuations) kernel correspondence between the two, we now touch upon\ndissipation in the relativistic effective fluids.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"n9JvuynPS_nmuVMJI1ORG50R3uYJhU1F2rv5BzHXS3w","pdfSize":"140399"}
