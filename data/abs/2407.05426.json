We delve\ninto various applications of AI in manufacturing, with a particular emphasis on\nhuman-machine interfaces (HMI) and AI-powered milling machines, showcasing how\nthese technologies contribute to more intuitive operations and precision in\nproduction processes. Through rigorous market analysis, the paper presents\ninsightful data on AI adoption rates among German manufacturers, comparing\nthese figures with global trends and exploring the specific uses of AI in\nproduction, maintenance, customer service, and more. In addition, the paper\nexamines the emerging field of Generative AI and the potential applications of\nlarge language models in manufacturing processes. The findings indicate a\nsignificant increase in AI adoption from 6% in 2020 to 13.3% in 2023 among\nGerman companies, with a projection of substantial economic impact by 2030. The\nstudy also addresses the challenges faced by companies, such as data quality\nand integration hurdles, providing a balanced view of the opportunities and\nobstacles in AI implementation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kFxXxjFmgxTmIVRJ5mjXAlUbp8Kwp1JGB0P28g48_DI","pdfSize":"582900"}
