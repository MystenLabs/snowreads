  "abstract": "  This work focuses on the numerical study of a recently published class of\nRunge-Kutta methods designed for mixed-precision arithmetic. We employ the\nmethods in solving partial differential equations on modern hardware. In\nparticular we investigate what speedups are achievable by the use of mixed\nprecision and the dependence of the methods algorithmic compatibility with the\ncomputational hardware. We use state-of-the-art software, utilizing the Ginkgo\nlibrary, which is designed to incorporate mixed precision arithmetic, and\nperform numerical tests of 3D problems on both GPU and CPU architectures. We\nshow that significant speedups can be achieved but that performance depends on\nsolver parameters and performance of software kernels.\n",
