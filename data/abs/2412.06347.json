For quark-line\nconnected diagrams at large separations, most of this additional variance can\nbe efficiently suppressed by the introduction of hierarchical subspaces, thanks\nto the reduced size of the coarse grid operators that act within the subspaces.\nIn this work, we investigate the contributions to the variance of the isovector\nvector current correlator with $N_{\\mathrm f}=2$ non-perturbatively $\\mathrm\nO(a)$-improved Wilson fermions on lattices approximately of size $L=2,3$ and\n$4$ $\\mathrm {fm}$. The numerical results obtained confirm that the variance\ndecreases as the volume is increased when a multigrid decomposition is used\nwith a fixed number of low modes. While the proposed decomposition can be\napplied to any quark propagator, it is expected to be especially effective for\nquark-line connected diagrams at large separations, for example, the isovector\ncontribution to the hadronic vacuum polarization or baryonic correlators.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wimqxKv3jJGysHrYZBgLUM29UDN15cBexsmolzMTGGs","pdfSize":"1057975"}
