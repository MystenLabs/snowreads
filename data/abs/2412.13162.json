  "abstract": "  The dipole anisotropy induced by our peculiar motion in the sky distribution\nof cosmologically distant sources is an important consistency test of the\nstandard FLRW cosmology. In this work, we formalize how to compute the\nkinematic matter dipole in redshift bins. Apart from the usual terms arising\nfrom angular aberration and flux boosting, there is a contribution from the\nboosting of the redshifts that becomes important when considering a sample\nselected on observed redshift, leading to non-vanishing correction terms. We\ndiscuss examples and provide expressions to incorporate arbitrary redshift\nselection functions. We also discuss the effect of redshift measurement\nuncertainties in this context, in particular in upcoming surveys for which we\nprovide estimates of the correction terms. Depending on the shape of a sample's\nredshift distribution and on the applied redshift cuts, the correction terms\ncan become substantial, even to the degree that the direction of the dipole is\nreversed. Lastly, we discuss how cuts on variables correlated with observed\nredshift, such as color, can induce additional correction terms.\n",
