We show that the damping rate of the quasinormal frequencies is\nstrongly suppressed by both the magnetic field and the mass term, with\nindications that arbitrarily long-lived modes, or quasi-resonances, may exist\nin the spectrum. In the time domain, the quasinormal ringing transitions into\nslowly decaying oscillatory tails, which are qualitatively distinct from the\nmassive tails observed in the absence of a magnetic field. For nonzero\nmultipole and azimuthal numbers, the power-law envelope characteristic of cases\nwithout a magnetic field transforms into an oscillatory envelope that cannot be\neasily fitted with a simple analytical formula.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"Xw9Uxw2JThJ6J58GoewHktPICdHky52lcTudTaBTiao","pdfSize":"915228"}
