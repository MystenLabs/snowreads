In order to address this issue, a statistical testing of the\nhypothesis problem is formalized, and the test statistic is formed based on the\nestimated second derivative of the unknown transformation. The asymptotic\nproperties of the test statistics are investigated using some advanced\ntechniques related to the empirical process. Moreover, to implement the test\nfor small sample size data, a Bootstrap algorithm is proposed, and it is shown\nthat the Bootstrap version of the test is as good as the original test for\nsufficiently large sample size. Furthermore, the utility of the proposed\nmethodology is shown for simulated data sets, and DTI data is analyzed using\nthis methodology.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wQ_CJGnWbjIDDLxIiK96WQhvlt-m5_nVxbyWLm1iZpE","pdfSize":"911998"}
