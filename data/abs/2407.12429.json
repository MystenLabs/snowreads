These oscillations arise\nfrom quantum beats between two size-quantized states of the condensate, split\nin energy due to the trap's ellipticity. By precisely targeting specific spots\ninside the trap with non-resonant laser pulses, we control the frequency,\namplitude, and phase of these quantum beats. The condensate wavefunction\ndynamics are visualized on a streak camera and mapped to the Bloch sphere,\ndemonstrating Hadamard and Pauli-Z operations. We conclude that a qubit based\non a superposition of these two polariton states would exhibit a coherence time\nexceeding the lifetime of an individual exciton-polariton by at least two\norders of magnitude.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"P9MQqIrYqSzs8oTIe0s9FKSOZIIEIMofcCnW63ueBB4","pdfSize":"9915361"}
