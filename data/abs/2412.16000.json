We first explore the significant role that\nguided modes including surface plasmon modes play in the collective decay of\nidentical singlephoton emitters (super- and subradiance). Surprisingly, on\ndistances relevant for collective emission, the guided or surface-plasmon modes\ndo not always enhance the collective emission. We identify configurations with\ninhibition, and others with enhancement of the dipole interaction due to the\nguided modes. We interpret our results in terms of local and cross densities of\noptical states. In the same structure, we show a remarkably favorable\nconfiguration for enhanced F\\\"orster resonance energy transfer between a donor\nand acceptor in the dielectric layer on a metallic substrate. We compare our\nresults to theoretical limits for energy transfer efficiency.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MeomZV0kw_pe6ffHJI-7EnSUDvgxmJsW_0t70G3BwBE","pdfSize":"2447076"}
