The developed package is computationally efficient, and it can be\ninvoked in R. Furthermore, the package is open-ended -- it can flexibly\naccommodate new randomization procedures and evaluate their statistical\nproperties via simulation. It may be also helpful for validating other\nrandomization methods for which software is not readily available. In summary,\nInsertus.jl can be used as ``Lego Blocks'' to construct a fit-for-purpose\nrandomization procedure for a given clinical trial design.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"V0vcx9_E3AmlGo11TBT9c-AT0e6QDiHSUS78nEo0wsM","pdfSize":"2115195","objectId":"0x71538123486088c9994b120c599b8f2aa2141afd54ba8a2e0ffe6af2bc4a9ba7","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
