  "abstract": "  We find implicit general solutions for modified eikonal equations $u_a\nu_a=F(u_t)$, where lower indices at dependent variables designate derivatives,\n$a=1,2,..,n$, and summation is implied over the repeated indices. We will\nconsider the general solutions and symmetries of these equations.\n",
