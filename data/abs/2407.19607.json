We find that\ndepartments exert an attractive force over early-career newcomer faculty, who\nafter their incorporation increase their within-department collaborations, and\nwork on topics closer to those of incumbent faculty. However, these\ncollaborations are not gender blind: Newcomers collaborate less than expected\nwith female senior incumbents. The analysis of departments grouped by fraction\nof female incumbents reveals that female newcomers in departments with above\nthe median fractions of female incumbents tend to select research topics\nfarther from their department than female newcomers in the remaining\ndepartments -- a difference we do not observe for male newcomers. Our results\nsuggest a relationship between the collaboration deficit with female incumbents\nand the selection of research topics of female early-faculty, thus highlighting\nthe importance of studying research environments to fully understand gender\ndifferences in academia.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"lMtIBV66DZl9i7j2UOa86CZpXYKsa_0_G5AQ1C0UNs8","pdfSize":"492256"}
