  "abstract": "  This paper develops an analytic study on the existence and properties of\nsolitary waves on 1D chains of lumped masses and nonlinear springs, which\nexhibit a mechanical response similar to that of tensegrity prisms with\nlocking-type response under axial loading. Making use of the Weierstrass'\ntheory of 1D Lagrangian conservative systems, we show that such waves exist and\nthat their shapes depend on the wave speed. A progressive localization of the\ntraveling pulses in narrow regions of space is observed as the wave speed\nincreases up to a limit value. A comparative analysis illustrates that the\npresented study is able to capture the wave dynamics observed in previous\nnumerical studies on tensegrity mass-spring chains.\n",
