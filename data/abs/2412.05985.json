  "abstract": "  In previous work, all finite simple groups that act with fixity 4 have been\nclassified. In this article we investigate which ones of these groups act\nfaithfully on a compact Riemann surface of genus at least 2 with fixity four in\ntotal and in such a way that fixity 4 is exhibited on at least one orbit.\n",
