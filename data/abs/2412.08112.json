However,\nthese models often rely on duration generated by external tools like the\nMontreal Forced Aligner, which can be time-consuming and lack flexibility. The\nimportance of accurate duration is often underestimated, despite their crucial\nrole in achieving natural prosody and intelligibility. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel Aligner-Guided Training Paradigm that\nprioritizes accurate duration labelling by training an aligner before the TTS\nmodel. This approach reduces dependence on external tools and enhances\nalignment accuracy. We further explore the impact of different acoustic\nfeatures, including Mel-Spectrograms, MFCCs, and latent features, on TTS model\nperformance. Our experimental results show that aligner-guided duration\nlabelling can achieve up to a 16\\% improvement in word error rate and\nsignificantly enhance phoneme and tone alignment. These findings highlight the\neffectiveness of our approach in optimizing TTS systems for more natural and\nintelligible speech generation.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Sound","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5roenmKJZmZEqXGzYe7B2qrI-zbgj561ZYHBDFJBH9U","pdfSize":"522678"}
