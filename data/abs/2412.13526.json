  "abstract": "  Model merging combines multiple fine-tuned models into a single one via\nparameter fusion, achieving improvements across many tasks. However, in the\nclassification task, we find a misalignment issue between merging outputs and\nthe fine-tuned classifier, which limits its effectiveness. In this paper, we\nfirst demonstrate the following observations: (1) Merging outputs exhibit the\ncomparable cluster effect with fine-tuned outputs, and already contain\nnecessary classification information; (2) The misalignment between merging\noutputs and the fine-tuned classifier can converge to an orthogonal\ntransformation, and alleviating this misalignment can significantly enhance the\nperformance of merging models. Based on these observations, we then propose a\nnew protocol FT-Classifier, which fine-tunes an aligned classifier with\nfew-shot unlabeled samples, enabling better evaluation of merging methods and\nimproved classification performance.\n",
