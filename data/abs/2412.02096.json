In this study, we\nnumerically investigate the dynamics of a single active particle in a medium\ncomposed of mixtures of rigid and flexible rings. We observe a non-monotonic\ndependence of diffusivity on the relative fraction of rigid to flexible rings,\nleading to the identification of an optimal composition for enhanced diffusion.\nThis long-time non-monotonic diffusion, likely resulting from the different\nresponses of the active particle to rigid and flexible rings, is coupled with\ntransient short-time trapping. The probability distribution of trapping\ndurations is well described by the extended entropic trap model. We further\nestablish a universal relationship between particle activity and the optimal\nrigid-to-flexible ring ratio for diffusion, which aligns closely with our\nnumerical results.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0rCsUeWDHEXn34TaJJpr6BibY48W_a1hyBFGR3Aqpd8","pdfSize":"499224"}
