  "abstract": "  The coherent interaction between free electrons and optical fields can\nproduce free-electron compression and push the temporal resolution of ultrafast\nelectron microscopy to the attosecond regime. However, a large electron-light\ninteraction is required to attain a strong compression, generally necessitating\nshort light and electron pulses combined with optical scattering at\nnanostructures. Here, we theoretically investigate an alternative configuration\nbased on stimulated Compton scattering, whereby two counterpropagating Gaussian\nlight beams induce energy jumps in a colinear electron beam by multiples of\ntheir photon-energy difference. Strong recoil effects are produced by extending\nthe electron-light interaction over millimetric distances, enabling a dramatic\nincrease in temporal compression and substantially reshaping the electron\nspectra for affordable laser powers. Beyond its fundamental interest, our work\nintroduces a practical scheme to achieve a large temporal compression of\ncontinuous electron beams without involving optical scattering by material\nstructures.\n",
