To enhance robustness in these safety critical\napplications, this paper considers a Deep Ensemble of Deep Neural Network\nregressors integrated with Conformal Prediction to predict and quantify\nuncertainties. In the Adaptive Cruise Control setting, the proposed method\nperforms state and uncertainty estimation from RGB images, informing the\ndownstream controller of the DNN perception uncertainties. An adaptive cruise\ncontroller using Conformal Tube Model Predictive Control is designed to ensure\nprobabilistic safety. Evaluations with a high-fidelity simulator demonstrate\nthe algorithm's effectiveness in speed tracking and safe distance maintaining,\nincluding in Out-Of-Distribution scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Robotics","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"87Dv0NgiG7GV3Z3bTiq3y3xCbZQj0ZRkVB6X1zN4tGw","pdfSize":"5654745"}
