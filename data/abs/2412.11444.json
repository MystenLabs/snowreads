We identify and analyze saddle point solutions and examine their\ncontributions within the perturbative expansions of the ground state energy,\nrevealing that the ambiguity structure observed in the $\\mathbb{CP}^1$ model\npersists in the deformed model as well. Additionally, we explore the role of\nthe elongation parameter and its potential impact on higher-loop corrections,\nand propose that it becomes relevant in shaping the system's quantum behavior\nfrom the three-loop level. This verifies that the trans-series framework\nprovides a comprehensive approach to capturing the structure of quantum\nfluctuations and ambiguities in these deformed sigma models.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bslNCVlabfxFjVnkSwF3NKC_FuJX1Cq6WvpE-RbYGbY","pdfSize":"1072832"}
