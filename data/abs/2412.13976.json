  "abstract": "  This note describes the validation of material allowing the reinterpretation\nof an ATLAS search for decays of pair-produced neutral long-lived particles\ndecaying in the hadronic part of the calorimeter, or at the edge of the\nelectromagnetic calorimeter, using the full Run-2 ATLAS dataset. This\nreinterpretation material includes an efficiency map linking truth-level\nkinematic information (decay position, transverse momentum and decay products\nof the LLPs) to the probability of the reconstructed event being selected in\nthe analysis signal region. In this document we describe the validation\nprocedure, i.e. how the map was used to recover the limits presented in the\nATLAS publication using events generated with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO and hadronised\nusing Pythia8, and we identify some limitations of this approach. We moreover\ncomment upon issues concerning the validation procedure itself, in particular\nwith regards to whether or not the information included in the existing,\npublished material allows for an external user to test recasting methods.\n",
