Furthermore, a nearest-action selection approach is\nused to map the continuous measurements to a realizable action where we show\nthat the approach satisfies a weak sector condition for multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) systems. Using the notion of input-to-state stability,\nunder some assumptions imposed on the transfer function of the system, we show\nthat the closed-loop system converges to the target ball exponentially fast.\nMoreover, when logarithmic extension for the scaling factors is realizable, the\nclosed-loop system is able to achieve asymptotic stability instead of only\npractical stability. Finally, we present an example of the application that\nconfirms our analysis.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computer Science/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Klj9l7tX2qXAHwM1zYYf2S-_Wro21AEwlm-_fTh2IdI","pdfSize":"702706"}
