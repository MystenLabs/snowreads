Such observations have in turn spurred exciting developments in design\nand analysis algorithms that exploit quasar-convexity. In this work, we study\nthe online stochastic quasar-convex optimization problems in a dynamic\nenvironment. We establish regret bounds of online gradient descent in terms of\ncumulative path variation and cumulative gradient variance for losses\nsatisfying quasar-convexity and strong quasar-convexity. We then apply the\nresults to generalized linear models (GLM) when the underlying parameter is\ntime-varying. We establish regret bounds of online gradient descent when\napplying to GLMs with leaky ReLU activation function, logistic activation\nfunction, and ReLU activation function. Numerical results are presented to\ncorroborate our findings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"aoPXN0t6RfWQ7y0bF_tNUEln2XwPBNaNsuCDHW4LOn4","pdfSize":"482079"}
