  "abstract": "  We show the existence and uniqueness of solutions to a generalized\nMonge-Amp\\`{e}re equation on closed almost K\\\"ahler surfaces, where the\nequation depends only on the underlying almost K\\\"ahler structure. As an\napplication, we prove Donaldson's conjecture for tamed almost complex\n4-manifolds.\n",
