Given any symmetric quadrature rule on a triangle $T$ that is\nexact for polynomials of a specific degree $d$, we investigate if it remains\nexact for sufficiently smooth splines of the same degree $d$ defined on the\nClough-Tocher 3-split or the (uniform) Powell-Sabin 6-split of $T$. We show\nthat this is always true for $C^{2r-1}$ splines having degree $d=3r$ on the\nformer split or $d=2r$ on the latter split, for any positive integer $r$. Our\nanalysis is based on the representation of the considered spline spaces in\nterms of suitable simplex splines.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Miq7INTChrKeaAiehV03EsHWfsZ8pxFRjKDLWxmSr6A","pdfSize":"581291"}
