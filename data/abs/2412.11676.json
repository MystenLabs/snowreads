  "abstract": "  Hyperbolism of a given curve with respect to a point and a line is an\ninteresting construct, a special kind of geometric locus, not frequent in the\nliterature. While networking between two different kinds of mathematical\nsoftware, we explore various cases, involving quartics, among them the\nso-called Kuelp quartic and topologically equivalent curves, and also an\nexample with a sextic and a curve of degree 12. By a similar but different way,\nwe derive a new construction of a lemniscate of Gerono. First, parametric\nequations are derived for the curve, then we perform implicitization Groebner\nbases packages and using elimination. The polynomial equation which is obtained\nenables to check irreducibility of the constructed curve.\n",
