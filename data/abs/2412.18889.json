The particle\nspectrum can be understood through an analogy to quantum mechanical scattering,\nin which the dynamics of the spacetime metric determine the shape of the\nscattering potential. Hallmark scattering phenomena such as resonant forward\nscattering and Bragg reflection are connected to their cosmological\ncounterparts, namely linearly expanding space and bouncing universes. We\ncompare our findings to a theoretical description that extends beyond the\nacoustic approximation, which enables us to apply the model to high-momentum\nexcitations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8EsG_0eyNk3qmaqevfLmm92beNF9blzj-OCS2aHvwB8","pdfSize":"1525573"}
