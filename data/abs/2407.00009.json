In response to this challenge, we present an open-source\nparallel routing methodology designed to expedite routing procedures for\ncommercial FPGAs. Our approach introduces a novel recursive partitioning\nternary tree to augment the parallelism of multi-net routing. Additionally, we\npropose a hybrid updating strategy for congestion coefficients within the\nrouting cost function to accelerate congestion resolution in negotiation-based\nrouting algorithms. Evaluation on public benchmarks from the FPGA24 routing\ncontest demonstrates the efficacy of our parallel router. It achieves a 2x\nspeedup compared to the academic serial router RWRoute. Furthermore, when\ncompared to the industry-standard tool Vivado, our approach not only delivers a\n2x acceleration but also yields a notable 31% enhancement in critical-path\nwirelength.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"M1ku-mEVSwe6xDSwJ_MZ6SpIlSBDhpeOxoGRSFiKuhI","pdfSize":"1670552"}
