  "abstract": "  Autonomous inspection of infrastructure on land and in water is a quickly\ngrowing market, with applications including surveying constructions, monitoring\nplants, and tracking environmental changes in on- and off-shore wind energy\nfarms. For Autonomous Underwater Vehicles and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles\noverfitting of controllers to simulation conditions fundamentally leads to poor\nperformance in the operation environment. There is a pressing need for more\ndiverse and realistic test data that accurately represents the challenges faced\nby these systems. We address the challenge of generating perception test data\nfor autonomous systems by leveraging Neural Radiance Fields to generate\nrealistic and diverse test images, and integrating them into a metamorphic\ntesting framework for vision components such as vSLAM and object detection. Our\ntool, N2R-Tester, allows training models of custom scenes and rendering test\nimages from perturbed positions. An experimental evaluation of N2R-Tester on\neight different vision components in AUVs and UAVs demonstrates the efficacy\nand versatility of the approach.\n",
