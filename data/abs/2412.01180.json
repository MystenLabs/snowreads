  "abstract": "  This study presented a novel method to prepare hexagonal iron flakes with\nhexagonal close-packed structures (hcp) on the copper oxide sublayers. Also, it\ndemonstrated that the size and structure of iron grains are functions of\nsublayer features. The sublayer was prepared by sputtering copper on the glass\nsubstrate and annealing it. As the annealing temperature of the copper sublayer\nincreased, the oxygen percentage increased and copper oxide rods were formed.\nHexagonal iron flakes were formed after sputtering iron on this sublayer. The\nXRD analysis showed that these hexagonal flakes have a close-packed hexagonal\nstructure. This finding was further confirmed by the magnetic properties of the\nsamples and by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.\n",
