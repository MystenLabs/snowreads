  "abstract": "  Smart Home Assistants (SHAs) have become ubiquitous in modern households,\noffering convenience and efficiency through its voice interface. However, for\nDeaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) individuals, the reliance on auditory and\ntextual feedback through a screen poses significant challenges. Existing\nsolutions primarily focus on sign language input but overlook the need for\nseamless interaction and feedback modalities. This paper envisions SHAs\ndesigned specifically for DHH users, focusing on accessibility and inclusion.\nWe discuss integrating augmented reality (AR) for visual feedback, support for\nmultimodal input, including sign language and gestural commands, and context\nawareness through sound detection. Our vision highlights the importance of\nconsidering the diverse communication needs of the DHH community in developing\nSHA to ensure equitable access to smart home technology.\n",
