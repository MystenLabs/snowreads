  "abstract": "  We study the nuclear compositions and neutrino reaction rates in the central\nregion of the core-collapse supernova, assuming the existence of dineutrons\n($^2n$) and tetraneutrons ($^4n$). At 100 ms after core bounce, $^2n$ and $^4n$\nare more abundant than deuterons within radii of approximately 100 km and 50\nkm, respectively. Compared to the model ignoring the existence of $^2n$ and\n$^4n$, the mass fraction of neutrons up to a radius of 100 km reduces. Hence,\nthe neutrino absorption and antineutrino emission rates decrease by\napproximately 40%-50%. Conversely, those of protons, deuterons, and $^4He$\nincrease, leading to the increase in the neutrino emission and antineutrino\nabsorption rates by approximately eight times within a radius of 100 km.\n",
