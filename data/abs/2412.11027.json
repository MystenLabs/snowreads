Jansen","authorsParsed":[["Zeng","Yaoxuan",""],["Jansen","Malte F.",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Dec 2024 02:42:36 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-17","timestamp":1734230556000,"abstract":"  Symmetric instability has broad applications in geophysical fluid dynamics.\nIt plays a crucial role in the formation of mesoscale rainbands at\nmid-latitudes on Earth, instability in the ocean's mixed layer, and slantwise\nconvection on gas giants and in the oceans of icy moons. Here, we apply linear\ninstability analysis to an arbitrary zonally symmetric Boussinesq flow on a\nrotating spherical planet, with applicability to planetary atmospheres and icy\nmoon oceans. We characterize the instabilities into three types: (1)\ngravitational instability, occurring when stratification is unstable along\nangular momentum surfaces, (2) inertial instability, occurring when angular\nmomentum shear is unstable along buoyancy surfaces, and (3) a mixed ``PV''\ninstability, occurring when the potential vorticity has the opposite sign as\nplanetary rotation. We note that $N^2>0$, where $N$ is the Brunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a\nfrequency, is neither necessary nor sufficient for stability. Instead, $b_z\n\\sin{\\theta}>0$, where $b_z$ is the stratification along the planetary rotation\naxis and $\\theta$ is latitude, is always necessary for stability and also\nsufficient in the low Rossby number limit. In the low Rossby number limit,\napplicable to convection in the oceans of icy moons and in the atmospheres of\ngas giants, the most unstable mode is slantwise convection parallel to the\nplanetary rotation axis.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HbJSpYj_g32GjjQoCqflqcReR9LDAecwCkpftb8rIP4","pdfSize":"2159081"}
