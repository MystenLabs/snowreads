While knowledge distillation methods\ncould overcome label scarcity and device heterogeneity, they assume the\nteachers are fully reliable and overlook the data heterogeneity, which prevents\nthe direct adoption of existing models. To address this problem, this paper\nproposes a framework, HaT, to expand learning systems. It first selects\nmultiple high-quality models from the system at a low cost and then fuses their\nknowledge by assigning sample-wise weights to their predictions. Later, the\nfused knowledge is selectively injected into the customized models based on the\nknowledge quality. Extensive experiments on different tasks, modalities, and\nsettings show that HaT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 16.5%\naccuracy and saves up to 39% communication traffic.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kwR2_-cdTfasJVrZ7rkQ9yeuKiuDwULwvgi72568w4w","pdfSize":"1159197"}
