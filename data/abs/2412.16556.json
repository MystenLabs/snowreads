This study delves into the developmental\ntrajectory of Mandarin-speaking children's acquisition of recursive possessives\nand locatives, assessing the impact of structural diversity on language\nacquisition. The research contrasts the comprehension of two-level recursive\nstructures among children aged 3 to 7 years, employing answering question while\nseeing a picture task to elicit responses. The findings indicate that children\ndo not attain adult-like proficiency in two-level recursion until the age of 6,\nand there exists a notable asymmetry in the acquisition of recursive\npossessives versus locatives. These results underscore the primacy of\nstructural complexity and cognitive factors in the acquisition process,\nenhancing our comprehension of the cognitive foundations of language\ndevelopment and the pivotal role of recursion in child language acquisition.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"ci1WMkvybM6v9a-igaAyoGbQk4aCkSyDb3qVJvEFZug","pdfSize":"1714021"}
