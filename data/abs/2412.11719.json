Focusing on scholars who\npublished at least three papers, the study underscores the resilience of these\nscholars, who continued their academic endeavours within their homeland despite\nthe conflict. The research utilizes data from the Social Sciences Citation\nIndex (SSCI) and the Arts & Humanities Citation Index (AHCI) to illustrate\ntheir continued scientific contributions under adverse conditions. It also\nhighlights the crucial role of international collaboration in supporting\nUkrainian SSH research, emphasizing that such collaborations primarily manifest\nthrough joint research projects rather than relocation of scholars to foreign\ninstitutions.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Digital Libraries"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AqMY6qtccrjQP6RQUKWqy-tW1cT03D02MpcKh5wRvEI","pdfSize":"459681"}
