We show how the stationary, axisymmetric sector of General Relativity\ncan be described by the boundary dynamics of a four-dimensional Chern-Simons\ntheory. This approach shows promise for simplifying solution generating methods\nin both General Relativity and higher-dimensional supergravity theories. The\nfour-dimensional Chern-Simons theory presented generalises those for flat space\nintegrable models by introducing a space-time dependent branch cut in the\nspectral plane. We also make contact with twistor space approaches to\nintegrability, showing how the branch cut defects of four-dimensional\nChern-Simons theory arise from a discrete reduction of six-dimensional\nChern-Simons theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3xpByA-P-uXzDADFcNtB69QBNueBjYM7uKvvtcHSQ-M","pdfSize":"818472"}
