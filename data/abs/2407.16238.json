In order to protect important data, developers and system\nadministrators must be trained and made aware of possible threats. Practical\ntraining can be used for students alike to introduce them to the topic. A\nconstant threat to websites that require user authentication is so-called\nbrute-force attacks, which attempt to crack a password by systematically trying\nevery possible combination. As this is a typical threat, but comparably easy to\ndetect, it is ideal for beginners. Therefore, three open-source blue team\nscenarios are designed and systematically described. They are contiguous to\nmaximize the learning effect.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZZXYfmpRk7YHbRmo1onAbNRM0mbjC6AzZdGPkjJKq6Q","pdfSize":"477681"}
