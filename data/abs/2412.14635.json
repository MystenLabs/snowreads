  "abstract": "  This survey is devoted to the geography problem of log-surfaces constructed\nas pairs consisting of a smooth projective surface and a reduced boundary\ndivisor. In the first part we focus on the geography problem for log-surfaces\nassociated with pairs of the form $(\\mathbb{P}^{2}, C)$, where $C$ is an\narrangement of smooth plane curves admitting ordinary singularities. In\nparticular, we focus on the case where $C$ is an arrangement of smooth rational\ncurves. In the second part, containing original new results, we study log\nsurfaces constructed as pairs consisting of a $K3$ surface and a rational curve\narrangement. In particular, we provide some combinatorial conditions for such\npairs to have the log-Chern slope equal to $3$. Our survey is illustrated with\nmany explicit examples of log-surfaces.\n",
