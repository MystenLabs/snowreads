At three loops, it was observed that\nelliptic integrals contribute to this observable. This prompts the question of\nwhich classes of functions appear at the next order. We report on the status of\nour calculation with a focus on the mathematical structures that emerge at four\nloops.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"S_Tr-_rDnskqimZyumbzJTSY2wBj2vlIX1H5k4NoIb8","pdfSize":"192599"}
