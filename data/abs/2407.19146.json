First, using smoothing properties of solution operators\nfor linear subdiffusion and a perturbation argument, we prove several\npointwise-in-time regularity estimates that are useful for numerical analysis.\nThen we develop a high-order time stepping scheme for solving quasilinear\nsubdiffusion, based on convolution quadrature generated by second-order\nbackward differentiation formula with correction at the first step. Further, we\nestablish that the convergence order of the scheme is\n$O(\\tau^{1+\\alpha-\\epsilon})$ without imposing any additional assumption on the\nregularity of the solution. The analysis relies on refined Sobolev regularity\nof the nonlinear perturbation remainder and smoothing properties of discrete\nsolution operators. Several numerical experiments in two space dimensions show\nthe sharpness of the error estimate.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"z4DC2JsCdwyBtzP4MqpiJ-KcZ_2FxnKZS05mcVDYRcs","pdfSize":"577659","objectId":"0xc836ee45081fee77540aae7274e1e369c0696606b27aeaf29f074d84fdb45f49","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
