The\nhopping amplitude decays with the inter-particle distance $\\|\\bm x\\|$ as\n$e^{-\\log^{\\rho}(\\|\\bm x\\|+1)}$ with $\\rho>1,\\bm x\\in\\Z^d$. By employing the\nmulti-scale analysis (MSA) technique, we prove that for large disorder, the\nrandom operators have pure point spectrum with localized eigenfunctions whose\ndecay rate is the same as the hopping term. This gives a partial answer to a\nconjecture of Yeung and Oono [{\\it Europhys.
