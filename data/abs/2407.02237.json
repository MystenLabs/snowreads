We then prove the foliated component $\\Omega_\\rho^1$ of\n$\\Omega_\\rho$ has exactly two group-invariant foliations by properly embedded\nprojective line segments and has a unique foliation by properly embedded convex\ndomains in projective planes. This gives a finiteness counterpart to work of\nGuichard and Wienhard. We also prove analogues for the non-foliated component\n$\\Omega_\\rho^2$ and deduce a rigidity of projective equivalences of properly\nconvex foliated projective structures on unit tangent bundles of surfaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HdrlcKNeAupsQ2fhclL3T_dEjeNVg_sXlRM6WS_fpuM","pdfSize":"4806075"}
