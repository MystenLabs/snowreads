This transform improves upon the\nwindowed Fourier and wavelet transforms by incorporating angular, scalable, and\nlocalized windows, allowing for greater directional flexibility in multi-scale\nsignal analysis within the Clifford domain. Using operator theory, we explore\nthe core properties of the proposed transform, such as the inner product\nrelation, reconstruction formula, and interval theorem. Practical examples are\nincluded to confirm the validity of the derived results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_MGc7ovir7h4V-V_c2xkLnSul_I81vl_ivdpSvNmCy4","pdfSize":"455986"}
