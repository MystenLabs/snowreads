  "abstract": "  Bilayer crystals, formed by stacking monolayers of two-dimensional (2D)\ncrystals, create interlayer potentials that govern excitonic phenomena but are\nconstrained by their fixed covalent lattices. Replacing one layer with an\natomically thin molecular crystal overcomes this limitation, as precise control\nof functional groups enables tunable 2D molecular lattices and, consequently,\nelectronic structures. Here, we report molecular tuning of lattices and\nexcitons in four-atom-thick hybrid bilayer crystals (HBCs), synthesized as\nmonolayers of perylene-based molecular and transition metal dichalcogenide\n(TMD) single crystals. In HBCs, we observe an anisotropic photoluminescence\nsignal exhibiting characteristics of both molecular and TMD excitons, directly\ntuned by molecular geometry and HBC composition. Ab initio calculations reveal\nthat this anisotropic emission arises from hybrid excitons, which inherit\nproperties from both layers through a hybridized bilayer band structure. Our\nwork establishes a synthetically derived, molecule-based 2D quantum materials\nplatform with the potential for engineering interlayer potentials.\n",
