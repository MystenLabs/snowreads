The advent of numerous facilities\nconducting dedicated FRB searches has dramatically revolutionised the field:\nhundreds of new bursts have been detected, and some are now known to repeat.\nUsing interferometry, it is now possible to localise FRBs to their host\ngalaxies, opening up new avenues for using FRBs as astrophysical probes. One\npromising application is studying gravitationally lensed FRBs. This review\noutlines the requirements for identifying a lensed FRB, taking into account\ntheir propagation effects and the importance of capturing the amplitude and\nphase of the signal. It also explores the different lens masses that could be\nprobed with FRBs throughout the duration of an FRB survey, from stellar masses\nto individual galaxies. This highlights the unique cosmological applications of\ngravitationally lensed FRBs, including measurements of the Hubble constant and\nthe compact object content of dark matter. Finally, we discuss future radio\ninterferometers and the prospects for finding gravitationally lensed FRBs.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rkhLAC1Ok0tz16nLVCWJF5LtaRfFKvvSdb04Ax0bOqI","pdfSize":"554968"}
