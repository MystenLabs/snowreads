Metaverse has the\nprospective to extend the physical world using virtual and augmented reality so\nthe users can interact seamlessly with the real and virtual worlds using\navatars and holograms. It has the potential to impact people in the way they\ninteract on social media, collaborate in their work, perform marketing and\nbusiness, teach, learn, and even access personalized healthcare. Several works\nin the literature examine Metaverse in terms of hardware wearable devices, and\nvirtual reality gaming applications. However, the requirements of realizing the\nMetaverse in realtime and at a large-scale need yet to be examined for the\ntechnology to be usable. To address this limitation, this paper presents the\ntemporal evolution of Metaverse definitions and captures its evolving\nrequirements. Consequently, we provide insights into Metaverse requirements. In\naddition to enabling technologies, we lay out architectural elements for\nscalable, reliable, and efficient Metaverse systems, and a classification of\nexisting Metaverse applications along with proposing required future research\ndirections.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MbDUgc3hMOq8Gtl_j6VLbUc7NKzYcc7n4lkxr4YZ054","pdfSize":"1185097"}
