  "abstract": "  We theoretically propose a scheme to synthesize photonic non-Abelian electric\nfield and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the synthetic frequency dimension based\non a polarization-multiplexed time-modulated ring resonator. Inside the ring\nresonator, the cascade of polarization-dependent phase modulation, polarization\nrotation, and phase retardation enables a photonic realization of minimal SOC\ncomposed of equal Rashba and Dresselhaus terms. The synthetic bands and\nassociated spin textures can be effectively probed by the continuous-wave\npolarization- and time-resolved band structure measurements. Meanwhile, the\npulse dynamics in the frequency dimension can be manipulated by both synthetic\nAbelian and non-Abelian electric fields, leading to Bloch oscillation,\nZitterbewegung, and their interplay dynamics. Our proposed setup can be\nrealized with free-space optics, fibers, and integrated photonics, and provides\npseudospin control knobs for large-scale synthetic lattices based on frequency\ncombs.\n",
