In this paper, the concept of varextropy for\ndoubly truncated random variables is introduced. The changes of this measure\nunder linear transforms are investigated. Also, lower and upper bounds for the\ninterval varextropy under some conditions are obtained and some other\nproperties for this measure are proved. In the following, three estimators for\nthe interval varextropy are proposed. A simulation study has been carried out\nto investigate the behavior of estimators. At the end, an application for these\nestimators is proposed.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"1BGj3Dfwrj24wOA_j2_HTr19P1OpRA3Cdj3AjVkmJdA","pdfSize":"622910"}
