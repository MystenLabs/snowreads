This\npaper introduces a novel approach to studying identity by enhancing word\nembeddings with socio-demographic information. As a proof of concept, we\ndemonstrate that our approach successfully reproduces and extends established\nfindings regarding gendered self-views. Our methodology can be applied in a\nwide variety of settings, allowing researchers to tap into a vast pool of\nnaturally occurring data, such as social media posts. Unlike similar methods\nalready introduced in computer science, our approach allows for the study of\ndifferences between social groups. This could be particularly appealing to\nsocial scientists and may encourage the faster adoption of computational\nmethods in the field.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"krxRGyGPkT7e3BOY_tBtbDXoFY3cahLUUzV41nPYoKs","pdfSize":"549597","objectId":"0xb176bddc7466849c09c2e9f4aa650c7528cb46512524d26838ef2eb13dcef994","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
