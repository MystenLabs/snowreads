We derive a two-stage approach\nbased on the alternating least squares algorithm followed by the estimation of\nthe signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques to extract the\ntarget parameters. Simulation results show that the proposed tensor-based\nalgorithm yields accurate estimates of the sensing parameters with low\ncomplexity.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fYVcxXefqSAGi0BJM0-XpZ4Ya9NqO0VYotO42FkZ4do","pdfSize":"572730"}
