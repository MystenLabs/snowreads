  "abstract": "  Physics-based differentiable rendering (PBDR) has become an efficient method\nin computer vision, graphics, and machine learning for addressing an array of\ninverse problems. PBDR allows patterns to be generated from perceptions which\ncan be applied to enhance object attributes like geometry, substances, and\nlighting by adding physical models of light propagation and materials\ninteraction. Due to these capabilities, distinguished rendering has been\nemployed in a wider range of sectors such as autonomous navigation, scene\nreconstruction, and material design. We provide an extensive overview of PBDR\ntechniques in this study, emphasizing their creation, effectiveness, and\nlimitations while managing inverse situations. We demonstrate modern techniques\nand examine their value in everyday situations.\n",
