Quantum coherence is susceptible to\ndecoherence because of the interactions with the environment. Dephasing is a\nprocess that destroys the coherence of quantum states, leading to a loss of\nquantum information. In this work, we explore the dynamics of the relative\nentropy of coherence for tripartite pure and mixed states in the presence of\nstructured dephasing environments at finite temperatures. Our findings\ndemonstrate that the system's resilience to decoherence depends on the bath\nconfiguration. Specifically, when each qubit interacts with an independent\nenvironment, the dynamics differ from those observed with a shared bath. In a\nMarkov, memoryless environment, coherence in both pure and mixed states decays,\nwhereas coherence is preserved in the presence of reservoir memory.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fJThjPI9ArJdbpy6lmjLYYiFXu5dBUoIfWzB03lUW48","pdfSize":"931142"}
