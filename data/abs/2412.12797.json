  "abstract": "  A significant debate has emerged in response to a paper written by Steven\nPiantadosi (Piantadosi, 2023) and uploaded to the LingBuzz platform, the open\narchive for generative linguistics. Piantadosi's dismissal of Chomsky's\napproach is ruthless, but generative linguists deserve it. In this paper, I\nwill adopt three idealized perspectives -- computational, theoretical, and\nexperimental -- to focus on two fundamental issues that lend partial support to\nPiantadosi's critique: (a) the evidence challenging the Poverty of Stimulus\n(PoS) hypothesis and (b) the notion of simplicity as conceived within\nmainstream Minimalism. In conclusion, I argue that, to reclaim a central role\nin language studies, generative linguistics -- representing a prototypical\ntheoretical perspective on language -- needs a serious update leading to (i)\nmore precise, consistent, and complete formalizations of foundational\nintuitions and (ii) the establishment and utilization of a standardized dataset\nof crucial empirical evidence to evaluate the theory's adequacy. On the other\nhand, ignoring the formal perspective leads to major drawbacks in both\ncomputational and experimental approaches. Neither descriptive nor explanatory\nadequacy can be easily achieved without the precise formulation of general\nprinciples that can be challenged empirically.\n",
