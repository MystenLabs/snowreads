Utilizing a combination of MFCC features and a\nbidirectional LSTM-based classifier, we effectively address the challenges\nposed by the small amount of expert-annotated vocal data available. Our\napproach significantly reduces false positives and improves the accuracy of\ncall detection in bioacoustic research. Initial results demonstrate an accuracy\nof 95\\% on instance predictions, highlighting the effectiveness of our model in\nidentifying and classifying complex vocal patterns in environmental audio\nrecordings. Moreover, we show how call classification can be done downstream,\npaving the way for real-world monitoring.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JJijN_jWyMyaFigCpMwmz03wVeYisVP9-IUAm7dXTQU","pdfSize":"779891"}
