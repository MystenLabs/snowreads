  "abstract": "  The Muon $g-2$ experiment at Fermilab aims to measure the muon anomalous\nmagnetic moment with an unprecedented precision of 140 parts per billion (ppb).\nData collection concluded in June 2023, and analysis of the largest dataset\n(2021-2023) is underway. Previous publications based on data from 2018-2020\nestablished the experimental foundation. This document provides an overview of\nthe measurement of the muon anomalous spin precession frequency ($\\omega_a$)\nand the associated systematic corrections. The precision of these results\ndirectly tests the Standard Model's completeness, making the experiment a\ncornerstone in the field of particle physics.\n",
