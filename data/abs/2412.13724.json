  "abstract": "  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are crucial in various applications, but\ntheir deployment on resource-constrained edge devices poses challenges. This\nstudy presents the Sum-of-Products (SOP) units for convolution, which utilize\nlow-latency left-to-right bit-serial arithmetic to minimize response time and\nenhance overall performance. The study proposes a methodology for fusing\nmultiple convolution layers to reduce off-chip memory communication and\nincrease overall performance. An effective mechanism detects and skips\ninefficient convolutions after ReLU layers, minimizing power consumption\nwithout compromising accuracy. Furthermore, efficient tile movement guarantees\nuniform access to the fusion pyramid. An analysis demonstrates the utile stride\nstrategy improves operational intensity. Two designs cater to varied demands:\none focuses on minimal response time for mission-critical applications, and\nanother focuses on resource-constrained devices with comparable latency. This\napproach notably reduced redundant computations, improving the efficiency of\nCNN deployment on edge devices.\n",
