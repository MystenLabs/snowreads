YOLO is a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) based model, which was first released in\n2015. In recent years, it gained popularity for its real-time detection\ncapabilities. Our study specifically targets YOLO-v9 model, released in 2024.\nAs the model is newly introduced, not much work has been done on it, especially\nnot in Sign Language Detection. Our paper provides deep insight on how YOLO- v9\nworks and better than previous model.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"u120QdQ3h0Mw-ZTuCIMVecMPs6btdro6HF3WVHPr3Hk","pdfSize":"1121271"}
