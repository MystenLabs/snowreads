  "abstract": "  In this Letter, we study the optical heating of spatially dispersive solids\ndue to electronic light scattering (ELS), a phenomenon driven by indirect\noptical transitions. In this process, a spatial heterogeneity generates an\noptical near-field photon with expanded momentum, leading to electron-photon\nmomentum matching, followed by thermalization of the electron system promoting\noptical heating. We experimentally demonstrate this effect by melting spatially\nconfined semiconductor (Si) and metal (Au) under continuous-wave laser pump\nwithin the transparency window. ELS is a dominant physical process in media\nwith strong spatial dispersion, underlying a variety of thermo-optical\napplications.\n",
