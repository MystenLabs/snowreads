  "abstract": "  In the present paper a distinguishability of bounded metric spaces by the set\nof the Gromov--Hausdorff distances to so-called simplexes (metric spaces with\nunique non-zero distance) is investigated. It is easy to construct an example\nof non-isometric metric spaces such that the Gromov--Hausdorff distance between\nthem vanishes. Such spaces are non-distinguishable, of course. But we give\nexamples of non-distinguishable metric spaces, the Gromov--Hausdorff distance\nbetween which is non-zero. More over, we prove several sufficient and necessary\nconditions for metric spaces to be non-distinguishable.\n",
