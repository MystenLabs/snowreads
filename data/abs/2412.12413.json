Understanding the suboptimality of such measurements with\nrestrictions may then lead to more efficient measurement policies. In this\npaper, we theoretically examine the suboptimality arising from a Procrustes\nproblem for minimizing the average distance between two fixed quantum states\nwhen one of the states has been measured by a Projective Measurement (PM).\nSpecifically, we compare optima when we can only use PMs that are aligned with\na low-rank subspace where the quantum states are supported, and when we can\nmeasure with the full set of PMs. For this problem, we show that the\nsuboptimality ratio is independent of the dimension of the full space, and is\nat most polylogarithmic in the dimension of the low-rank subspace. In the proof\nof this result, we use a probabilistic approach and the main techniques include\ntrace inequalities related to projective measurements, and operator norm bounds\nfor equipartitions of Parseval frames, which are of independent interest.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Nt8qtO5rHx7EMV6Tib1U8HDyVdcSmfoYF47GOagLAGE","pdfSize":"941585"}
