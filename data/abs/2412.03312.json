We propose a path-guided\nparticle-based sampling~(PGPS) method based on a novel Log-weighted Shrinkage\n(LwS) density path linking an initial distribution to the target distribution.\nWe propose to utilize a Neural network to learn a vector field motivated by the\nFokker-Planck equation of the designed density path. Particles, initiated from\nthe initial distribution, evolve according to the ordinary differential\nequation defined by the vector field. The distribution of these particles is\nguided along a density path from the initial distribution to the target\ndistribution. The proposed LwS density path allows for an efficient search of\nmodes of the target distribution while canonical methods fail. We theoretically\nanalyze the Wasserstein distance of the distribution of the PGPS-generated\nsamples and the target distribution due to approximation and discretization\nerrors. Practically, the proposed PGPS-LwS method demonstrates higher Bayesian\ninference accuracy and better calibration ability in experiments conducted on\nboth synthetic and real-world Bayesian learning tasks, compared to baselines,\nsuch as SVGD and Langevin dynamics, etc.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"f7nOJ-PafLdMxRxp__YH1hoQT2fJDgJSx5HTLzG90lY","pdfSize":"1064812"}
