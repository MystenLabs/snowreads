However, empirical evidence\nsupporting this assumption is limited, and recent findings from artificial\nintelligence challenge its validity. This paper uses a probabilistic approach\nto examine whether fingerprint patterns remain unique across large populations.\nWe do this by drawing on Francis Galton's 1892 argument and applying the\nbirthday paradox to estimate the probability of fingerprint repetition. Our\nfindings indicate that there is a 50\\% probability of coincidental fingerprint\nmatches in populations of 14 million, rising to near certainty at 40 million,\nwhich contradicts the traditional view of fingerprints as unique identifiers.\nWe introduce the concept of a Random Overlap Probability (ROP) to assess the\nlikelihood of fingerprint repetition within specific population sizes. We\nrecommend a shift toward probabilistic models for fingerprint comparisons that\naccount for the likelihood of pattern repetition. This approach could\nstrengthen the reliability and fairness of fingerprint comparisons in the\ncriminal justice system.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UZ3_wqN3JyDAwtr3jTG7T45hprCMp856XOuZV0vKaNM","pdfSize":"414976"}
