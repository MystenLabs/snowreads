  "abstract": "  There are a number of emerging quantum technologies that have the potential\nto be disruptive in application areas such as computation, communication and\nsensing. In such a rapidly emerging field, there is a need for: transparency\nand accountability pertaining to devices, their performance, and limitations;\nthe ability to assess new entities for integration into existing systems;\nsufficient information to undertake technology selection; share knowledge\nwithin and across institutions and discipline domains; manage risk and assure\ncompliance with regulatory frameworks; drive innovation. Here we propose Model\nCards for documentation detailing use-cases and performance characteristics of\nentities for use in quantum technologies. Purpose of this document is therefore\nto stimulate discussion and begin to motivate the community to build a\nsufficient body of knowledge so that the most useful form of Model Cards can be\ndeveloped and standardised.\n",
