  "abstract": "  The complex Langevin (CL) method shows significant potential in addressing\nthe numerical sign problem. Nonetheless, it often produces incorrect results\nwhen used without any stabilization techniques. Leveraging insights from\nprevious research that links Lefschetz thimbles and CL, we explore a strategy\nto regularize the CL method to address this issue of incorrect convergence.\nSpecifically, we implement weight regularizations inspired by the associated\nLefschetz thimble structure and correct the bias to retrieve the correct\nresults of the original theory. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this\napproach by solving the SU(N) Polyakov chain model and various scalar models,\nincluding the cosine model and the one-link model, across a broad range of\ncouplings where the CL method previously failed. We also discuss the potential\napplication of these insights to gauge theories in practical scenarios.\n",
