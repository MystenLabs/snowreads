The optimisation in PP can be non-trivial, involving\nnon-smooth functions and optima with a small squint angle, detectable only from\nclose proximity. To address these challenges, this study investigates the\nperformance of a recently introduced swarm-based algorithm, Jellyfish Search\nOptimiser (JSO), for optimising PP indexes. The performance of JSO for\nvisualising data is evaluated across various hyper-parameter settings and\ncompared with existing optimisers. Additionally, this work proposes novel\nmethods to quantify two properties of the PP index, smoothness and\nsquintability that capture the complexities inherent in PP optimisation\nproblems. These two metrics are evaluated along with JSO hyper-parameters to\ndetermine their effects on JSO success rate. Our numerical results confirm the\npositive impact of these metrics on the JSO success rate, with squintability\nbeing the most significant. The JSO algorithm has been implemented in the tourr\npackage and functions to calculate smoothness and squintability are available\nin the ferrn package.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Computation","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DmaQaWo9dRziUIZ_1VzEDL0IRs8KRCKVtTOSLwuLP8w","pdfSize":"5628375"}
