Our\nmain result is that any thick subcategory on a weighted projective curve either\nis equivalent to the derived category of nilpotent representations of some\nquiver (we call such categories quiver-like) or is the orthogonal to an\nexceptional collection of torsion sheaves (we call such subcategories big). We\nprovide several equivalent descriptions of big subcategories and explain that\nthey can be explicitly classified. We give some results clarifying the\nstructure of thick subcategories: in particular, for weighted projective lines\nwe prove that any admissible subcategory is generated by an exceptional\ncollection and any exceptional collection is a part of a full one. Apart from\nthe above, we study general properties of quiver-like categories. In\nparticular, we extend and simplify results from arXiv:2007.02134 providing\nsufficient criteria for a triangulated or abelian category to be quiver-like.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PTZhPVLSqig_sJuSRKm6OeySyYDm178TEkOoToODbcQ","pdfSize":"623157"}
