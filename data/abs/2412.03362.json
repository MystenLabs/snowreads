The knock-on deuteron\nimager (KoDI) was developed at the Omega Laser Facility to image these\nparticles in order to diagnose low-mode asymmetries in the hot-spot and dense\nfuel layer of cryogenic deuterium--tritium ICF implosions. However, the images\ncollected are distorted in several ways that prevent reconstruction of the\ndeuteron source. In this paper we describe these distortions and a series of\nattempts to mitigate or compensate for them. We present several potential\nmechanisms for the distortions, including a new model for scattering of charged\nparticles in filamentary electric or magnetic fields surrounding the implosion.\nA novel particle-tracing methodology is developed and utilized to create\nsynthetic KoDI data based on the filamentary field model that reproduces the\nmain experimentally observed image distortions. We conclude with a discussion\nof the outlook for KoDI, and potential considerations for other\ncharged-particle diagnostics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"VSHB2Vt_zRY2neOxt3kPe43sVjdccjpPJuQUhvZOxcg","pdfSize":"4727101"}
