The\nmodel incorporates damage functions with the risk parameters of the ABC\nframework to simulate adverse events. As a result, it combines continuous and\nprobabilistic degradation. This hybrid approach allows us to study the emergent\nbehavior of the system and explore the range of possible lifetimes of a\ncollection. The main outcome of the model is the decay in condition of a\ncollection as a consequence of all the combined degradation processes. The\nmodel is based on six hypotheses that are described for further testing. This\npaper presents a first attempt at an universal implementation of Collections\nDemography principles, with the hope that it will generate discussion and the\nidentification of research gaps.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"e_RePPCgaxtBfp3ucfbeoeWFsK-pDWhsJQRYcCysteQ","pdfSize":"372702"}
