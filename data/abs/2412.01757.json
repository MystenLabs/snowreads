However, most GNN architectures perform well\non homophilic datasets, where the labels of neighboring nodes are likely to be\nthe same. In recent years, an increasing body of work has been devoted to the\ndevelopment of GNN architectures for heterophilic datasets, where labels do not\nexhibit this low-pass behavior. In this work, we create a new graph in which\nnodes are connected if they share structural characteristics, meaning a higher\nchance of sharing their labels, and then use this new graph in the GNN\narchitecture. To do this, we compute the k-nearest neighbors graph according to\ndistances between structural features, which are either (i) role-based, such as\ndegree, or (ii) global, such as centrality measures. Experiments show that the\nlabels are smoother in this newly defined graph and that the performance of GNN\narchitectures improves when using this alternative structure.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yBDJvWhrEIyHRydf_mOWKypGQw6lvwVj090UaEj0O5E","pdfSize":"1901630"}
