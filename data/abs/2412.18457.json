Let $\\cal DFR$ be the space of discrete faithful\nrepresentations of the modular group into ${\\rm Isom\\/}(X)$ which map the order\n$2$ generator to an isometry with a unique fixed point. I prove many things\nabout the component $\\cal B$ of $\\cal DFR$ known as the Barbot component: It is\nhomeomorphic to $\\R^2 \\times [0,\\infty)$. The boundary parametrizes the Pappus\nrepresentations from [{\\bf S0\\/}]. The interior parametrizes the complete\nextension of the family of Anosov representations from [{\\bf BLV\\/}]. The\nmembers of $\\cal B$ are isometry groups of embedded patterns of geodesics in\n$X$ which have asymptotic properties like the edges of the Farey triangulation\nor shears thereof. The Anosov representations are obtained from the Pappus\nrepresentations by either of two shearing operations in $X$. The shearing\nstructure is encoded by two proper foliations of $\\cal B$ into rays.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mK6Luj91fB3AXQmDgCojbFA6ss-X45hwXtbVgplgz5Q","pdfSize":"1101837"}
