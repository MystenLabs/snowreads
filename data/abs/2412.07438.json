The main results consist of two proofs of the\nKalman Theorem, which are alternative to the most common ones and which\nenlighten the above relations and stimulate generalisations in various\ndirections.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"41QJngXTNXu1VjbBZsImzqiYvapOmO67htJ9nhQhx2Q","pdfSize":"290695"}
