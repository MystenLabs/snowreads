Green hydrogen competes with carbon capture and\nstorage, biomass and imports in reaching emissions reductions; earlier studies\nhave demonstrated the great uncertainty in future cost-optimal development of\ngreen hydrogen. In spite of this, we show that Europe risks little by setting\ngreen hydrogen production targets at around 25 Mt by 2040. Employing an\nextensive scenario analysis combined with novel near-optimal techniques, we\nfind that this target results in systems that are within 10% of cost-optimal in\nmost considered scenarios. Setting concrete targets is important in order to\nresolve significant uncertainty which hampers investments. Targeting green\nhydrogen reduces the dependence on carbon capture and storage and green fuel\nimports, making for a more robust European climate strategy.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Computer Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-Xn35M6GxcnCG3UigJUktBcbfTDy3m11JK6_hW0SbQE","pdfSize":"3484164"}
