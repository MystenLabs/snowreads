We introduce\na partial compactification of this family. We show that the zeta function of\nthe fibers in the family can be written as an explicit product of $L$-series\nattached to nondegenerate hypergeometric motives and zeta functions of tori,\ntwisted by Hecke Grossencharacters. This permits a combinatorial algorithm for\ncomputing the Hodge numbers of the family.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"L3bEJJ6Kb6BfLzwvAdwmQRSrBAFHZlZPD3gwSjMbKt0","pdfSize":"344067"}
