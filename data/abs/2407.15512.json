However, the presence of missing data\nposes a significant challenge, particularly in non-persistent sensors that can\nbe affected by external factors. Existing literature has explored strategies\nlike temporal dropout and sensor-invariant models to address the generalization\nto missing data issues. Inspired by these works, we study two novel methods\ntailored for multi-sensor scenarios, namely Input Sensor Dropout (ISensD) and\nEnsemble Sensor Invariant (ESensI). Through experimentation on three\nmulti-sensor temporal EO datasets, we demonstrate that these methods\neffectively increase the robustness of model predictions to missing sensors.\nParticularly, we focus on how the predictive performance of models drops when\nsensors are missing at different levels. We observe that ensemble multi-sensor\nmodels are the most robust to the lack of sensors. In addition, the sensor\ndropout component in ISensD shows promising robustness results.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uoPbgs1SkBCVxmpwK79-d2UBU1NudCryPpRK3_Q6TrM","pdfSize":"1212046"}
