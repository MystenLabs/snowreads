In this paper, we\npropose a novel method for pairwise spatiotemporal partial trajectory matching\nthat transforms tabular spatiotemporal data into interpretable trajectory\nimages based on specified time windows, allowing for partial trajectory\nanalysis. This approach includes localization of trajectories, checking for\nspatial overlap, and pairwise matching using a Siamese Neural Network. We\nevaluate our method on a co-walking classification task, demonstrating its\neffectiveness in a novel co-behavior identification application. Our model\nsurpasses established methods, achieving an F1-score up to 0.73. Additionally,\nwe explore the method's utility for pair routine pattern analysis in real-world\nscenarios, providing insights into the frequency, timing, and duration of\nshared behaviors. This approach offers a powerful, interpretable framework for\nspatiotemporal behavior analysis, with potential applications in social\nbehavior research, urban planning, and healthcare.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cPo0w7LnOBvG3bCzx3sXEn87W61JStheMYvOm7AonTA","pdfSize":"2249480"}
