An\nEuler scheme with constant time step for SDEwS is considered. It is shown that\nthe scheme converges with order one in weak sense and also in the ergodic\nlimit. Numerical experiments illustrate the use of SDEwS for sampling from\nmixture distributions and confirm the theoretical results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eX7O0G1dt2cYmac5in9BCIdPMks4q80Wua01oi1Yh3M","pdfSize":"935390"}
