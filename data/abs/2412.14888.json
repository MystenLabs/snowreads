By employing single-atom detection of Rb and Cs, we\nobserve molecule formation via correlated loss of both species and study the\nformation dynamics with single-particle resolution. We control the interatomic\ndistances by manipulating the relative wavefunction of atom pairs using the\ntweezer intensity, optimizing the coupling to molecular states and exploring\nthe effect of the tweezer on these states. Additionally, we demonstrate\nmolecule association with atoms trapped in separate tweezers, paving the way\nfor state-selective assembly of polyatomic molecules. The observed binding\nenergies, molecular alignment, and bond lengths are in good agreement with\ntheory. Our approach is broadly applicable to Rydberg tweezer platforms,\nexpanding the range of available molecular systems and enabling the integration\nof Rydberg molecules into existing quantum science platforms.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VN9JAG10SKE5l6RrrF_NpcjJQO7-wol8jIsGdTAGo9c","pdfSize":"9502828"}
