We show that the exponential\ndouble-solitons correspond to double isolated eigenvalues in the Lax spectrum,\nwhereas the algebraic double-solitons correspond to double embedded eigenvalues\non the imaginary axis, where the continuous spectrum resides. This resolves the\nlong-standing conjecture that multiple embedded eigenvalues may exist in the\nspectral problem associated with the massive Thirring model. To obtain the\nexponential double-solitons, we solve the Riemann--Hilbert problem with the\nreflectionless potential in the case of a quadruplet of double poles in each\nquadrant of the complex plane. To obtain the algebraic double-solitons, we\nconsider the singular limit where the quadruplet of double poles degenerates\ninto a symmetric pair of double embedded poles on the imaginary axis.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_nheBUyTo8wmVDdMD1ezEINGqtiy-EDIBU5kk6LurFE","pdfSize":"538823"}
