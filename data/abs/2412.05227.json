  "abstract": "  Some calculations of parton distributions from first principles only give\naccess to a limited range of Fourier modes of the function to reconstruct. We\npresent a physically motivated procedure to regularize the inverse integral\nproblem using a Gaussian process as a Bayesian prior. We propose to fix the\nhyperparameters of the prior in a meaningful physical fashion, offering a\nsimple implementation, great numerical efficiency, and allowing us to\nunderstand and keep control easily of the uncertainty of the reconstruction.\n",
