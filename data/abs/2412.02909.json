We show\nthat through alternating between squeezing along different quadratures of a\nsingle photonic mode, the cross-Kerr interaction strength can be generically\namplified. As an application of the squeezing protocols we discuss speeding up\nthe deterministic implementation of controlled phase gates in photonic quantum\ncomputing architectures. We develop bounds that characterize how fast and\nstrong single-mode squeezing has to be applied to achieve a desired gate error\nand show that the protocols can overcome photon losses. Finally, we discuss\nexperimental realizations of the squeezing strategies in optical fibers and\nnanophotonic waveguides.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"J9OwA7PQGw_B9J2nhoitzpXw8JPQdDf1kQy9BiO1Pnk","pdfSize":"2689614"}
