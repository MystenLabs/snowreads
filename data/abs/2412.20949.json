We first give an alternative perspective of the corresponding\nsub-Gaussian bound due to Abbasi-Yadkori et al. via a PAC-Bayesian argument\nwith Gaussian priors. By instantiating this argument to priors drawn uniformly\nover well-chosen ellipsoids, we obtain a Bernstein bound.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4OOWY2u0vDbHQVAKNEr7d-S8f8fD6sY9cMLWPpaQve4","pdfSize":"182736"}
