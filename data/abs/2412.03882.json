Active shooters kill innocent students and\neducators in schools. These tragic events highlight the urgent need for\neffective strategies to minimize casualties. This study aims to address the\nchallenge of simulating and assessing potential mitigation measures by\ndeveloping a multi-agent simulation model. Our model is designed to estimate\ncasualty rates and evacuation efficiency during active shooter scenarios within\nschool buildings. The simulation evaluates the impact of a gun detection system\non safety outcomes. By simulating school shooting incidents with and without\nthis system, we observe a significant improvement in evacuation rates, which\nincreased from 16.6% to 66.6%. Furthermore, the Gun Detection System reduced\nthe average casualty rate from 24.0% to 12.2% within a period of six minutes,\nbased on a simulated environment with 100 students. We conducted a total of 48\nsimulations across three different floor layouts, varying the number of\nstudents and time intervals to assess the system's adaptability. We anticipate\nthat the research will provide a starting point for demonstrating that a\ngunshot detection system can significantly improve both evacuation rates and\ncasualty reduction.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OrUGnZqfd484jEVcYddNyIqTZWJViBEeW9n_j00x5no","pdfSize":"3512847"}
