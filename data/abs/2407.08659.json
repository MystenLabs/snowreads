Our approach involves manipulating the distribution of\ntraining and generated data through a novel metric for individual samples,\nnamed pseudo density, which is based on the nearest-neighbor information from\nreal samples. Our approach offers three distinct techniques to adjust the\nfidelity and diversity of deep generative models: 1) Per-sample perturbation,\nenabling precise adjustments for individual samples towards either more common\nor more unique characteristics; 2) Importance sampling during model inference\nto enhance either fidelity or diversity in the generated data; 3) Fine-tuning\nwith importance sampling, which guides the generative model to learn an\nadjusted distribution, thus controlling fidelity and diversity. Furthermore,\nour fine-tuning method demonstrates the ability to improve the Frechet\nInception Distance (FID) for pre-trained generative models with minimal\niterations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fmPavfCkH-p6SMA11UQTveWFUm3-VNX930c1W11YvVU","pdfSize":"26374783"}
