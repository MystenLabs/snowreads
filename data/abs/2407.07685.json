We\nprovide a quantum algorithm matching these bounds. Specifically, we find that\nfor a non-linear differential equation of the form $\\frac{d|u\\rangle}{dt} =\nA|u\\rangle + B|u\\rangle^{\\otimes2}$ for evolution of time $T$, error tolerance\n$\\epsilon$ and $c$ dependent on the strength of the nonlinearity, the number of\nqueries to the differential operators that approaches the scaling of the\nquantum lower bound of $e^{o(T\\|B\\|)}$ queries in the limit of strong\nnon-linearity. Finally, we introduce a classical algorithm based on the Euler\nmethod allowing comparably scaling to the quantum algorithm in a restricted\ncase, as well as a randomized classical algorithm based on path integration\nthat acts as a true analogue to the quantum algorithm in that it scales\ncomparably to the quantum algorithm in cases where sign problems are absent.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vHCRULPNGRYDbOPeChX6rDEln4WjnRqHYNXakMRaOsk","pdfSize":"330773"}
