  "abstract": "  Many inverse problems are ill-posed and need to be complemented by prior\ninformation that restricts the class of admissible models. Bayesian approaches\nencode this information as prior distributions that impose generic properties\non the model such as sparsity, non-negativity or smoothness. However, in case\nof complex structured models such as images, graphs or three-dimensional (3D)\nobjects,generic prior distributions tend to favor models that differ largely\nfrom those observed in the real world. Here we explore the use of diffusion\nmodels as priors that are combined with experimental data within a Bayesian\nframework. We use 3D point clouds to represent 3D objects such as household\nitems or biomolecular complexes formed from proteins and nucleic acids. We\ntrain diffusion models that generate coarse-grained 3D structures at a medium\nresolution and integrate these with incomplete and noisy experimental data. To\ndemonstrate the power of our approach, we focus on the reconstruction of\nbiomolecular assemblies from cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) images, which\nis an important inverse problem in structural biology. We find that posterior\nsampling with diffusion model priors allows for 3D reconstruction from very\nsparse, low-resolution and partial observations.\n",
