  "abstract": "  Spatial omics assays allow for the molecular characterisation of cells in\ntheir spatial context. Notably, the two main technological streams,\nimaging-based and high-throughput sequencing-based, can give rise to very\ndifferent data modalities. The characteristics of the two data types are well\nknown in adjacent fields such as spatial statistics as point patterns and\nlattice data, and there is a wide range of tools available. This paper\ndiscusses the application of spatial statistics to spatially-resolved omics\ndata and in particular, discusses various advantages, challenges, and nuances.\nThis work is accompanied by a vignette, pasta, that showcases the usefulness of\nspatial statistics in biology using several R packages.\n",
