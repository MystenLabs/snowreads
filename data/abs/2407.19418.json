To ensure consistency with the experimental methodology, we have taken\ninto account the feed-down transitions originating from higher excited states,\nwhich exhibit significant relevance. Combining all the contributions, we arrive\nat the NLO prediction of $\\mathcal{B}_{Z \\to \\Upsilon(nS)+\\Upsilon(mS)} \\sim\n10^{-11}$, which is notably lower than the upper limits set by CMS.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KFpqOEki6_xnJGr27cctn81SYyoVEdXIMQyC3k92RNM","pdfSize":"656895","objectId":"0xfae424bfdcbfb990cbbd5fa9a18c72d768d947503abdfb2c9b1524eedc72ca9f","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
