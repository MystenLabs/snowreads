This (deterministic) round-complexity is optimal for $k=2$ up to\nlogarithmic factors thanks to the lower bound for $C_4$-freeness by Drucker et\nal. [PODC 2014], which holds even for randomized algorithms. Moreover it\nmatches the round-complexity of the best known randomized algorithms by\nCensor-Hillel et al. [DISC 2020] for $k\\in\\{3,4,5\\}$, and by Fraigniaud et al.\n[PODC 2024] for $k\\geq 6$. Our algorithm uses parallel BFS-explorations with\ndeterministic selections of the set of paths that are forwarded at each round,\nin a way similar to what was done for the detection of odd-length cycles, by\nKorhonen and Rybicki [OPODIS 2017]. However, the key element in the design and\nanalysis of our algorithm is a new combinatorial result bounding the \"local\ndensity\" of graphs without $2k$-cycles, which we believe is interesting on its\nown.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computer Science/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NHpauFTHDLYe8MOsu7RJ2NpdI3VD3yB5CKHYFjleWzo","pdfSize":"1280584"}
