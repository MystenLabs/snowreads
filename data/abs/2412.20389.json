  "abstract": "  We provided comments on the article Orbits of particles with magnetic dipole\nmoment around magnetized Schwarzschild black holes: Applications to S2 star\norbit by Uktamjon Uktamov, Mohsen Fathi, Javlon Rayimbaev, and Ahmadjon\nAbdujabbarov from arXiv:2406.03371v2. We derived the Hamilton-Jacobi equation\nused in the article from the Lagrangian utilized and found inconsistencies in\nthe use of the interaction term which describes the magnetic dipole moment of\nthe particle. Consequently, this results in incorrect equations of motion for\nthe particle.\n",
