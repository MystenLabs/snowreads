In this note,\nwe provide a structural explanation of this phenomenon, and we extend the\nresult to a wide class of non-Gaussian and non-product models with a convex\ninteraction. The key observation is a relation to a spectral rigidity result of\nCheng and Zhou, linked to the presence of a Gaussian factor. We formulate the\nphenomenon using a Wasserstein coupling distance, and we deduce from it the\nformulation for total variation distance and relative entropy divergence.\nFurthermore, we discuss a natural extension to Riemannian manifolds, and ask\nabout a possible extension or stability by perturbation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pyH44WDgp8odHHRpdyDBycEW9j0ndN0oyUkD_-7UyBc","pdfSize":"243909"}
