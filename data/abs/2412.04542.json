Low metallicities,\nhigh Lyman continuum escape fractions, and rapidly declining star-formation\nhistories have been proposed as primary drivers behind low H$\\beta$+[OIII]\nequivalent widths, but the blend of H$\\beta$+[OIII] in photometric studies\nmakes proving one of these scenarios difficult. We aim to characterize this\npeculiar population with deep spectroscopy from the JWST Advanced Deep\nExtragalactic Survey (JADES). We find that a significant subset of these\ngalaxies at $z\\gtrsim2$ with modest H$\\beta$+[OIII] equivalent widths ($\\rm\n\\approx 300-600$\\r{A}) have high ionization efficiencies ($\\rm \\log \\xi_{ion}\n\\gtrsim 25.5~[Hz~erg^{-1}]$). Suppressed [OIII] EW values yet elevated\nH$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$ EW values imply that the level of chemical enrichment is\nthe primary culprit, supported by spectroscopic measurements of metallicities\nbelow 12+log(O/H)$\\rm \\approx 7.70~(10\\%Z_{\\odot})$. We demonstrate that\nintegrated H$\\beta$+[OIII] selections (e.g., H$\\beta$+[OIII] EW $> 700$\\r{A})\nexclude the most metal-poor efficient ionizers and favor 1) more chemically\nenriched systems with comparable extreme radiation fields and 2) older\nstarbursting systems. In contrast, metallicity degeneracies are reduced in\nH$\\alpha$ space, enabling the identification of these metal-poor efficient\nionizers by their specific star-formation rate.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"j9hWsfpKVIDMc_jha0vX4Hvx4gCJ15DU1rJn2ueQHrk","pdfSize":"1468053"}
