The unit ball of this norm is a convex\npolyhedron, whose shape's data (e.g. number of vertices, regularity) measures\nthe complexity of the surfaces sitting in the ambient 3-manifold.\n  Unfortunately, the Thurston norm is generally quite hard to compute, and a\nlong-standing problem is to understand which polyhedra are realised as the unit\nballs of the Thurston norms of $3$-manifolds. We show that, when $M$ is the\ncomplement of a $2$-bridge link $L$ with components $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$, the\nThurston ball of $M$ has at most 8 faces. The proof of this result strongly\nrelies on a description of essential surfaces in $2$-bridge link complements\ngiven by Floyd and Hatcher. Then, we exhibit norm-minimizing representatives\nfor the integral classes of $H_2(M,\\partial M)$ and use them to compare the\ncomplexity of the Thurston ball with the complexities of $L$ and of $M$. As an\nexample, we show that all the vertices of the Thurston ball lie on the\nbisectors if and only if $M$ fibers over the circle with fiber a surface with\nboundary equal to a longitude of $\\ell_1$ and some meridians of $\\ell_2$.\nFinally, we use $2$-bridge links in satellite constructions to find\n$2$-component links whose complements in $S^3$ have Thurston balls with\narbitrarily many vertices.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8P04nvBw1QFTjfRUs8GDC7Ur__gsSkig20mXdQ6tS44","pdfSize":"1715202","objectId":"0xecaa0bd97ed16da30091b5f4f3fe7ce98ac164fe3ce89de481b1a01a0707eca0","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
