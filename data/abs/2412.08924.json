  "abstract": "  We prove asymptotic estimates for the growth in the degree of the Hodge locus\nin terms of arithmetic properties of the integral vectors that define it. Our\nmethods are general and apply to most variations of Hodge structures for which\nthe Hodge locus is dense. As applications we give asymptotic formulas\ncontrolling the degrees of Noether-Lefschetz loci associated to smooth\nprojective hypersurfaces in $\\mathbb{P}^3$, and the degrees of subvarieties of\nthe Torelli locus parameterizing Jacobians split up to isogeny.\n",
