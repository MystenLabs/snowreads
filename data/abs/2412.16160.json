By incorporating the k-means algorithm into\nthe radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), the proposed method addresses\nthe challenges of manual clustering and the reliance on potentially\nuninformative features. More specifically, our approach involves a dual\ncompetitive mechanism for feature importance, combining the mean-decrease\nimpurity (MDI) method and a gradient descent (GD) based feature importance\nmechanism. This approach, tested on HFT Level 1 order book data for 20 S&P 500\nstocks, enhances the forecasting ability of the RBFNN regressor. Our findings\nsuggest that an autonomous approach to feature selection and clustering is\ncrucial, as each stock requires a different input feature space. Overall, by\nautomating the feature selection and clustering processes, we remove the need\nfor manual topological grid search and provide a more efficient way to predict\nLOB's mid-price.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nk4tBqS89pv-KIGRktxFTrdUmQb6kU83-tDHxmGZ8uY","pdfSize":"417220"}
