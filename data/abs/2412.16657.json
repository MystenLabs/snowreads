  "abstract": "  The purpose of this study is to provide a step-by-step demonstration of item\nrecovery for the Multidimensional Graded Response Model (MGRM) in R. Within\nthis scope, a sample simulation design was constructed where the test lengths\nwere set to 20 and 40, the interdimensional correlations were varied as 0.3 and\n0.7, and the sample size was fixed at 2000. Parameter estimates were derived\nfrom the generated datasets for the 3-dimensional GRM, and bias and Root Mean\nSquare Error (RMSE) values were calculated and visualized. In line with the aim\nof the study, R codes for all these steps were presented along with detailed\nexplanations, enabling researchers to replicate and adapt the procedures for\ntheir own analyses. This study is expected to contribute to the literature by\nserving as a practical guide for implementing item recovery in the MGRM. In\naddition, the methods presented, including data generation, parameter\nestimation, and result visualization, are anticipated to benefit researchers\neven if they are not directly engaged in item recovery.\n",
