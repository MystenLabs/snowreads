One important focus is on meshes being local\npatches (stars) of tetrahedra from a larger tetrahedral mesh. We also review\nvarious equivalent results to the discrete Poincar\\'e inequalities, namely\nstability of discrete constrained minimization problems, discrete inf-sup\nconditions, bounds on operator norms of piecewise polynomial vector potential\noperators (Poincar\\'e maps), and existence of graph-stable commuting\nprojections.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jLzgh7swXGWpa-NAZWj1pq9y3ghAKDIDmZ1W8ggQRnY","pdfSize":"393558"}
