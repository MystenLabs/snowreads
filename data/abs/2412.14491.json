  "abstract": "  Probabilities of causation (PoC) offer valuable insights for informed\ndecision-making. This paper introduces novel variants of PoC-controlled direct,\nnatural direct, and natural indirect probability of necessity and sufficiency\n(PNS). These metrics quantify the necessity and sufficiency of a treatment for\nproducing an outcome, accounting for different causal pathways. We develop\nidentification theorems for these new PoC measures, allowing for their\nestimation from observational data. We demonstrate the practical application of\nour results through an analysis of a real-world psychology dataset.\n",
