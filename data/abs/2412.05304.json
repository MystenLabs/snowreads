We\nshow that the whisker topology preserves products, resolve an open question\nregarding the existence of a space which makes $\\pi_1^{wh}(X,x_0)$ a\nnon-discrete, non-abelian, and Hausdorff topological group, and show the\nwhisker topology is not separable on the earring group $\\pi_1(\\Er^1,x_0)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Topology","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lBddcN-x1A4yktDdAJEjIWaiBSgn95OFqPkVDkFOiSE","pdfSize":"416860"}
