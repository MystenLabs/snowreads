  "abstract": "  This thesis explores adaptive inference as a tool to characterize quantum\nsystems using experimental data, with applications in sensing, calibration,\ncontrol, and metrology. I propose and test algorithms for learning Hamiltonian\nand Kraus operators using Bayesian experimental design and advanced Monte Carlo\ntechniques, including Sequential and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Application to\nthe characterization of quantum devices from IBMQ shows a robust performance,\nsurpassing the built-in characterization functions of Qiskit for the same\nnumber of measurements. Introductions to Bayesian statistics, experimental\ndesign, and numerical integration are provided, as well as an overview of\nexisting literature.\n",
