ADLs recognition is typically\nbased on deep learning methods requiring large datasets to be trained.\nRecently, several studies proved that Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively\ncapture common-sense knowledge about human activities. However, the\neffectiveness of LLMs for ADLs recognition in smart home environments still\ndeserves to be investigated. In this work, we propose ADL-LLM, a novel\nLLM-based ADLs recognition system. ADLLLM transforms raw sensor data into\ntextual representations, that are processed by an LLM to perform zero-shot ADLs\nrecognition. Moreover, in the scenario where a small labeled dataset is\navailable, ADL-LLM can also be empowered with few-shot prompting. We evaluated\nADL-LLM on two public datasets, showing its effectiveness in this domain.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TWh1p6v18q9U1xeTR_tOMcbtVt9RWBlDLROLi2Ym7ms","pdfSize":"1523699","objectId":"0x0bc959aa85cdda0ce171b881b23858137a54b5a14e497bf9e6299b0abb2d32b4","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
