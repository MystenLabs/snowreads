In\nparticular renormalization theory can be based entirely on inductively bounding\ntheir perturbatively expanded solutions. Recently the solutions of these\nequations for scalar field theory have been analysed rigorously without\nrecourse to perturbation theory, at the cost of restricting to the mean-field\napproximation. In particular it was shown there that one-component\n$\\varphi^4_4$-theory is trivial if the bare coupling constant of the UV\nregularized theory is not large. This paper presents progress w.r.t. Kopper's\nprevious paper on asymptotically free solutions of the mean-field scalar flow\nequations: 1. The upper bound on the bare coupling is sent to infinity and the\nproof is extended to $O(N)$ vector models. 2. The unphysical infrared cutoff\nused for technical simplicity is replaced by a physical mass.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-5SGKs5AEtQkRHzO9be2MyJTevCH1LRT4U94D3dP89g","pdfSize":"493980"}
