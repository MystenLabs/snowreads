Key\nresults include the identification of ``mirage'' sources indicating significant\noffsets in high-energy emissions from their originating pulsars, challenging\nthe results of traditional symmetric diffusion models. By varying parameters\nlike source distance, magnetic field strength, and electron injection spectral\nindex, the study delineates their effects on observable phenomena such as the\nprobability that a source has at least one mirage around it, as well as the\nsource separation. Our results offer insights into some puzzling sources\nobserved recently by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO),\nand shed light on the cosmic-ray transport mechanism in the interstellar\nmedium.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"tzhj9tufZBOB1SY5HsbIcqbpByNn62dPB6yDw3_SVag","pdfSize":"1098432"}
