This work focuses on graph local clustering, which has broad\napplications beyond graphs because of the internal connectivities within\nvarious modalities. While most existing studies on local graph clustering adopt\nthe discrete graph setting (i.e., unweighted graphs without self-loops),\nreal-world graphs can be more complex. In this paper, we extend the\nnon-approximating Andersen-Chung-Lang (\"ACL\") algorithm beyond discrete graphs\nand generalize its quadratic optimality to a wider range of graphs, including\nweighted, directed, and self-looped graphs and hypergraphs. Specifically,\nleveraging PageRank, we propose two algorithms: GeneralACL for graphs and\nHyperACL for hypergraphs. We theoretically prove that, under two mild\nconditions, both algorithms can identify a quadratically optimal local cluster\nin terms of conductance with at least 1/2 probability. On the property of\nhypergraphs, we address a fundamental gap in the literature by defining\nconductance for hypergraphs from the perspective of hypergraph random walks.\nAdditionally, we provide experiments to validate our theoretical findings.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Social and Information Networks","Computer Science/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"-uEdW2aV0lIy9fkIzpGwmjrdJjjwe-Gy_nDN_Jw562s","pdfSize":"4117737"}
