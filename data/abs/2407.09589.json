In the present study, we consider two highly motivated hybrid $f(T)$\nmodels and constrain them using the observations from the Big Bang\nNucleosynthesis era. In addition, using late-time observations of Cosmic\nChronometers and Gamma-Ray-Bursts, the ranges of the model parameters are\nconfined which are in good agreement with early time bounds. Subsequently, the\ncommon ranges obtained from the analysis for early and late time are\nsummarized. Further, we verify the intermediating epochs by investigating the\nprofiles of cosmographic parameters using the model parameter values from the\ncommon range. From this study, we find the considered teleparallel models are\nviable candidates to explain the primordial-intermediating-present epochs.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"s348Vum4xPxVvjPS3bFrQOGb27BlExnfckYQPsvzEWI","pdfSize":"790987"}
