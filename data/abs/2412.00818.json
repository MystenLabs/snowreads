Unlike human ReID, animal ReID\nfaces significant challenges due to the high variability in animal poses,\ndiverse environmental conditions, and the inability to directly apply\npre-trained models to animal data, making the identification process across\nspecies more complex. This work introduces an innovative keypoint propagation\nmechanism, which utilizes a single annotated image and a pre-trained diffusion\nmodel to propagate keypoints across an entire dataset, significantly reducing\nthe cost of manual annotation. Additionally, we enhance the Vision Transformer\n(ViT) by implementing Keypoint Positional Encoding (KPE) and Categorical\nKeypoint Positional Embedding (CKPE), enabling the ViT to learn more robust and\nsemantically-aware representations. This provides more comprehensive and\ndetailed keypoint representations, leading to more accurate and efficient\nre-identification. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that this\napproach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across\nfour wildlife datasets. The code will be publicly released.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"VQEFxCTqwMFwz2IvJkWGfF5OT8wafCIMw0WMnrR5F8A","pdfSize":"3172739"}
