  "abstract": "  Weather forecasting plays a vital role in today's society, from agriculture\nand logistics to predicting the output of renewable energies, and preparing for\nextreme weather events. Deep learning weather forecasting models trained with\nthe next state prediction objective on ERA5 have shown great success compared\nto numerical global circulation models. However, for a wide range of\napplications, being able to provide representative samples from the\ndistribution of possible future weather states is critical. In this paper, we\npropose a methodology to leverage deterministic weather models in the design of\nprobabilistic weather models, leading to improved performance and reduced\ncomputing costs. We first introduce \\textbf{ArchesWeather}, a transformer-based\ndeterministic model that improves upon Pangu-Weather by removing\noverrestrictive inductive priors. We then design a probabilistic weather model\ncalled \\textbf{ArchesWeatherGen} based on flow matching, a modern variant of\ndiffusion models, that is trained to project ArchesWeather's predictions to the\ndistribution of ERA5 weather states. ArchesWeatherGen is a true stochastic\nemulator of ERA5 and surpasses IFS ENS and NeuralGCM on all WeatherBench\nheadline variables (except for NeuralGCM's geopotential). Our work also aims to\ndemocratize the use of deterministic and generative machine learning models in\nweather forecasting research, with academic computing resources. All models are\ntrained at 1.5{\\deg} resolution, with a training budget of $\\sim$9 V100 days\nfor ArchesWeather and $\\sim$45 V100 days for ArchesWeatherGen. For inference,\nArchesWeatherGen generates 15-day weather trajectories at a rate of 1 minute\nper ensemble member on a A100 GPU card. To make our work fully reproducible,\nour code and models are open source, including the complete pipeline for data\npreparation, training, and evaluation, at https://github.com/INRIA/geoarches .\n",
