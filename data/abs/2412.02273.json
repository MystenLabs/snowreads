Inspired by guidelines, we aim to develop a model that learns from\nelectronic health records to determine the optimal sequence of actions for\naccurate diagnosis. Focusing on anemia and its sub-types, we employ deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms and evaluate their performance on both\na synthetic dataset, which is based on expert-defined diagnostic pathways, and\na real-world dataset. We investigate the performance of these algorithms across\nvarious scenarios. Our experimental results demonstrate that DRL algorithms\nperform competitively with state-of-the-art methods while offering the\nsignificant advantage of progressively generating pathways to the suggested\ndiagnosis, providing a transparent decision-making process that can guide and\nexplain diagnostic reasoning.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"p38KyAW3EVMGtm5Xe3fMkS56yeQB8_a2wVTCG4Cj8Xo","pdfSize":"1523228"}
