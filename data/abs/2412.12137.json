In bulk-boundary framework, we observe\ntwo topological charges $(\\omega = +1, -1)$ concerning the non-extensive Barrow\nparameter and with ($\\delta=0$) in Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. For Renyi\nentropy, different topological charges are observed depending on the value of\nthe $\\lambda$ with a notable transition from three topological charges $(\\omega\n= +1, -1, +1)$ to a single topological charge $(\\omega = +1)$ as $\\lambda$\nincreases. Also, by setting $\\lambda$ to zero results in two topological\ncharges $(\\omega = +1, -1)$. Sharma-Mittal entropy exhibits three distinct\nranges of topological charges influenced by the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ with\ndifferent classifications viz $\\beta$ exceeds $\\alpha$, we will have $(\\omega =\n+1, -1, +1)$, $\\beta = \\alpha$, we have $(\\omega = +1, -1)$ and for $\\alpha$\nexceeds $\\beta$ we face $(\\omega = -1)$. Also, Kaniadakis entropy shows\nvariations in topological charges viz we observe $(\\omega = +1, -1)$ for any\nacceptable value of $K$, except when $K = 0$, where a single topological charge\n$(\\omega = -1)$. In the case of Tsallis-Cirto entropy, for small parameter\n$\\Delta$ values, we have $(\\omega = +1)$ and when $\\Delta$ increases to 0.9, we\nwill have $(\\omega = +1, -1)$. When we extend our analysis to the RPS\nframework, we find that the topological charge consistently remains $(\\omega =\n+1)$ independent of the specific values of the free parameters for Renyi,\nSharma-Mittal, and Tsallis-Cirto. Additionally, for Barrow entropy in RPS, the\nnumber of topological charges rises when $\\delta$ increases from 0 to 0.8.\nFinally for Kaniadakis entropy, at small values of $K$, we observe $(\\omega =\n+1)$. However, as the non-extensive parameter $K$ increases, we encounter\ndifferent topological charges and classifications with $(\\omega = +1, -1)$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7jswmU9XJTQyT0TmgFN4UrXwlphVNn7OTgwUBapll9M","pdfSize":"4097565"}
