We introduce the Optimal Growth Mode (OGM) to\ncapture this slow initial relaxation. The OGM is calculated from Markov\nmatrices approximating the action of the Fokker-Planck operator onto the phase\nspace. It is obtained as the mode having the largest growth in energy before\ndecay. Important nuances between the OGM and the more traditional slowest\ndecaying mode are detailed in the case of the Lorenz 63 model. The implications\nfor understanding how complex systems respond to external forces, are\ndiscussed.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pXIevnhA3UWnXE22Xd5e38PJDzBcDUigDqLnvZnvfq4","pdfSize":"1856076"}
