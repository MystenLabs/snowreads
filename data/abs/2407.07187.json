Transits of both systems were first detected from\nobservations by the NASA TESS mission, and the transiting objects are confirmed\nas planets through high-precision radial velocity (RV) observations carried out\nwith VLT/ESPRESSO. TOI 762 A b is a warm sub-Saturn with a mass of 0.251 +-\n0.042 M_J, a radius of 0.744 +- 0.017 R_J, and an orbital period of 3.4717 d.\nIt transits a mid-M dwarf star with a mass of 0.442 +- 0.025 M_S and a radius\nof 0.4250 +- 0.0091 R_S. The star TOI 762 A has a resolved binary star\ncompanion TOI 762 B that is separated from TOI 762 A by 3.2\" (~ 319 AU) and has\nan estimated mass of 0.227 +- 0.010 M_S. The planet TIC 46432937 b is a warm\nSuper-Jupiter with a mass of 3.20 +- 0.11 M_J and radius of 1.188 +- 0.030 R_J.\nThe planet's orbital period is P = 1.4404 d, and it undergoes grazing transits\nof its early M dwarf host star, which has a mass of 0.563 +- 0.029 M_S and a\nradius of 0.5299 +- 0.0091 R_S. TIC 46432937 b is one of the highest mass\nplanets found to date transiting an M dwarf star. TIC 46432937 b is also a\npromising target for atmospheric observations, having the highest Transmission\nSpectroscopy Metric or Emission Spectroscopy Metric value of any known warm\nSuper-Jupiter (mass greater than 3.0 M_J, equilibrium temperature below 1000\nK).\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kLrQq1AJiJLfCcCdX_nVraK8khykIrs5RF7SF1T4SAE","pdfSize":"3587798"}
