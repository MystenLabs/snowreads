  "abstract": "  We present an analysis of LAMOST J171013.211+532646.04 (hereafter J1710), a\nbinary system comprising a hot subdwarf B star (sdB) and a white dwarf (WD)\ncompanion. Multi-epoch spectroscopy reveals an orbital period of 109.20279\nminutes, consistent with TESS and ZTF photometric data, marking it as the sixth\ndetached system known to harbor a WD companion with a period less than two\nhours. J1710 is remarkably close to Earth, situated at a distance of only\n\\(350.68^{+4.20}_{-4.21} \\, \\mathrm{pc}\\), with a GAIA G-band magnitude of\n12.59, rendering it conducive for continuous observations. The spectral\ntemperature is around 25164 K, in agreement with SED fitting results\n(\\(25301^{+839}_{-743} \\, \\mathrm{K}\\)). The TESS light curve displays\nellipsoidal variation and Doppler beaming without eclipsing features. Through\nfitting the TESS light curve using the Wilson-Devinney code, we determined the\nmasses for the sdB (\\(M_1 = 0.44^{+0.06}_{-0.07} \\, M_{\\odot}\\)) and the\ncompact object (\\(M_2 = 0.54^{+0.10}_{-0.07} \\, M_{\\odot}\\)), with the compact\nobject likely being a WD. Furthermore, MESA models suggest that the sdB, with a\nhelium core mass of 0.431 \\(M_{\\odot}\\) and a hydrogen envelope mass of \\(1.3\n\\times 10^{-3}\\, M_{\\odot}\\), is in the early helium main-sequence phase. The\nMESA binary evolution shows that the J1710 system is expected to evolve into a\ndouble white dwarf system, making it an important source of low-frequency\ngravitational waves.\n",
