As a method for\nestimating confidence intervals (CIs), the HPD has two main desirable\nproperties. Firstly, it is the shortest interval to have a specified coverage\nprobability. Secondly, every point inside the HPD interval has a density\ngreater than every point outside the interval. However, it is sometimes\ncriticized for being transformation invariant.\n  We make the case that the HPD interval is a natural analog to the frequentist\nprofile likelihood ratio confidence interval (LRCI). First we provide\nbackground on the HPD interval as well as the Likelihood Ratio Test statistic\nand its inversion to generate asymptotically-correct CIs. Our main result is to\nshow that the HPD interval has similar desirable properties as the profile\nLRCI, such as transformation invariance with respect to the mode for monotonic\nfunctions. We then discuss an application of the main result, an example case\nwhich compares the profile LRCI for the binomial probability parameter p with\nthe Bayesian HPD interval for the beta distribution density function, both of\nwhich are used to estimate population proportions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZTmeKbVU4WJcifOu95DOhlVu9-iAnqnScSVSL6WUMVU","pdfSize":"410957"}
