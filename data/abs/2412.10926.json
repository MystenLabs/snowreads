  "abstract": "  A set of edges $F$ in a graph $G$ is an edge dominating set if every edge in\n$G$ is either in $F$ or shares a vertex with an edge in $F$. $G$ is said to be\nwell-edge-dominated if all of its minimal edge dominating sets have the same\ncardinality. Recently it was shown that any triangle-free well-edge-dominated\ngraph is either bipartite or in the set $\\{C_5, C_7, C_7^*\\}$ where $C_7^*$ is\nobtained from $C_7$ by adding a chord between any pair of vertices distance\nthree apart. In this paper, we completely characterize all well-edge-dominated\ngraphs containing exactly one triangle, of which there are two infinite\nfamilies. We also prove that there are only eight well-edge-dominated\nouterplanar graphs, most of which contain at most one triangle.\n",
