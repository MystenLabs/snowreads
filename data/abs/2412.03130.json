  "abstract": "  We introduce a novel framework aimed at identifying and quantifying the value\nof customer pains as a critical element in service innovation. The proposed\napproach enhances existing end-to-end frameworks by offering a structured\nmethod to elaborate on and measure the value derived from solving these\ncustomer challenges. The effectiveness of the framework is validated by\noperationalizing it in an industrial case study, where the model parameters\nwere captured specifically and the value of solving various operational and\nstructural pains was evaluated numerically.\n",
