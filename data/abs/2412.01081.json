The increased concentration of CO2 in the upper\natmosphere results in enhanced radiative cooling rates leading to the\ncontraction of the upper atmosphere. Due to its long lifetime and large\nvertical gradient, CO2 concentration is also influenced by large dynamic\nevents. We report a startling case of variability in CO2 density and its\ninfrared radiative cooling rates in the mesosphere and lower thermospher during\na major sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) event. A counter-intuitive\nconnection between CO2 density and resulting CO2 radiative cooling has been\nobserved during the 2009 major SSW event. The behaviour of CO2 cooling rates\nduring such a dramatic events draw attention to our current understanding of\nCO2 infrared cooling variation and its connection to changes in CO2\nconcentration. The significance of temperature and atomic oxygen variability in\nthe observed cooling patterns despite changes in CO2 concentration, is also\nhighlighted.\n","subjects":["Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cmeV6tmgRmfJ5oNgNcBjEkH6lWuRSHNfzkjfxoR8868","pdfSize":"786369"}
