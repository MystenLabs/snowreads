The model includes families of the\n$\\rho$- and $\\omega$-mesons with the associated radial excitations. The free\nparameters of the model are determined using a global statistical analysis of\nexperimental data on the electromagnetic nucleon form factors in space- and\ntimelike regions of transferred momenta. The vector meson masses and widths are\nequal to their empirical values, while the residues of form factors at the\npoles corresponding to the ground states of the $\\rho$- and $\\omega$-mesons are\nconsistent with the findings of both the Frazer-Fulco unitarity relations and\nthe Bonn potential for coupling constants of the $\\rho$- and $\\omega$-mesons\nwith nucleons. Theoretical constraints imposed on the model include the quark\ncounting rules, the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka rule, the scaling law of Sachs form\nfactors at moderate momentum transfers, and the suppression of Sachs form\nfactors near the nucleon-antinucleon threshold. A reasonable description of the\nnucleon form factors in the experimentally accessible range of transferred\nmomenta, as well as the electric and magnetic nucleon radii and Zemach radii,\nis obtained.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UJ2fzNrj6f23v-NuqrH_yXXOKYhpw0Sr0b8Ad7c6NX8","pdfSize":"1389257"}
