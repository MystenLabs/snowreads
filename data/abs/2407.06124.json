The proposed approach generates new images by\nsampling from a root embedding of a learned latent tree VAE-based structure, it\nthen propagates through hierarchical paths, and utilizes a second-stage DDPM to\nrefine and generate distinct, high-quality images for each data cluster. The\nresult is a model that not only improves image clarity but also ensures that\nthe generated samples are representative of their respective clusters,\naddressing the limitations of previous VAE-based methods and advancing the\nstate of clustering-based generative modeling.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"81WBcGCW4asdol7TVPEvRTUg2--nzaZ3ZAFFov7xajU","pdfSize":"5213253"}
