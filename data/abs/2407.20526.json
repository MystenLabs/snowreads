In this paper, we prove tight bounds on the energy barrier\napplicable to any quantum code obtained from the hypergraph product of two\nclassical codes. If the underlying classical codes are low-density parity-check\ncodes (LDPC), the energy barrier of the quantum code is shown to be the minimum\nenergy barrier of the underlying classical codes (and their transposes) up to\nan additive $O(1)$ constant.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TJ1nh_RZsr08TH_9lkz2-bTiPAWqwqjX7qdStdbzBgw","pdfSize":"2004464"}
