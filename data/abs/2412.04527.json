We study a variant in which $d=1$ and particles have an additional\ndrift $\\mu\\in\\mathbb{R}$. We show that there is a critical value, $\\mu_c^N$,\nand three distinct regimes (sub-critical, critical, and super-critical) and we\ndescribe the behaviour of the system in each case. In the sub-critical regime,\nthe system is positive Harris recurrent and has an invariant distribution; in\nthe super-critical regime, the system is transient; and in the critical case,\nafter rescaling, the system behaves like a single reflected Brownian motion.\n  We also show that the critical drift $\\mu_c^N$ is in fact the speed of the\nwell-studied $N$-BBM process, and give a rigorous proof for the speed of\n$N$-BBM, which was missing in the literature.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ddoyhm392SJQ82GkfAys6ouyZ2uDkrkxvp90cv8AGuA","pdfSize":"408484"}
