As part\nof a larger project entitled \"Breaking down research silos\", we created a\ndatabase of research contributions by Canadian LIS researchers (academics and\npractitioners). This was motivated by a desire to make research by Canadian LIS\nscholars and practitioners more visible and foster collaboration between these\ntwo groups. The aim of this paper is to introduce the database, describe the\nprocess through which it was created, provide descriptive statistics of the\ndatabase content, and highlight areas for future development.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Digital Libraries"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jdXBzJWxB-TBYhWC3k_Fs7GeLnfhB2r_9qAlQGbNOAg","pdfSize":"453338"}
