Based on this, a heuristic polynomial-time\nalgorithm for finding an optimal locally ultrametric approximation of a\ngraph-distance power Laplacian matrix via the Vietoris-Rips graph based on the\ngraph distance function is proposed. In the end, the error in the solution to\nthe graph Laplacian heat equation given by extension to a locally p-adic\nequation is estimated.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"u09Or-UBBUv3g3LXiz4ODUWr9mbGdNVhd0EQTikRsxA","pdfSize":"202059"}
