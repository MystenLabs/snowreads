Traditionally, coacervates are viewed as\nspherical droplets with growth dynamics resembling liquid-liquid phase\nseparation. However, our fluid particle dynamics simulations incorporating\nhydrodynamic and electrostatic interactions challenge this perspective. Here,\nwe find that oppositely charged PEs form a percolated network even in\nsemi-dilute solutions, coarsening with a unique growth law, $\\ell \\propto\nt^{1/2}$. This self-similarity, absent for neutral polymers in poor solvents,\narises because PEs in good solvents exhibit weaker, longer-range attractions\ndue to spatial charge inhomogeneity under global charge neutrality. This\nresults in a lower density of the PEs-rich phase and reduced interfacial\ntension. Increased charge asymmetry further slows network coarsening.\nAdditionally, coacervate droplets initially display irregular shapes due to\nweak interfacial tension, transitioning slowly to spherical forms. Our research\nprovides new insights into coacervate morphology and coarsening dynamics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Biological Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"cuxkdvisOerY6PjceRMMDyi4Yel0T3dohm2XXTD6cvs","pdfSize":"14183179"}
