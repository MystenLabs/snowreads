Both\nparameters only depend on the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic\ntest and are equivalent to a relative risk. This article studies the comparison\nof the likelihood ratios of two binary diagnostic tests subject to a paired\ndesign through confidence intervals. Six approximate confidence intervals are\npresented for the ratio of the likelihood ratios, and simulation experiments\nare carried out to study the coverage probabilities and the average lengths of\nthe intervals considered, and some general rules of application are proposed. A\nmethod is also proposed to determine the sample size necessary to estimate the\nratio between the likelihood ratios with a determined precision. The results\nwere applied to the diagnosis of coronary artery disease.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Other Statistics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CtrJ0bq8g7Jqd9dFOc0So04LZVKp7d-R5W23DeVjlFs","pdfSize":"429316"}
