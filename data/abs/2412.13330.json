  "abstract": "  Fault-tolerant photonic quantum computing requires the generation of large\nentangled resource states. The required size of these states makes it\nchallenging to simulate the effects of errors such as loss and partial\ndistinguishability. For an interferometer with $N$ partially distinguishable\ninput photons and $M$ spatial modes, the Fock basis can have up to\n${N+NM-1\\choose N}$ elements. We show that it is possible to use a much smaller\nunsymmetrized basis with size $M^N$ without discarding any information. This\nenables simulations of the joint effect of loss and partial distinguishability\non larger states than is otherwise possible. We demonstrate the technique by\nproviding the first-ever simulations of the generation of imperfect qubits\nencoded using quantum parity codes, including an example where the Hilbert\nspace is over $60$ orders of magnitude smaller than the $N$-photon Fock space.\nAs part of the analysis, we derive the loss mechanism for partially\ndistinguishable photons.\n",
