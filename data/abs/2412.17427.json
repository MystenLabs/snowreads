We motivate this task, which we call\nmeasuring contextual informativeness in children's stories, and provide a\nformal task definition as well as a dataset for the task. We further propose a\nmethod for automating the task using a large language model (LLM). Our\nexperiments show that our approach reaches a Spearman correlation of 0.4983\nwith human judgments of informativeness, while the strongest baseline only\nobtains a correlation of 0.3534. An additional analysis shows that the\nLLM-based approach is able to generalize to measuring contextual\ninformativeness in adult-directed text, on which it also outperforms all\nbaselines.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tKjw6NVzicrOj2lxQzkCebTIRM8fM10baML0L6sRIso","pdfSize":"469357"}
