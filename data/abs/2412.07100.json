We explore foundational concepts,\nincluding neighborhoods of compact sets, invariant sets, and the properties of\ndynamical systems, and establish key results on the relationships between\nattraction, invariance, and stability. The work explores Lyapunov stability\nwithin the context of dynamical systems, highlighting equivalent formulations\nand related criteria. Central to the exposition is a proof of the fundamental\ntheorem linking Lyapunov functions to the asymptotic stability of compact sets.\nThis expository piece consolidates results from several classical texts to\nprovide a unified and accessible framework for understanding stability in\nmetric spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"LHetaptYEYJlFRbVunOfBQkEEA_1lNZ1ROwf8SlW7TY","pdfSize":"176258"}
