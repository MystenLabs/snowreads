Played as an interactive fiction (IF) game, WHAT-IF\nlets the player choose between decisions that the large language model (LLM)\nGPT-4 generates as possible branches in the story. Starting with an existing\nlinear plot as input, a branch is created at each key decision taken by the\nmain character. By meta-prompting the LLM to consider the major plot points\nfrom the story, the system produces coherent and well-structured alternate\nstorylines. WHAT-IF stores the branching plot tree in a graph which helps it to\nboth keep track of the story for prompting and maintain the structure for the\nfinal IF system. A video demo of our system can be found here:\nhttps://youtu.be/8vBqjqtupcc.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qIM6lXAqwOK4IRFFIjcgi8-3L9kKHxxiIzeplYyv8k0","pdfSize":"857986"}
