To overcome this limitation, we present here\nthe X-ray spectral analysis of a new, large sample of 61 highly accreting AGNs\nnamed as the \\emph{XMM-Newton} High-Eddington Serendipitous AGN Sample, or\nX-HESS, obtained by cross-correlating the 11th release of the \\emph{XMM-Newton}\nserendipitous catalogue and the catalogue of spectral properties of quasars\nfrom the SDSS DR14. The X-HESS AGNs are spread across wide intervals with a\nredshift of $0.06<z<3.3$, a black hole mass of\n$6.8<\\log(M_\\mathrm{BH}/M_\\odot)<9.8$, a bolometric luminosity of\n$44.7<\\log(L_\\mathrm{bol}/\\mathrm{erg\\,s}^{-1})<48.3$, and an Eddington ratio\nof $-0.2<\\log\\lambda_\\mathrm{Edd}<0.5$, and more than one third of these AGNs\ncan rely on multiple observations at different epochs, allowing us to\ninvestigate also their variability. We find a large scatter in the $\\Gamma -\n\\lambda_\\mathrm{Edd}$ distribution of the highly accreting X-HESS AGNs. A\nsignificant correlation is only found by considering a sample of lower-\\ledd\\\nAGNs with $\\lambda_\\mathrm{Edd}\\lesssim0.3$. The $\\Gamma -\n\\lambda_\\mathrm{Edd}$ relation appears to be more statistically sound for AGNs\nwith lower $M_\\mathrm{BH}$ and/or $L_\\mathrm{bol}$. We investigate the\npossibility of transforming the $\\Gamma - \\lambda_\\mathrm{Edd}$ plane into a\nfully epoch-dependent frame by calculating the Eddington ratio from the\nsimultaneous optical/UV data from the optical monitor,\n$\\lambda_\\mathrm{Edd,O/UV}$. Finally, we also get a mild indication of a\npossible anti-correlation between $\\Gamma$ and the strength of the soft excess.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"IVSsOatAcN1E0oRBSaaz6Z3thghBM6WH4wwb9yfMRZE","pdfSize":"9529436","objectId":"0x39177044a7b62da19651558a5a172ae63ab00eb19d7522d40b8a35c9b4b3101f","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
