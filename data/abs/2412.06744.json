  "abstract": "  In the absence of fault tolerant quantum error correction for analog,\nHamiltonian quantum computation, error suppression via energy penalties is an\neffective alternative. We construct families of distance-$2$ stabilizer\nsubsystem codes we call ``trapezoid codes'', that are tailored for\nenergy-penalty schemes. We identify a family of codes achieving the maximum\ncode rate, and by slightly relaxing this constraint, uncover a broader range of\ncodes with enhanced physical locality, thus increasing their practical\napplicability. Additionally, we provide an algorithm to map the required qubit\nconnectivity graph into graphs compatible with the locality constraints of\nquantum hardware. Finally, we provide a systematic framework to evaluate the\nperformance of these codes in terms of code rate, physical locality, graph\nproperties, and penalty gap, enabling an informed selection of\nerror-suppression codes for specific quantum computing applications. We\nidentify the $[[4k+2,2k,g,2]]$ family of subsystem codes as optimal in terms of\ncode rate and penalty gap scaling.\n",
