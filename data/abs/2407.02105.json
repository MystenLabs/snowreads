For\nthe calculations, the Dirac equation with two-center potential is solved\nnumerically using the dual-kinetically balanced finite-basis-set method adapted\nto systems with axial symmetry (A-DKB). Adiabatic potential curves are\nconstructed for the ground state of the above quasi-molecular compounds in the\nframework of the A-DKB approach. Calculations were also performed for the case\nof an external magnetic field (the field is taken into account\nnon-perturbatively). Zeeman shifts of the quasi-molecular terms are obtained\nfor a homogeneous magnetic field with a strength of the laboratory order (up to\n100 Tesla) directed along the axis of the molecule.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tmH7TXH4GL1-gN-E6OU8GUiWgk913lnChDcSVni3aGQ","pdfSize":"290985"}
