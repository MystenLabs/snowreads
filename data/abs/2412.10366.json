We show\nthat the second-order correction in the expansion of the bubble nucleation rate\nis necessary for accurate predictions and quantify its impact on the abundance\nof PBHs and gravitational waves (GWs). We find that the distribution of the\nfluctuations becomes more Gaussian as the second-order term increases.\nConsequently, models that predict the same PBH abundances can produce different\nGW spectra.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IaJgiZ1DPrEMw3nICW7o8mfYfQS9DXxNT9obW1tiVp4","pdfSize":"798614"}
