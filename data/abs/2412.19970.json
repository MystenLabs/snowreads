PandaX-4T dual-phase xenon time\nprojection chamber. This constraint is derived through detecting electronic\nrecoil signals resulting from the interaction with solar-enhanced dark matter\nflux. Low-mass dark matter particles, lighter than a few MeV/$c^2$, can scatter\nwith the thermal electrons in the Sun. Consequently, with higher kinetic\nenergy, the boosted dark matter component becomes detectable via contact\nscattering with xenon electrons, resulting in a few keV energy deposition that\nexceeds the threshold of PandaX-4T. We calculate the expected recoil energy in\nPandaX-4T considering the Sun's acceleration and the detection capabilities of\nthe xenon detector. The first experimental search results using the xenon\ndetector yield the most stringent cross-section of $3.51 \\times\n10^{-39}~\\mathrm{cm}^2$ at $0.08~\\mathrm{MeV}$/$c^2$ for a solar boosted dark\nmatter mass ranging from $0.02$ to $10~ \\mathrm{MeV}$/$c^2$, achieving a 23\nfold improvement compared with earlier experimental studies.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qgx2KUibj4l2Ga5kJ1vDkto_WxHF50Z7SSzuXb0dKh4","pdfSize":"682781"}
