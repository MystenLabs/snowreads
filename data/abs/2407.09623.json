Ramping a dressing field on/off adiabatically before/after an operation\nchanges its effective Hamiltonian. The amplitude and detuning of the dressing\nfield act as tunable degrees of freedom we can use to `customize' the\nproperties of any operation. We propose three use cases for this general tool.\nFirst, we can generate `artificial' clock states, where we eliminate the\n(assumed to be small) linear sensitivity of a qubit. Second, we can break the\ndegeneracies that often complicate shelving at low quantization\nfields\\textemdash allowing us to implement operations with linearly polarized\nmicrowaves that would, otherwise, require circular polarization. Finally, we\ncan implement laser-free single qubit gates on a set of `target' ions using\nfields that are separated from the rest of the computer in frequency space.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VzVGZkelsVuw6KRkluoKpHfloziV28P9iO84ge80ReM","pdfSize":"524658","objectId":"0x926ffcda54ae6959f146f12c70a90b1af75c29465e4b126d2442aa163edebac8","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
