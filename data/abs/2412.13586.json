The short-term evolution and associated hazards of debris\ngenerated by collisions in the geostationary region is investigated in this\nstudy. The initial distribution of two debris clouds is modeled using a single\nprobability density function. The combined distribution of the evolved clouds\nis determined by solving boundary value problems. The risks associated with\nthese debris clouds are evaluated by calculating the instantaneous impact rate\nand cumulative collision probability. The probability of collisions with\nmillimeter-sized fragments may increase to 1% within 36 hours, while the\nprobability of collisions with fragments 5 cm or larger is approximately\n$10^{-5}$. These findings underscore the vulnerability of the geostationary\nregion to space traffic accidents.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"ViJfXQZx_gyQI2d6jO0qCJC6rKbT43Er8TsVuw7UKSM","pdfSize":"2058810"}
