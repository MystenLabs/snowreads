Contributions describe the\nexperimental infrastructure available in Hall D and potential physics\napplications. The rate and detection capabilities of Hall D are outlined, as\nwell as the properties of a circularly polarized photon beam and a polarized\ntarget. Possible physics measurements include light and strange quark baryon\nspectroscopy, the GDH sum rule, proton structure accessed through measurement\nof Generalized Parton Distributions and modification of nucleon structure\nwithin the nuclear medium.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cuHZefltdknrEcOmy09w9RWRxQyCuDaRPbk3uQnwtSQ","pdfSize":"1157271"}
