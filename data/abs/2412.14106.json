  "abstract": "  We study the non-Gaussian tail of the curvature fluctuation, $\\zeta$, in an\ninflationary scenario with a transient ultra slow-roll phase that generates a\nlocalized large enhancement of the spectrum of $\\zeta$. To do so, we implement\na numerical procedure that provides the probability distribution of $\\zeta$\norder by order in perturbation theory. The non-Gaussianities of $\\zeta$ can be\nshown to arise from its non-linear relation to the inflaton fluctuations and\nfrom the intrinsic non-Gaussianities of the latter, which stem from its self\ninteractions. We find that intrinsic non-Gaussianities, which have often been\nignored to estimate the abundance of primordial black holes in this kind of\nscenario, are important. The relevance of the intrinsic contribution depends on\nthe rapidity with which the transient ultra slow-roll phase occurs, as well as\non its duration. Our method cannot be used accurately when the perturbative\nin-in formalism fails to apply, highlighting the relevance of developing fully\nnon-perturbative approaches to the problem.\n",
