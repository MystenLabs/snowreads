We study how to effectively account for key stakeholders in VA\nrecommendations while also considering user-centred measures such as novelty,\nserendipity, and diversity. We propose MOSAIC, a novel multimodal\nmultistakeholder-aware approach using state-of-the-art CLIP and BLIP backbone\narchitectures and two joint optimisation objectives: popularity and\nrepresentative selection of paintings across different categories. We conducted\nan offline evaluation using preferences elicited from 213 users followed by a\nuser study with 100 crowdworkers. We found a strong effect of popularity, which\nwas positively perceived by users, and a minimal effect of representativeness.\nMOSAIC's impact extends beyond visitors, benefiting various art stakeholders.\nIts user-centric approach has broader applicability, offering advancements for\ncontent recommendation across domains that require considering multiple\nstakeholders.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8zuvbBB4NzcxNb9Oa9hwO3FVE-zT_NwBw1oicdmnPB0","pdfSize":"3602830"}
