  "abstract": "  We study the Solar System constraints on covariant $f(Q)$ gravity. The\ncovariant $f(Q)$ theory is described by the metric and affine connection, where\nboth the torsion and curvature vanish. Considering a model including a higher\nnonmetricity-scalar correction, $f(Q)= Q +\\alpha Q^{n} - 2\\Lambda$, we derive\nstatic and spherically symmetric solutions, which represent the\nSchwarzschild-de Sitter solution with higher-order corrections, for two\ndifferent ansatz of the affine connection. On the obtained spacetime solutions,\nwe investigate the perihelion precession, light deflection, Shapiro delay,\nCassini constraint, and gravitational redshift in the $f(Q)$ gravity. We place\nbounds on the parameter $\\alpha$ with $n=2, 3$ in our model of $f(Q)$ gravity,\nusing various observational data in the Solar System.\n",
