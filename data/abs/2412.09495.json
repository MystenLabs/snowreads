We review how the Bekenstein\nentropy is obtained through the count of brane bound states. We describe the\nfuzzball construction of black hole microstates. These states have no horizon\nand radiate from their surface like a normal body, so there is no information\npuzzle. We explain how the semiclassical approximation is violated in\ngravitational collapse even though curvatures are low at the classical horizon.\nThis violation happens because the collapse leads to a stretching of space that\nis {\\it fast}: light does not have time to travel across the collapsing region\nto establish the `vecro' correlations needed in the quantum gravitational\nvacuum. These vecro correlations arise from the existence of virtual fuzzball\nfluctuations in the gravitational vacuum, and are significant because of the\nlarge degeneracy of fuzzball states implied by the Bekenstein entropy. It is\nplausible that similar effects of fast expansion may be responsible for effects\nlike dark energy and the Early Dark Energy postulated to explain the Hubble\ntension.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3CAvyvzu48R22pt61wCpTKwhNB9NfZbbEnSP6RtAGL8","pdfSize":"821722"}
