Beretta et al.\n(Sustainable Energy Fuels, 2017). Featuring a user-friendly graphical user\ninterface and robust computational capabilities, the tool is designed for use\nby scientists, researchers, and engineers to analyze and optimize device\ndesigns. The software calculates key performance metrics such as power,\nefficiency, electrical resistance, open circuit voltage, and short circuit\ncurrent per unit of device area, based on the device design and material\nproperties. The full source code is available for download on GitHub, enabling\nfurther customization.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"73y434lnZLLtS92qfvKW-OeHB-OyMZlg1vXubrIqyVw","pdfSize":"752334"}
