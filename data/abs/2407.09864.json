We obtain the small-$p$ asymptotic behavior\nof the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions and discuss their features for different\nspace dimensions. These results find immediate applications to the theory of\nstochastic processes and unveil the long-time asymptotic behavior of\nprobability densities of various first-passage times in exterior domains.\nTheoretical results are validated by solving the exterior Steklov problem by a\nfinite-element method with a transparent boundary condition.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Spectral Theory","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WmaHozAMb_HjKAPlgVSwcdtKEi780jURejX0vTXnEbU","pdfSize":"2419977","objectId":"0x7faf595385178adf785100c955de68dd1e339e2d4e1b51b18e5d2b9494aa2151","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
