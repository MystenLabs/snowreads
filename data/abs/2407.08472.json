The displacement in the\ndistance between test particles $\\xi^i$ does not depend on the cosmological\nevolution, but only on the primordial value $\\bar h^i_{j}$ of the gravitational\nwave: $\\Delta \\xi^i = -\\frac 12 \\bar h^i_{j} \\xi^j$. The memory is thus related\nto the adiabatic tensor mode that maps the unperturbed FLRW geometries at early\nand late times; this is analogous to the relation between memory in Minkowski\nspacetime and the BMS group. The primordial memory is also connected to the\nconsistency relations of cosmological correlators, as the flat-space memory is\nrelated to the soft theorems for gravitational wave emission. We comment on the\nsignature of the effect on the CMB $B$-modes and on the large-scale structure.\nThere is also a primordial memory effect that is subleading in the spatial\ngradients of the wave: it is encoded in the rotation of free-falling\ngyroscopes.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xydry_lP33Wdj-1E9OP4y3XIF3eAYPy_STt4983Sbls","pdfSize":"589320"}
