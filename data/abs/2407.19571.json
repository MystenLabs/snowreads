These combs are generated by modulating non-linear\nelectro-optic crystals with radio frequencies, creating equally spaced\nside-bands centered around the single-frequency seed laser. Electro-optic\nfrequency comb architectures often choose between optical bandwidth (cascaded\nGHz combs) or higher mode density (chirped RF generation). This work\ndemonstrates an electro-optic frequency comb with > 120 GHz of bandwidth and a\n75 MHz repetition rate. The comb has three cascaded electro-optic modulators\ndriven at sequentially lower harmonics, the last megahertz modulation dictating\nthe repetition rate. This architecture can modulate at any individual harmonic\nand repetition rate without changes to the components. This comb can be used in\nany applications where a stable and tunable repetition rate is needed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"b0tGqee4O2c_t5kErI6wOp-RwU5L4F530pZhgMZse8s","pdfSize":"2462956","objectId":"0xd494e248730cd1ddfdd526ef489c03da21687ddc0727267bc8f56818eac4cd8d","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
