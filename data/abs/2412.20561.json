The expression for\nthe energy losses is derived for the general case of the dispersion for\ndielectric permittivities inside and outside the cylinder. A comprehensive\nanalysis is presented in the spectral range corresponding to the radiation of\nsurface polaritons. The highest peaks in the spectral distribution are obtained\nfor intermediate values of the beam velocity. In the limit of transparent\nmedium the spectrum of radiated surface polaritons is discrete and the\ncorresponding frequencies are determined by the eigenvalue equation for the\ncylindrical waveguide. Numerical examples are presented for the Drude model of\ndispersion.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qmYm-jd_Ct28waRtLwzifn1Ka67Dyqk9FFpbfb7ALiA","pdfSize":"268377"}
