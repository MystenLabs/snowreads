Recent works have\ninvestigated the use of first-order statistics and second-order statistics to\naggregate local client data distributions at the server and achieve very high\nperformance without any training. In this work we propose a training-free\nmethod based on an unbiased estimator of class covariance matrices. Our method,\nwhich only uses first-order statistics in the form of class means communicated\nby clients to the server, incurs only a fraction of the communication costs\nrequired by methods based on communicating second-order statistics. We show how\nthese estimated class covariances can be used to initialize a linear\nclassifier, thus exploiting the covariances without actually sharing them. When\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods which also share only class means, our\napproach improves performance in the range of 4-26\\% with exactly the same\ncommunication cost. Moreover, our method achieves performance competitive or\nsuperior to sharing second-order statistics with dramatically less\ncommunication overhead. Finally, using our method to initialize classifiers and\nthen performing federated fine-tuning yields better and faster convergence.\nCode is available at https://github.com/dipamgoswami/FedCOF.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RsYXFU54b8Gy-0VcmJWIIrKyAGHMWT6DnvFoUygt-8k","pdfSize":"1511790"}
