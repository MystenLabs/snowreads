We use this example to\ndemonstrate that the Aharonov-Bohm effect in principle has nothing to do with\nquantum-mechanics. We then discuss how this classical field description can be\nconnected to the standard one particle quantum description of the Aharonov-Bohm\neffect.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MTQ2ivKHbgSovvQpQgaPJCSGkmBnTvRLixHy5h6n4v0","pdfSize":"106029"}
