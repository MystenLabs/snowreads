  "abstract": "  Electromagnetic radiation of a relativistic gas or plasma jet in the field of\na plane gravitational wave is investigated. The gravitational wave is\nconsidered as a weak (linearized) field on flat Minkowski spacetime. It is\nassumed that the relativistic jet has large regions with uncompensated electric\ncharge. The deformation of these areas under the action of a gravitational wave\nleads to the appearance of electric currents that generate electromagnetic\nradiation. The angular distribution of the intensity of this radiation is\nfound. Cases are considered when the jet and the gravitational wave move in the\nsame direction or towards each other.\n",
