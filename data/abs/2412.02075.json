Despite\nrecent advancements in Neural Implicit Representations (NIR), existing methods\noften lack editability and compositional flexibility, limiting their use in\nscenarios requiring high interactivity and object-level manipulation. In this\npaper, we introduce the Gaussian Object Carver (GOC), a novel, efficient, and\nscalable framework for object-compositional 3D scene reconstruction. GOC\nleverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS), enriched with monocular geometry priors\nand multi-view geometry regularization, to achieve high-quality and flexible\nreconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a zero-shot Object Surface Completion\n(OSC) model, which uses 3D priors from 3d object data to reconstruct unobserved\nsurfaces, ensuring object completeness even in occluded areas. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that GOC improves reconstruction efficiency and geometric\nfidelity. It holds promise for advancing the practical application of digital\ntwins in embodied AI, AR/VR, and interactive simulation environments.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"lmIwFmKTIxMBg47HC8FkMta_bA-BxX1ufrmHFvY7x9M","pdfSize":"8157651"}
