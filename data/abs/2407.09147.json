In this work, we demonstrate an AI-powered immersive\nassistance system that supports users in performing complex tasks in industrial\nenvironments. Specifically, our system leverages a VR environment that\nresembles a juice mixer setup. This digital twin of a physical setup simulates\ncomplex industrial machinery used to mix preparations or liquids (e.g., similar\nto the pharmaceutical industry) and includes various containers, sensors,\npumps, and flow controllers. This setup demonstrates our system's capabilities\nin a controlled environment while acting as a proof-of-concept for broader\nindustrial applications. The core components of our multimodal AI assistant are\na large language model and a speech-to-text model that process a video and\naudio recording of an expert performing the task in a VR environment. The video\nand speech input extracted from the expert's video enables it to provide\nstep-by-step guidance to support users in executing complex tasks. This\ndemonstration showcases the potential of our AI-powered assistant to reduce\ncognitive load, increase productivity, and enhance safety in industrial\nenvironments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rcE92YJnJ5WUvrhj0PEzKYb1X7c4bEy2gmaB84AG2ws","pdfSize":"3927050","objectId":"0xe1190ead289d77e2661be1a5278073791a1029a47231c667e3cedcf4d620ffc8","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
