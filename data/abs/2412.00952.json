We\nintroduce ESCAPE (Equivariant Shape Completion via Anchor Point Encoding), a\nnovel framework designed to achieve rotation-equivariant shape completion. Our\napproach employs a distinctive encoding strategy by selecting anchor points\nfrom a shape and representing all points as a distance to all anchor points.\nThis enables the model to capture a consistent, rotation-equivariant\nunderstanding of the object's geometry. ESCAPE leverages a transformer\narchitecture to encode and decode the distance transformations, ensuring that\ngenerated shape completions remain accurate and equivariant under rotational\ntransformations. Subsequently, we perform optimization to calculate the\npredicted shapes from the encodings. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that\nESCAPE achieves robust, high-quality reconstructions across arbitrary rotations\nand translations, showcasing its effectiveness in real-world applications\nwithout additional pose estimation modules.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jnviqMc7UfPbGF80ciI9RM9di7uxH7GNAyrAklbLR_M","pdfSize":"3783379"}
