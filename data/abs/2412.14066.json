In particular, we consider the stochastically\nresetting deterministic process undergoing linear growth of rate 1 subject to\nPoissonian resetting and deduce its marginal, expectation, and variance. Then,\nusing these results, we construct a stochastic model for hair growth subject to\nregular haircuts and use this model to prescribe the reader's ideal haircut\nroutine.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JonX1xPPQskFJpsLLPYyB-1P3mM5VbwW7UtVuOxE86k","pdfSize":"651047"}
