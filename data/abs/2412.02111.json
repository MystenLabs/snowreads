  "abstract": "  We study the critical behavior of the $O(n)$ model under steady shear flow\nusing a dynamical renormalization group (RG) method. Incorporating the strong\nanisotropy in scaling ansatz, which has been neglected in earlier RG analyses,\nwe identify a new stable Gaussian fixed point. This fixed point reproduces the\nanisotropic scaling of static and dynamical critical exponents for both\nnon-conserved (Model A) and conserved (Model B) order parameters. Notably, the\nupper critical dimensions are $d_{\\text{up}} = 2$ for the non-conserved order\nparameter (Model A) and $d_{\\text{up}} = 0$ for the conserved order parameter\n(Model B), implying that the mean-field critical exponents are observed even in\nboth $d=2$ and $3$ dimensions. Furthermore, the scaling exponent of the order\nparameter is negative for all dimensions $d \\geq 2$, indicating that shear flow\nstabilizes the long-range order associated with continuous symmetry breaking\neven in $d = 2$. In other words, the lower critical dimensions are $d_{\\rm low}\n< 2$ for both types of order parameters. This contrasts with equilibrium\nsystems, where the Hohenberg -- Mermin -- Wagner theorem prohibits continuous\nsymmetry breaking in $d = 2$.\n",
