However, academic research is an untapped\nresource that could greatly benefit industry practitioners. The challenge lies\nin connecting the innovative insights from academia to real-world problems\nfaced by developers. This project introduces ResearchBot, a tool designed to\nbridge this academia-industry gap. ResearchBot employs a modular approach,\nencompassing understanding questions, curating queries to obtain relevant\npapers in the CrossRef repository, summarizing paper content and finally\nanswering user questions based on paper summaries. The core objective of\nResearchBot is to democratize access to academic knowledge for industry\nprofessionals. By providing concise summaries of cutting-edge research directly\nin response to SE-related questions, ResearchBot facilitates the application of\nacademic insights to practical contexts. Ultimately, it aims to bridge the gap\nbetween academia and industry, using research evidence to support learning and\ndecision-making in software development.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"b3oarMFFbCcPovveB6Ab9pi-v2XWP_kJhQvnhXDxck0","pdfSize":"626422"}
