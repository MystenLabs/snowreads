Such entities,\nor agents, may game model decisions by manipulating their inputs to the model\nto obtain better outcomes and maximize some utility. We consider a multi-agent\nsetting where the goal is to identify the \"worst offenders:\" agents that are\ngaming most aggressively. However, identifying such agents is difficult without\nknowledge of their utility function. Thus, we introduce a framework in which\neach agent's tendency to game is parameterized via a scalar. We show that this\ngaming parameter is only partially identifiable. By recasting the problem as a\ncausal effect estimation problem where different agents represent different\n\"treatments,\" we prove that a ranking of all agents by their gaming parameters\nis identifiable. We present empirical results in a synthetic data study\nvalidating the usage of causal effect estimation for gaming detection and show\nin a case study of diagnosis coding behavior in the U.S. that our approach\nhighlights features associated with gaming.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DcrlHoShtz-v479N7PQrKpt1xySbwE536yec7yT24L8","pdfSize":"2542907"}
