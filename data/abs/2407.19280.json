As AD systems evolve from rule-based and\noptimization-based methods to learning-based techniques like deep reinforcement\nlearning, they are now poised to embrace a third and more advanced category:\nknowledge-based AD empowered by LLMs. This shift promises to bring AD closer to\nhuman-like AD. However, integrating LLMs into AD systems poses challenges in\nreal-time inference, safety assurance, and deployment costs. This survey\nprovides a comprehensive and critical review of recent progress in leveraging\nLLMs for AD, focusing on their applications in modular AD pipelines and\nend-to-end AD systems. We highlight key advancements, identify pressing\nchallenges, and propose promising research directions to bridge the gap between\nLLMs and AD, thereby facilitating the development of more human-like AD\nsystems. The survey first introduces LLMs' key features and common training\nschemes, then delves into their applications in modular AD pipelines and\nend-to-end AD, respectively, followed by discussions on open challenges and\nfuture directions. Through this in-depth analysis, we aim to provide insights\nand inspiration for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection\nof AI and autonomous vehicles, ultimately contributing to safer, smarter, and\nmore human-centric AD technologies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"flUTLGZbXa8RqrXOi_R91UVUxrAHpMwAGFqHqsH_0UE","pdfSize":"1275261","objectId":"0xad4fc6e987dcf2cfab8ae9684d0e546716d89589ba78888794a7f11d95e322e7","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
