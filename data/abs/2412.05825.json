  "abstract": "  Numerical weather prediction (NWP) models are fundamental in meteorology for\nsimulating and forecasting the behavior of various atmospheric variables. The\naccuracy of precipitation forecasts and the acquisition of sufficient lead time\nare crucial for preventing hazardous weather events. However, the performance\nof NWP models is limited by the nonlinear and unpredictable patterns of extreme\nweather phenomena driven by temporal dynamics. In this regard, we propose a\n\\textbf{S}elf-\\textbf{S}upervised \\textbf{L}earning with \\textbf{P}robabilistic\n\\textbf{D}ensity \\textbf{L}abeling (SSLPDL) for estimating rainfall probability\nby post-processing NWP forecasts. Our post-processing method uses\nself-supervised learning (SSL) with masked modeling for reconstructing\natmospheric physics variables, enabling the model to learn the dependency\nbetween variables. The pre-trained encoder is then utilized in transfer\nlearning to a precipitation segmentation task. Furthermore, we introduce a\nstraightforward labeling approach based on probability density to address the\nclass imbalance in extreme weather phenomena like heavy rain events.\nExperimental results show that SSLPDL surpasses other precipitation forecasting\nmodels in regional precipitation post-processing and demonstrates competitive\nperformance in extending forecast lead times.
