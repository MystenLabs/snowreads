Current texture engineering methods are\ntime-consuming, energy extensive, or can lead to unnecessary diffusion of added\ndopants. Herein, we explore ultrafast high-temperature sintering (UHS) to\nprepare dense and textured alumina using templated grain growth (TGG). From a\nslurry containing alumina microplatelets coated with Fe3O4 nanoparticles\ndispersed in a matrix of alumina nanoparticles, green bodies with oriented\nmicroplatelets were prepared using magnetic assisted slip casting (MASC). The\neffects of the sintering temperature, time and heating rate on the density and\nmicrostructure of the obtained ceramics were then studied. We found that TGG\noccurs for a temperature range between 1640 and 1780 {\\deg}C and 10 s sintering\ntime. Sintering at 1700 {\\deg}C for 10 s led to dense and textured alumina with\nanisotropic grains thanks to the Fe3O4 coating, which did not have the time to\ndiffuse. The highest texture and relative density were obtained with a heating\nrate of ~5,500 {\\deg}C/min, leading to texture-dependent anisotropic mechanical\nproperties. This study opens new avenues for fabricating textured ceramics in\nultra-short times.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"e2WdqKTFwTxvzVX2OhAEgFDGwL61yYaoUou6RQdbqJc","pdfSize":"3423392"}
