However,\nthe large number of modes and sensitivity to random rotations complicate\nexperimental entanglement certification. Here, we experimentally certify\nthree-dimensional entanglement in a five-dimensional two-photon state using 800\nHaar-random measurements implemented via a 10-plane programmable light\nconverter. We further demonstrate the robustness of this approach against\nrandom rotations, certifying high-dimensional entanglement despite arbitrary\nphase randomization of the optical modes. This method, which requires no common\nreference frame between parties, opens the door for high-dimensional\nentanglement distribution through long-range random links.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iPuzWcv25vsBc_jrT9ZgcDidOOLUlPsesrD_9G6sXWQ","pdfSize":"8875898"}
