Our contribution consists on using Spherical Radial Basis Functions\ninstead of Spherical Harmonic, since the first achieves much better results\nwhen many coefficients are used. We explain how to integrate the Spherical\nRadial Basis Functions with the cascaded light propagation volumes, and\nevaluate our technique against the same implementation, but with Spherical\nharmonics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KCygECZNDNlXNNbWfL3P5dGmF6tU1c4Nop9gQgwJBdE","pdfSize":"1210060"}
