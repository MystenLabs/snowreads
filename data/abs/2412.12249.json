Zweibel","authorsParsed":[["Habegger","Roark",""],["Zweibel","Ellen G.",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2024 19:00:00 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-18","timestamp":1734375600000,"abstract":"  Each supernova's energy drives interstellar medium (ISM) turbulence and can\nhelp launch galactic winds. What difference does it make if $10\\%$ of the\nenergy is initially deposited into cosmic rays? To answer this question and\nstudy cosmic-ray feedback, we perform galactic patch simulations of a\nstratified ISM. We compare two magnetohydrodynamic and cosmic ray (MHD+CR)\nsimulations, which are identical except for how each supernova's energy is\ninjected. In one, $10\\%$ of the energy is injected as cosmic-ray energy and the\nrest is thermal. In the other case, energy injection is strictly thermal. We\nfind that cosmic-ray injections (1) drive a faster vertical motion with more\nmass, (2) produce a more vertically oriented magnetic field, and (3) increase\nthe scale height of warm gas outside the midplane $(z \\gtrsim\n0.5\\,\\mathrm{kpc})$. Both simulations show the formation of cold clouds (with a\ntotal mass fraction $>50\\%$) through the Parker instability and thermal\ninstability. We also show that the Parker instability leads to a decorrelation\nof cosmic-ray pressure and gas density. Finally, our simulations show that a\nvertical magnetic field can lead to a significant decrease in the calorimetric\nfraction for injected cosmic rays.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mhOsWIs05YL3qhtoIYJocQE3XVjuhqOPb8csQUU_y8U","pdfSize":"18035823"}
