We examined cultural differences in attitudes toward nuclear safety\nand the associated ambiguities in the choice of a nuclear fuel cycle. We\nsuggested that the reduction in consumption of natural uranium does not seem to\nbe a feasible way of reducing nuclear waste because of the nonidentity problem.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3rOCYFrRGdWyfQJJoGjM5Sn48E3bDMqFdo7zOB2THng","pdfSize":"311894"}
