In addition, any scattering systems\noperated at this condition would be accompanied by a needle Dirac-delta-like\nfar-field radiation pattern, reducing to perturb the background field except in\nthe forward direction. We therefore refer to this outcome as dark\nsuperabsorbers. Moreover, by considering the mathematical Gibbs phenomenon, we\nfind that a completely equivalent Dirac-delta far-field radiation is excluded\neven we could properly design the scatterers operated at such conditions. We\nbelieve this finding has potential applications in design of dark energy\nharvesting, lower-visibility receivers, superdirective light-matter\ninteraction, and Fresnel diffractive imaging.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"r1dh4aT98mMLAKH3n9yYYm2OFeKFImu2idmiS5jemCI","pdfSize":"3127618","objectId":"0x5bd2f7e2b3a925c715d118218fe0a8408135c63301362d8b9eb868a2e68467cd","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
