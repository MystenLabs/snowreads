The definition of associated\nMersenne graphs is motivated from the Fibonacci-run graphs ({\\\"O}.\nE\\v{g}ecio\\v{g}lu, V. Ir\\v{s}i\\v{c}, 2021) by extending run-constrained strings\nto circularly-run-constrained strings. The name of this new family of graphs is\nidentified with the interesting fact that $|V(\\mathcal{M}_{n})|$ is equal to\nthe $n$-th associated Mersenne number. Various interesting structural and\nenumerative properties of associated Mersenne graphs are investigated,\nincluding the analogue of the fundamental recursion, number of vertices and\nedges, radius, diameter, center, periphery and medianicity. Some future\nresearch directions and open problems concerning associated Mersenne graphs are\nalso proposed.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pS2SWlaY3MzvvLKBaH4MTBIms0zh9bqzj8ZXB5mmgWk","pdfSize":"433027"}
