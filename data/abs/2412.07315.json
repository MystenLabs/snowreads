  "abstract": "  The purpose of this paper is to extend the definition of quasiarithmetic\nmeans by taking a strictly monotone generating function instead of a strictly\nmonotone and continuous one. We establish the properties of such means and\ncompare them to the analogous properties of standard quasiarithmetic means. The\ncomparability and equality problems of generalized quasiarithmetic are also\nsolved. We also provide an example of a mean which, depending on the underlying\ninterval or on the number of variables, could be or could not be represented as\na generalized quasiarithmetic mean.\n",
