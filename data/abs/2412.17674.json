  "abstract": "  This note aims to offer a non-technical and self-contained introduction to\ngravitational algebras and their applications in the nonequilibrium physics of\ngravitational systems. We begin by presenting foundational concepts from\noperator algebra theory and exploring their relevance to perturbative quantum\ngravity. Additionally, we provide a brief overview of the theory of\nnonequilibrium dynamical systems in finite dimensions and discuss its\ngeneralization to gravitational algebras. Specifically, we focus on entropy\nproduction in black hole backgrounds and fluctuation theorems in de Sitter\nspacetime.\n",
