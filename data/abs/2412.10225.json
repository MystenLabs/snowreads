  "abstract": "  We consider tight contact structures on plumbed 3-manifolds with no bad\nvertices. We discuss how one can count the number of tight contact structures\nwith zero Giroux torsion on such 3-manifolds and explore conditions under which\nGiroux torsion can be added to these tight contact structures without making\nthem overtwisted. We give an explicit algorithm to construct stein diagrams\ncorresponding to tight structures without Giroux torsion. We focus mainly on\nplumbed 3-manifolds whose vertices have valence at most 3 and then briefly\nconsider the situation for plumbed 3-manifolds with vertices of higher valence.\n",
