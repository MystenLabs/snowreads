The core method, namely cascading relay nodes for the\ncompensation of signal attenuation and dispersion, is however insufficient to\ndeal with crucial point-to-point transfer scenarios, such as harsh environments\nwith extremely deficient infrastructure and emergency conditions. In\nlong-distance signal transmission without any inline amplifiers, the high loss\nof the optical fiber link becomes the primary limiting factor, and direct use\nof traditional photodetectors at the receiving end will bring about a\nsignificant drop in the stability of detected signals. Here we propose a\nwaveform-resolved single photon detection technique and experimentally perform\ntomography on the weak transferred signal with an average photon number of just\n0.617 per pulse. By adopting this technique, we achieve the time deviation of\n95.68 ps and 192.58 ps at 200 km and 300 km respectively at an averaging time\nof 1 s, overcoming the technical lower bound induced by traditional\nphotodetectors. This work lays the foundation for through-type time transfer\nwith high precision in those significant inline-amplification-free scenarios.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"o9dWLX63w5MxvvItxxC-6jiXSyflPHgkcE65iQlV4xE","pdfSize":"704783"}
