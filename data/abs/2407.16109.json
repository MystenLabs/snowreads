We\npropose to stimulate the nonlinear tunneling in a spin-orbit-coupled spinor\nBose-Einstein condensate. The system provides an experimentally tunable\nnonlinearity as well as multiple avoided crossings with tunable gap size in\nnonlinear dispersion relations. The nonlinearity generates tilted cusp and loop\nstructures around the avoided crossings, and the physical consequence of these\nnonlinear structures is the nonlinear Landau-Zener tunneling. The spin-momentum\nlocking induced by the spin-orbit coupling leads to the time-resolved\nobservation of the nonlinear tunneling by measuring atom populations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lLzZ4TJWEJDEm9FFWkE5jhBmx4-XnPmpaGnxclx2V90","pdfSize":"16952586"}
