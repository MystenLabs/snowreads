  "abstract": "  The debate between scientific realism and anti-realism remains at a\nstalemate, making reconciliation seem hopeless. Yet, important work remains:\nexploring a common ground, even if only to uncover deeper points of\ndisagreement and, ideally, to benefit both sides of the debate. I propose such\na common ground. Specifically, many anti-realists, such as instrumentalists,\nhave yet to seriously engage with Sober's call to justify their preferred\nversion of Ockham's razor through a positive account. Meanwhile, realists face\na similar challenge: providing a non-circular explanation of how their version\nof Ockham's razor connects to truth. The common ground I propose addresses\nthese challenges for both sides; the key is to leverage the idea that everyone\nvalues some truths and to draw on insights from scientific fields that study\nscientific inference -- namely, statistics and machine learning. This common\nground also isolates a distinctively epistemic root of the irreconcilability in\nthe realism debate.\n",
