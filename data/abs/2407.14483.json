For this purpose, pulsed dynamical decoupling (PDD) protocols are\ntypically applied, which enhance sensitivity to RF signals. However, these\nmethods are limited to frequencies of a few megahertz, which poses a challenge\nfor sensing higher frequencies. We introduce an alternative approach based on a\ncontinuous dynamical decoupling (CDD) scheme involving dressed states of\nnitrogen vacancy (NV) ensemble spins driven within a microwave resonator. We\ncompare the CDD methods to established PDD protocols and demonstrate the\ndetection of RF signals up to $\\sim$ 85 MHz, about ten times the current limit\nimposed by the PDD approach under identical conditions. Implementing the CDD\nmethod in a heterodyne synchronized protocol combines the high frequency\ndetection with high spectral resolution. This advancement extends to various\ndomains requiring detection in the high frequency (HF) and very high frequency\n(VHF) ranges of the RF spectrum, including spin sensor-based magnetic resonance\nspectroscopy at high magnetic fields.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"egJu8TohfE8uNqw0dHreFbeTmMXv55OXqe2BhT4bAJ0","pdfSize":"2142258"}
