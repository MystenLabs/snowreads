Such a system can be realized by parametrically\nmodulating the coupling between the system and bath. In this letter, by\ncoupling a transmon qubit to a lossy Superconducting Nonlinear Asymmetric\nInductive eLement (SNAIL) mode, we experimentally create a tunable chemical\npotential for the qubit mode. We show that the qubit can be thermalized to\nequilibrium with different population distributions under different parametric\npumping conditions. We further extend our method to the third level of the\ntransmon, showing its practical use beyond the simple two-level case. Our\nresults provide a useful tool that can be readily integrated with quantum\nsimulators that would benefit from a non-trivial photon population\ndistribution.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bJn4s__q0EZkOkbkQ5hIAalu7X5qrLVTea7pi4FfYPk","pdfSize":"7948818"}
