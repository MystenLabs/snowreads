This\nallows us to obtain expressions for the critical contributions to various\nobservables (fluctuation specific heat and magnetic susceptibility and\nAslamazov-Larkin paraconductivity). Our results suggest that these systems may\ndisplay deviations from pure 2D behaviour and interesting crossover effects,\nwith both similitudes and differences to those known to occur in\ninfinite-layers superconductors. Some challenges for future related research\nare also outlined.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WeUbMoTH1F8Rr2gh9xAQ4jPI6TzQ_RDbzoo7vO-cnrE","pdfSize":"804385"}
