One application of this project is for pest\ncontrol to monitor and protect our ecosystem. Our project leverages data\naugmentation, including pitch shifting and speed changing, to improve model\ngeneralization. This project will test the performance of Decision Tree, Random\nForest, SVM RBF, XGBoost, and k-NN models, combined with MFCC feature. A\npotential novelty of this project is that various data augmentation techniques\nare used and created 6 data along with the original sound. The dataset consists\nof the sound recordings of these four insects. This project aims to achieve a\nhigh classification accuracy and to reduce the over-fitting problem.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Sound","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tw8CQV6GVqMRRsBmXWGU1-4xxiVcwdACXBN3qSzpXVc","pdfSize":"1166133"}
