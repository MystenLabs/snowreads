Quantum technology, which harnesses the unique\nprinciples of quantum mechanics, enables us to construct and manipulate atomic\nstructures with extraordinary precision.\n  Here, we propose a bottom-up approach to create topological magnetic textures\nin diluted adatom lattices on the Nb(110) surface. By fine-tuning adatom\nspacing, previously inaccessible magnetic phases can emerge. Our findings\nreveal that interactions between magnetic adatoms, mediated by the Nb\nsubstrate, foster the formation of unique topological spin textures, such as\nskyrmions and anti-skyrmions, both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic. Since\nNb can be superconducting, our findings present a novel platform with valuable\ninsights into the interplay between topological magnetism and\nsuperconductivity, paving the way for broader exploration of topological\nsuperconductivity in conjunction with spintronics applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9AF3laGspmS_MyOU1DphemgDqGft8B4--Kqisd2JZt0","pdfSize":"18763710"}
