To do so, we use a symmetry of\nLittlewood-Richardson coefficients in terms of the hive model. Along the way,\nwe obtain a new branching model in terms of flagged hives.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2C9ujOSJ8wY9dtWP6huVVpMFAvXa6pbl9rQeej_dT4E","pdfSize":"193714"}
