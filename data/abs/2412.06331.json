Let $G$ be a graph with a perfect\nmatching $M$. The forcing number of $M$ is the smallest cardinality of a subset\nof $M$ that is contained only in one perfect matching $M$. The maximum forcing\nnumber of $G$ is the maximum value of forcing numbers over all perfect\nmatchings of $G$. Kleinerman (2006) obtained that the maximum forcing number of\n$2n\\times 2m$ quadriculated torus is $nm$. By improving Kleinerman's approach,\nwe obtain the maximum forcing numbers of all 4-regular quadriculated graphs on\ntorus except one class.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"n_Ewcu8d_dqCrU0sw3z4v-8EiV-Don9PagPOyK3rLpQ","pdfSize":"733836"}
