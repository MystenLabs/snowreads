  "abstract": "  We investigate electron heating by magnetic-field-aligned electric fields\n($E_\\parallel$) during anti-parallel magnetic reconnection in the Earth's\nmagnetotail. Using a statistical sample of 140 reconnection outflows, we infer\nthe acceleration potential associated with $E_\\parallel$ from the shape of the\nelectron velocity distribution functions. We show that heating by $E_\\parallel$\nin the reconnection outflow can reach up to ten times the inflow electron\ntemperature. We demonstrate that the magnitude of the acceleration potential\nscales with the inflow Alfv\\'en and electron thermal speeds to maintain\nquasi-neutrality in the reconnection region. Our results suggest that\n$E_\\parallel$ plays a major role in the ion-to-electron energy partition\nassociated with magnetic reconnection.\n",
