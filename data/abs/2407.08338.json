We obtain a\nmultidimensional version of this result, which can be regarded as a first step\ntowards effectivising those cases of the multidimensional polynomial\nSzemer\\'edi theorem involving polynomials with distinct degrees. In addition,\nwe prove an effective ``popular'' version of this result, showing that every\ndense set has some non-zero $d$ such that the number of configurations with\ndifference parameter $d$ is almost optimal. Perhaps surprisingly, the\nquantitative dependence in this result is exponential, compared to the\ntower-type bounds encountered in the popular linear Roth theorem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lo2dfl4gMekxKEIqaE-CNg-Z_yf-vxViGzpCdnneQJg","pdfSize":"352099"}
