To address this, researchers have explored two independent\napproaches: adapting Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and leveraging synthetic\ndata. However, VLMs often struggle with granularity, failing to disentangle\nfine-grained concepts, while synthetic data-based methods remain limited by the\nscope of available datasets.\n  This paper proposes enhancing segmentation accuracy across diverse domains by\nintegrating Vision-Language reasoning with key strategies for Unsupervised\nDomain Adaptation (UDA). First, we improve the fine-grained segmentation\ncapabilities of VLMs through multi-scale contextual data, robust text\nembeddings with prompt augmentation, and layer-wise fine-tuning in our proposed\nFoundational-Retaining Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (FROVSS)\nframework. Next, we incorporate these enhancements into a UDA framework by\nemploying distillation to stabilize training and cross-domain mixed sampling to\nboost adaptability without compromising generalization. The resulting\nUDA-FROVSS framework is the first UDA approach to effectively adapt across\ndomains without requiring shared categories.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"k0ISybwi1pI1pxaY1azAW5YkQb3eQoiAB2pZ4q3X0zs","pdfSize":"7048274"}
