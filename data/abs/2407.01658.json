We present a new decoder for quantum\nrandom linear codes (QRLCs) capable of dealing with imperfect decoding\noperations. A first approach, introduced by Cruz et al., only considered\nchannel errors, and perfect gates at the decoder. Here, we analyze the\nfault-tolerant characteristics of QRLCs with a new noise-guessing decoding\ntechnique, when considering preparation, measurement, and gate errors in the\nsyndrome extraction procedure, while also accounting for error degeneracy. Our\nfindings indicate a threshold error rate ($\\pth$) of approximately $\\pnum$ in\nthe asymptotic limit, while considering realistic noise levels in the mentioned\nphysical procedures.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LGPVDe1dFVd6Bdv8aOQKFEVailafUQqMsK8CQR4hvuU","pdfSize":"2131926"}
