This paper proposes a novel neural network\narchitecture, the MEP-Net, which combines the MEP with neural networks to\ngenerate probability distributions from moment constraints. We also provide a\ncomprehensive overview of the fundamentals of the maximum entropy principle,\nits mathematical formulations, and a rigorous justification for its\napplicability for non-equilibrium systems based on the large deviations\nprinciple. Through fruitful numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the\nMEP-Net can be particularly useful in modeling the evolution of probability\ndistributions in biochemical reaction networks and in generating complex\ndistributions from data.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Machine Learning","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"oQKWIYu0XHHishGwDMTq7Vs87Qlh3wLPBGHgKovlle0","pdfSize":"8437231"}
