  "abstract": "  Recent studies show that large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools for\nworking with natural language, bringing advances in many areas of computational\nlinguistics. However, these models face challenges when applied to low-resource\nlanguages due to limited training data and difficulty in understanding cultural\nnuances. Research is now focusing on multilingual models to improve LLM\nperformance for these languages. Education in these languages also struggles\nwith a lack of resources and qualified teachers, particularly in underdeveloped\nregions. Here, LLMs can be transformative, supporting innovative methods like\ncommunity-driven learning and digital platforms. This paper discusses how LLMs\ncould enhance education for low-resource languages, emphasizing practical\napplications and benefits.\n",
