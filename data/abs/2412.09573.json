However, deriving camera extrinsics and intrinsics from\nsparse-view images presents significant challenges. In this work, we present\nFreeSplatter, a highly scalable, feed-forward reconstruction framework capable\nof generating high-quality 3D Gaussians from uncalibrated sparse-view images\nand recovering their camera parameters in mere seconds. FreeSplatter is built\nupon a streamlined transformer architecture, comprising sequential\nself-attention blocks that facilitate information exchange among multi-view\nimage tokens and decode them into pixel-wise 3D Gaussian primitives. The\npredicted Gaussian primitives are situated in a unified reference frame,\nallowing for high-fidelity 3D modeling and instant camera parameter estimation\nusing off-the-shelf solvers. To cater to both object-centric and scene-level\nreconstruction, we train two model variants of FreeSplatter on extensive\ndatasets. In both scenarios, FreeSplatter outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines in terms of reconstruction quality and pose estimation accuracy.\nFurthermore, we showcase FreeSplatter's potential in enhancing the productivity\nof downstream applications, such as text/image-to-3D content creation.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pZpTA226vEmZWSQn51vWz9EsgTlFkeil4pv248EP85o","pdfSize":"16301069"}
