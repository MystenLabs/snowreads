  "abstract": "  Electromagnetism is the paradigm case of a theory that satisfies relativistic\nlocality. This can be proven by demonstrating that, once the theory's laws are\nimposed, what is happening within a region fixes what will happen in the\ncontracting light-cone with that region as its base. The Klein-Gordon and Dirac\nequations meet the same standard. We show that this standard can also be\napplied to quantum field theory (without collapse), examining two different\nways of assigning reduced density matrix states to regions of space. Our\npreferred method begins from field wave functionals and judges quantum field\ntheory to be local. Another method begins from particle wave functions (states\nin Fock space) and leads to either non-locality or an inability to assign\nstates to regions, depending on the choice of creation operators. We take this\nanalysis of quantum field theory (without collapse) to show that the\nmany-worlds interpretation of quantum physics is local at the fundamental\nlevel. We argue that this fundamental locality is compatible with either local\nor global accounts of the non-fundamental branching of worlds, countering an\nobjection that has been raised to the Sebens-Carroll derivation of the Born\nRule from self-locating uncertainty.\n",
