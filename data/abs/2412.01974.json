  "abstract": "  We study automatic sequences and automatic systems generated by general\nconstant length (nonprimitive) substitutions. While an automatic system is\ntypically uncountable, the set of automatic sequences is countable, implying\nthat most sequences within an automatic system are not themselves automatic. We\nprovide a complete and succinct classification of automatic sequences that lie\nin a given automatic system in terms of the quasi-fixed points of the\nsubstitution defining the system. Our result extends to factor maps between\nautomatic systems and highlights arithmetic properties underpinning these\nsystems. We conjecture that a similar statement holds for general nonconstant\nlength substitutions.\n",
