In this paper we address this problem by\nproposing a novel notion of quantitative assume-guarantee contracts, that\nenables the compositional design and verification of multi-agent systems with\nquantitative temporal specifications. The crux of these contracts lies in their\nability to capture the coordination between the individual agents to achieve an\noptimal value of the overall specification under any possible behavior of the\nexternal environment. We show that the proposed framework improves the\nscalability and modularity of formal verification of multi-agent systems\nagainst quantitative temporal specifications.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YBUtjYFVZJ2wvemKRgL9X2t-Xe1qc_-EXDa-wv5f41M","pdfSize":"317750"}
