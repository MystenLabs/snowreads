  "abstract": "  We expand on the method of sequential filtering for calculating spectra of\ninhomogeneous fields. Sadek & Aluie [Phys. Rev. Fluids, 3, 124610 (2018)]\nshowed that the kernel has to have at least $p$ vanishing moments to extract a\npower-law spectrum $k^{-\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha<p+2$ by low-pass filtering. Here,\nwe show that sequential high-pass filtering allows for extracting steeper\nspectra with $\\alpha<2p+3$ using the same $p$-th order kernel. For example, any\nspectrum of a field that is shallower than $k^{-5}$ can be extracted by\nsequential high-pass filtering using any 1st order kernel such as a Gaussian or\ntop-hat. Finally, we demonstrate how second-order structure functions fail to\ncapture spectral peaks because they cannot detect scaling that is too shallow.\n",
