  "abstract": "  We consider the relaxation of finite-wavevector density waves in a\nfacilitated classical lattice gas. Linear hydrodynamics predicts that such\nperturbations should relax exponentially, but nonlinear effects were predicted\nto cause subexponential relaxation via nonperturbative long-time tails. We\npresent a detailed numerical study of this effect. While our results clearly\nindicate the importance of nonlinear effects, we find that the\nwavevector-dependence of the late-time relaxation is clearly inconsistent with\ntheoretical predictions. We discuss manifestations of hydrodynamic\nnonlinearities in mesoscopic samples and at short times.\n",
