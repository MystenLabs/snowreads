In this paper, we investigate the memory\nand dynamical stability of magnetar bursts from four soft gamma repeater (SGR)\nsources: SGR 1806$-$20, SGR 1900+14, SGR J1935+2154 and SGR J1550$-$5418. Based\non the rescaled range analysis, we quantify the memory in magnetar bursts for\nthe first time and find that there exists long-term memory in the time series\nof both waiting time and energy. We investigate the dynamical stability in the\ncontext of randomness and chaos. For all the four SGR samples, we find that the\nwaiting time is not completely random, but the energy of two SGRs is consistent\nwith a total random organization. Furthermore, both waiting time and energy\nexhibits weak chaos. We also find no significant difference between SGRs and\nrepeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) in the randomness-chaos phase space. The\nstatistical similarity between SGRs and repeating FRBs hints that there may be\npotential physical connection between these two phenomena.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"380mg0a3v8WfRPf5wAKa9IiVWRjmZJI1b2RK2qV9wNk","pdfSize":"709114"}
