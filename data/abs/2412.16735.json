In addition, a signed\ndistance field is introduced to efficiently query the surface information\nrequired to compute the insulating effect caused by the char layer.\nNon-charring materials such as acrylic glass or non-combustible materials such\nas stone can also be modeled in the simulator. Adaptive data structures are\nutilized to enable memory-efficient computations within our multiresolution\napproach. The simulator is qualitatively validated by showcasing the numerical\nsimulation of a variety of scenes covering different kinds of structural\nconfigurations and materials. Two-way coupling of our combustion simulator and\nposition-based dynamics is demonstrated capturing characteristic mechanical\ndeformations caused by the combustion process. The volumetric combustion\nprocess of wooden structures is further quantitatively assessed by comparing\nour simulated results to sub-surface measurements of a real-world combustion\nexperiment.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Graphics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9otjH6OtDUNNW-7CR82RvgiXuixUd_crUS7hmrpycd8","pdfSize":"42396976"}
