However, current models following this\nparadigm assume that, for any user, all images uploaded by other users can be\nconsidered negative training examples (i.e. bad explanatory images), an\ninadvertedly naive labelling assumption that contradicts the rationale of the\napproach. This work proposes a new explainer training pipeline by leveraging\nPositive-Unlabelled (PU) Learning techniques to train image-based explainer\nwith refined subsets of reliable negative examples for each user selected\nthrough a novel user-personalized, two-step, similarity-based PU Learning\nalgorithm. Computational experiments show this PU-based approach outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art non-PU method in six popular real-world datasets, proving\nthat an improvement of visual-based RS explainability can be achieved by\nmaximizing training data quality rather than increasing model complexity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"DmdmLYnzWH8huFwt9e1N-JYQcardqnAnLiwbrynwvJE","pdfSize":"2967763"}
