The study addresses\nthree primary research questions: the comparative accuracy and efficiency of\nthe algorithms, the optimal configurations for each model, and the potential\napplications of the optimized models in a live system for monitoring public\nsentiment and its impact on the import bill. The dataset comprises tweets from\n2018 to 2024, divided into imbalanced, balanced, and temporal subsets to assess\nthe impact of data balancing and the COVID-19 pandemic on sentiment trends. Ten\nexperiments were conducted to evaluate the models under various configurations.\nResults indicated that VADER outperformed the other models in both multi-class\nand binary sentiment classifications. The study highlights significant changes\nin sentiment trends pre- and post-COVID-19, with implications for import\npolicies.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FuqpGer6MtPgVSO7SEfwcQIUagitGS0-jsymxXk_RZc","pdfSize":"940664"}
