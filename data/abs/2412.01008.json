  "abstract": "  Compared to p-values, e-values provably guarantee safe, valid inference. If\nthe goal is to test multiple hypotheses simultaneously, one can construct\ne-values for each individual test and then use the recently developed e-BH\nprocedure to properly correct for multiplicity. Standard e-value constructions,\nhowever, require distributional assumptions that may not be justifiable. This\npaper demonstrates that the generalized universal inference framework can be\nused along with the e-BH procedure to control frequentist error rates in\nmultiple testing when the quantities of interest are minimizers of risk\nfunctions, thereby avoiding the need for distributional assumptions. We\ndemonstrate the validity and power of this approach via a simulation study,\ntesting the significance of a predictor in quantile regression.\n",
