However, publicly available data\nand tools for career path prediction are scarce. In this work, we introduce\nKARRIEREWEGE, a comprehensive, publicly available dataset containing over 500k\ncareer paths, significantly surpassing the size of previously available\ndatasets. We link the dataset to the ESCO taxonomy to offer a valuable resource\nfor predicting career trajectories. To tackle the problem of free-text inputs\ntypically found in resumes, we enhance it by synthesizing job titles and\ndescriptions resulting in KARRIEREWEGE+. This allows for accurate predictions\nfrom unstructured data, closely aligning with real-world application\nchallenges. We benchmark existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on our dataset\nand a prior benchmark and observe improved performance and robustness,\nparticularly for free-text use cases, due to the synthesized data.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FCJqdw3wZZ73oDvJ5g8N3O-1pNZSOZ8TovqgX3KMYBs","pdfSize":"590225"}
