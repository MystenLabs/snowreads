We describe our bespoke approaches to\ntime-binning, community clustering, and connecting communities over time, as\nwell as our adaptation of state-of-the-art approaches to semantic change\ndetection and semantic leadership induction. We find substantial evidence of\nthe leadership role of BLM activists and progressives, as well as Black\ncelebrities. We also find evidence of the sustained engagement of the\nconservative community with this discourse, suggesting an alternative\nexplanation for how we arrived at the present moment, in which \"anti-woke\" and\n\"anti-CRT\" bills are being enacted nationwide.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Kh3-lQl45n3dOOO9AJ-zKzzLp79ycKQllpsLhl4raTo","pdfSize":"3024650"}
