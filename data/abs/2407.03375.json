The starting\npoint is a kinetic Boltzmann-type model derived from microscopic interactions\nrules for the opinion exchange among individuals holding a certain degree of\nconnectivity. The key idea is to derive from the kinetic model an Allen-Cahn\ntype equation for the fraction of individuals holding one of the two opinions.\nThe latter can be studied by means of a linear stability analysis and by\nexploiting integral operator analysis. While this is true for ternary\ninteractions, for binary interactions the derived equation of interest is a\nlinear scattering equation, that can be studied by means of General Relative\nEntropy tools and integral operators.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Y4wiQHT5SFcKLhQxJUvQ6LNjNQxAcfxHbMKfFUdlO9A","pdfSize":"610546"}
