  "abstract": "  We propose a mathematical model for tumor invasion supported by angiogenesis\nand interactions with the surrounding tissue. For the model deduction we employ\na multiscale approach starting from lower scales and obtaining by an informal\nparabolic upscaling a system of reaction-diffusion-taxis equations with a\nso-called 'taxis cascade', where one species is performing taxis towards a\nsignal whose production/decay is controled by the other, for which it also\nserves as a tactic cue. We prove global existence and uniqueness of solutions\nto the obtained PDE-ODE system and perform numerical simulations to illustrate\nthe behavior of solutions.\n",
