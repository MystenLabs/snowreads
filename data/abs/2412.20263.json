  "abstract": "  We consider the normalized adjacency matrix of a random $d$-regular graph on\n$N$ vertices with any fixed degree $d\\geq 3$ and denote its eigenvalues as\n$\\lambda_1=d/\\sqrt{d-1}\\geq \\lambda_2\\geq\\lambda_3\\cdots\\geq \\lambda_N$. We\nestablish the following two results as $N\\rightarrow \\infty$. (i) With high\nprobability, all eigenvalues are optimally rigid, up to an additional $N^{{\\rm\no}(1)}$ factor. Specifically, the fluctuations of bulk eigenvalues are bounded\nby $N^{-1+{\\rm o}(1)}$, and the fluctuations of edge eigenvalues are bounded by\n$N^{-2/3+{\\rm o}(1)}$. (ii) Edge universality holds for random $d$-regular\ngraphs. That is, the distributions of $\\lambda_2$ and $-\\lambda_N$ converge to\nthe Tracy-Widom$_1$ distribution associated with the Gaussian Orthogonal\nEnsemble. As a consequence, for sufficiently large $N$, approximately $69\\%$ of\n$d$-regular graphs on $N$ vertices are Ramanujan, meaning\n$\\max\\{\\lambda_2,|\\lambda_N|\\}\\leq 2$.\n",
