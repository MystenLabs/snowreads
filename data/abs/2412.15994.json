For $\\mathbb{S}^2$ spin\nsystems close to the Landau-Lifschitz point (where the\nhelimagnetic/ferromagnetic transition occurs), it is well established that for\nchirality transitions emerge with vanishing energy. Inspired by recent work on\nthe $N$-clock model, we consider a spin model where spins are constrained to\n$k_n$ copies of $\\mathbb{S}^1$ covering $\\mathbb{S}^2$ as $n\\to\\infty$. We\nidentify a critical energy-scaling regime and a threshold for the divergence\nrate of $k_n\\to+\\infty$, below which the $\\Gamma$-limit of the discrete\nenergies capture chirality transitions while retaining an $\\mathbb{S}^2$-valued\nenergy description in the continuum limit.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yaLSOd0tI86GfTY22taSetJr_aUTclwDm5wC-72bcJM","pdfSize":"513489"}
