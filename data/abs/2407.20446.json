This dataset provides a synchronized\nstream of event data and grayscale images of traffic scenes, captured using the\nDynamic and Active-Pixel Vision Sensor (DAVIS) 240c hybrid event-based camera.\nMEVDT comprises 63 multi-modal sequences with approximately 13k images, 5M\nevents, 10k object labels, and 85 unique object tracking trajectories.\nAdditionally, MEVDT includes manually annotated ground truth labels\n$\\unicode{x2014}$ consisting of object classifications, pixel-precise bounding\nboxes, and unique object IDs $\\unicode{x2014}$ which are provided at a labeling\nfrequency of 24 Hz. Designed to advance the research in the domain of\nevent-based vision, MEVDT aims to address the critical need for high-quality,\nreal-world annotated datasets that enable the development and evaluation of\nobject detection and tracking algorithms in automotive environments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8Cds_D00w27f9MbjE2tWyoWpSIQ6wpeILcpDEekcofY","pdfSize":"10003183","objectId":"0xa102d6ad7db4d87008c0b6b56009202172c2148f198e2a5a53ce7f9efee2dd2a","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
