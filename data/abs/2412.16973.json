Unlike traditional random number generators,\nrandomness obtained from nonlocal correlations is fundamentally guaranteed to\nbe unpredictable. However, it is also highly susceptible to noise. Here, we\nshow that extending the conventional bipartite Bell scenario to hybrid quantum\nnetworks -- which incorporate both quantum channels and entanglement sources --\nenhances the robustness of certifiable randomness. Our protocol even enables\nrandomness to be certified from Bell-local states, broadening the range of\nquantum states useful for this task. Through both theoretical analysis and\nexperimental validation in a photonic network, we demonstrate enhanced\nperformance and improved noise resilience.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wlg5-NB1B_j05RrzyIM6hp4EUXhjvCGL1ANMuaGXnTs","pdfSize":"891251"}
