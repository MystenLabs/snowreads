  "abstract": "  Conjugate phase retrieval considers the recovery of a function, up to a\nunimodular constant and conjugation, from its phaseless measurements. In this\npaper, we explore the conjugate phase retrieval in a shift-invariant space\ngenerated by a Gaussian funciton. First, we show that the modulus function in\nthe Gaussian shift-invariant space can be determined from the phaseless Hermite\nsamples taken on a discrete sampling set. We then show that a function in the\nshift-invariant space generated by a Gaussian can be uniquely determined, up to\na unimodular constant and conjugation, from its phaseless Hermite samples on a\ndiscrete set. For the functions with finite coefficient sequences, we provide\nan explicit reconstruction procedure.\n",
