Under a\ndependent multifactor model, we develop a fully data-driven orchestrated\napproximate message passing algorithm for integrating information across these\nfeature sets to achieve statistically optimal signal recovery. In practice,\nthese reference data sets are often queried later by new subjects that are only\npartially observed. Leveraging on asymptotic normality of estimates generated\nby our data integration method, we further develop an asymptotically valid\nprediction set for the latent representation of any such query subject. We\ndemonstrate the prowess of both the data integration and the prediction set\nconstruction algorithms on a tri-modal single-cell dataset.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CoVLREt5gV7wyTxLC3GSEAEy79AkAf3TDT8zhx-Ag-k","pdfSize":"1874711","objectId":"0xaf51054f7e0ad50bc1941679c40d908e7284335ef83ada82a705be257e0b3a24","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
