To this\nend, we launch a blue-detuned partial standing wave and two red-detuned light\nfields through the nanofiber. We demonstrate the trapping of atoms in the array\nand characterize the resulting trap configuration by measuring the trap\nfrequencies in three directions and observe good agreement with theoretical\npredictions. The implementation of this nanofiber-based optical interface with\nmagic trapping wavelengths and sub-$\\lambda/2$ spacing is an important step\ntowards the exploration of novel collective radiative effects such as selective\nradiance in 1D atomic arrays.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SwHrEgDj2xFWd6QXEDWUWUDLZJv4sGbWvgQ5V9NALvY","pdfSize":"1103852"}
