Language varies along several axes, most\nimportantly, language instance (e.g. French) and domain (e.g. news). While\nadapting NLP models to new languages within a single domain, or to new domains\nwithin a single language, is widely studied, research in joint adaptation is\nhampered by the lack of evaluation datasets. This prevents the transfer of NLP\nsystems from well-resourced languages and domains to non-dominant\nlanguage-domain combinations. To address this gap, we introduce M2QA, a\nmulti-domain multilingual question answering benchmark. M2QA includes 13,500\nSQuAD 2.0-style question-answer instances in German, Turkish, and Chinese for\nthe domains of product reviews, news, and creative writing. We use M2QA to\nexplore cross-lingual cross-domain performance of fine-tuned models and\nstate-of-the-art LLMs and investigate modular approaches to domain and language\nadaptation. We witness 1) considerable performance variations across\ndomain-language combinations within model classes and 2) considerable\nperformance drops between source and target language-domain combinations across\nall model sizes. We demonstrate that M2QA is far from solved, and new methods\nto effectively transfer both linguistic and domain-specific information are\nnecessary. We make M2QA publicly available at https://github.com/UKPLab/m2qa.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"kOiUOFNdPxe24BVHPiw5Dejnx-S7U5e5oSY1htBszCk","pdfSize":"844545"}
