We use standard\nsoftware to fit single S\\'ersic models to each galaxy in the rest-frame optical\nand extract their parametric structural parameters (S\\'ersic index, half-light\nradius and axis-ratio), and \\texttt{Morfometryka} to measure their\nnon-parametric concentration and asymmetry parameters. We find a wide range of\nsizes for these early galaxies, but with a strong galaxy-size mass correlation\nup to $z \\sim 12$ such that galaxy sizes continue to get progressively smaller\nin the high-redshift regime, following $R_{e} = 2.74 \\pm 0.49 \\left( 1 + z\n\\right) ^{-0.79 \\pm 0.08}$ kpc. Using non-parametric methods we find that\ngalaxy merger fractions, classified through asymmetry parameters, at these\nredshifts remain consistent with those in literature, maintaining a value of\n$f_{m} \\sim 0.12 \\pm 0.07$ showing little dependence with redshift when\ncombined with literature at $z > 4$. We find that galaxies which are smaller in\nsize also appear rounder, with an excess of high axis-ratio objects. Finally,\nwe artificially redshift a subsample of our objects to determine how robust the\nobservational trends we see are, determining that observed trends are due to\nreal evolutionary effects, rather than being a consequence of redshift effects.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"lO-XBtbq5pnAbYlyzJ1tFT3Dvy8Q76C3eKUBTuvczxs","pdfSize":"17336107"}
