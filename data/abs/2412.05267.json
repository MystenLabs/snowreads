Our\napproach is rooted in semiclassical methods of scattering amplitudes which have\nrecently been developed for application to gravitational-wave physics. The\ndiagrams we encounter do not compute a standard amplitude, but rather an in-in\ngeneralisation of an amplitude which is closely connected to the Bogoliubov\ncoefficients. We also compute the subdominant one-loop correction in our\nperturbative approach, analogous to the triangle correction to Schwarzschild\nscattering. This term can be interpreted as a finite-size correction sensitive\nto the radius of the black hole.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Dy0PX8Ndp0SV0SiOXes5eqoH22eGXnx95S0BnA5kxrc","pdfSize":"550028"}
