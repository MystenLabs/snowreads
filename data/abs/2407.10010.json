We prove that these numbers are\nindependent of the choices made in their definition and that, for the local\nring of an isolated singularity, they can be expressed in terms of the Hodge\nnumbers of the cohomology of the link of the singularity. We give examples of\nisolated singularities with the same Lyubeznik numbers but different\nHodge-Lyubeznik numbers.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TOebYP_h3GkKoVYblBCyS8bX2TX1GXzLLNmH3WUdEGU","pdfSize":"158433","objectId":"0x683b3111a510539521656beaee13b9f3ddeab49b81af3d76c76a3a0045919595","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
