  "abstract": "  Statutory article retrieval plays a crucial role in making legal information\nmore accessible to both laypeople and legal professionals. Multilingual\ncountries like Belgium present unique challenges for retrieval models due to\nthe need for handling legal issues in multiple languages. Building on the\nBelgian Statutory Article Retrieval Dataset (BSARD) in French, we introduce the\nbilingual version of this dataset, bBSARD. The dataset contains parallel\nBelgian statutory articles in both French and Dutch, along with legal questions\nfrom BSARD and their Dutch translation. Using bBSARD, we conduct extensive\nbenchmarking of retrieval models available for Dutch and French. Our\nbenchmarking setup includes lexical models, zero-shot dense models, and\nfine-tuned small foundation models. Our experiments show that BM25 remains a\ncompetitive baseline compared to many zero-shot dense models in both languages.\nWe also observe that while proprietary models outperform open alternatives in\nthe zero-shot setting, they can be matched or surpassed by fine-tuning small\nlanguage-specific models. Our dataset and evaluation code are publicly\navailable.\n",
