It is unknown whether\nthese CP effects result from innately determined brain maturation or as a\nstabilization of neural connections naturally induced by experience. In this\nstudy, we use language models (LMs) to test the extent to which these phenomena\nare peculiar to humans, or shared by a broader class of language learners. We\nvary the age of exposure by training LMs on language pairs in various\nexperimental conditions, and find that LMs, which lack any direct analog to\ninnate maturational stages, do not show CP effects when trained sequentially on\nL1 and L2. Our results contradict the claim that CP effects are an inevitable\nresult of learning in statistical learners, and they are consistent with an\ninnate mechanism for CP effects. We show that we can reverse-engineer the CP by\nintroducing a regularizer partway through training to simulate a maturational\ndecrease in plasticity. All in all, our results suggest that L1 learning on its\nown may not be enough to induce a CP, and additional engineering is necessary\nto make language models more cognitively plausible.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vxt4ZJtNfUtjAOhfBaWtikiQaPL0N_Ts05iAim1DrEE","pdfSize":"1028638","objectId":"0x8dd0273e02fe3e74b38054ff4a386eab38d072562440cc83b6d961aa4601f747","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
