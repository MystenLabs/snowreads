The signal under investigation is the ALP\ndecay into two photons. Assuming dark matter (DM) to be in the form of ALPs, we\nanalyze the signal from the DM halos of dwarf spheroidal galaxies, the Large\nMagellanic Cloud and the Milky Way. We find that SPHEREx can significantly\nimprove current limits on the axion-photon coupling in the 0.5-3 eV ALP mass\nrange.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"R58rY8fwjWFG2HlWyjtGSDclBSi7QhWUebT1Jk8uDuY","pdfSize":"625806"}
