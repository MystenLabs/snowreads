  "abstract": "  Tech neck is a modern epidemic caused by prolonged device usage and it can\nlead to significant neck strain and discomfort. This paper addresses the\nchallenge of detecting and preventing tech neck syndrome using non-invasive\nubiquitous sensing techniques. We present NeckCare, a novel system leveraging\nhearable sensors, including IMUs and microphones, to monitor tech neck postures\nand estimate distance form screen in real-time. By analyzing pitch,\ndisplacement, and acoustic ranging data from 15 participants, we achieve\nposture classification accuracy of 96% using IMU data alone and 99% when\ncombined with audio data. Our distance estimation technique is millimeter-level\naccurate even in noisy conditions. NeckCare provides immediate feedback to\nusers, promoting healthier posture and reducing neck strain. Future work will\nexplore personalizing alerts, predicting muscle strain, integrating neck\nexercise detection and enhancing digital eye strain prediction.\n",
