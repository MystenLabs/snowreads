This paper\npresents a comprehensive SWOT analysis of Metas Movie Gen, a cutting-edge\ngenerative AI foundation model designed to produce 1080p HD videos with\nsynchronized audio from simple text prompts. We explore its strengths,\nincluding high-resolution video generation, precise editing, and seamless audio\nintegration, which make it a transformative tool across industries such as\nfilmmaking, advertising, and education. However, the analysis also addresses\nlimitations, such as constraints on video length and potential biases in\ngenerated content, which pose challenges for broader adoption. In addition, we\nexamine the evolving regulatory and ethical considerations surrounding\ngenerative AI, focusing on issues like content authenticity, cultural\nrepresentation, and responsible use. Through comparative insights with leading\nmodels like DALL-E and Google Imagen, this paper highlights Movie Gens unique\nfeatures, such as video personalization and multimodal synthesis, while\nidentifying opportunities for innovation and areas requiring further research.\nOur findings provide actionable insights for stakeholders, emphasizing both the\nopportunities and challenges of deploying generative AI in media production.\nThis work aims to guide future advancements in generative AI, ensuring\nscalability, quality, and ethical integrity in this rapidly evolving field.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uqTtOxnxrbsDsY9Llf8DQh6BRvxUOnneA9GA9NTkj7g","pdfSize":"363086"}
