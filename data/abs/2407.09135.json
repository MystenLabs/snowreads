Using the Advanced\nExposure Time Calculator (AETC), we evaluate MORFEO astrometric accuracy in\nmoderately crowded fields. Our simulations account for spatially variable Point\nSpread Function (PSF), geometric distortion, and rotation-dependent variations.\nWe computed focal plane coordinates using observed stellar distribution and\ncomputed population synthesis with the SPISEA tool, generating stellar\nmagnitude distributions for MICADO filters at selected metallicities and\nstellar ages. Our analysis shows that MORFEO can achieve high-precision\nastrometry in the galaxy neighborhood (within $\\mu < 24$ mag) by minimizing PSF\nenlargement and optimizing calibration strategies. These results inform future\nobservational campaigns and contribute to the development of astrometric\nscience cases for the ELT.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XfYhr6WQ30l63IPg7CZsEOtR0TgZvLCstXM6HX-gJIA","pdfSize":"3997913"}
