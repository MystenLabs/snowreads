As simulators do not suffer from noise, the metric used\nin the comparison is the time required to simulate a set Quantum Volume. The\nresults are important to estimate the feasibility of proof of concept studies\nand debugging of quantum algorithms on HPC systems. Besides benchmarks of some\ncommonly used simulators, this paper also offers an overview of their main\nfeatures, a review of the state of quantum computing simulation and quantum\ncomputing benchmarking, and some insight into the theory of Quantum Volume.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qqLNl_jj1I1dv1aKlnUoNfinGos_is6gbCGzasZ_z5s","pdfSize":"716480"}
