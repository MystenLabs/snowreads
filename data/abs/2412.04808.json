We establish the\nharmonic mapping counterpart of the well-known Zalcman-Pang lemma and as a\nconsequence, we prove that a harmonic mapping whose spherical derivative is\nbounded away from zero is normal. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of the\nextended spherical derivative for harmonic mappings and obtain several\nsufficient conditions for a harmonic mapping to be $\\varphi$-normal.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rUsUhAk1ug_wp3vFnCsz5QTpE389wuBWRnjq7rQkilA","pdfSize":"209718"}
