HumorDB consists of meticulously curated\nimage pairs with contrasting humor ratings, emphasizing subtle visual cues that\ntrigger humor and mitigating potential biases. The dataset enables evaluation\nthrough binary classification(Funny or Not Funny), range regression(funniness\non a scale from 1 to 10), and pairwise comparison tasks(Which Image is\nFunnier?), effectively capturing the subjective nature of humor perception.\nInitial experiments reveal that while vision-only models struggle,\nvision-language models, particularly those leveraging large language models,\nshow promising results. HumorDB also shows potential as a valuable zero-shot\nbenchmark for powerful large multimodal models.
