Methods for\nquantifying geometric similarity in neural representations have become a\npopular tool for identifying computational principles that are potentially\nshared across neural systems. These methods generally assume that neural\nresponses are deterministic and static. However, responses of biological\nsystems, and some artificial systems, are noisy and dynamically unfold over\ntime. Furthermore, these characteristics can have substantial influence on a\nsystem's computational capabilities. Here, we demonstrate that existing metrics\ncan fail to capture key differences between neural systems with noisy dynamic\nresponses. We then propose a metric for comparing the geometry of noisy neural\ntrajectories, which can be derived as an optimal transport distance between\nGaussian processes. We use the metric to compare models of neural responses in\ndifferent regions of the motor system and to compare the dynamics of latent\ndiffusion models for text-to-image synthesis.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DPvEigyoLbFOgiyP4HOJGI3pvs0FDpGPpQ4KKgad5mw","pdfSize":"9019688"}
