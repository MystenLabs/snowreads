It is shown that for any combination of substrate\ntemperature and drop discharge, there is a critical height above which unfrozen\nwater accumulates at the stalagmite's tip, drips and develops into fingers that\ngive a star-shape to the stalagmite. Both the vertical growth and the radial\ngrowth of the stalagmite are discussed through the Stefan problem and mass\nscaling arguments respectively. Finally, a phase diagram that presents the\nstalagmite aspect ratio in function of the main control parameters is proposed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2MEzlzbw5Ao_e7jc-rqcATG7bXlL_FRfQALvqz4Ckqs","pdfSize":"7338933"}
