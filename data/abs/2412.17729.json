  "abstract": "  Existing humor datasets and evaluations predominantly focus on English,\nleaving limited resources for culturally nuanced humor in non-English languages\nlike Chinese. To address this gap, we construct Chumor, the first Chinese humor\nexplanation dataset that exceeds the size of existing humor datasets. Chumor is\nsourced from Ruo Zhi Ba, a Chinese Reddit-like platform known for sharing\nintellectually challenging and culturally specific jokes. We test ten LLMs\nthrough direct and chain-of-thought prompting, revealing that Chumor poses\nsignificant challenges to existing LLMs, with their accuracy slightly above\nrandom and far below human. In addition, our analysis highlights that\nhuman-annotated humor explanations are significantly better than those\ngenerated by GPT-4o and ERNIE-4-turbo. We release Chumor at\nhttps://huggingface.co/datasets/dnaihao/Chumor, our project page is at\nhttps://dnaihao.github.io/Chumor-dataset/, our leaderboard is at\nhttps://huggingface.co/spaces/dnaihao/Chumor, and our codebase is at\nhttps://github.com/dnaihao/Chumor-dataset.\n",
