  "abstract": "  Regarding the concepts of urban management, digital transformation, and smart\ncities, various issues are presented. Currently, we like to attend to location\nallocation problems that can be a new part of digital transformation in urban\nmanagement (such as locating and placing facilities, locating and arranging\ncenters such as aid and rescue centers, or even postal hubs,\ntelecommunications, electronic equipment, and data centers, and routing in\ntransportation optimization). These issues, which are seemingly simple but in\npractice complex, are important in urban environments, and the issue of\naccurate location allocation based on existing criteria directly impacts cost\nmanagement, profit, efficiency, and citizen satisfaction. In recent years,\nresearchers have used or presented various models and methods for location\nallocation problems, some of which will be mentioned in this article. Given the\nnature of these problems, which are optimization problems, this article will\nalso examine existing research from an optimization perspective in summary.\nFinally, a brief conclusion will be made of the existing methods and their\nweaknesses, and suggestions will be made for continuing the path and improving\nscientific and practical research in this field.\n",
