Our investigation spans two frameworks: bulk boundary and restricted\nphase space (RPS) thermodynamics. In the bulk boundary framework, we face\nsingular zero points revealing topological charges influenced by the free\nparameter $(\\lambda)$ with a positive topological charge $(\\omega = +1)$ and\nthe total topological charge $(W = +1)$, indicating the presence of a single\nstable on-shell black hole. Further analysis shows that when $(\\lambda)$ is set\nto zero, the equations align with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy structure,\ndemonstrating different behaviors with multiple topological charges $(\\omega =\n+1, -1, +1)$. Notably, increasing the parameter $\\alpha$ in Sharma-Mittal\nentropy results in multiple topological charges $(\\omega = +1, -1, +1)$ with\nthe total topological charge $(W = +1)$. Conversely, increasing $(\\beta)$\nreduces the number of topological charges, maintaining the total topological\ncharge $(W = +1)$. Extending our study to the restricted phase space, we\nobserve consistent topological charges $(\\omega = +1)$ across all conditions\nand parameters. This consistency persists even when reducing to\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy, suggesting similar behaviors in both non-extended\nand Hawking entropy states within RPS.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qbavamP6JWn8DuvEkfRKEm90A6DRzqLaoQA65UQUVMc","pdfSize":"1584460"}
