By using the structure theorem of double\ncomplexes due to Stelzig and Qi-Khovanov, we show there are exactly $3$\nisomorphism types in this family and determine explicitly structures of these\n$3$ types. As an application, we computed the Fr\\\"olicher spectral sequence for\neach fiber in the Kuranishi family of the Iwasawa manifold.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"7svttmYRb94pFHFGMjDEkNxAlzLmuhwDvlpQtadmd7A","pdfSize":"264270"}
