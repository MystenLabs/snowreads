Although a handful of relevant surveys have been conducted,\ntheir coverage is still limited. In this work, we present a comprehensive\nsurvey on 3D point cloud registration, covering a set of sub-areas such as\npairwise coarse registration, pairwise fine registration, multi-view\nregistration, cross-scale registration, and multi-instance registration. The\ndatasets, evaluation metrics, method taxonomy, discussions of the merits and\ndemerits, insightful thoughts of future directions are comprehensively\npresented in this survey.
