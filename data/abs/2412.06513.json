Recent work by Christodolou, Fiat, Koutsoupias, and\nSgouritsa (\"Fair allocation in graphs\", EC 2023) establishes the existence of\nEFX allocations for graphical valuations, when agents are vertices in a graph,\nitems are edges, and each item has zero value for all agents other than those\nat its end-points. Thus in this setting, each good has non-zero value for at\nmost two agents, and there is at most one good valued by any pair of agents.\nThis marks one of the few cases when an exact and complete EFX allocation is\nknown to exist for arbitrary agents.\n  In this work, we extend these results to multi-graphs, when each pair of\nvertices can have more than one edge between them. The existence of EFX\nallocations in multi-graphs is a natural open question given their existence in\nsimple graphs. We show that EFX allocations exist, and can be computed in\npolynomial time, for agents with cancellable valuations in the following cases:\n(i) bipartite multi-graphs, (ii) multi-trees with monotone valuations, and\n(iii) multi-graphs with girth $(2t-1)$, where $t$ is the chromatic number of\nthe multi-graph. The existence in multi-cycles follows from (i) and (iii).\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"s9-rcKyGeGEuqgYHeoUMy0aIHC85YkM25iP9bRPJZms","pdfSize":"223773"}
