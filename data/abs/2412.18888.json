This result allows to construct a new class of shortest\ngeodesics (in the proper class of all metric spaces) connecting such subset of\na metric tree with the tree itself. In particular, the technique elaborated is\ndemonstrated on subsets of the real line.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0Atg0xQRiQ0DLeHu3OVy-n0rSwGmKg9cdf37eoMjH2Q","pdfSize":"157591"}
