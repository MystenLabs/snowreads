Current kriging techniques can handle linear dependencies on\nspatially referenced covariates. Although splines have shown promise in\ncapturing nonlinear dependencies of covariates, their combination with kriging,\nespecially in handling count data, remains underexplored. This paper proposes a\nnovel Bayesian approach to the low-rank representation of geoadditive models,\nwhich integrates splines and kriging to account for both spatial correlations\nand nonlinear dependencies of covariates. The proposed method accommodates\nGaussian and count data inherent in many geospatial datasets. Additionally,\nLaplace approximations to selected posterior distributions enhances\ncomputational efficiency, resulting in faster computation times compared to\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo techniques commonly used for Bayesian inference.\nMethod performance is assessed through a simulation study, demonstrating the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach. The methodology is applied to the\nanalysis of heavy metal concentrations in the Meuse river and vulnerability to\nthe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Belgium. Through this work, we\nprovide a new flexible and computationally efficient framework for analyzing\nspatial data.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"g3UUE7LRFRISecoIbvUMY1ulffQRM6V4jSHoDQriCVU","pdfSize":"1371064"}
