With the pressing climate goals set\nand the potential of Biochar Carbon Removal (BCR) as a climate-relevant\ntechnology, scaling up the number of new plants to over 1000 facilities per\nyear by 2030 becomes imperative. However, such a massive scale-up presents not\nonly technical challenges but also control and regulation issues, ensuring\nmaximal output of plants while conforming to regulatory requirements.\n  In this paper, we present a novel method of optimizing the process of a\nbiochar plant based on machine learning methods. We show how a standard Random\nForest Regressor can be used to model the states of the pyrolysis machine, the\nphysics of which remains highly complex. This model then serves as a surrogate\nof the machine -- reproducing several key outcomes of the machine -- in a\nnumerical optimization. This, in turn, could enable us to reduce NOx emissions\n-- a key regulatory goal in that industry -- while achieving maximal output\nstill. In a preliminary test our approach shows remarkable results, proves to\nbe applicable on two different machines from different manufacturers, and can\nbe implemented on standard Internet of Things (IoT) devices more generally.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9qD9c9jRKmbOevjb_o76ij1IVyccgnvqcVt_NB6yTCg","pdfSize":"1638922"}
