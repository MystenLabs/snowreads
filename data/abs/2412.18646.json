It formalizes the notion of an infinite sequence\nof qubits. The von Neumann entropy $H(d)$ of a density matrix $d$ is the\nShannon entropy of its eigenvalue distribution. We show: (1) If $\\rho$ is a\ncomputable quantum Schnorr random state then $\\lim_n [H(\\rho_n )/n] = 1$. (2)\nWe define quantum s-tests for $s\\in [0,1]$, show that $\\liminf_n\n[H(\\rho_n)/n]\\geq \\{ s: \\rho$ is covered by a quantum s-test $\\}$ for\ncomputable $\\rho$ and construct states where this inequality is an equality.\n(3) If $\\exists c \\exists^\\infty n H(\\rho_n)> n-c$ then $\\rho$ is strong\nquantum random. Strong quantum randomness is a randomness notion which implies\nquantum Schnorr randomness relativized to any oracle. (4) A computable state\n$(\\rho_n)_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ is quantum Schnorr random iff the family of\ndistributions of the $\\rho_n$'s is uniformly integrable. We show that the\nimplications in (1) and (3) are strict.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computer Science/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Dq0_aGFkXj19Xt4OaKnWqfuG1yx01xawUYUa_wCIjQA","pdfSize":"384837"}
