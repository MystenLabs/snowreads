We investigate the accretion properties of\nthe soft X-ray transient XTE J1856+053 during its 2023 outburst obtained by\nNICER and NuSTAR data in July. We present detailed results on the timing and\nspectral analysis of the X-ray emission during the outburst. The power spectral\ndensity shows no quasi-periodic oscillation features. The source's spectrum on\nJuly 19 can be well-fitted with a multi-color blackbody component, a power-law\ncomponent, and a reflection component with a broadened iron emission line.\nNICER spectra can be well-fitted by considering a combination of a blackbody\nand a power-law. The source exhibits a transition within just five days from a\nsoft state to an intermediate state during the outburst decline phase. The\ninner accretion disk has a low inclination angle ($\\sim18^\\circ$). The spectral\nanalysis also suggests a high-spin ($a>0.9$) BH as the central accreting\nobject.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"huiEHfrXRULbrqTkRbnWyGY9OxMIE8HjD8xkTSNu6A0","pdfSize":"1191709","objectId":"0x4f66dd6a53d15e02d65a45ef0f7bd07db679fc619c39cd2e64f8316ab407acf9","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
