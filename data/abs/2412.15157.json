  "abstract": "  The integrated photonics CMOS-compatible silicon nitride (SiN) platform is\npraised for its low propagation loss, but is limited by its lack of active\nfunctionalities such as a strong Pockels coefficient and intrinsic \\c{hi}(2)\nnonlinearity. In this paper, we demonstrate the integration of centimetre-long\nthin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) devices on a SiN platform using the\nmicro-transfer printing (uTP) method. At a wavelength of 1550 nm, propagation\nlosses of approximately 0.9 dB/cm and transition losses of 1.8 dB per facet\nwere measured. Furthermore, the TFLN was integrated into an imbalanced\npush-pull Mach-Zehnder modulator, achieving a V{\\pi} of 3.2 V. The\nelectro-optics nature of the observed modulation is confirmed by measuring the\ndevice up to 35 GHz, showing that the printing does not affect the high-speed\nLN properties.\n",
