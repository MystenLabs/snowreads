While recent adaptive indexing approaches\naddress this need, they are cases where demonstrate poor performance.\nParticularly, during the initial queries, in regions with a high density of\nobjects, and in very large files over commodity hardware. This work introduces\nan approach for adaptive indexing driven by both query workload and\nuser-defined accuracy constraints to support approximate query answering. The\napproach is based on partial index adaptation which reduces the costs\nassociated with reading data files and refining indexes. We leverage a\nhierarchical tile-based indexing scheme and its stored metadata to provide\nefficient query evaluation, ensuring accuracy within user-specified bounds. Our\npreliminary evaluation demonstrates improvement on query evaluation time,\nespecially during initial user exploration.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Jn-sO4FGUfbS1t0T6cMUGW0TZoLp5FwYhaEC9mvyzWs","pdfSize":"366107","objectId":"0xd5aae7404e12fdfd464fb64e5fdf965b531049bb023fe07ffcddfeffb87d9256","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
