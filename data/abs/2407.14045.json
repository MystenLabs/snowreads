In this paper,\nideologically heterogeneous agents choose the ideological composition of their\nneighborhood, their tolerance, and invest into connections. The resulting\nweighted network describes allies, opponents, and strengths. Disputes with\nopponents determine benefits, which increase in an agent's strength and\ncohesion. Cohesive agents have fewer mutual allies with opponents. In\nequilibrium, the network is segregated when cohesion is effective enough and\nsome agents tolerate ideologically distant types to oppose closer ones.\nSubsidizing connections dampens polarization in societies on the verge of\nsegregation.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"L886_YSRom1R82Pil1TVnLkbKsh3oKBwubC3j6_bRpI","pdfSize":"329666"}
