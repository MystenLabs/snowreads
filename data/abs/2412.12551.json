  "abstract": "  We study spectra of Toeplitz operators $T_a $ with periodic symbols in\nBergman spaces $A^2(\\Pi)$ on unbounded periodic planar domains $\\Pi$, which are\ndefined as the union of infinitely many copies of the translated, bounded\nperiodic cell $\\varpi$. We introduce Floquet-transform techniques and prove a\nversion of the band-gap-spectrum formula, which is well-known in the framework\nof periodic elliptic spectral problems and which describes the essential\nspectrum of $T_a$ in terms of the spectra of a family of Toepliz-type operators\n$T_{a,\\eta}$ in the cell $\\varpi$, where $\\eta$ is the so-called Floquet\nvariable.\n  As an application, we consider periodic domains $\\Pi_h$ containing thin\ngeometric structures and show how to construct a Toeplitz operator $T_{\\sf a}:\nA^2(\\Pi_h) \\to A^2(\\Pi_h)$ such that the essential spectrum of $T_{\\sf a}$\ncontains disjoint components which approximatively coincide with any given\nfinite set of real numbers. Moreover, our method provides a systematic and\nillustrative way how to construct such examples by using Toeplitz operators on\nthe unit disc $\\mathbb{D}$ e.g. with radial symbols.\n  Using a Riemann mapping one can then find a Toeplitz operator $T_a :\nA^2(\\mathbb{D}) \\to A^2(\\mathbb{D})$ with a bounded symbol and with the same\nspectral properties as $T_{\\sf a}$.\n",
