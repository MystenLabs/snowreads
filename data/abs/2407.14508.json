The star formation in the Galactic thin and thick disc, with peak\nmetallicities of $-0.20$ and $-0.45$ dex, is found to have peaked about 5.5 and\n12.5 Gyr ago, respectively. The thin disc is also found to have experienced an\ninitial star formation burst about 12.5 Gyr ago. The pro-grade population\nSplash and hot-disc (HD), with peak metallicity of about $-0.60$ and $-0.43$,\nare found to be about 13.03 and 12.21 Gyr old, respectively, with peak\neccentricity of 0.70 and 0.35, are understood to be of in situ origin. The\nGaia-Enceladus/Sausage (GE/S), Thamnos and Sequoia, with peak metallicity of\nabout $-1.31$, $-1.36$ and $-1.56$, are found to be about 11.66, 12.89 and\n12.18 Gyr, respectively, and are understood to be remnants of dwarf galaxies\nmerged with the Milky Way. The HD, Splash, and Thamnos are found to have\nexperienced chemical evolution similar to the thick disc while GE/S, Sequoia,\nand Helmi stream are found to have experienced distinct chemical enrichment of\niron and $\\alpha$-elements.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Wr2HPUZFmkdTICErDcOykqlLQyQ1dJXnXzxpq2AfBJ4","pdfSize":"2629192","objectId":"0x33be33c8ffde9bfe8e5cc57c620d9dc9508bcaf3ce36b114b31b7e9afd2aa1a0","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
