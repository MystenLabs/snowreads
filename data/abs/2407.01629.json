As such, planar knotoid diagrams\nrepresent the same knotoid in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ if and only if they can be\npresented as the closure of two labeled braidoid diagrams related by an\nequivalence relation, named $L$-equivalence. In this paper, we refine the\nnotion of $L$-equivalence of braidoid diagrams in order to obtain an\nequivalence theorem for (multi)-knotoid diagrams in $S^2$ when represented as\nthe closure of labeled braidoid diagrams.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"O3X8wnTOVO0hhOF5S5c2EODUEyZAqTpkt8Ibv5Auc7Y","pdfSize":"940083"}
