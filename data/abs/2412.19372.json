In this study, we\npresent a novel approach to mid-price forecasting using Level 1 limit order\nbook (LOB) data from NASDAQ, focusing on 100 U.S. stocks from the S&P 500 index\nduring the period from September to November 2022. Expanding on our previous\nwork with Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFNN), which leveraged\nautomated feature importance techniques based on mean decrease impurity (MDI)\nand gradient descent (GD), we introduce the Adaptive Learning Policy Engine\n(ALPE) - a reinforcement learning (RL)-based agent designed for batch-free,\nimmediate mid-price forecasting. ALPE incorporates adaptive epsilon decay to\ndynamically balance exploration and exploitation, outperforming a diverse range\nof highly effective machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models in\nforecasting performance.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xn_7OoXgHVhFqsu6uEJiIvCdey7qQcIUlEkR4h5pegQ","pdfSize":"2053912"}
