However, the same cannot be said\nfor the field's strength and geometry at the convective-radiative boundary,\nwhich are crucial when performing asteroseismic inference. In this Letter, we\npresent three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a 7\nsolar mass mid-main sequence star, with particular attention given to the\nconvective-radiative boundary in the near-core region. Our simulations reveal\nthat the toroidal magnetic field is significantly stronger than the poloidal\nfield in this region, contrary to recent assumptions. Moreover, the rotational\nshear layer, also important for asteroseismic inference, is specifically\nconfined within the extent of the buoyancy frequency peak. These results, which\nare based on the inferred properties of HD 43317, have widespread implications\nfor asteroseismic studies of rotation, mixing and magnetism in stars. While we\nexpect our results to be broadly applicable across stars with similar buoyancy\nfrequency profiles and stellar masses, we also expect the MHD parameters and\nthe initial stellar rotation rate to impact the geometry of the field and\ndifferential rotation at the convective-radiative interface.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Gdu1n20D8esqBz6FwCVLp7YLgEekZt7jdCwA0Wk7L0s","pdfSize":"4267921"}
