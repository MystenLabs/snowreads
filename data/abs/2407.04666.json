The boundary terms in the varied action give rise\nto modifications in the geometric background, which are investigated by\nanalyzing the metric tensor and the Ricci curvature within the framework of a\nrenormalized quantum theory of gravity.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EBEf6KZS5c-VJ8V5JIpGISzF2p6Oa4fddubzL-bJlcg","pdfSize":"185730"}
