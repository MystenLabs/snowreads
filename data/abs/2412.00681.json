This work presents a novel\ndataset and proposes a classifier based on the Vision-and-Language Transformer\n(ViLT) specifically tailored to identify anti-Muslim hate within memes by\nintegrating both visual and textual representations. Our model leverages joint\nmodal embeddings between meme images and incorporated text to capture nuanced\nIslamophobic narratives that are unique to meme culture, providing both high\ndetection accuracy and interoperability.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"nlcuD0br39lrUpSMJ190WxqR4gJf_3ienVfcQH84LxQ","pdfSize":"1166727"}
