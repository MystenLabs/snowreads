  "abstract": "  We study the problem of statically optimizing select-project-join (SPJ) plans\nwhere unary key constraints are allowed. A natural measure of a plan, which we\ncall the output degree and which has been studied previously, is the minimum\ndegree of a polynomial bounding the plan's output relation, as a function of\nthe input database's maximum relation size. This measure is, by definition,\ninvariant under passing from a plan to another plan that is semantically\nequivalent to the first. In this article, we consider a plan measure which we\ncall the intermediate degree; this measure is defined to be the minimum degree\nbounding the size of all intermediate relations computed during a plan's\nexecution -- again, as a function of the input database's maximum relation\nsize. We present an algorithm that, given an SPJ plan $q$ and a set $\\Sigma$ of\nunary keys, computes an SPJ plan $q'$ that is semantically equivalent to $q$\n(over databases satisfying $\\Sigma$) and that has the minimum intermediate\ndegree over all such semantically equivalent plans. For the types of plans\nconsidered, we thus obtain a complete and effective understanding of\nintermediate degree.\n",
