With current Noisy Intermediate\nScale Quantum (NISQ) devices, only variational quantum algorithms like the\nQuantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) can be practically run. QAOA is\neffective for solving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)\nproblems by approximating Quantum Annealing via Trotterization. Successful\nimplementation on NISQ devices requires shallow circuits, influenced by the\nnumber of variables and the sparsity of the augmented interaction matrix. This\npaper investigates the necessary sparsity levels for augmented interaction\nmatrices to ensure solvability with QAOA. By analyzing the Max-Cut problem with\nvarying sparsity, we provide insights into how the Hamiltonian density affects\nthe QAOA performance. Our findings highlight that, while denser matrices\ncomplicate the energy landscape, the performance of QAOA remains largely\nunaffected by sparsity variations. This study emphasizes the algorithm's\nrobustness and potential for optimization tasks on near-term quantum devices,\nsuggesting avenues for future research in enhancing QAOA for practical\napplications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"nSjL67tNuD4zUvZRzfycbn0oY3e3u9ncAhOBYdB9J34","pdfSize":"612375"}
