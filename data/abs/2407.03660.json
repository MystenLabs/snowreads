Grosswald, in 1972, found a simple\nextension of Ramanujan's formula which in turn gives transformation formula for\nEisenstein series over the full modular group. Recently, Banerjee, Gupta and\nKumar found a number field analogue of Ramanujan's formula. In this paper, we\npresent a new number field analogue of the Ramanujan-Grosswald formula for\n$\\zeta(2m+1)$ by obtaining a formula for Dedekind zeta function at odd\narguments. We also obtain a number field analogue of an identity of\nChandrasekharan and Narasimhan, which played a crucial role in proving our main\nidentity. As an application, we generalize transformation formula for\nEisenstein series $G_{2k}(z)$ and Dedekind eta function $\\eta(z)$. A new\nformula for the class number of a totally real number field is also obtained,\nwhich provides a connection with the Kronceker's limit formula for the Dedekind\nzeta function.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4CtJdgVHi1IdVAo0PD9v1xfcRbpM9JkVI9JPvl19k_s","pdfSize":"355130"}
