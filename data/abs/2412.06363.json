Observations of this\ntangential-normal coupling is made on a variety of chemically modified silica\nspheres, over 3 decades in velocity and at varied normal load, thereby\ndemonstrating its robustness. Quantitative measurements of the extra normal\nforce and of the friction-velocity relationship versus normal load are well\nrationalized within a theoretical model based on the thermal actuation of\nmolecular bonds. To do so, we account for the finite non-zero thickness of the\nsliding interface at which molecular adsorption and stretching events produce\nan out-of-plane force responsible for both friction and normal pull-in.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ngqBNszScYUtRke64faIiNTBqiCnCEsiQbxjEH9kBcg","pdfSize":"737328"}
