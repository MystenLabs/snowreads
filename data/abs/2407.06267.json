They are most pronounced in the\nsingle-$\\tau$, missing-transverse-energy, four-jet and\n$\\geqslant1\\ell+\\!\\geqslant1b$-jet channels ($\\approx3\\sigma$) and can be\nexplained by the Drell-Yan production of new Higgs bosons, i.e. $pp\\to W^*\\to\nH^\\pm H^0$. We first examine the excesses in a simplified model approach,\nconsidering that $H^\\pm$ decays to $\\tau\\nu$, $WZ$ or $tb$. Both the $\\tau\\nu$\nand $tb$ decay modes individually lead to a significance of\n$\\lessapprox4\\sigma$ while for $WZ$ one can obtain at most $3.5\\sigma$. This is\nbecause the decays of $WZ$ lead to multiple leptons contributing to the\ntwo-lepton channel which does not show an excess at 152 GeV. Next, we consider\ntwo-Higgs-doublet models where the charged Higgs does not decay to $WZ$ at\ntree-level, finding a significance of $\\gtrapprox4\\sigma$ for a branching ratio\nof the new neutral Higgs to photons of $\\approx$2%. Even though this branching\nfraction is quite sizable, it can be obtained in composite models or via the\nLagrangian term $\\lambda_6 H_1^\\dagger H_1 H_2^\\dagger H_1+{\\rm h.c.}$ breaking\nthe commonly imposed $Z_2$ symmetry.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GJXrMceQg9xTeZWWCzI1cA-Ea_CqkZGlfljjUFiGuQ4","pdfSize":"5330713"}
