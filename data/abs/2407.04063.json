Since the valuation is at most exponential in the size\nof the grammar, this gives rise to a single-exponential running time.\nPreviously only a doubly-exponential algorithm was known. As an application, we\nprovide a conversion from context-free session types to simple grammars whose\nvaluation is linear in the size of the type. In this way, we provide the first\npolynomial-time algorithm for deciding context-free session type equivalence.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RS-X4Xqx8m1kqKXaVsi95PV75GFmntdyVNe43YsoS28","pdfSize":"466445"}
