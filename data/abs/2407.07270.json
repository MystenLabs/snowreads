It\nrequires domain knowledge, integration of robust computational methods, and\neffective use of complex datasets. However, existing solutions tend to focus on\nspecific aspects, data, or methods, limiting their impact and applicability.\nHere, we present a general data-driven framework to support risk assessment and\npolicy making illustrating its usage in the context of fire hazard by\nintegrating three unique datasets of fire behavior, street network, and census\ndata for the whole state of California. We show that integrating spatial\ncomplexity by including a fire behavior layer and a socio-demographic layer\nchanges the universal function observed in previous optimization frameworks\nthat only work with the accessibility of facilities. These results open avenues\nfor the future development of flexible interdisciplinary frameworks in natural\nhazards management using complex large-scale data.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AzPR2y2i8c6bJiVroeKzMWl26QdYpJPhXVKWqIEIPME","pdfSize":"10880677"}
