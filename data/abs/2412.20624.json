As\nthe result we will obtain some new the relations which hold in general, and, as\nthe ultimate goal, equality of the topology of $\\omega$-open sets and topology\nobtained by the local function with ideal of countable sets.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dnYS7al0-1e55BN1DTgnkeXKCdIZQp4DPlrhIxeGw-U","pdfSize":"291236"}
