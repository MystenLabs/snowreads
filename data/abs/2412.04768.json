  "abstract": "  We present a framework to classify PL-types of large censuses of triangulated\n$4$-manifolds, which we use to classify the PL-types of all triangulated\n$4$-manifolds with up to $6$ pentachora. This is successful except for\ntriangulations homeomorphic to the $4$-sphere, $\\mathbb{C}P^2$, and the\nrational homology sphere $QS^4(2)$, where we find at most four, three, and two\nPL-types respectively. We conjecture that they are all standard. In addition,\nwe look at the cases resisting classification and discuss the combinatorial\nstructure of these triangulations -- which we deem interesting in their own\nrights.\n",
