Through the functoriality in Rabinowitz\nFloer theory, this leads to a chain-level weak proper Calabi-Yau structure on\nthe Rabinowitz Fukaya category of a nondegenerate Liouville manifold, which\nhomotopically perturbs the rigid but restrictive open-string pairing. This\nproper Calabi-Yau structure is also related to the closed-string Rabinowitz\nFloer cohomology, to which we construct a geometric map from Hochschild\nhomology of the wrapped Fukaya category with coefficients in the Rabinowitz\nFukaya category, comparing the dualities in the open and closed strings.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5smO-uKdz7b6bGSJV-1BXuiOrOOLBVfd1eEn2v-eYgU","pdfSize":"1038935"}
