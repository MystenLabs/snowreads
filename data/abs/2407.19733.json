The Rig Veda\ndescribes the occurrence of the eclipse, how the Sun suddenly disappeared in\nthe daytime under the spell of the Asura. The people and gods were scared but\nthe Great Sage Atri saved the Sun and restored his full glory. While discussing\nthe eclipse, Tilak refers to the eclipse as having occurred when the Vernal\nEquinox was in Orion and three days before the Autumnal Equinox. Based on these\ndata, we identify Atris eclipse as the one that occurred on 22 October 4202 BC\nor on 19 October 3811 BC.\n","subjects":["Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"KKsBOR7YOHH57xBCAZa43i2aSxGIeqngwweIQRmiqLk","pdfSize":"368096"}
