The Yukawa matrices are constrained to have many zero entries by a\n\"Higgs-Flavor\" symmetry, $G_{\\rm HF}$, that acts on Higgs and quark fields. The\nviolation of both CP and $G_{\\rm HF}$ occurs in the Higgs mass matrix so that,\nfor certain choices of $G_{\\rm HF}$ charges, the strong CP parameter\n$\\bar{\\theta}$ is zero at tree-level. Radiative corrections to $\\bar{\\theta}$\nare computed in this class of theories. They vanish in realistic two-Higgs\ndoublet models with $G_{\\rm HF} = \\mathbb{Z}_3$. We also construct realistic\nthree-Higgs models with $G_{\\rm HF} = \\rm U(1)$, where the one-loop results for\n$\\bar{\\theta}$ are model-dependent. Requiring $\\bar{\\theta}< 10^{-10}$ has\nimportant implications for the flavor problem by constraining the Yukawa\ncoupling and Higgs mass matrices. Contributions to $\\bar{\\theta}$ from\nhigher-dimension operators are computed at 1-loop and can also be sufficiently\nsmall, although the hierarchy problem of this class of theories is worse than\nin the Standard Model.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JTeeGfs0wUz7BFBhdkaTlwvltGoORU1AJYn7OuzXouE","pdfSize":"270049"}
