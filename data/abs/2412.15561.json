  "abstract": "  The deep diagonal map $T_k$ acts on planar polygons by connecting the $k$-th\ndiagonals and intersecting them successively. The map $T_2$ is the pentagram\nmap and $T_k$ is a generalization. We study the action of $T_k$ on two special\nsubsets of the so-called twisted polygons, which we name \\textit{$k$-spirals of\ntype $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$}. Both types of $k$-spirals are twisted $n$-gons that\nresemble the shape of inward spirals on the affine patch under suitable\nprojective normalization. We show that for $k \\geq 3$, $T_{k}$ preserves both\ntypes of $k$-spirals. In particular, we show that the two types of $3$-spirals\nhave precompact forward and backward $T_3$ orbits, and these special orbits in\nthe moduli space are partitioned into squares of a $3 \\times 3$ tic-tac-toe\ngrid. This establishes the action of $T_k$ on $k$-spirals as a nice geometric\ngeneralization of $T_2$ on convex polygons.\n",
