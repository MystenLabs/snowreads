  "abstract": "  We present new results on quantum tunneling between deep potential wells, in\nthe presence of a strong constant magnetic field. We construct a family of\ndouble well potentials containing examples for which the low-energy eigenvalue\nsplitting vanishes, and hence quantum tunneling is eliminated. Further, by\ndeforming within this family, the magnetic ground state can be made to\ntransition from symmetric to anti-symmetric. However, for typical double wells\nin a certain regime, tunneling is not suppressed, and we provide a lower bound\nfor the eigenvalue splitting.\n",
