At\nfixed pressure we find non-monotonic constitutive curves that are shear\nthinning, whereas at fixed volume we find non-monotonic constitutive curves\nthat are shear thickening. We show that the presence of one non-monotonicity\ndoes not imply the other. Instead, there exists a signature in the volume\nfraction measured under fixed pressure that, when present, ensures\nnon-monotonic constitutive curves at fixed volume. In the context of dry\ngranular flow we show that gradient and vorticity bands arise under fixed\npressure and volume respectively, as implied by the constitutive curves. For\nwet systems our results are consistent with a recent experimental observation\nof shear thinning at fixed pressure. We furthermore predict discontinuous shear\nthickening in the absence of critical load friction.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"t88tdmQmKo0Ihm_3f0OTfutghStqkMMP397gBGu33ec","pdfSize":"7400002"}
