  "abstract": "  This paper presents a multi-way parallel English-Tamil-Sinhala corpus\nannotated with Named Entities (NEs), where Sinhala and Tamil are low-resource\nlanguages. Using pre-trained multilingual Language Models (mLMs), we establish\nnew benchmark Named Entity Recognition (NER) results on this dataset for\nSinhala and Tamil. We also carry out a detailed investigation on the NER\ncapabilities of different types of mLMs. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of\nour NER system on a low-resource Neural Machine Translation (NMT) task. Our\ndataset is publicly released: https://github.com/suralk/multiNER.\n",
