We show that algebraic\nrelations of $v$-adic arithmetic gamma values over $\\mathbb{F}_q(\\theta)$ are\nexplained by the standard functional equations together with Thakur's analogue\nof the Gross-Koblitz formula. A key step is working out a formula expressing\n$v$-adic crystalline-de Rham periods of Carlitz motives with Complex\nMultiplication as products of these special gamma values (a $v$-adic\nChowla-Selberg formula). The algebraic independence of those periods in\nquestion results from determining the dimension of the motivic Galois groups,\nadapting and further developing existing tools.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zbeHwSjZCXb9yLGxOtOLy8JZdxn2p87lra6Dy4oQmL0","pdfSize":"548461"}
