The main tool to obtain this\nresult is a new bijective, deterministic mapping between the joint law of an\nergodic FEP and its current through the origin, and the joint law of a SSEP and\nits current through the origin. This mapping is interesting in itself, as it\nremains valid in the non-ergodic regime where it gives a coupling between the\nposition of a tagged particle in the FEP and the current through the origin in\na SSEP with traps.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"X3Cs1zZJuBxzkLc32AxhRkopKJ3cotzLpCuQqYU5_gY","pdfSize":"713270"}
