The notes cover fundamental concepts such as isotopies, Reidemeister\nmoves, torus knots, and (orientable, connected) surfaces with one boundary\ncomponent. They also present knot invariants defined through Seifert surfaces\nand their associated matrices, including the 3-genus, the Alexander polynomial,\nand the signature. Finally, starting from the notion of concordance and the\nconnected sum operation, a group structure on the set of knots is introduced.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/History and Overview","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rku5I580vRLpnW7ocYLtuJ7f3SZyK7uEW9LjPEH8zfY","pdfSize":"4905740"}
