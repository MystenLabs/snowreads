A well-known Hilali conjecture claims that for a rationally elliptic\nspace its homotopy rank \\emph{does not exceed} its (co)homology rank. In this\npaper, after recalling some well-known fundamental properties of a rationally\nelliptic space and giving some important examples of rationally elliptic spaces\nand rationally elliptic singular complex algebraic varieties for which the\nHilali conjecture holds, we give some revised formulas and some conjectures. We\nalso discuss some topics such as mixd Hodge polynomials defined via mixed Hodge\nstructures on cohomology group and the dual of the homotopy group, related to\nthe ``Hilali conjecture \\emph{modulo product}\", which is an inequality between\nthe usual homological Poincar\\'e polynomial and the homotopical Poincar\\'e\npolynomial.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"U3nCOUWNoo6H3s8YQKSj522rQ7jBCgWSIaWI4zNm4p0","pdfSize":"283961"}
