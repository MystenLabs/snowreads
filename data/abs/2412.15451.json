  "abstract": "  The EU GDPR is a landmark regulation that introduced several rights for\nindividuals to obtain information and control how their personal data is being\nprocessed, as well as receive a copy of it. However, there are gaps in the\neffective use of rights due to each organisation developing custom methods for\nrights declaration and management. Simultaneously, there is a technological gap\nas there is no single consistent standards-based mechanism that can automate\nthe handling of rights for both organisations and individuals. In this article,\nwe present a specification for exercising and managing rights in a\nmachine-interpretable format based on semantic web standards. Our approach uses\nthe comprehensive Data Privacy Vocabulary to create a streamlined workflow for\nindividuals to understand what rights exist, how and where to exercise them,\nand for organisations to effectively manage them. This work pushes the state of\nthe art in GDPR rights management and is crucial for data reuse and rights\nmanagement under technologically intensive developments, such as Data Spaces.\n",
