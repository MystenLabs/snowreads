This family of theories is the only one that preserves all the\nsymmetries of Maxwell's theory, having applications in the study of regular\nblack hole solutions and supersymmetry. The purpose of this article is\nthree-fold. Firstly, we study the initial-value problem of ModMax and show, by\nmeans of a simple geometric criterion, that such a theory admits a well-posed\nformulation. Secondly, we prove a series of geometric inequalities relating\nenergy, charge, angular momentum, and size in ModMax. The validity of these\nbounds gives strong evidence of a universal inequality conjectured by\nBekenstein for macroscopic systems. Finally, we perform the first stable\nnumerical simulations of ModMax in the highly nonlinear regime, and verify an\ninequality between energy, size and angular momentum in bounded domains.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LY1geQyKuYX83fPWNfCuJh2p2kBbFOeaQxCXbrHgXcY","pdfSize":"1676249"}
