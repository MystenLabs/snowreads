The pressure disturbance has the\nform of a narrow-banded weakly nonlinear deep-water wave packet. During the\nforcing, the vorticity equation implies that the momentum is entirely in the\nnear-surface Lagrangian mean flow. After the forcing is turned off, the wave\npacket propagates away from the forcing region carrying with it the energy\nimparted from the pressure forcing. These waves together with their induced\nlong wave response have no momentum, in agreement with the classical results of\nLonguet-Higgins and Stewart (1962) and McIntyre (1981). The momentum imparted\nto the fluid from the form stress of the pressure forcing is entirely in a\ndipolar structure that remains in the area of the forcing event. This is in\ncontrast with the finite-depth scenario discussed in McIntyre (1981) where the\nmomentum imparted to the fluid by the forcing event propagates away as shallow\nwater waves. Finally, we examine waves propagating from deep to shallow water\nand argue that wave packets, which initially have no momentum, may have\nnon-zero momentum in finite-depth water through the trapping of a long wave at\nthe step change in depth, which ensures the total momentum of the system\nremains conserved.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cU0fA8S-YG8jn_Q6rVSzJ1F3FbYJR4wwxXWzmYogzlo","pdfSize":"1991221"}
