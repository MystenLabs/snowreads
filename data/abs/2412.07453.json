  "abstract": "  The present work proposes an alternative approach to the problem of the\nemergence of classicality. Typical approaches developed in the literature\nderive the classical behaviour of a quantum system from conditions that concern\nthe value of the parameters deemed responsible of non-classicality, like Planck\nconstant.\n  Our first step in addressing the problem is instead to identify the physical\norigin of non-classicality of quantum physics. Nowadays the deepest origin is\nidentified in the impossibility of a simultaneous consistent value assignment\nto every set of quantum observables. To attack this impossibility a concept of\n``evaluation'' is then introduced, which allows for a consistent value\nassignment to non-comeasurable observables whenever an established set of\nconditions is satisfied. It is shown that in the case of the motion of the\ncenter of mass of a large rigid body evaluations exist that realize a\nconsistent value assignment to both the position and the velocity of the center\nof mass of the body. In so doing emergence of classicality is explained by\novercoming the obstacles to the simultaneous value assignments that allow for a\nclassical description of the phenomenon. This result prompts to search for\nextensions and generalization of the approach.\n",
