The chapter provides an overview, and some original\nresults, on codes in distance regular graphs which admit symmetries via a\npermutation group acting on the vertices of the graph. The strongest notion of\ncompletely transitive codes is developed, as well as the more general notion of\nneighbour-transitive codes. The graphs considered are the Hamming, Johnson, and\nKneser graphs and their q-analogues, as well as some graphs related to\nincidence structures.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4lSGaNTbNPx0X8mj-WaRBXCe_Lbd239b7EvnRxVtPyM","pdfSize":"456981"}
