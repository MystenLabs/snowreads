In 2022, Davis, Orson, and Park\nproved that the homotopy trivializing number of \\(L\\) is bounded above by the\nsum of the absolute values of the pairwise linking numbers and some quantity\n\\(C_n\\) which depends only on \\(n\\), the number of components. In this paper we\nimprove on this result by using the classification of link homotopy due to\nHabegger-Lin to give a quadratic upper bound on \\(C_n\\). We employ ideas from\nextremal graph theory to demonstrate that this bound is close to sharp, by\nexhibiting links with vanishing pairwise linking numbers and whose homotopy\ntrivializing numbers grows quadratically. In the process, we determine the\nhomotopy trivializing number of every 4-component link. We also prove a cubic\nupper bound on the difference between the Delta homotopy trivializing number of\n\\(L\\) and the sum of the absolute values of the triple linking numbers of\n\\(L\\).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NAla9LD5rwHsOP1Ao2zJyB1QnaYhVJSTDu_Dupq3GXE","pdfSize":"619332"}
