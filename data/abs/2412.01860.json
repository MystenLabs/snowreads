  "abstract": "  This study takes a preliminary step toward teaching computers to recognize\nhuman emotions through Facial Emotion Recognition (FER). Transfer learning is\napplied using ResNeXt, EfficientNet models, and an ArcFace model originally\ntrained on the facial verification task, leveraging the AffectNet database, a\ncollection of human face images annotated with corresponding emotions. The\nfindings highlight the value of congruent domain transfer learning, the\nchallenges posed by imbalanced datasets in learning facial emotion patterns,\nand the effectiveness of pairwise learning in addressing class imbalances to\nenhance model performance on the FER task.\n",
