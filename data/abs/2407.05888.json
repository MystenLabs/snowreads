However, other methods for inducing somewhat localized states in\nelementary lattice models have been historically much less studied. Here we\nshow how edge states can emerge within a simple two-leg ladder of coupled\nharmonic oscillators, where it is important to include interactions beyond\nthose at the nearest neighbour range. Remarkably, depending upon the interplay\nbetween the coupling strength along the rungs of the ladder and the\nnext-nearest neighbour coupling strength along one side of the ladder, edge\nstates can indeed appear at particular energies. In a wonderful manifestation\nof a type of bulk-edge correspondence, these edge state energies correspond to\nthe quantum number for which additional stationary points appear in the\ncontinuum bandstructure of the equivalent problem studied with periodic\nboundary conditions. Our theoretical results are relevant to a swathe of\nclassical or quantum lattice model simulators, such that the proposed edge\nstates may be useful for applications including waveguiding in metamaterials\nand quantum transport.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XUo4fUJJB9JqJoHA1CxTaSaFPGpwv0XeGkLRNDk5Gwk","pdfSize":"13419739"}
