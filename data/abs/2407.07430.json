Drawing inspiration\nfrom Support Vector Machine's margin concept, a non-parametric clustering\napproach is proposed, building an affinity margin between each pair of\nVorono\\\"i regions. This approach is characterized by minimal hyperparameters\nand delineation of intricate, non-convex cluster structures.\n  The numerical experiments underscore Spectral Bridges as a fast, robust, and\nversatile tool for sophisticated clustering tasks spanning diverse domains. Its\nefficacy extends to large-scale scenarios encompassing both real-world and\nsynthetic datasets.\n  The Spectral Bridge algorithm is implemented both in Python\n(<https://pypi.org/project/spectral-bridges>) and R\n<https://github.com/cambroise/spectral-bridges-Rpackage>).\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"95w6UIU5FXtydxXExa_8hos9MwoDGzZ22JEpXMUHIJY","pdfSize":"3068151"}
