{"id":"2407.16701","title":"Integrated Deflector Shield Technology for Spacecraft","authors":"Florian Neukart","authorsParsed":[["Neukart","Florian",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2024 23:54:41 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-25","timestamp":1720137281000,"abstract":"  The increasing velocity and frequency of space missions necessitate\nadvancements in spacecraft protection technologies to ensure mission success\nand the safety of onboard systems and personnel. Existing shielding solutions,\nincluding electromagnetic shields, plasma shields, and speculative force\nfields, each offer distinct protective capabilities but are limited when used\nindependently. This study proposes an integrated deflector shield system that\ncombines the strengths of these technologies to provide comprehensive\nprotection against a wide range of spaceborne threats, including charged\nparticles, micrometeoroids, and high-energy radiation. By leveraging fusion\nenergy as a primary power source, we aim to sustain a high-energy shield\ncapable of dynamically adjusting to varying threat levels. Extensive\ntheoretical modeling, simulations, and analytical calculations demonstrate the\nfeasibility of this integrated approach, highlighting significant improvements\nin energy efficiency and scalability. The implementation of this multi-layered\nshield system marks a pivotal advancement in spacecraft protection, paving the\nway for safer and more reliable space exploration missions.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"L4nSHamxnxkMCf696heXPQEnGrvLlhjaJa1woP2t_DQ","pdfSize":"265821"}
