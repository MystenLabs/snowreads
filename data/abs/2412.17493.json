  "abstract": "  A general strategy is proposed to explore the low-energy properties of\ntwo-dimensional nonlinear $\\sigma$ models with $\\theta$ terms. We demonstrate\nits application to nonlinear $\\sigma$ models with the target space\n$\\text{SU($N$)}$/H, which include $\\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$, complex Grassmannian\nmanifolds as well as the flag $\\text{SU($N$)}/\\text{U(1)}^{N-1}$ and\n$\\text{SU($N$)})/\\text{SO($N$)}$ manifolds. By analyzing the symmetry and its\nanomaly content, we realize these nonlinear $\\sigma$ models through\nperturbations added to the SU(N)$_1$ conformal field theory. For the\nflag-manifold $\\text{SU($N$)}/\\text{U(1)}^{N-1}$ and\n$\\text{SU($N$)})/\\text{SO($N$)}$ models, those perturbations are shown to\ncorrespond to the marginal current-current operator with the specific sign\nwhich leads to a massless renormalization group flow to the SU(N)$_1$ fixed\npoint. In contrast, a massive regime with a two-fold ground-state degeneracy is\nfound for the $\\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$ ($N >2$) and Grassmannian nonlinear $\\sigma$\nmodels at $\\theta=\\pi$.\n",
