We revisit the cosmological\ninformation content of voids and connect void properties with the parameters of\nthe background universe. We combine analytical results with a suite of large\nn-body realizations of large-scale structure in the quasilinear regime to\nmeasure the central density and radial outflow of voids. These properties,\nestimated from multiple voids that span a range of redshifts, provide estimates\nof the Hubble parameter, $\\Omega_m$ and $\\Omega_\\Lambda$. The analysis assumes\naccess to the full phase-space distribution of mass within voids, a dataset\nthat is not currently observable. The observable properties of the largest void\nin the universe may also test models. The suite of large n-body realizations\nenables construction of lightcones reaching $\\sim$3,000 $h^{-1}$Mpc. Based on\nthese lightcones, we show that large voids similar to those observed are\nexpected in the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"r_NEVlphhr7bbMhMzyJWrkw0Nfb4Ba4znYtRAtAIHec","pdfSize":"2011739"}
