The\noptical monitoring project consists of 55 dwarf galaxies and four globular\nclusters that are members of the Local Group. We have made observations of\nthese galaxies using the WFC mounted on the 2.5 m INT in nine different\nperiods, both in the i-band filter Sloan and in the filter V-band Harris. We\naim to select AGB stars with brightness variations larger than 0.2 mag to\ninvestigate the evolutionary processes in these dwarf galaxies. The resulting\ncatalog of LPV stars in Andromeda's satellite galaxies offers updated\ninformation on features like half-light radii, TRGB magnitudes, and distance\nmoduli. This manuscript will review the results obtained for And II galaxy.\nUsing the Sobel filter, we have calculated the distance modulus for this\nsatellite galaxy, which ranges from 23.90 to 24.11 mag.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"igDji5AzzUoY9zsq3oGrIe6Y_gV9_Vv19miXKzk7QyM","pdfSize":"2691580"}
