In particular,\nwe show that the symmetry-based method for partial differential equations is\nthe natural extension of Lie's reduction of order algorithm for ordinary\ndifferential equations by looking at this algorithm from a different point of\nview. Many examples exhibit various situations that can arise.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"BFARTP79cMM_4gZ3rNhSJ-O6anTiRx8qi38Stq2mMAE","pdfSize":"242758","objectId":"0xda1035c61a801ea07cd4dda3f1462da1c3a4aa215078aad99ab91d30c0639e00","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
