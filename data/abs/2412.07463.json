  "abstract": "  In our previous paper [Fei Hou, Fei Tao, Huicheng Yin, Global existence and\nscattering of small data smooth solutions to a class of quasilinear wave\nsystems on $\\mathbb{R}^2\\times\\mathbb{T}$, Preprint (2024), arXiv:2405.03242],\nfor the $Q_0$-type quadratic nonlinearities, we have shown the global\nwell-posedness and scattering properties of small data smooth solutions to the\nquasilinear wave systems on $\\mathbb{R}^2\\times\\mathbb{T}$. In this paper, we\nstart to solve the global existence problem for the remaining\n$Q_{\\alpha\\beta}$-type nonlinearities. By combining these results, we have\nestablished the global well-posedness of small solutions on\n$\\mathbb{R}^2\\times\\mathbb{T}$ for the general 3-D quadratically quasilinear\nwave systems when the related 2-D null conditions are fulfilled.\n",
