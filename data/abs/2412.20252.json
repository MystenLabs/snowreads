Using the Coulomb gauge, the stochastic differential equations for\nthe reduced dynamics on the orbit space are obtained. It is shown that the\ngeometry of the reduced space is completely determined by the behaviour of the\nmaterial fields. Since the main role in the singular behavior of the reduction\nJacobian is played by the mean curvature of the orbit, the final solution of\nthe path inyegral reduction problem in the field system under consideration is\npossible only by carrying out an adequate regularization of the term that\ndetermines the volume of the orbit, and on which the additional correction to\nthe interaction potential completely depends.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZPMVlORWvTEylQtqlIClqQEvqNM1LQc7rFprMbY17hk","pdfSize":"220014"}
