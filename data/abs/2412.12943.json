  "abstract": "  We employ polarization tomography to characterize the modal properties of a\ndielectric nanocavity with sub-wavelength mode confinement. Our analysis of\nreflection spectra shows that the Fano-lineshape depends strongly on the\npolarization in a confocal configuration, and that the lineshape can be\ntransformed into a Lorentzian-like peak for a certain polarization. For this\npolarization setting, the background is almost fully suppressed in a finite\nrange of frequencies. This enables us to identify another resonance that has\nnot yet been experimentally reported for these nanocavities. Lastly, we use\nsymmetry-forbidden polarizations and show that, surprisingly, the modal\nresonance features of the system remain visible.\n",
