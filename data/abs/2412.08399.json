Further, we give a conjecture that the\nP-positions approximate a half-line whose slope is described by algebraic\nnumbers of degree 5.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"8LvcIp-WSnCcWQSy_oyG40nLfwH5Cvl3fTCYyhEGgZU","pdfSize":"231798"}
