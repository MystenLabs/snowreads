  "abstract": "  Class imbalance poses a significant challenge in machine learning (ML), often\nleading to biased models favouring the majority class. In this paper, we\npropose GAT-RWOS, a novel graph-based oversampling method that combines the\nstrengths of Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and random walk-based\noversampling. GAT-RWOS leverages the attention mechanism of GATs to guide the\nrandom walk process, focusing on the most informative neighbourhoods for each\nminority node. By performing attention-guided random walks and interpolating\nfeatures along the traversed paths, GAT-RWOS generates synthetic minority\nsamples that expand class boundaries while preserving the original data\ndistribution. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of imbalanced datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of GAT-RWOS in improving classification\nperformance, outperforming state-of-the-art oversampling techniques. The\nproposed method has the potential to significantly improve the performance of\nML models on imbalanced datasets and contribute to the development of more\nreliable classification systems.\n",
