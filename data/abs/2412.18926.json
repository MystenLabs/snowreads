The proposed method eliminates the limitations\nof exemplar selection in replay-based approaches for mitigating catastrophic\nforgetting in federated continual learning (FCL). The limitations particularly\nrelated to the heterogeneity of information density of each summarized data.\nOur approach maintains the consistency of training gradients and the\nrelationship to past tasks for the summarized exemplars to represent the\nstreaming data compared to the original images effectively. Additionally, our\napproach reduces the information-level heterogeneity of the summarized data by\ninter-client sharing of the disentanglement generative model. Extensive\nexperiments show that our ECoral outperforms several state-of-the-art methods\nand can be seamlessly integrated with many existing approaches to enhance\nperformance.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YY1rXXpm1lVE5U2xXlU5Gejfr1nSkyfbMh0AsW4yOHo","pdfSize":"1592150"}
