  "abstract": "  This article investigates the influence of luck and strategic considerations\non performance of teams participating in the M6 investment challenge. We find\nthat there is insufficient evidence to suggest that the extreme Sharpe ratios\nobserved are beyond what one would expect by chance, given the number of teams,\nand thus not necessarily indicative of the possibility of consistently\nattaining abnormal returns. Furthermore, we introduce a stylized model of the\ncompetition to derive and analyze a portfolio strategy optimized for attaining\nthe top rank. The results demonstrate that the task of achieving the top rank\nis not necessarily identical to that of attaining the best investment returns\nin expectation. It is possible to improve one's chances of winning, even\nwithout the ability to attain abnormal returns, by choosing portfolio weights\nadversarially based on the current competition ranking. Empirical analysis of\nsubmitted portfolio weights aligns with this finding.\n",
