Specifically, we perform a Bayesian search in\nthe International PTA Data Release 2 (IPTA DR2) for a combined GW background\narising from scalar perturbations and unresolved PBH mergers, assuming a broad\nPBH mass distribution. In our analysis, we incorporate constraints on the\ncurvature power spectrum from CMB $\\mu$-distortions and the overproduction of\nPBHs, which significantly suppress the contribution of PBH mergers to the total\nGW background. We find that scalar-induced GWs dominate the nHz frequency\nrange, while PBH mergers alone cannot account for the observed signal under the\nstandard PBH formation scenario involving Gaussian perturbations, and including\nonly Poissonian PBH clustering. However, specific PBH models, such as those\nwith enhanced clustering, could yield a GW background dominated by PBH mergers.\nOverall, we find that the IPTA DR2 strongly favors an astrophysical origin for\nthe reported common-spectrum process over the PBH models considered in this\nanalysis.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"M2Vsddtbk9X_k_iVKvqVDMyS_YZMUAAsN9IqguU40dg","pdfSize":"1828225"}
