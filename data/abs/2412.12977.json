  "abstract": "  We generalize the chirally motivated $\\pi\\Sigma - \\bar{K}N$ coupled channels\nmodel to the cubic finite volume and use it to calculate the stationary energy\nspectrum that appears in a nice agreement with the spectrum obtained in the\nlattice QCD simulations by the BaSc collaboration. Several other comparisons\nwith the BaSc results are made, in particular relating their pole positions of\nthe meson-baryon scattering matrix to the two-pole picture of $\\Lambda(1405)$\ngenerated by our chiral model in the infinite volume.\n",
