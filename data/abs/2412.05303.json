By implementing a distant-neighbor quantum-mechanical (DNQM) method, we\ndemonstrate a pronounced enhancement of the nonlinear optical response of GNR\nheterojunctions as the number of topological states at their interfaces\nincreases. Specifically, we find that GNR heterojunctions with multiple\ntopological interface states exhibit a notably stronger third-order nonlinear\noptical response in comparison with the similarly sized counterparts with a\nsingle topological interface state or without such states. Furthermore, we\nobserve that the presence of topological interface states in GNR\nheterojunctions can induce a significant red-shift in their quantum plasmon\nfrequency. Our results reveal the potential to enhance the nonlinear optical\nresponse at the nanoscale by increasing the number of topological interface\nstates in graphene nanostructures or other topological systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Sz5W7szrxgqlBPB24TETm9Rl29aXew-eMfO5EgtZeVI","pdfSize":"1932071"}
