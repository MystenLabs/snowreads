  "abstract": "  A future multi-TeV muon collider would provide an important probe for\nMajorana neutrinos. A muon collider with a collision energy of $\\sim$30 TeV\nwould be sensitive to $\\nu_e-\\nu_\\mu$ transition dipole moments of the order of\n$\\sim 10^{-12}\\mu_B$ and would be thus competitive with the latest\nastrophysical observation and laboratory experiments. Contrary to the latter,\nthe muon collider would have the unique advantage of a direct and clean\nidentification of lepton number and flavour violation. This would establish the\nMajorana nature of the neutrino and would provide crucial complementary\ninformation on the neutrino properties in the event of a (near) future\nobservation at low-energy experiments. Additionally, a muon collider would\nimprove by orders of magnitude the direct bounds on the Majorana neutrino mass\nmatrix entries $m_{e\\mu}$ and $m_{\\mu\\mu}$.\n",
