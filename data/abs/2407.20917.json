This variety has become\nso large that choosing an algorithm for a task at hand can be challenging. In\nthis work, we streamline the process of choosing reinforcement-learning\nalgorithms and action-distribution families. We provide a structured overview\nof existing methods and their properties, as well as guidelines for when to\nchoose which methods.
