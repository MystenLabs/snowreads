  "abstract": "  In the symmetric group $S_n$, each element $\\sigma$ has an associated cycle\ntype $\\alpha$, a partition of $n$ that identifies the conjugacy class of\n$\\sigma$. The Robinson-Schensted (RS) correspondence links each $\\sigma$ to\nanother partition $\\lambda$ of $n$, representing the shape of the pair of Young\ntableaux produced by applying the RS row-insertion algorithm to $\\sigma$.\nSurprisingly, the relationship between these two partitions, namely the cycle\ntype $\\alpha$ and the RS shape $\\lambda$, has only recently become a subject of\nstudy. In this work, we explicitly describe the set of RS shapes $\\lambda$ that\ncan arise from elements of each cycle type $\\alpha$ in cases where $\\alpha$\nconsists of two cycles. To do this, we introduce the notion of an\n$\\alpha$-coloring, where one colors the entries in a certain tableau of shape\n$\\lambda$, in such a way as to construct a permutation $\\sigma$ with cycle type\n$\\alpha$ and RS shape $\\lambda$.\n",
