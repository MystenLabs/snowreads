This\nstudy introduces the Persian translation of the WQ, adapted for\nPersian-speaking populations using a rigorous forward-backward translation,\ncognitive debriefing, and cultural adaptation process to ensure alignment with\nthe original tool's reliability and validity. The Persian WQ provides a\ncomplete assessment of spatial navigation skills and identifies potential\nnavigation challenges. Furthermore, the Persian WQ serves as a valuable\nresource for future research exploring spatial navigation and memory in diverse\npopulations.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction","Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"9IirMK-ml_Dz1KouRyo2ODZwWhIYXrrgdb7lyxFoxDw","pdfSize":"1050181"}
