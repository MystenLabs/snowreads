  "abstract": "  The downstream use cases, benefits, and risks of AI systems depend\nsignificantly on the access afforded to the system, and to whom. However, the\ndownstream implications of different access styles are not well understood,\nmaking it difficult for decision-makers to govern model access responsibly.\nConsequently, we spotlight Model Access Governance, an emerging field focused\non helping organisations and governments make responsible, evidence-based\naccess decisions. We outline the motivation for developing this field by\nhighlighting the risks of misgoverning model access, the limitations of\nexisting research on the topic, and the opportunity for impact. We then make\nfour sets of recommendations, aimed at helping AI evaluation organisations,\nfrontier AI companies, governments and international bodies build consensus\naround empirically-driven access governance.\n",
