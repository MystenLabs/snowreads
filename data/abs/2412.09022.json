  "abstract": "  This paper explores the application of physics-informed neural networks\n(PINNs) to tackle forward problems in 3D contact mechanics, focusing on small\ndeformation elasticity. We utilize a mixed-variable formulation, enhanced with\noutput transformations, to enforce Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions as\nhard constraints. The inherent inequality constraints in contact mechanics,\nparticularly the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, are addressed as soft\nconstraints by integrating them into the network's loss function. To enforce\nthe KKT conditions, we leverage the nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP)\napproach, specifically using the Fischer-Burmeister function, which is known\nfor its advantageous properties in optimization. We investigate two benchmark\nexamples of PINNs in 3D contact mechanics: a single contact patch test and the\nHertzian contact problem.\n",
