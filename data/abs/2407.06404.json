While existing models like the\nInformation Visualization Reference Model describe the data-to-visual mapping\nprocess, they often overlook a crucial intermediary step: design-specific\ntransformations. This process, occurring after data transformation but before\nvisual-data mapping, further derives data, such as groupings, layout, and\nstatistics, that are essential to properly render the visualization. In this\npaper, we advocate for a deeper exploration of design-specific transformations,\nhighlighting their importance in understanding visualization properties,\nparticularly in relation to user tasks. We incorporate design-specific\ntransformations into the Information Visualization Reference Model and propose\na new formalism that encompasses the user task as a function over data. The\nresulting formalism offers three key benefits over existing visualization\nmodels: (1) describing task as compositions of functions, (2) enabling analysis\nof data transformations for visual-data mapping, and (3) empowering reasoning\nabout visualization correctness and effectiveness. We further discuss the\npotential implications of this model on visualization theory and visualization\nexperiment design.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"p8t9_vBfuzbGosYAJQaLkyZE6uA88qK0HbZUVxeSazs","pdfSize":"2216604"}
