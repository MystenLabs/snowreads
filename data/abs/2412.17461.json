In the homogeneous case, i.e., in in\nthe case of equal or similar capacities and reaction strengths, it is well\nknown that the number of stationary solutions ranges from three (strong\ndiffusion) to nine (weak diffusion). We provide sufficient conditions which\nincludes the diffusion strength and reaction parameters that ensure that the\nextinction point is the unique and globally asymptotically stable equilibrium\nin the case of heterogeneous capacities. For the sake of robustness we consider\nseveral bistable reaction functions, compare our analytical result with\nnumerical simulations, and conclude the paper with a short discussion on global\nextinction literature (which has provided mostly numerical results so far), as\nwell as other related phenomena, e.g., fragmentation, the perfect mixing\nparadox, and the natural form the reaction diffusion patch models.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oVH9nk7ljxe4LSjSkyrdyGE7yY0gbolZZDnR2MY8lVE","pdfSize":"2969530"}
