  "abstract": "  This study examines contemporaneous and lagged spillover effects in BRICS\nstaple grain futures markets and their linkages with U.S. markets. The results\nshow that contemporaneous spillovers dominate, while net spillovers are driven\nby lagged connectedness. Systemic risk is lower in intra-BRICS markets compared\nto those including the U.S., highlighting the U.S. grain market's significant\ninfluence. Brazilian and U.S. grains are key net spillover contributors,\nexcluding U.S. rice, while South African staple grains act as major net\nreceivers. Particularly, the spillover between soybeans is the strongest. The\nstudy also reveals heterogeneous impacts of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and\nBlack Sea Grain Initiative on grain futures.\n",
