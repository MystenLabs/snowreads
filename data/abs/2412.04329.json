  "abstract": "  In their seminal 1992 paper, Ba\\~{n}ados, Teitelboim and Zanelli (BTZ)\nproposed a simple charged generalization of what is now known as the spinning\nBTZ black hole, the proposal being that a rotating metric can be supported by a\n`static vector' potential. While with such an ansatz the Einstein equations are\nsatisfied, and the corresponding energy-momentum tensor is divergence-less, the\nMaxwell equations do not (due to the special degenerate form of the\ncorresponding field strength) hold. More recently, Deshpande and Lunin have\nproposed a generalized `Einstein--Maxwell' system which yields analytic\nrotating black holes in all odd dimensions. In this paper, we show that the\noriginal charged BTZ solution can be re-interpreted as a solution of the\nDeshpande--Lunin theory. Moreover, as we shall explicitly illustrate on an\nexample of regularized conformal electrodynamics, similar construction also\nworks for any non-linear electrodynamics in 3-dimensions.\n",
