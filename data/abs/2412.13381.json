This system leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate\nautomated marking and rationale explanations, addressing the challenge of\nlimited explainability in automated educational assessment and the high costs\nassociated with annotation. Our system allows users to input questions and\nstudent answers, providing educators and researchers with insights into\nassessment accuracy and the quality of LLM-assessed rationales. Additionally,\nit offers advanced visualization and robust evaluation tools, enhancing the\nusability for educational assessment and facilitating efficient rationale\nverification.
