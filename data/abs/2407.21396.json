We study the regime of long internal waves\ninteracting with modulated surface wave packets and describe their resonant\ninteraction by a system of equations where the internal wave solves a\nhigh-order Benjamin-Ono (BO) equation coupled to a linear Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation for the envelope of the free surface. The perturbation methods are\nbased on the Hamiltonian formulation for the original system of irrotational\nEuler's equations as described in Benjamin-Bridges [J. Fluid Mech. 333, 1997]\nand Craig-Guyenne-Kalisch [Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 58, 2005]. We also establish\na local wellposedness result for a reduced BO-Schr\\\"{o}dinger system using an\napproach developed by Linares-Ponce-Pilod [J. Diff. Eqs. 250, 2011].\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VK0vNmEcCfZpBg6zyv-JKus41v5s8ne6oQjJt-igNUo","pdfSize":"431988"}
