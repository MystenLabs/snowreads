  "abstract": "  In this paper, we prove a $\\partial\\bar{\\partial}$-type lemma on compact\nK\\\"ahler manifolds for logarithmic differential forms valued in the dual of a\ncertain pseudo-effective line bundle, thereby confirming a conjecture proposed\nby X. Wan.\n  We then derive several applications, including strengthened results by H.\nEsnault-E. Viehweg on the degeneracy of the spectral sequence at the\n$E_1$-stage for projective manifolds associated with the logarithmic de Rham\ncomplex, as well as by L. Katzarkov-M. Kontsevich-T. Pantev on the unobstructed\nlocally trivial deformations of a projective generalized log Calabi-Yau pair\nwith some weights, both of which are extended to the broader context of compact\nK\\\"ahler manifolds.\n  Furthermore, we establish the K\\\"ahler version of an injectivity theorem\noriginally formulated by F. Ambro in the algebraic setting. Notably, while O.\nFujino previously addressed the K\\\"ahler case, our proof takes a different\napproach by avoiding the reliance on mixed Hodge structures for cohomology with\ncompact support.\n",
