This success can be attributed to its smoothness and\nhigh representation capacity. The first allows the use of the network's\nderivatives during training, enabling regularization. However, defining the\narchitecture and initializing its parameters to achieve a desired capacity\nremains an empirical task. This work provides theoretical and experimental\nresults justifying the capacity property of sinusoidal MLPs and offers control\nmechanisms for their initialization and training.\n  We approach this from a Fourier series perspective and link the training with\nthe model's spectrum. Our analysis is based on a $harmonic$ expansion of the\nsinusoidal MLP, which says that the composition of sinusoidal layers produces a\nlarge number of new frequencies expressed as integer linear combinations of the\ninput frequencies (weights of the input layer). We use this novel $identity$ to\ninitialize the input neurons which work as a sampling in the signal spectrum.\nWe also note that each hidden neuron produces the same frequencies with\namplitudes completely determined by the hidden weights. Finally, we give an\nupper bound for these amplitudes, which results in a $bounding$ scheme for the\nnetwork's spectrum during training.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"V6jtZhQzEhwQMfSNEd0xOnqqdKLSsKAhshUGBhGk-2E","pdfSize":"18094158","objectId":"0x175e5ca7594249704e9b69b4abc54f179be37f11f39d7e7fa163ea509fafda0f","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
