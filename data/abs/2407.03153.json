Previous work focuses on\nidentifying individual training samples important for the generation of a given\nimage. However, instead of focusing on a given generated image, some use cases\nrequire understanding global properties of the distribution learned by a\ndiffusion model (e.g., demographic diversity). Furthermore, training data for\ndiffusion models are often contributed in groups rather than separately (e.g.,\nmultiple artworks from the same artist). Hence, here we tackle the problem of\nattributing global properties of diffusion models to groups of training data.\nSpecifically, we develop a method to efficiently estimate Shapley values by\nleveraging model pruning and fine-tuning. We empirically demonstrate the\nutility of our method with three use cases: (i) global image quality for a DDPM\ntrained on a CIFAR dataset, (ii) demographic diversity for an LDM trained on\nCelebA-HQ, and (iii) overall aesthetic quality for a Stable Diffusion model\nLoRA-finetuned on Post-Impressionist artworks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bODmciKuF5JDPAPoR8Lbdejmcw9g-r2LD1KBdfkK18A","pdfSize":"29870907"}
