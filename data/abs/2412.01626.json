In the time when information is\nreadily accessible, it is crucial to stimulate and preserve human cognitive\nabilities and maintain strong reasoning skills. This paper addresses such\nchallenges by promoting the use of hints as an alternative or a supplement to\ndirect answers. We first introduce a manually constructed hint dataset,\nWikiHint, which is based on Wikipedia and includes 5,000 hints created for\n1,000 questions. We then finetune open-source LLMs such as LLaMA-3.1 for hint\ngeneration in answer-aware and answeragnostic contexts. We assess the\neffectiveness of the hints with human participants who answer questions with\nand without the aid of hints. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight\nevaluation method, HintRank, to evaluate and rank hints in both answeraware and\nanswer-agnostic settings. Our findings show that (a) the dataset helps generate\nmore effective hints, (b) including answer information along with questions\ngenerally improves quality of generated hints, and (c) encoder-based models\nperform better than decoder-based models in hint ranking.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cvlfuEz_Mt2miNY7K6osWTtf8DdDh6GWlnOvMup16f0","pdfSize":"1446438"}
