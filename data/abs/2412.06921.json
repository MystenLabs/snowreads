  "abstract": "  This article studies the moduli spaces of semistable objects related to two\nfamilies of Enriques categories over K3 surfaces, coming from quartic double\nsolids and special Gushel--Mukai threefolds. In particular, classic geometric\nconstructions are recovered in a modular way, such as the double EPW sextic and\ncube associated with a general Gushel--Mukai surface, and the Beauville's\nbirational involution on the Hilbert scheme of two points on a quartic K3\nsurface. In addition, we describe the singular loci in some moduli spaces of\nsemistable objects and an explicit birational involutions on an O'Grady's\nhyperk\\\"ahler tenfold.\n",
