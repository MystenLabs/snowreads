The approach is based on a combination of FISTA and\nCondat-Vu algorithms exploiting the convergence rate of the former and the low\nper-iteration complexity of the latter. The estimation is cast as a bilevel\nlearning problem where a first-order method is obtained via reduced-memory\nautomatic differentiation to compute the derivatives. The method is validated\nwith experimental industrial tomographic data with the numerical implementation\navailable.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"rKt1MkOghRjE9jUy9LvGUjMcNmJcqtuefsnEC_CuvyU","pdfSize":"3748299"}
