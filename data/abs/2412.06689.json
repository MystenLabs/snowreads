We have implemented five\ndifferent deep learning models, namely ConvNet, ResNet18, EfficientNet, ViT,\nand DenseNet121 and three supervised classifiers namely K-Nearest Neighbors,\nNaive Bayes Classifier and Support Vector Machine. We evaluated the performance\nof these models under varying settings. Our best performing model to date is\nEfficientNet with test accuracy of $59.63\\%$ with the following parameters\n(Adam optimizer, batch size 256, epoch size 100, epsilon value 5.0, learning\nrate $1e-3$, clipping threshold 1.0, and noise multiplier 0.912).\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"E76V8aFZbsvfNKK2NWc0TK3qmlOwe1PzD9BnO2LXSmI","pdfSize":"3286857"}
