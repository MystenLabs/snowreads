  "abstract": "  For the early identification, diagnosis, and treatment of mental health\nillnesses, the integration of deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) has\nstarted playing a significant role. By evaluating complex data from imaging,\ngenetics, and behavioral assessments, these technologies have the potential to\nsignificantly improve clinical outcomes. However, they also present unique\nchallenges related to data integration and ethical issues. This survey reviews\nthe development of ML and DL methods for the early diagnosis and treatment of\nmental health issues. It examines a range of applications, with a particular\nemphasis on behavioral assessments, genetic and biomarker analysis, and medical\nimaging for diagnosing diseases like depression, bipolar disorder, and\nschizophrenia. Predictive modeling for illness progression is further\ndiscussed, focusing on the role of risk prediction models and longitudinal\nstudies. Key findings highlight how ML and DL can improve diagnostic accuracy\nand treatment outcomes while addressing methodological inconsistencies, data\nintegration challenges, and ethical concerns. The study emphasizes the\nimportance of building real-time monitoring systems for individualized\ntreatment, enhancing data fusion techniques, and fostering interdisciplinary\ncollaboration. Future research should focus on overcoming these obstacles to\nensure the valuable and ethical application of ML and DL in mental health\nservices.\n",
