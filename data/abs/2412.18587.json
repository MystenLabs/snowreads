  "abstract": "  We investigate the kinematically allowed baryon to baryon-meson strong\ntransitions in all the light and heavy sectors. We consider only the ground\nstate particles in the baryonic and mesonic channels. In the case of mesons,\nonly the well-established pseudoscslar and vector nonets are involved. Using\nall the restrictions and conservation laws, a \\texttt{mathematica}/\n\\texttt{python} code selects the allowed strong channels among many possible\ntransitions. It is obtained that only five decay channels satisfy the required\nconditions that all the states are in their on-shell modes. Using the strong\ncoupling constants defining these transitions, we estimate the strong width and\nbeaching fraction at each channel, that may help ongoing experimental and\ntheoretical investigations.\n",
