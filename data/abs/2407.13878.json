The technique maintains two\nindependent monocular VIO modules, with one at the mobile base and the other at\nthe end-effector (EE), which are tightly coupled at the low level of the factor\ngraph. The proposed method treats each monocular VIO with respect to each other\nas a positional anchor through arm-kinematics. These anchor points provide a\nsoft geometric constraint during the VIO pose optimization. This allows us to\nstabilize both estimators in case of instability of one estimator in highly\ndynamic locomotions. The performance of our approach has been demonstrated\nthrough extensive experimental testing with a mobile manipulator tested in\ncomparison to running dual VINS-Mono in parallel. We envision that our method\ncan also provide a foundation towards active-SLAM (ASLAM) with a new\nperspective on multi-VIO fusion and system redundancy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"YvNFypImNiYndfEyXlAgoWhsH0OwZuRA6vcDztI0O8k","pdfSize":"19973659"}
