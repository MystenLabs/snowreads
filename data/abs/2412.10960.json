  "abstract": "  Yes! In the present-day documenting and preserving endangered languages, the\napplication of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a promising approach. This\npaper explores how LLMs, particularly through in-context learning, can assist\nin generating grammatical information for low-resource languages with limited\namount of data. We takes Moklen as a case study to evaluate the efficacy of\nLLMs in producing coherent grammatical rules and lexical entries using only\nbilingual dictionaries and parallel sentences of the unknown language without\nbuilding the model from scratch. Our methodology involves organising the\nexisting linguistic data and prompting to efficiently enable to generate formal\nXLE grammar. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can successfully capture key\ngrammatical structures and lexical information, although challenges such as the\npotential for English grammatical biases remain. This study highlights the\npotential of LLMs to enhance language documentation efforts, providing a\ncost-effective solution for generating linguistic data and contributing to the\npreservation of endangered languages.\n",
