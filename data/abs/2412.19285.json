We calculate the roton gap as a function of Raman coupling\n($\\Omega$) or quadratic Zeeman field strength ($\\epsilon$) to extract the\ncritical points separating the supersolid stripe phase from the plane wave or\nzero-momentum phase at finite temperatures. We present a few representative\nfinite-temperature phase diagrams for the system in the $T-\\Omega$ and\n$T-\\epsilon$ planes. Our observations indicate that the supersolid stripe phase\nmelts at finite temperatures. We also discuss the contrasting roles of quantum\nand thermal fluctuations in shifting the phase boundary separating the\nsupersolid stripe from the plane-wave phase.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xOzgJ9cbYwO8LEIISsWEpf8Cfc48TILdeKlZzCS5JbA","pdfSize":"583898"}
