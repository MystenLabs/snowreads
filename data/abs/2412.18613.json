{"id":"2412.18613","title":"The Illusion-Illusion: Vision Language Models See Illusions Where There\n  are None","authors":"Tomer Ullman","authorsParsed":[["Ullman","Tomer",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Dec 2024 03:30:51 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-30","timestamp":1733542251000,"abstract":"  Illusions are entertaining, but they are also a useful diagnostic tool in\ncognitive science, philosophy, and neuroscience. A typical illusion shows a gap\nbetween how something \"really is\" and how something \"appears to be\", and this\ngap helps us understand the mental processing that lead to how something\nappears to be. Illusions are also useful for investigating artificial systems,\nand much research has examined whether computational models of perceptions fall\nprey to the same illusions as people. Here, I invert the standard use of\nperceptual illusions to examine basic processing errors in current vision\nlanguage models. I present these models with illusory-illusions, neighbors of\ncommon illusions that should not elicit processing errors. These include such\nthings as perfectly reasonable ducks, crooked lines that truly are crooked,\ncircles that seem to have different sizes because they are, in fact, of\ndifferent sizes, and so on. I show that many current vision language systems\nmistakenly see these illusion-illusions as illusions. I suggest that such\nfailures are part of broader failures already discussed in the literature.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"T9Xh3iS3b9xlH6oSoEiAgtcquuOLse_V9cjVxpunAFc","pdfSize":"1686611"}
