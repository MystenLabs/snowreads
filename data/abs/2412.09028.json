  "abstract": "  Learning models for dynamical systems in continuous time is significant for\nunderstanding complex phenomena and making accurate predictions. This study\npresents a novel approach utilizing differential neural networks (DNNs) to\nmodel nonlinear systems, specifically permanent magnet synchronous motors\n(PMSMs), and to predict their current trajectories. The efficacy of our\napproach is validated through experiments conducted under various load\ndisturbances and no-load conditions. The results demonstrate that our method\neffectively and accurately reconstructs the original systems, showcasing strong\nshort-term and long-term prediction capabilities and robustness. This study\nprovides valuable insights into learning the inherent dynamics of complex\ndynamical data and holds potential for further applications in fields such as\nweather forecasting, robotics, and collective behavior analysis.\n",
