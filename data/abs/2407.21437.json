The energy we propose consists of the original Landau-de Gennes free\nenergy, three penalty terms and a volume constraint. We prove the existence and\nregularity of minimizers to the diffuse-interface energy functional. We also\nprove a uniform maximum principle of the minimizer under appropriate\nassumptions, together with a uniqueness result for small domains. Then, we\nestablish a sharp-interface limit where minimizers of the diffuse-interface\nenergy converge to a minimizer of a sharp-interface energy under the framework\nof $\\Gamma$-convergence. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments with the\ndiffuse-interface model, the findings of which are compared with existing\nworks.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zoDPsu8x4_y5Bk49GZNLyFbXFNMWXt-UlZxOE5Pg_OA","pdfSize":"2605355"}
