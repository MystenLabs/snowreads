Such data frequently exhibit clustering structures, however,\ntraditional clustering methods are not well-suited for multiplex networks.\nAdditionally, standard methods treat edge weights in their raw form,\npotentially biasing clustering towards a node's total weight capacity rather\nthan reflecting cluster-related interaction patterns. To address this, we\npropose transforming edge weights into a compositional format, enabling the\nanalysis of connection strengths in relative terms and removing the impact of\nnodes' total weights. We introduce a multiplex Dirichlet stochastic block model\ndesigned for multiplex networks with compositional layers. This model accounts\nfor sparse compositional networks and enables joint clustering across different\ntypes of interactions. We validate the model through a simulation study and\napply it to the international export data from the Food and Agriculture\nOrganization of the United Nations.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Computation","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OMXWcR2w2DW0InYV8pdsNrYY2c7V3-gGmZ0cAotSIHE","pdfSize":"1301853"}
