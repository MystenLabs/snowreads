  "abstract": "  The objective of this work is to examine the integrability of Hamiltonian\nsystems in $2D$ spaces with variable curvature of certain types. Based on the\ndifferential Galois theory, we announce the necessary conditions of the\nintegrability. They are given in terms of arithmetic restrictions on values of\nthe parameters describing the system. We apply the obtained results to some\nexamples to illustrate that the applicability of the obtained result is easy\nand effective. Certain new integrable examples are given. The findings\nhighlight the applicability of the differential Galois approach in studying the\nintegrability of Hamiltonian systems in curved spaces, expanding our\nunderstanding of nonlinear dynamics and its potential applications.\n",
