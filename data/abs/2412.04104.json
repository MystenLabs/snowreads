We emphasize surprising properties\nof the trajectories in configuration space, in particular their (quasi)\ndiscontinuous variations when the context (the experimental setup) is changed.\nThis occurs in both Galilean and Einsteinian relativity. In the latter case,\ndiscontinuous variations also appear without changing the setup, when the\nLorentzian reference frame is changed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Dg47ZzCTPsXIHnExOUwd1v58O3W-dfJabFPbUH1f4do","pdfSize":"448163"}
