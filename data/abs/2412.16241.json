These\nautonomous programs that act on behalf of humans are neither new nor exclusive\nto the mainstream AI movement. By exploring past incarnations of agents, we can\nunderstand what has been done previously, what worked, and more importantly,\nwhat did not pan out and why. This understanding lets us to examine what\ndistinguishes the current focus on agents. While generative AI is appealing,\nthis technology alone is insufficient to make new generations of agents more\nsuccessful. To make the current wave of agents effective and sustainable, we\nenvision an ecosystem that includes not only agents but also Sims, which\nrepresent user preferences and behaviors, as well as Assistants, which directly\ninteract with the user and coordinate the execution of user tasks with the help\nof the agents.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction","Computer Science/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"-3Xza7gnQ2XFC7-wJ3_ZoJ3wR_fDhrn6-eK1I60O-Ig","pdfSize":"408983"}
