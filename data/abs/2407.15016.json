Today's focus is\non quantifying and pre-dicting the climate effects of digitalization through\nvarious life-cycle assessments and baseline sce-nario methodologies. Here we\nargue that this is a mistake. Most attempts at prediction are based on three\nimplicit assumptions: (a) the digital carbon footprint can be quantified, (b)\nbusiness-as-usual with episodic change leading to a new era of stability, and\n(c) investments in digitalization will be delivered within the cost, timeframe,\nand benefits described in their business cases. We problema-tize each\nassumption within the context of digitalization and argue that the digital\ncarbon footprint is inherently unpredictable. We build on uncertainty\nliterature to show that even if you cannot predict, you can still mitigate. On\nthat basis, we propose to rethink practice on the digital carbon footprint from\nprediction to mitigation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QSUeiOFBSRKxkTJWH13mWmsG9sY1U0vfXpwBgdYM6mc","pdfSize":"539150"}
