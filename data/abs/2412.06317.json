In this paper, we complete the classification of the\nunitary highest weight modules for the remaining cases; i.e., universal covers\nof the Lie groups $SO_{e}(2, n)$, $E_{6(-14)}$ and $E_{7(-25)}$. We also\ndescribe unitary highest weight modules with given infinitesimal characters.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"fT7PG5eQf10C_YM55ZrXwaLzaRwO74Fpk8WWmwE7lDI","pdfSize":"351468"}
