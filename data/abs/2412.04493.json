  "abstract": "  The problem of robust quickest change detection (QCD) in non-stationary\nprocesses under a multi-stream setting is studied. In classical QCD theory,\noptimal solutions are developed to detect a sudden change in the distribution\nof stationary data. Most studies have focused on single-stream data. In\nnon-stationary processes, the data distribution both before and after change\nvaries with time and is not precisely known. The multi-dimension data even\ncomplicates such issues. It is shown that if the non-stationary family for each\ndimension or stream has a least favorable law (LFL) or distribution in a\nwell-defined sense, then the algorithm designed using the LFLs is robust\noptimal. The notion of LFL defined in this work differs from the classical\ndefinitions due to the dependence of the post-change model on the change point.\nExamples of multi-stream non-stationary processes encountered in public health\nmonitoring and aviation applications are provided. Our robust algorithm is\napplied to simulated and real data to show its effectiveness.\n",
