These models assign to each node latent\nattributes that characterize connectivity with other nodes, with these latent\nattributes dynamically changing over time. Node attributes can be organized as\na three-way tensor with modes corresponding to nodes, latent space dimension,\nand time. Unfortunately, as the number of nodes and time points increases, the\nnumber of elements of this tensor becomes enormous, leading to computational\nand statistical challenges, particularly when data are sparse. We propose a new\napproach for massively reducing dimensionality by expressing the latent node\nattribute tensor as low rank. This leads to an interesting new nested exemplar\nlatent space model, which characterizes the node attribute tensor as dependent\non low-dimensional exemplar traits for each node, weights for each latent space\ndimension, and exemplar curves characterizing time variation. We study\nproperties of this framework, including expressivity, and develop efficient\nBayesian inference algorithms. The approach leads to substantial advantages in\nsimulations and applications to ecological networks.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"d8SXD3C19-jCQnYuceN96C-6_X0y0dVvtRU4aiPv3XI","pdfSize":"2897803"}
