  "abstract": "  In this paper, we establish well-posedness of reflected McKean-Vlasov SDEs\nand their particle approximations in smooth non-convex domains. We prove\nconvergence of the interacting particle system to the corresponding mean-field\nlimit with the optimal rate of convergence. We motivate this study with\napplications to sampling and optimization in constrained domains by considering\nreflected mean-field Langevin SDEs and two reflected consensus-based\noptimization (CBO) models, respectively. We utilize reflection coupling to\nstudy long-time behaviour of reflected mean-field SDEs and also investigate\nconvergence of the reflected CBO models to the global minimum of a constrained\noptimization problem. We numerically test reflected CBO models on benchmark\nconstrained optimization problems and an inverse problem.\n",
