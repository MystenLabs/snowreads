By analyzing the Q-adic closure of O_K in O_F we\ncharacterize those rings of integers O_K for which every residue class ring of\nInt(O_K) modulo a non-zero prime ideal is GE2 (meaning that every unimodular\npair can be trasformed to (1,0) by a series of elementary transformations).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"QlCzUerwBJFwVqyqm5uFnq7bL-0FFZ9XpuMDV8_Sct0","pdfSize":"134630"}
