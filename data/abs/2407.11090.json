They significantly influence\nthe performance of artificial neural networks. By modulating the non-linear\nproperties essential for learning complex patterns, AFs are fundamental in both\nclassification and regression tasks. This paper presents a comprehensive review\nof various types of AFs, including fixed-shape, parametric, adaptive,\nstochastic/probabilistic, non-standard, and ensemble/combining types. We begin\nwith a systematic taxonomy and detailed classification frameworks that\ndelineates the principal characteristics of AFs and organizes them based on\ntheir structural and functional distinctions. Our in-depth analysis covers\nprimary groups such as sigmoid-based, ReLU-based, and ELU-based AFs, discussing\ntheir theoretical foundations, mathematical formulations, and specific benefits\nand limitations in different contexts. We also highlight key attributes of AFs\nsuch as output range, monotonicity, and smoothness. Furthermore, we explore\nmiscellaneous AFs that do not conform to these categories but have shown unique\nadvantages in specialized applications. Non-standard AFs are also explored,\nshowcasing cutting-edge variations that challenge traditional paradigms and\noffer enhanced adaptability and model performance. We examine strategies for\ncombining multiple AFs to leverage complementary properties. The paper\nconcludes with a comparative evaluation of 12 state-of-the-art AFs, using\nrigorous statistical and experimental methodologies to assess their efficacy.\nThis analysis not only aids practitioners in selecting and designing the most\nappropriate AFs for their specific deep learning tasks but also encourages\ncontinued innovation in AF development within the machine learning community.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WI0uJjmG7eSbfHX-VqJ-kyrpJIaj4DlPqzyhFkPM64w","pdfSize":"6525971"}
