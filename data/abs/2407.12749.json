Navigating this complex landscape to retrieve specific\ninformation about gates or design rules is often time-consuming and\nerror-prone. To address this, we present HDLCopilot, an LLM-powered PDK query\nsystem that allows engineers to streamline interactions with PDKs in natural\nlanguage format, making information retrieval accurate and more efficient.\nHDLCopilot achieves an accuracy of 94.23\\% on an evaluation set comprised of\ndiverse and complex natural language queries. HDLCopilot positions itself as a\npowerful assistant in the hardware design process, enhancing productivity and\nreducing potential human errors.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"tXGLPl31DHjxbIhPJS4RlBNsxSt3RgBcZifJPlPLGjk","pdfSize":"2679216"}
