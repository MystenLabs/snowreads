In this paper, we propose a numerical method based on the constraint\nenergy minimizing generalized multiscale finite element method (CEM-GMsFEM)\nspecifically designed for sign-changing problems. The construction of auxiliary\nspaces in the original CEM-GMsFEM is tailored to accommodate the sign-changing\nsetting. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod in handling sophisticated coefficient profiles and the robustness of\ncoefficient contrast ratios. Under several technical assumptions and by\napplying the \\texttt{T}-coercivity theory, we establish the inf-sup stability\nand provide an a priori error estimate for the proposed method.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"-gshPiTOXuez0VLAsq-y5eW8qFAEglWbh90xlZDe1gY","pdfSize":"13817815"}
