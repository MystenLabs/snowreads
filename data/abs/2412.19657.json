The construction\nbegins with a reconstruction of the Haagerup weak Hopf algebra $H_3$ from the\nHaagerup fusion category, ensuring that the representation category of $H_3$ is\nequivalent to Haagerup fusion category. Utilizing the framework of symmetry\ntopological field theory (SymTFT), we develop an ultra-thin weak Hopf quantum\ndouble model, characterized by a smooth topological boundary condition. We show\nthat this model supports Haagerup fusion category symmetry. Finally, we solve\nthe ground state of the model in terms of a weak Hopf matrix product state,\nwhich serves as a natural generalization of the cluster state, embodying\nHaagerup fusion category symmetry.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gH01ftMl0FTgII517vSM4vqLj3ayaEEePW4rs2LGXeo","pdfSize":"413166"}
