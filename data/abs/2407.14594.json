Using low-resolution spectra, we accurately measure\nthe extinction curve - a diagnostic of the grain properties - for 130 million\nstars, orders of magnitude more than previously available, allowing us to map\nits variation in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds in 3D in unprecedented\ndetail. We find evidence that accretion is the dominant mechanism of grain\ngrowth in moderately dense regions, with coagulation dominating at higher\ndensities. Moreover, we find that the extinction curve flattens in star-forming\nregions, possibly caused by cycling of large grains formed in molecular clouds,\nor by preferential destruction of small grains by supernova shocks.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"9h5ipXKkhZ_RHewSFTi_PyTtQzm4RWb2IKQfrX7moQM","pdfSize":"9003915"}
