  "abstract": "  Traditional metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and precision are frequently\nused to evaluate machine learning models, however they may not be sufficient\nfor evaluating performance on tiny, unbalanced, or high-dimensional datasets. A\ndataset-adaptive, normalized metric that incorporates dataset characteristics\nlike size, feature dimensionality, class imbalance, and signal-to-noise ratio\nis presented in this study. Early insights into the model's performance\npotential in challenging circumstances are provided by the suggested metric,\nwhich offers a scalable and adaptable evaluation framework. The metric's\ncapacity to accurately forecast model scalability and performance is\ndemonstrated via experimental validation spanning classification, regression,\nand clustering tasks, guaranteeing solid assessments in settings with limited\ndata. This method has important ramifications for effective resource allocation\nand model optimization in machine learning workflows.\n",
