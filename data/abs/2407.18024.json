Quantum circuits\nbuilt to implement these algorithms usually require multi-controlled gates as\nfundamental building blocks, where the multi-controlled Toffoli stands out as\nthe primary example. For implementation in quantum hardware, these gates should\nbe decomposed into many elementary gates, which results in a large depth of the\nfinal quantum circuit. However, even moderately deep quantum circuits have low\nfidelity due to decoherence effects and, thus, may return an almost perfectly\nuniform distribution of the output results. This paper proposes a different\napproach for efficient cost multi-controlled gates implementation using the\nquantum Fourier transform. We show how the depth of the circuit can be\nsignificantly reduced using only a few ancilla qubits, making our approach\nviable for application to noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers. This\nquantum arithmetic-based approach can be efficiently used to implement many\ncomplex quantum gates.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xYkcmCZ6Gyj35SoIegJB_rp-KjCLCs_Z2K9db1q_jlE","pdfSize":"562798","objectId":"0x45c54d970c27223ea6fcdec063ded5137c710d6ccbc4d638e47d9653cb4fdde4","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
