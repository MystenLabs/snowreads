A strategy is shown on how to bound these\nsums for a wide class of functions $w$ belonging within the same ecosystem.\nUsing this new technology we are able to improve current results on minor arcs\nthat have recently appeared in the literature of the Hardy-Littlewood circle\nmethod. Lastly, we show how a bound on $\\sum_{n \\le X} |\\mu(n)| e^{2\\pi i\\alpha\nn}$ can be used to study partitions asymptotics over squarefree parts and\nexplain their connection to the zeros of the Riemann zeta-function.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YZnBTnIz2gPFDQdiOdNGYTjFAAMTqyA0Gh9gMXes2BI","pdfSize":"1374170"}
