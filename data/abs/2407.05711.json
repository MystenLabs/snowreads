Taking periodically driven graphene as an\nexample, we show that mirror symmetries about the $xz$ and $yz$ planes and the\ncombining symmetries, the symmetries of combinations of the mirror operations\nabout these planes and a uniform time translation, can be broken by linearly or\ncircularly polarized light. We also show that this symmetry breaking induces\nthe time-averaged off-diagonal symmetric or antisymmetric charge conductivity\nin a nonequilibrium steady state with linearly or circularly, respectively,\npolarized light. Our results are experimentally testable in pump-probe\nmeasurements. This work will pave the way for controlling mirror symmetries via\nlight and utilizing the light-induced mirror symmetry breaking.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MhvwqCtCVCrnreXWl9G8vuhxdfK-Ub_vXsUf9qXgLlo","pdfSize":"1620845"}
