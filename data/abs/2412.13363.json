  "abstract": "  Single organic molecules embedded in solid-state matrices exhibit remarkable\noptical properties, making them competitive candidates for single-photon\nsources and quantum nonlinear optical elements. However, the lack of long-lived\ninternal states imposes significant constraints on their application in the\nbroader field of quantum technologies. In this article, we reexamine the\nsingle-molecule host-guest system from first principles, elaborate on the rich\ninternal states this system encompasses and put forward strategies to harness\nthem for applications in quantum memory, spin-photon interface, spin register,\nand optomechanics. Further, we discuss the potential of leveraging the vast\nchemical space of molecules, and highlight the challenges and opportunities for\nmolecular systems along these directions.\n",
