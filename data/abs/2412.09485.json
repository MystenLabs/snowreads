  "abstract": "  Celestial holography is the conjecture that scattering amplitudes in\n$(d+2)$-dimensional asymptotically Minkowski spacetimes are dual to correlators\nof a $d$-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) on the celestial sphere,\ncalled the celestial CFT (CCFT). In a CFT, we can calculate sub-region\nentanglement R\\'{e}nyi entropies (EREs), including entanglement entropy (EE),\nfrom correlators of twist operators, via the replica trick. We argue that CCFT\ntwist operators are holographically dual to cosmic branes in the\n$(d+2)$-dimensional spacetime, and that their correlators are holographically\ndual to the $(d+2)$-dimensional partition function (the vacuum-to-vacuum\nscattering amplitude) in the presence of these cosmic branes. We hence compute\nthe EREs of a spherical sub-region of the CCFT's conformal vacuum, finding the\nform dictated by conformal symmetry, including a universal contribution\ndetermined by the CCFT's sphere partition function (odd $d$) or Weyl anomaly\n(even $d$). We find that this universal contribution vanishes when $d=4$ mod\n$4$, and otherwise is proportional to $i$ times the $d^{\\textrm{th}}$ power of\nthe $(d+2)$-dimensional long-distance cutoff in Planck units.\n",
