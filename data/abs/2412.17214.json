  "abstract": "  X-ray Astrophysics, which addresses extreme physics in extreme conditions, is\nparticularly well suited for answering questions related to known physics.\nReversely tiny effects, but integrated along sidereal distances, allow to probe\nextensions of known physics or even new physics. The new window into\npolarimetry in this energy band, opened by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry\nExplorer (IXPE) a NASA-ASI Small Explorer mission launched on 9th December 2021\nenables an entirely novel approach, whether used alone or in combination with\nstandard observables such as light curves and spectra and with data in other\nwavelengths. In this paper, we review IXPE's results after nearly three years\nof successful operation, focusing on their implications for key questions in\nFundamental Physics.\n",
