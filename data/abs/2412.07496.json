This work investigates\nboth experimentally and theoretically the collisional scattering of $^{6}\\rm\nLi_2$ molecular Bose-Einstein condensate in the $D$ band of a one-dimensional\noptical lattice, with interaction strength directly tunable via magnetic\nFeshbach resonance. We find a clear dependence of the $D$-band lifetimes on the\ninteraction strength within the strongly interacting regime, which arises from\nthe fact that the scattering cross-section is proportional to the square of the\nscattering length. The maximum lifetime versus lattice depth is measured to\nreveal the effects of interactions. We also investigate the scattering channels\nof $D$-band molecules under different interaction levels and develop a reliable\ntwo-body scattering rate equation. This work provides insight into the\ninterplay between interaction and the collisional scattering of high-band\nbosons in optical lattices, paving the way for research into strong correlation\neffects in high-band lattice systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XoJBMWJcSJLrw8ug0o0l53InGPmf2QbCllqoSGluovw","pdfSize":"3649591"}
