We\nconstructed a dataset comprising both native and non-native speech to\nfacilitate our research. Three key features (MFCC, LFCC, and CQCC) were\nextracted from the speech data, and three classic machine learning-based\nclassifiers (CatBoost, XGBoost, and GMM) were employed to develop robust\nspoofing detection systems using the native and combined (native and\nnon-native) speech data. This resulted in two types of CMs: Native and\nCombined. The performance of these CMs was evaluated on both native and\nnon-native speech datasets. Our findings reveal significant challenges faced by\nNative CM in handling non-native speech, highlighting the necessity for\ndomain-specific solutions. The proposed method shows improved detection\ncapabilities, demonstrating the importance of incorporating non-native speech\ndata into the training process. This work lays the foundation for more\neffective spoofing detection systems in diverse linguistic contexts.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"5kR9EfZCicXbA7Fx1h5wNA5AmaYUqxtj_jPkJpjbFP8","pdfSize":"533646"}
