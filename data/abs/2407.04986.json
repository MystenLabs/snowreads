This study introduces DLICP (Deep Learning Integrated\nCommunity Parks), an innovative approach that combines deep learning techniques\nspecifically, face recognition technology with a novel walking activity\nmeasurement algorithm to enhance user experience in community parks. The DLICP\nutilizes a camera with face recognition software to accurately identify and\ntrack park users. Simultaneously, a walking activity measurement algorithm\ncalculates parameters such as the average pace and calories burned, tailored to\nindividual attributes. Extensive evaluations confirm the precision of DLICP,\nwith a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 5.64 calories and a Mean Percentage Error\n(MPE) of 1.96%, benchmarked against widely available fitness measurement\ndevices, such as the Apple Watch Series 6. This study contributes significantly\nto the development of intelligent smart park systems, enabling real-time\nupdates on burned calories and personalized fitness tracking.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"uv5sIHW5IyG50fgiFJ6iWPPGOvx5yJ13UcUeHd43n5I","pdfSize":"600460"}
