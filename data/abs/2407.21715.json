In\nthis paper, we study the interplay between bulk dephasing and a linear\npotential in a boundary-driven tight-binding chain. A linear potential induces\nWannier-Stark localization in the absence of noise, while dephasing induces\ndiffusive transport in the absence of a tilt. We derive an approximate\nexpression for the steady-state current as a function of both dephasing and\ntilt which closely matches the exact solution for a wide range of parameters.\nFrom it, we find that the maximum current occurs for a dephasing rate equal to\nthe period of Bloch oscillations in the Wannier-Stark localized system. We also\nfind that the current displays a maximum as a function of the system size,\nprovided that the total potential tilt across the chain remains constant. Our\nresults can be verified in current experimental platforms and represents a step\nforward in analytical studies of environment-assisted transport.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cAG6ZK3Xrvg1akEG-WgWjtOBL6hBflOpIZl2Wz1s4c4","pdfSize":"1566881"}
