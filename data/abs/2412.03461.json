Despite many uncertainties, it is commonly assumed that if BHs\noriginated from isolated massive star binaries, their spins should be aligned\nwith the orbital angular momentum of the binary system. This assumption stems\nfrom the notion that BHs inherit their spins from their progenitor stars. In\nthis study, we relax this long-held viewpoint and explore various mechanisms\nthat can spin up BHs before or during their formation. In addition to natal\nspins, we discuss physical processes that can spin BHs isotropically, parallel\nto natal kicks, and perpendicular to natal kicks. These different mechanisms\nleave behind distinct imprints on the observable distributions of spin\nmagnitudes, spin-orbit misalignments and the effective inspiral spin of merging\nbinaries. In particular, these mechanisms allow even the binaries originating\nin the field to exhibit precession and retrograde spin ($\\chi_{\\rm eff}<0$).\nThis broadens the parameter space allowed for isolated binary evolution into\nregimes which were previously thought to be exclusive to dynamically assembled\nbinaries.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5iPT3tIsqPiXxQCJsYQaj4rID7HypAMYMVJxmUxdJgA","pdfSize":"5932365"}
