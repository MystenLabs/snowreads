The challenge lies in reducing the computational\ncomplexity while maintaining high accuracy for quick evaluations of multiple\ndesign alternatives. This research explores advanced methods, including\nsurrogate models, reduced-order models (ROM), and multi-fidelity machine\nlearning techniques, to achieve more efficient aircraft design evaluations.\nSpecifically, the study investigates the application of Multi-fidelity\nPhysics-Informed Neural Networks (MPINN) and autoencoders for manifold\nalignment, alongside the potential of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)\nfor refining design geometries. Through a proof-of-concept task, the research\ndemonstrates the ability to predict high-fidelity results from low-fidelity\nsimulations, offering a path toward faster and more cost effective aircraft\ndesign iterations.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"-KwWefHTC_a6tuK93d8YllmfnVcDkJ-aMk5fJGaSMB4","pdfSize":"465307"}
