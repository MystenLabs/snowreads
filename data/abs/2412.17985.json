In\nparticular, for fractal subsets $A\\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ and $a,x\\in\n\\mathbb{R}^n$, we study sets of the form \\[ \\Pi_x^a(A) := \\{\\alpha \\in\n\\mathbb{R} : (a-x)\\cdot y= \\alpha, \\text{ for some $y\\in A$}\\}. \\] We discuss\nsome of what is already known to give a picture of the current state of the\nart, as well as prove some new results and special cases. We obtain lower\nbounds on the Hausdorff dimension of $A$ to guarantee that $\\Pi^a_x(A)$ is\nlarge in some quantitative sense for some $a\\in A$ (i.e. $\\Pi_x^a(A)$ has large\nHausdorff dimension, positive measure, or nonempty interior). Our approach to\nall three senses of \"size\" is the same, and we make use of both classical and\nrecent results on projection theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8dVKMMHKSTYdf1A-COWVHMSEYU8pNKcGZO3LctFpjBY","pdfSize":"552049"}
