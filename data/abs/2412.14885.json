However, the intrinsic interdependence between electrical\nconductivity, the Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity presents a\nsignificant challenge. Over time, various strategies have emerged, but the\nliterature remains difficult to navigate due to its widespread distribution\nacross numerous sources. This short review highlights the key approaches to\nimproving zT, offering a clear and concise guide to help researchers understand\nthe major ideas and breakthroughs in the field.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"5oqdAM7ru0eUHM8bAJUuqorZU-DbH3pZwt2ghKks6C4","pdfSize":"6059505"}
