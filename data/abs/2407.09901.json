Part I\nprovided a complete characterization for approximating invariant probability\nmeasures and density functions, while here, we focus on explicit approximations\nfor periodic solutions in distribution. Two easily implementable methods are\nintroduced: periodic normal approximation (PNOA) and periodic log-normal\napproximation (PLNA). These methods offer unified algorithms to calculate the\nmean and covariance matrix, and verify positive definiteness, without\nadditional constraints like non-degenerate diffusion. Furthermore, we explore\nessential properties of the covariance matrix, particularly its connection\nunder periodic and non-periodic drift coefficients. Our new approximation\nmethods significantly relax the minimal criteria for positive definiteness of\nthe solution of the discrete-type Lyapunov equation. Some numerical experiments\nare provided to support our theoretical results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vFlyaDm2VD2rHLdRldy9vQj135TdF2YyobYJnSSB1hg","pdfSize":"2328910"}
