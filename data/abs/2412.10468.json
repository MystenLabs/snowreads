  "abstract": "  Separating a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from noise is a\nchallenging statistical task. One approach to establishing a detection\ncriterion for the SGWB is using Bayesian evidence. If the evidence ratio (Bayes\nfactor) between models with and without the signal exceeds a certain threshold,\nthe signal is considered detected. We present a formalism to compute the\naveraged Bayes factor, incorporating instrumental-noise and SGWB uncertainties.\nAs an example, we consider the case of power-law-shaped SGWB in LISA and\ngenerate the corresponding \\textit{bayesian sensitivity curve}. Unlike existing\nmethods in the literature, which typically neglect uncertainties in both the\nsignal and noise, our approach provides a reliable and realistic alternative.\nThis flexible framework opens avenues for more robust stochastic gravitational\nwave background detection across gravitational-wave experiments.\n",
