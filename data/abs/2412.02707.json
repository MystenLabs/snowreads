  "abstract": "  We study Coupling Extended Proca-Nuevo gravity, a non-linear theory extending\nfrom dRGT massive gravity with a spin-1 field. This theory is shown to yield\nreliable, ghost-free cosmological solutions, modeling both the Universe's\nthermal history and late-time acceleration. By analyzing data from Dark energy\nspectroscopic instruments (DESI), Cosmic Chronometer (CCh), Gamma Ray Bursts\n(GRBs), and Type Ia Supernova (SNeIa), we derive parameter constraints with up\nto 3$\\sigma$ confidence, demonstrating good agreement with observations. Our\ncomparison of $BAO$ data from $WiggleZ$ and $DESI$ highlights its constraining\npower on the Hubble constant. The analysis of the cosmographic parameter, $q$\nshows the statistical compatibility with the recent data. Further, this\nindicates that Universe's current accelerated expansion aligns with\nquintessential behavior.\n",
