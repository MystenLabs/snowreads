It is shown that, at least in some cases, the densities are not\naffected by Fermi-Dirac or Bose- Einstein statistics, and are determined only\nby the initial state of the multi-particle system. The second quantisation\ntechnique is extended to Dirac electrons and, with some modifications, to\nKlein-Gordon bosons. The difference in pair production in these two\nrelativistic cases is analysed in some detail.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tg-aoZYGAxKX36xpG7XIfrnL5ehhnlZX4St2GWlnMGA","pdfSize":"2926580","objectId":"0xe6c932c7f0458fc1aecd41d66834abbc9a6282d7acc1f82759c11a5f64d01670","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
