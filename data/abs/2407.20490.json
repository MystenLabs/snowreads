We incorporate\nprobabilistic model-checking and linear programming into a dynamic Bayesian\nnetwork to enable the construction of risk-averse digital twins. By modeling\nwith a random variable the probability of the asset to transition from one\nstate to another, we define a parametric Markov decision process. By solving\nthis Markov decision process, we compute a policy that defines state-dependent\noptimal actions to take. To account for rare events connected to failures we\nleverage risk measures associated with the distribution of the random variables\ndescribing the transition probabilities. We refine the optimal policy at every\ntime step resulting in a better trade off between operational costs and\nperformances. We showcase the capabilities of the proposed framework with a\nstructural digital twin of an unmanned aerial vehicle and its adaptive mission\nreplanning.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"OTIB_BUf3-heypD1NWbK_j136vomKJOdDoejhKh_JGs","pdfSize":"2129310","objectId":"0x0f3563c9ba03face098214f0c2d02150079bc1e2e2d35d2d2db32b604f43aed3","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
