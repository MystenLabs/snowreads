  "abstract": "  In this article, we shall describe the center of the universal affine vertex\nsuperalgebra $V^{\\kappa_c}(\\mathfrak g)$ associated with $\\mathfrak\ng=\\mathfrak{sl}_{2|1}, \\mathfrak {gl}_{2|1}$ at the critical level $\\kappa_c$\nand prove the conjecture of A. Molev and E. Ragoucy in this case.\n  The center $\\mathfrak{z}(V^{\\kappa_c}(\\mathfrak{sl}_{2|1}))$ turns out to be\nisomorphic to the large level limit $\\ell \\rightarrow \\infty$ of a vertex\nsubalgebra, called the parafermion vertex algebra $K^{\\ell} (\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$,\nof the affine vertex algebra $V^\\ell(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. The key ingredient of\nthe proof is to understand the principal $W$-superalgebra $\nW^{\\kappa_c}(\\mathfrak{sl}_{2|1})$ at the critical level. It relates the center\n$\\mathfrak{z}(V^{\\kappa_c}(\\mathfrak{sl} _{2|1}))$ to\n$V^\\infty(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ via the Kazama-Suzuki duality while it has a\nsurprising coincidence with $V^{\\kappa_c}(\\mathfrak{gl}_{1|1})$, whose center\nhas been recently described. Moreover, the centers\n$\\mathfrak{z}(V^{\\kappa_c}(\\mathfrak{sl}_{2|1}))$ and\n$\\mathfrak{z}(W^{\\kappa_c}(\\mathfrak{sl}_{2|1}))$ are proven to coincide as a\nbyproduct.\n  A general conjecture is proposed which describes the center\n$\\mathfrak{z}(V^{\\kappa_c}(\\mathfrak{sl}_{n|m}))$ with $n>m$ as a large level\nlimit of ``the dual side'', i.e., the parafermion-type subalgebras of\n$W$-algebras $ W^\\ell(\\mathfrak{sl}_{n}, \\mathbb{O}_{[n-m,1^m]})$ associated\nwith hook-type partitions $[n-m,1^m]$, known also as vertex algebras at the\ncorner.\n",
