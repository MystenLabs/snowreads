  "abstract": "  Papers published in top conferences contribute influential discoveries that\nare reshaping the landscape of modern Artificial Intelligence (AI). We analyzed\n87,137 papers from 11 AI conferences to examine publication trends over the\npast decade. Our findings reveal a consistent increase in both the number of\npapers and authors, reflecting the growing interest in AI research. We also\nobserved a rise in prolific researchers who publish dozens of papers at the\nsame conference each year. In light of this analysis, the AI research community\nshould consider revisiting authorship policies, addressing equity concerns, and\nevaluating the workload of junior researchers to foster a more sustainable and\ninclusive research environment.\n",
