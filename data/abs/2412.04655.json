However, real-world recommendation systems\nare built on multiple models and even multiple stages, from candidate retrieval\nto scoring and serving, which raises challenges for responsible development and\ndeployment. This system-level view, as highlighted by regulations like the EU\nAI Act, necessitates moving beyond auditing individual models as independent\nentities. We propose a holistic framework for modeling system-level fairness,\nfocusing on the end-utility delivered to diverse user groups, and consider\ninteractions between components such as retrieval and scoring models. We\nprovide formal insights on the limitations of focusing solely on model-level\nfairness and highlight the need for alternative tools that account for\nheterogeneity in user preferences. To mitigate system-level disparities, we\nadapt closed-box optimization tools (e.g., BayesOpt) to jointly optimize\nutility and equity. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nproposed framework on synthetic and real datasets, underscoring the need for a\nsystem-level framework.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mxp8t1EP7sB2qS6tlOtD8wggEGWFinzuQEK86xNs36c","pdfSize":"2127251"}
