  "abstract": "  The height of a toric variety and that of its hypersurfaces can be expressed\nin convex-analytic terms as an adelic sum of mixed integrals of their roof\nfunctions and duals of their Ronkin functions.\n  Here we extend these results to the $2$-codimensional situation by presenting\na limit formula predicting the typical height of the intersection of two\nhypersurfaces on a toric variety. More precisely, we prove that the height of\nthe intersection cycle of two effective divisors translated by a strict\nsequence of torsion points converges to an adelic sum of mixed integrals of\nroof and duals of Ronkin functions.\n  This partially confirms a previous conjecture of the authors about the\naverage height of families of complete intersections in toric varieties.\n",
