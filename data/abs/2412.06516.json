The ESA Gaia space mission has\nrevolutionized this research field, providing parallaxes and multi-band\nphotometry for nearly 360,000 white dwarfs. Furthermore, this data, combined\nwith spectroscopical and spectropolarimetric observations, have provided new\ninformation on their chemical abundances and magnetic fields. This large data\nset has raised new questions on the nature of white dwarfs, boosting our\ntheoretical efforts for understanding the physics that governs their evolution\nand for improving the statistical analysis of their collective properties. In\nthis article, I summarize the current state of our understanding of the\ncollective properties of white dwarfs, based of detailed theoretical models and\npopulation synthesis studies.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5t1Wz2VP_6lgn22ZqWOlN3oppDTyIvo6SgvQFJuoDFg","pdfSize":"448406"}
