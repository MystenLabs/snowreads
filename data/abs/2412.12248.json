  "abstract": "  Neural-network-based variational quantum states in general, and more recently\nautoregressive models in particular, have proven to be powerful tools to\ndescribe complex many-body wave functions. However, their performance crucially\ndepends on the computational basis chosen and they often lack physical\ninterpretability. To mitigate these issues, we here propose a modified\nvariational Monte-Carlo framework which leverages prior physical information to\nconstruct a computational second-quantized basis containing a reference state\nthat serves as a rough approximation to the true ground state. In this basis, a\nTransformer is used to parametrize and autoregressively sample the corrections\nto the reference state, giving rise to a more interpretable and computationally\nefficient representation of the ground state. We demonstrate this approach\nusing a non-sparse fermionic model featuring a metal-insulator transition and\nemploying Hartree-Fock and a strong-coupling limit to define physics-informed\nbases. We also show that the Transformer's hidden representation captures the\nnatural energetic order of the different basis states. This work paves the way\nfor more efficient and interpretable neural quantum-state representations.\n",
