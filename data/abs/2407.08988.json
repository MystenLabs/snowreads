We derive useful integral\nexpressions of the entries that allow us to explicitly or semi-analytically\nevaluate the entries for various interaction kernels. Moreover, the limiting\ncases of the nonlocal stiffness matrix when the interactional radius\n$\\delta\\rightarrow0$ or $\\delta\\rightarrow\\infty$ automatically lead to integer\nand fractional FEM stiffness matrices, respectively, and the FEM discretisation\nis intrinsically compatible. We conduct ample numerical experiments to study\nand predict some of its properties and test on different types of nonlocal\nproblems. To the best of our knowledge, such a semi-analytic approach has not\nbeen explored in literature even in the one-dimensional case.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0xd8c4787cf44ae6ad2e7e77b326202fe6ecb5ac52c2b23bf0f599c7132c46dce6","pdfSize":"1867107"}
