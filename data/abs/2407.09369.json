The QB field, which is the combination of\nfour Beltrami fields, is described by four scale parameters. These scale\nparameters are often either real or both real and complex in nature. The values\nof the scale parameters are determined by Beltrami parameters, relativistic\ntemperatures, and the densities of plasma species. It is demonstrated that all\nthe scale parameters become real at higher relativistic temperatures and ion\ndensities, which naturally lead to paramagnetic structures. It is also shown\nthat the scale separation in the QB state provides the possibility of field and\nflow generation in such thermally relativistic plasmas. The present study may\nhave implications for space, astrophysical and laboratory plasmas.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Ir3tlMu0EK6gb-BjhNu1OuZ9bPX6sDjIF_frbRKx_x4","pdfSize":"349781","objectId":"0x8cefd0176d3cc253967ba91db9e6960c8e6c4b9be409cf64ea4ad913e91e2139","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
