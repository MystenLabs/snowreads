  "abstract": "  The crystal structure, stability, electronic and optical properties of the\nTa$_2$NiSe$_5$ monolayer have been investigated using first-principles\ncalculations in combination with the Bethe-Salpeter equation. The results show\nthat it is feasible to directly exfoliate a Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ monolayer from the\nlow-temperature monoclinic phase. The monolayer is stable and behaves as a\nnormal narrow-gap semiconductor with neither spontaneous excitons nor\nnon-trivial topology. Despite the quasi-particle and optical gaps of only 266\nand 200 meV, respectively, its optically-active exciton has a binding energy up\nto 66 meV and can exist at room temperature. This makes it valuable for\napplications in infrared photodetection, especially its inherent in-plane\nanisotropy adds to its value in polarization sensing. It is also found that the\ninclusion of spin-orbit coupling is theoretically necessary to properly\nelucidate the optical and excitonic properties of monolayer.\n",
