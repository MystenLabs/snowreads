  "abstract": "  We examined the effectiveness of various human-AI collaboration designs on\ncreative work. Through a human subjects experiment set in the context of\ncreative writing, we found that while AI assistance improved productivity\nacross all models, collaboration design significantly influenced output\nquality, user satisfaction, and content characteristics. Models incorporating\nhuman creative input delivered higher content interestingness and overall\nquality as well as greater task performer satisfaction compared to conditions\nwhere humans were limited to confirming AI's output. Increased AI involvement\nencouraged creators to explore beyond personal experience but also led to lower\naggregate diversity in stories and genres among participants. However, this\neffect was mitigated through human participation in early creative tasks. These\nfindings underscore the importance of preserving the human creative role to\nensure quality, satisfaction, and creative diversity in human-AI collaboration.\n",
