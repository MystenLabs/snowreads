This papers considers more\ngeneral Riemannian products of surfaces and explores geometric and topological\nrestrictions that arise for minimal surfaces. We show that generically, a\ntotally geodesic surface in a Riemannian product is locally either a slice or a\nproduct of geodesics. If the Gauss curvatures of the factors are negative, it\nis proven that there are no minimal 2-spheres, while minimal 2-tori are\nLagrangian with respect to both product symplectic structures. If the surfaces\nhave non-zero bounded curvatures, we establish a sharp lower bound on the area\nof minimal 2-spheres and explore the properties of the Gauss and normal\ncurvatures of general compact minimal surfaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hedsST2nBPGVkEa1E2iNDgGWf8ZWAdC0X410S1jR4Ug","pdfSize":"209187"}
