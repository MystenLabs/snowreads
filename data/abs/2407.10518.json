Identifying gas in filaments is a challenge, due\nto their lower density contrast which produces faint signals. The best chance\nto detect these signals is therefore in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. We\nrevisit the X-ray observation of the cluster Abell 2744 using statistical\nestimators of anisotropic matter distribution to identify filamentary patterns\naround it. We report for the first time the blind detection of filaments\nconnected to a galaxy cluster from X-ray emission using a filament-finder\ntechnique and a multipole decomposition technique. We compare this result with\nfilaments extracted from the distribution of spectroscopic galaxies, through\nwhich we demonstrate the robustness and reliability of our techniques in\ntracing a filamentary structure of 3 to 5 filaments connected to Abell 2744.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"hjwf06D4qCsf6V9ZN3KxRBQ2q2MFTUbgasXouZ64V3I","pdfSize":"9399438"}
