We approach this\nquestion by investigating two key aspects: internal representations and\ndispositions to act. First, we survey various philosophical theories of\nrepresentation, including informational, causal, structural, and teleosemantic\naccounts, arguing that LLMs satisfy key conditions proposed by each. We draw on\nrecent interpretability research in machine learning to support these claims.\nSecond, we explore whether LLMs exhibit robust dispositions to perform actions,\na necessary component of folk psychology. We consider two prominent\nphilosophical traditions, interpretationism and representationalism, to assess\nLLM action dispositions. While we find evidence suggesting LLMs may satisfy\nsome criteria for having a mind, particularly in game-theoretic environments,\nwe conclude that the data remains inconclusive. Additionally, we reply to\nseveral skeptical challenges to LLM folk psychology, including issues of\nsensory grounding, the \"stochastic parrots\" argument, and concerns about\nmemorization. Our paper has three main upshots. First, LLMs do have robust\ninternal representations. Second, there is an open question to answer about\nwhether LLMs have robust action dispositions. Third, existing skeptical\nchallenges to LLM representation do not survive philosophical scrutiny.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Gr7ZrElkPp9c_Xh54GdOJGvCqEivtKogFxVkJzrPNRM","pdfSize":"2515925"}
