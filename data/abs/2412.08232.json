  "abstract": "  While formal models of concurrency tend to focus on synchronous\ncommunication, asynchronous communication is relevant in practice. In this\npaper, we will discuss asynchronous communication in the context of\nsession-based concurrency, the model of computation in which session types\nspecify the structure of the two-party protocols implemented by the channels of\na communicating process. We overview recent work on addressing the challenge of\nensuring the deadlock-freedom property for message-passing processes that\ncommunicate asynchronously in cyclic process networks governed by session\ntypes. We offer a gradual presentation of three typed process frameworks and\noutline how they may be used to guarantee deadlock freedom for a concurrent\nfunctional language with sessions.\n",
