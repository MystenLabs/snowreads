  "abstract": "  In this work, we make use of Lie algebraic methods to obtain the time\nevolution operator for an optomechanical system with linear and quadratic\ncouplings between the field and the mechanical oscillator. Firstly, we consider\nthe case of a non-driven system and find its exact time evolution operator,\nsecondly we consider the case of a forced system whose time evolution operator\nis obtained in an approximate form. We confront our analytical results with a\nnumerical simulation and find a good agreement between them.\n",
