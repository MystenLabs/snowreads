Using a novel carbon intensity model and structural\ndecomposition approach, it assesses the operational decarbonization progress\nover the past two decades. Results show significant decarbonization, with China\nand India collectively reducing 1498.3 and 399.7 MtCO2, respectively.\nElectrification notably contributed to decarbonizing space cooling and\nappliances in both countries.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2btRx_pNlQtQv_USKY1htcQH97AJk6r0KU40r8W5opw","pdfSize":"840986"}
