The key idea of SBMs is to partition the vertices of the\ngraph into blocks with similar edge densities within, as well as between\ndifferent blocks. However, what if we are given not one but multiple graphs\nthat are unaligned and of different sizes? How can we find out if these graphs\nshare blocks with similar connectivity structures? In this paper, we propose\nthe shared stochastic block modeling (SSBM) problem, in which we model $n$\ngraphs using SBMs that share parameters of $s$ blocks. We show that fitting an\nSSBM is NP-hard, and consider two approaches to fit good models in practice. In\nthe first, we directly maximize the likelihood of the shared model using a\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. In the second, we first fit an SBM for each\ngraph and then select which blocks to share. We propose an integer linear\nprogram to find the optimal shared blocks and to scale to large numbers of\nblocks, we propose a fast greedy algorithm. Through extensive empirical\nevaluation on synthetic and real-world data, we show that our methods work well\nin practice.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xmfRi8fct3IgBnZeRW1UKAlpQcmEtGFz44mlHUflyTQ","pdfSize":"447274"}
