However, the scale ambiguity problem presents a critical barrier to\neffective monocular visual odometry. In this paper, we present CodedVO, a novel\nmonocular visual odometry method that overcomes the scale ambiguity problem by\nemploying custom optics to physically encode metric depth information into\nimagery. By incorporating this information into our odometry pipeline, we\nachieve state-of-the-art performance in monocular visual odometry with a known\nscale. We evaluate our method in diverse indoor environments and demonstrate\nits robustness and adaptability. We achieve a 0.08m average trajectory error in\nodometry evaluation on the ICL-NUIM indoor odometry dataset.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5wimDX0t-o_kzYfCH-Hpi6qPuRLh8sXkzeEmqNqFyDs","pdfSize":"5968833"}
