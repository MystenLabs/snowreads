The constructed $(T,P_M)$ phase diagrams (M = Mg or Na)\nindicate that these layered metal borocarbides can be hole-doped via thermal\ndeintercalation that has been successfully used in previous experiments to\nproduce Li$_y$BC ($y=1>x\\gtrsim0.5$) samples. The relatively low temperature\nthreshold required to trigger NaBC desodiation may help prevent the formation\nof defects shown recently to be detrimental to the electron-phonon coupling in\nthe delithiated LiBC analog. According to our numerical solutions of the\nanisotropic full-bandwidth Migdal-Eliashberg equations, the proposed\nMg$_x$B$_2$C$_2$ and Na$_x$BC materials exhibit superconducting critical\ntemperatures between 43 K and 84 K. At the same time, we demonstrate that\nbuckling of defect-free honeycomb BC layers, favored in heavily-doped Na$_x$BC\ncompounds, can substantially reduce or effectively suppress the materials'\npotential for MgB$_2$-type superconductivity.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vAxrnUn4eGR4k1cGOGZYxMfOClGH9fqTwlt7lQmfMk0","pdfSize":"9041520"}
