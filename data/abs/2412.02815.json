From another perspective, the systems\noperating in the near-field in both indoor environment and outdoor environments\ncan support line-of-sight multiple input multiple output (MIMO) communications\nand be beneficial from the FR3 bands. In this paper, a novel method is proposed\nto measure the near-field parameters leveraging a recently developed reflection\nmodel where the near-field paths can be described by their image points. We\nshow that these image points can be accurately estimated via triangulation from\nmultiple measurements with a small number of antennas in each measurement, thus\naffording a low-cost procedure for near-field multi-path parameter extraction.\nA preliminary experimental apparatus is presented comprising 2 transmit and 2\nreceive antennas mounted on a linear track to measure the 2x2 MIMO channel at\nvarious displacements. The system uses a recently-developed wideband radio\nfrequency (RF) transceiver board with fast frequency switching, an FPGA for\nfast baseband processing, and a new parameter extraction method to recover\npaths and spherical characteristics from the multiple 2x2 measurements.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"udTHzwNoatSJ0eXlLWuNdGKc8zK4HiHQyKy3tzZXrLQ","pdfSize":"3823983"}
