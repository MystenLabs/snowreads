We then\ndescribe the coupling of the Standard Model to this quantum gravity theory and\nshow that the corresponding path integral is finite when the negative power of\nthe product of the edge lengths squared in the path-integral measure is chossen\nto be grater than 52,5. The implications of this result are discussed, which\ninclude a relationship between the effective action and a wavefunction of the\nuniverse, the existence of the non-perturbative effective action, the correct\nvalue of the cosmological constant and the natural appearence of the\nStarobinsky inflation.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2t2Hdp5DF7_surc3CGkSLj6Pa5awc7V8TRKEf6kIRGw","pdfSize":"517671"}
