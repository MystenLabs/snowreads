This paper introduces the RUle Mutation Classifier (RUMC), which\nrepresents a significant improvement over the Rule Aggregation ClassifiER\n(RACER). RUMC uses innovative rule mutation techniques based on evolutionary\nmethods to improve classification accuracy. In tests with forty datasets from\nOpenML and the UCI Machine Learning Repository, RUMC consistently outperformed\ntwenty other well-known classifiers, demonstrating its ability to uncover\nvaluable insights from complex data.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"5ivBTkOA98mgxTZS1nxLZ5_bS2wLrhUzXtWl-ke-UFg","pdfSize":"796842"}
