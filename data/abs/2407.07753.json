We introduce a method for extending smaller\nsplittings of quantum duadic codes to create larger, potentially degenerate\nquantum duadic codes. Furthermore, we present a technique for computing or\nbounding the minimum distances of quantum codes constructed through this\napproach. Additionally, we introduce quantum CSS triadic codes, a family of\nquantum codes with a rate of at least $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UWpaOrnymxCt3aZtx9Du8wXrBMJdLoih_VTW38TFVoI","pdfSize":"624104"}
