{"id":"2412.15961","title":"Two-Part Interplanetary Type II Solar Radio Bursts","authors":"Silja Pohjolainen","authorsParsed":[["Pohjolainen","Silja",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Dec 2024 14:55:27 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-23","timestamp":1734706527000,"abstract":"  Two similar-looking, two-part interplanetary type II burst events from 2003\nand 2012 are reported and analysed. The 2012 event was observed from three\ndifferent viewing angles, enabling comparisons between the spacecraft data. In\nthese two events, a diffuse wide-band type II radio burst was followed by a\ntype II burst that showed emission at the fundamental and harmonic (F-H) plasma\nfrequencies, and these emission bands were also slightly curved in their\nfrequency-time evolution. Both events were associated with high-speed,\nhalo-type coronal mass ejections (CMEs). In both events, the diffuse type II\nburst was most probably created by a bow shock at the leading front of the CME.\nHowever, for the later-appearing F-H type II burst there are at least two\npossible explanations. In the 2003 event there is evidence of CME interaction\nwith a streamer, with a possible shift from a bow shock to a CME flank shock.\nIn the 2012 event a separate white-light shock front was observed at lower\nheights, and it could have acted as the driver of the F-H type II burst. There\nis also some speculation on the existence of two separate CMEs, launched from\nthe same active region, close in time. The reason for the diffuse type II burst\nbeing visible only from one viewing direction (STEREO-A), and the ending of the\ndiffuse emission before the F-H type II burst appears, still need explanations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"25hcquQb5b6sCnRMwyD31yTz9XJgZs5Ig4RgG0vBTC8","pdfSize":"2189805"}
