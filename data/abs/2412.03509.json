The supernova\n(SN) shockwave propagating through this environment forms a shock-swept dense\nshell that interacts with the surrounding circumstellar material (CSM),\ngenerating secondary shocks that energise the ejecta and may power the SN\nduring the nebular phase. In the present work, we investigate the nebular\nspectrum of SN 2023ixf, observed one-year post-explosion (at +363 d) with the\nrecently commissioned WEAVE instrument on the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope.\nThis marks the first supernova spectrum captured with WEAVE. In this spectrum,\nH$\\alpha$ exhibits a peculiar evolution, flanked by blueward and redward broad\ncomponents centred at $\\sim\\pm 5650\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$, features that have\nbeen observed in only a few SNe as early as one-year post-explosion. These\nfeatures may indicate energy deposition from shock generated by the interaction\nof shock-swept dense shell with CSM expelled a few hundred years prior to the\nexplosion. Comparisons of the +363 d spectrum with model spectra from the\nliterature suggest a shock power of at least $\\sim5 \\times 10\n^{40}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s^{-1}}$ at this epoch. Additionally, analysis of the [O I]\ndoublet and other emission lines helped to constrain the oxygen mass ($\\lesssim\n0.07-0.30 M_\\odot$), He-core mass ($\\lesssim 3 M_\\odot$), and zero-age main\nsequence mass ($\\lesssim 12 M_\\odot$) for SN~2023ixf. The comparison with other\nType II SNe highlights SN 2023ixf's unique shock interaction signatures and\nevidence of dust formation, setting it apart in terms of evolution and\ndynamics.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3fHAPt1fGT8F4r4oPn0CFKoB4ee9397hNAT8w6k2msw","pdfSize":"2205151"}
