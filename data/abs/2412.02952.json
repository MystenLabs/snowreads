The novelty is to assume that the colonization\nand extinction rates are positive almost periodic functions whereas our main\nresults show that the predominance of either colonization or extinction forces\nof a specific species is equivalent to the property of exponential dichotomy of\na scalar linear differential equation. By using well known results of\nexponential dichotomy theory, we carry out a recursive and exhaustive\ndescription of persistence/extinction scenarios. In addition, we start a\npreliminary discussion describing a more elusive behavior when the colonization\nand extinction forces are similar in average.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Oo-7p9P6ZidIIMflDHUA3fYqTLUiC6pZ2TgxL_3qMAE","pdfSize":"516034"}
