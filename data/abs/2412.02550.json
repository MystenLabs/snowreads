The representation is a generalization of K. Bagi's work\nand is based upon the void-cell approach of M. Satake. The general\nrepresentation applies to a material region partitioned into polygonal\nsubregions. This representation possesses a certain consistency that allows for\na unique assignment of the contribution that each contact displacement makes to\nthe average deformation of an assembly. The paper addresses construction of the\nparticle graph and appropriate data structures for use with the Discrete\nElement Method. The approach is applied in a numerical simulation of a\ntwo-dimensional assembly of disks. The author presents results of the\ndistributions of deformation and particle-group rotation, with a resolution of\nabout a single particle diameter. Deformation was very nonuniform, even at low\nstrains. Micro-bands, thin linear zones of intense rotation, were also\nobserved.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BD8_4crgKegOYWR8TNgovCGzQ0dQW4Uf-FFiepZDAGg","pdfSize":"476878"}
