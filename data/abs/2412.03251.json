  "abstract": "  We present a sequent calculus for first-order logic with lambda terms and\ndefinite descriptions. The theory formalised by this calculus is essentially\nRussellian, but avoids some of its well known drawbacks and treats definite\ndescription as genuine terms. A constructive proof of the cut elimination\ntheorem and a Henkin-style proof of completeness are the main results of this\ncontribution.\n",
