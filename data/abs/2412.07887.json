  "abstract": "  The beta-modification of FeSe, which has an anti-PbO type structure, achieves\nsuperconductivity at 8 K without external doping or pressure and exhibits a\nnematic phase, which has been crucial for studies of unconventional pairing\nmechanisms. Although the critical temperature (Tc) in FeSe increases\nsignificantly with applied pressure, intercalation, and in thin films, the\neffect of replacing selenium with sulfur in FeSe1-xSx has remained unclear. To\ninvestigate the effects of chemical pressure, we have synthesized FeSe1-xSx\ncrystals (up to x = 0.52) and intercalated them with tetramethylammonium ions\n(TMA+). Our results show that both Tc and unit cell volume decrease linearly\nwith sulfur content in both host and intercalated (TMA)yFe2(Se1-xSx)2. The\nunexpected common rate of normalized decrease of Tc suggests that chemical\npressure affects the electron-doped intercalates in the same way as the host\ncompounds. This result highlights the unique role of chemical pressure and\nelectron doping in tuning superconductivity in FeSe systems and provides new\ninsights into their complex behavior.\n",
