In the traditional approach, each prisoner may need to open up\nto half of the drawers. We show that this strategy is sub-optimal. Remarkably,\na single swap allows all $n$ prisoners to find their number by opening only\n$\\frac{n \\ln \\ln n}{\\ln n} (1 + o(1))$ drawers in the worst case. We show that\nno strategy can do better than that by a factor larger than two. Efficiently\nconstructing such a strategy is harder, but we provide an explicit efficient\nstrategy that requires opening only $O(\\frac{n \\log \\log n}{\\log n})$ drawers\nby each prisoner in the worst case.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LbCYVECcyP2r_jXWpCnu4nRiDMOns0wzwViNoz9s4Io","pdfSize":"215232"}
