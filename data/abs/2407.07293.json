How\nshould the decision rule be designed if agents are known to be biased in favor\nof one of the options? We address this question by considering the Condorcet\nJury Setting as a mechanism design problem. Applications include the optimal\ndecision mechanisms for boards of directors, political committees, and trial\njuries.\n  While we allow for any kind of mechanism, the optimal mechanism is a voting\nmechanism. In the terminology of the trial jury example: When jurors (agents)\nare more eager to convict than the lawmaker (principal), then the defendant\nshould be convicted if and only if neither too many nor too few jurors vote to\nconvict.\n  This kind of mechanism accords with a judicial procedure from ancient Jewish\nlaw.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kxAb5QqH3-DEFGaR327GnZUWm5Rae5565liSBC1mMKI","pdfSize":"269763"}
