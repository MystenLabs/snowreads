  "abstract": "  In this paper, we study a certain type of noisy tug-of-war game which can be\nregarded as an interpretation of a certain type of boundary value problem for\nthe normalized $p$-Laplace equation, where $1<p<\\infty$. More precisely, we\nwill investigate the boundary regularity of the value function to the game and\nits convergence to a viscosity solution of the model problem.\n",
