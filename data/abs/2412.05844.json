We first validate the efficiency of the utilized interaction by\ncomparing the theoretical low-lying energy spectra, the kinematic moment of\ninertia, and reduced transition probabilities with the experimental data for\nboth the parent and grand-daughter nuclei $^{78}$Kr and $^{78}$Se,\nrespectively. Additionally, we examine the shell-model level densities of the\n$1^+$ states in the intermediate nucleus $^{78}$Br, comparing them with the\npredictions from the Back-shifted Fermi gas model. We analyze the variation of\ncumulative nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) for the $2\\nu$ECEC process in\n$^{78}$Kr as a function of $1^+$ state energies in the intermediate nucleus\n$^{78}$Br up to the saturation level. Our estimated half-life for $^{78}$Kr,\nextracted from the shell-model predicted NMEs, shows good agreement with the\nexperimental value. The Gamow-Teller transitions from the lowest $1^+$ state of\n$^{78}$Br via both the EC$+\\beta^+$ and $\\beta^-$-channels are also discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-d1aWINaeSwnZEADdO3_eSvPHGvji_mNbFeZthXQCNI","pdfSize":"475013"}
