The special\ncase of the aforementioned result for positive-definite quadratic forms is\nknown as Williamson's theorem. In this work, we establish necessary and\nsufficient conditions on positive semi-definite quadratic forms on a symplectic\nspace to be simultaneously reduced to their normal forms in a common symplectic\nbasis. In particular, we establish conditions on 2n x 2n real symmetric\npositive-definite matrices to be simultaneously diagonalizable by a symplectic\nmatrix in the sense of Williamson's theorem. We also discuss some applications\nof the main result in quantum information theory and statistical\nthermodynamics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GxnhjWinMkdgaSQ6GMshAmxQ5T0Q18cf-MIoMSKqHt4","pdfSize":"234116"}
