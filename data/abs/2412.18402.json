To do so, we define a Lipschitz fractional caloric capacity and\nstudy its critical dimension and the $L^2$-boundedness of a pair of singular\nintegral operators, whose kernels will be the gradient of the fundamental\nsolution of the fractional heat equation and its conjugate.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"k1YbN2yb9GgM5h_NTR7J8jiDXzBE-PdPi0ljlBRarYg","pdfSize":"975462"}
