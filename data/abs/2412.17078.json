Our results for the ground state energy\n$B_N$ and size $R_N$ improve previously known large-$N$ asymptotes and we\nbetter understand the crossover to the few-body regime. The oscillatory\nbreathing motion results from the quantum-mechanical breaking of the mean-field\nscaling symmetry. The breathing-mode frequency scales as $\\Omega\\propto\n|B_N|/\\sqrt{N}$ at large $N$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SqpBNGSadJSric3PAIO1fRtK7YvL33WPMBUWAHvYggw","pdfSize":"394373"}
