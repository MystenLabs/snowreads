However, existing\nmethods often rely on a single score function, which can limit their efficiency\nand informativeness. We propose a novel approach that combines multiple score\nfunctions to improve the performance of conformal predictors by identifying\noptimal weights that minimize prediction set size. Our theoretical analysis\nestablishes a connection between the weighted score functions and subgraph\nclasses of functions studied in Vapnik-Chervonenkis theory, providing a\nrigorous mathematical basis for understanding the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod. Experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms\nsingle-score conformal predictors while maintaining valid coverage, offering a\nprincipled and data-driven way to enhance the efficiency and practicality of\nconformal prediction in classification tasks.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ID_aJMFaOtz6vx5hj1oMUiWUBMTuZWZuhGuKLmxxKSw","pdfSize":"637656","objectId":"0x2b11c3d3330a5a78b62cf44e42bbbdc7b7ab3d52ef2b4736a254d35da2c4024e","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
