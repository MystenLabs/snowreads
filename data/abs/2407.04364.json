This novel multiscale method is specifically designed to\novercome problems related to pollution effect, high-contrast coefficients, and\nthe loss of hermiticity of operators. We establish the inf-sup stability and\ngive an a priori error estimate for this method under a number of established\nassumptions and resolution conditions. The theoretical results are validated by\na set of numerical tests, which further show that the multiscale technique can\neffectively capture pertinent physical phenomena.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"sDh6Opees_bLpWAD9CTnrDSDgme9GZSGl_WiO18jSQU","pdfSize":"764040"}
