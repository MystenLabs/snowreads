Different models are used.\nWe focus on the contribution to exclusive $q\\bar{q}$ dijets.\n  The results of our calculations are compared with the H1 and ZEUS data.\nExcept of one GTMD, our results are below the HERA data points. This is in\ncontrast with recent results where the normalization was adjusted to some\nselected distributions and no agreement with other observables was checked. We\nconclude that the calculated cross sections are only a small part of the\nmeasured ones which probably contain also processes with pomeron remnant,\nreggeon exchange, etc.\n  We present also azimuthal correlations between the sum and the difference of\ndijet transverse momenta. The cuts on transverse momenta of jets generate\nazimuthal correlations (in this angle) which can be easily misinterpreted as\ndue to so-called elliptic GTMD.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rqR_Nj17jF0Qhek-_ugtrMS9iaM_6msrtiH8YWOJ5Ec","pdfSize":"168944"}
