We obtain the cardinality, the M\\\"obius function, the\nrank numbers, the antipode, and the number of maximal chains. Generalizing work\nof Stanley, we give an edge labeling such that the labels of the maximal chains\nare exactly the d-parking functions. We also introduce two classes of labeled\ntrees: the first class is in bijective correspondence with the noncrossing\npartitions in NC^d_n and the second class is in bijective correspondence with\nthe maximal chains.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gDWx_UYyMjI3q-DeuDPeJBqVVCEMIsYovUgf4IpZcbY","pdfSize":"383673","objectId":"0x361a6fa687cdbda15c34a4a4fc2a0dc62a08d19eeb533150c6795e31682b58b4","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
