As part of this investigation, the nominal classifications of\nstandards and items specifications were used to examine construct equivalence.\nIn the current paper, we determine the strength of empirical support for the\nsemantic distinctiveness of these classifications, which are known as \"domains\"\nfor Common Core standards, and \"strands\" for National Assessment of Educational\nProgress (NAEP) item specifications. This is accomplished by separate k-means\nclustering for standards and specifications of their corresponding embedding\nvectors. We then briefly illustrate an application of these findings.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computers and Society","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"1N9ON-YMXMlUQsaQwhPLh4ZbbiS2Cxn6HZPluHZrmzs","pdfSize":"114032"}
