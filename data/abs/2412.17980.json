The\n$\\sim$30-hour integration represents one of the longest exposures yet taken on\na single pointing with the ACA 7-m. The low-resolution ACA data\n($21.0''\\,{\\times}\\,12.2''$) reveal a 75% excess CO(4-3) flux compared to the\nsum of individual sources detected in higher-resolution Atacama Large\nMillimeter Array (ALMA) data ($1.0''\\,{\\times}\\,0.8''$). Our work also reveals\na similar result by tapering the ALMA data to $10''$. In contrast, the 3.2mm\ndust continuum shows little discrepancy between ACA and ALMA. A single-dish\n[CII] spectrum obtained by APEX/FLASH supports the ACA CO(4-3) result,\nrevealing a large excess in [CII] emission relative to ALMA. The missing flux\nis unlikely due to undetected faint sources but instead suggests that\nhigh-resolution ALMA observations might miss extended and\nlow-surface-brightness gas. Such emission could originate from the\ncircum-galactic medium (CGM) or the pre-heated proto-intracluster medium\n(proto-ICM). If this molecular gas reservoir replenishes the star formation\nfuel, the overall depletion timescale will exceed 400Myr, reducing the\nrequirement for the simultaneous SMG activity in SPT2349$-$56. Our results\nhighlight the role of an extended gas reservoir in sustaining a high star\nformation rate (SFR) in SPT2349$-$56, and potentially establishing the ICM\nduring the transition phase to a mature cluster.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"H2sqSJ0cLhB967xP_hwIbt2jrvl7SgXQkwY33Edu-YU","pdfSize":"774882"}
