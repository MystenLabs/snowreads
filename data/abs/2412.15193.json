Here we demonstrate the difference-frequency\nconversion from 606 nm to 1552 nm of microsecond-long weak coherent pulses at\nthe single photon level compatible with Pr$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5\\,$ quantum\nmemories, with high-signal to noise ratio. We use a single step difference\nfrequency generation process with a continuous-wave pump at 994 nm in a\nMgO:ppLN-waveguide and ultra-narrow spectral filtering down to a bandwidth of\n12.5 MHz. With this setup, we achieve the conversion of weak coherent pulses of\nduration up to 13.6 $\\mu s$ with a device efficiency of about 25% and a\nsignal-to-noise ratio >460 for 10 $\\mu s$-long pulses containing one photon on\naverage. This signal-to-noise ratio is large enough to enable a high-fidelity\nconversion of qubits emitted from an emissive quantum memory based on\nPr$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5\\,$ and to realize an interface with quantum processing\nnodes based on narrow-linewidth cavity-enhanced trapped ions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iVnfht2gRvwaJ0GN-7MEgmWwVGWkNaH0GwCcoychGz4","pdfSize":"1798939"}
