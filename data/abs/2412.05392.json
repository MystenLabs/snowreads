The effect of an\nelectric field ranging from 0 to 6 kV/cm applied to the GaAs/AlGaAs QW\nstructure in the growth direction is studied for several QWs of various widths\nup to 100 nm. The three-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger equation (SE) of exciton is\nnumerically solved using the finite difference method. Wave functions and\nenergies for several states of the heavy-hole and light-hole excitons are\ncalculated. Dependencies of the exciton state energy, the binding energy, the\nradiative broadening, and the static dipole moment on the applied electric\nfields are determined. The threshold of exciton dissociation for the 100-nm QW\nis also determined. In addition, we found the electric-field-induced shift of\nthe center of mass of the heavy-hole and light-hole exciton in the QWs.\nFinally, we have modeled reflection spectra of heterostructures with the\nGaAs/AlGaAs QWs in the electric field using the calculated energies and\nradiative broadenings of excitons.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Z7v0zFjMZ-jvmTNezoPmdaMJZE3G1MO-7fNP_zcbG10","pdfSize":"3006479"}
