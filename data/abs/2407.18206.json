We propose a finite sample Bayesian decision rule and a finite sample\nmaximum likelihood decision rule. We show that in finite samples from 2 to 50,\nit is possible for these rules to achieve better performance according to\nestablished maximin and maximum regret criteria than a rule based on the\nBoole-Frechet-Hoeffding bounds. We also propose a finite sample maximum\nlikelihood criterion. We apply our rules and criterion to an actual clinical\ntrial that yielded a promising estimate of efficacy, and our results point to\nsafety as a reason for why results were mixed in subsequent trials.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zMHIlZQJGKj-hyzgDR_DMj8_hlcp2QE9sjDjKzRcdvU","pdfSize":"851129","objectId":"0x9db62e1233a290bc4688299bec3f8b75337291138c0daf2fa2e9608427093112","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
