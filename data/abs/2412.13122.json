  "abstract": "  We propose a novel Fr\\'echet sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) method\nbased on kernel distance covariance, tailored for metric space-valued responses\nsuch as count data, probability densities, and other complex structures. The\nmethod leverages a kernel-based transformation to map metric space-valued\nresponses into a feature space, enabling efficient dimension reduction. By\nincorporating kernel distance covariance, the proposed approach offers enhanced\nflexibility and adaptability for datasets with diverse and non-Euclidean\ncharacteristics. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through\nsynthetic simulations and several real-world applications. In all cases, the\nproposed method runs faster and consistently outperforms the existing Fr\\'echet\nSDR approaches, demonstrating its broad applicability and robustness in\naddressing complex data challenges.\n",
