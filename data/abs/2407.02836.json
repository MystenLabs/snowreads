Specializing to geometric inclusions, we\ncharacterize subtriposes of an arrow tripos in terms of nuclei on the\nunderlying arrow algebra, recovering a classical locale-theoretic result. As an\nexample of application, we lift modified realizability to the setting of arrow\nalgebras, and we establish its functoriality.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Category Theory","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"I2vlBr0gy-9uS7VzW4maKT_4Bu4N7P1onckQgz3CFsI","pdfSize":"513373","objectId":"0x0e7f5b40aa2d95d1be99f78fdd403d31ff5ff79caf5f2bc4a5b814432d41ce08","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
