Despite extensive studies on the\nconvergence of FCM and FGCM, the convergence behavior of FGGCM under sigmoid\nactivation functions remains underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by\nderiving sufficient conditions for the convergence of FGGCM to a unique fixed\npoint.\n  Using the Banach and Browder-Gohde-Kirk fixed point theorems, and\nCauchy-Schwarz inequality, the study establishes conditions for the kernels and\ngreyness of FGGCM to converge to unique fixed points. A Web Experience FCM is\nadapted to design an FGGCM with weights modified to GGN. Comparisons with\nexisting FCM and FGCM convergence theorems confirm that they are special cases\nof the theorems proposed here.\n  The conclusions support the application of FGGCM in domains such as control,\nprediction, and decision support systems.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computer Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"47WvXS5Y7K2d7eQQr4iW1nYwzmUDOGPcLloJ0xXUU_8","pdfSize":"1076194"}
