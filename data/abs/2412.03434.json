BIMCaP refines sensor poses by leveraging a 3D BIM and employing a\nbundle adjustment technique to align real-world measurements with the model.\nExperiments using real-world open-access data show that BIMCaP achieves\nsuperior accuracy, reducing translational error by over 4 cm compared to\ncurrent state-of-the-art methods. This advancement enhances the accuracy and\ncost-effectiveness of 3D mapping methodologies like SLAM. BIMCaP's improvements\nbenefit various fields, including construction site management and emergency\nresponse, by providing up-to-date, aligned digital maps for better\ndecision-making and productivity.
