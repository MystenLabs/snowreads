We study the relation between open parameters and tempered\nparameters and Arthur parameters and generic representations. We state a\ngenericity conjecture for ABV-packets and prove this conjecture for quasi-split\nclassical groups and their pure inner forms. Motivated by this we study\nABV-packets for open parameters and prove that they are L-packets, and further\nthat the function from the packet to the fundamental group given by normalized\nvanishing cycles coincides with the one given by the Langlands correspondence.\nFrom this conclude Vogan's conjecture on A-packets for tempered\nrepresentations: ABV-packets for tempered parameters are Arthur packets and the\nfunction from the packet to the fundamental group given by normalized vanishing\ncycles coincides with the one given by Arthur.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pFoKmF1_PlqgBW7qj0rcv4Kfl8DlukD4EKYix8jzcK4","pdfSize":"490330"}
