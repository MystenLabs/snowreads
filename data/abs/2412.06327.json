The output feedback control was developed by\nbounding the solution and its time derivative for both the infinite-dimensional\nsystem and the nonlinear ODE, and leveraging these bounds to ensure the\nboundedness of the control coefficient and error dynamics perturbations. The\nmathematical framework demonstrates the controller's ability to manage two\noutput types within the system, overcoming model uncertainties and\nheterogeneities using minimal system information and a continuous control\nsignal. A case study addressing induced seismicity mitigation while ensuring\nenergy production in the Groningen gas reservoir highlights the control's\neffectiveness. The strategy guarantees precise tracking of target seismicity\nrates and pressures across reservoir regions, even under parameter\nuncertainties. Numerical simulations validate the approach in two scenarios:\ngas extraction with minimal seismicity and the addition of CO$_2$ injections\nachieving net-zero environmental impact.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computer Science/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"AvD01XZeM5Hj5HYghXZz4sgcoRLWd_FSVCTeGEVPNHk","pdfSize":"3185844"}
