This is the solution for\nsemantic segmentation problem in both real-world and synthetic images from a\nvehicle s forward-facing camera. We concentrate in building a robust model\nwhich performs well across various domains of different outdoor situations such\nas sunny, snowy, rainy, etc. In particular, our method is developed with two\nmain directions: model development and domain adaptation. In model development,\nwe use the High Resolution Network (HRNet) as the baseline. Then, this baseline\ns result is processed by two coarse-to-fine models: Object-Contextual\nRepresentations (OCR) and Hierarchical Multi-scale Attention (HMA) to get the\nbetter robust feature. For domain adaption, we implement the Domain-Based Batch\nNormalization (DNB) to reduce the distribution shift from diverse domains. Our\nproposed method yield 81.259 mean intersection-over-union (mIoU) in validation\nset. This paper studies the effectiveness of employing real-world and synthetic\ndata to handle the domain adaptation in semantic segmentation problem.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wrLTsFUCi7vjC4N2mxWQ6sbewDN4Da67WCFOE5mrHgg","pdfSize":"2566010"}
