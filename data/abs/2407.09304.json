Here, we introduce a {\\it quantum-probing}\napproach to the quest of deriving metrological upper bounds on the free\nparameters of such empirical models. To illustrate our approach, we consider an\nextended quantum Ising chain whose elements are -- either individually or\ncollectively -- affected by a mechanism responsible for spontaneous collapse.\nWe explore configurations involving out-of-equilibrium states of the chain,\nwhich allows us to infer information about the collapse mechanism before it is\ncompletely scrambled from the state of the system. Moreover, we investigate\npotential amplification effects on the probing performance based on the\nexploitation of quantum criticality.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"92vGfQVUg33PO-1b4azhQnai1CLUmKyNZZscBVEDFdk","pdfSize":"1104610","objectId":"0x18acbaf42c057baa3684e19a25063d50bd511ddbaf805270e9a7ed17c25c905c","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
