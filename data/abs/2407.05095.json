It is called a $C$-pseudo-cone if $C$ is its recession cone, where $C$ is a\npointed closed convex cone with interior points. The cone-volume measure of a\npseudo-cone can be defined similarly as for convex bodies, but it may be\ninfinite. After proving a necessary condition for cone-volume measures of\n$C$-pseudo-cones, we introduce suitable weights for cone-volume measures,\nyielding finite measures. Then we provide a necessary and sufficient condition\nfor a Borel measure on the unit sphere to be the weighted cone-volume measure\nof some $C$-pseudo-cone.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dhxdwbknCB8YxQsIdmz0DH__DMrbI2SKhB2_TZedm0Q","pdfSize":"195704"}
