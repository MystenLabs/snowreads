ACMPTCP addresses the limitations of conventional MPTCP by\nleveraging deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for agile end-to-end path\nmanagement and optimal bandwidth allocation, facilitating path realignment\nacross diverse network environments.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"W5s7XSioc8cs3d3Bnf4F-GHdo2GQL8Q3TAqKpRUBEiU","pdfSize":"986633"}
