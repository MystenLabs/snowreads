In contrast to the Earth, the high temperature of the\nSun suppresses the fraction of millicharged particles that are bound to nuclei,\nallowing for potentially high annihilation rates. We recast existing\nconstraints from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory and use this information to\nplace new limits on the fraction of the dark matter that is millicharged. This\nanalysis excludes previously unexplored parameter space for masses of $m_\\chi\n\\sim (5-100) \\ \\text{GeV}$, charges of $q_\\chi \\sim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}$, and\nfractional abundances as small as $f_{_\\text{DM}} \\sim 10^{-5}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"z92XAaDWJNDwIF4pah6aMTKRfLNt57NfEwK05je0BEk","pdfSize":"792267"}
