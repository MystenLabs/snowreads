How robust is the\ninformation to changes in cell parameters? We use a mapping between the\nstochastic dynamics of two cells sharing a stimulatory molecule, and parameters\nakin to an extension of Landau's equilibrium phase transition theory. We show\nthat different single-cell dynamics lead to the same dynamical response -- a\nflexibility that cells can use. The companion equilibrium Landau model behaves\nsimilarly, thereby describing the dynamics of information in a broad class of\nmodels with coupled order parameters.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Quantitative Biology/Molecular Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7YIzfmpOMQcx-Tclo95qgKs7NrOgwy3wTdDkkjCppkk","pdfSize":"1017923"}
