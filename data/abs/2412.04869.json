Using molecular dynamics\nsimulations based on effective Hamiltonians, we investigate the thermal\nstability of antiskyrmion nanodomains in rhombohedral barium titanate. At 1 K,\nantiskyrmions with a topological charge of -2 emerge as the most stable\nnanodomain state across all examined diameters. In our systematic study, the\nmost robust antiskyrmion was found to have a diameter of 4 nm, maintaining its\noriginal size, shape, and topological charge up to the characteristic\ntemperature T* ~ 85 K. Domains with diameters between 2.8 and approximately 4.5\nnm exhibit fragmentation into six topological defects, termed quarks, each\ncarrying a fractional skyrmion charge of -1/3. For domains larger than 4.5 nm,\neach topological quark splits into two pre-quarks, each with a charge of -1/6.\nThese larger nanodomains demonstrate increased mobility and a growing tendency\nfor shape and skyrmion charge fluctuations. Above the T* temperature, all\nlarger nanodomains gradually shrink to a diameter of about 4 nm before\ncollapsing into a single-domain state. These findings reveal the relatively\nhigh stability of antiskyrmions over a broad temperature range, even in the\nabsence of a stabilizing bias field, and emphasize the pivotal role of\ntopological quark dynamics. This establishes barium titanate as a key platform\nfor exploring and applying topological phenomena.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"I2lMYG1bPigaoHepS7m05JqCbSh0DV6otDF98onvnmI","pdfSize":"877475"}
