In this work, we propose a new\napproach to study cosmological signatures of neutrino seesaw through the\ninteraction between inflaton and right-handed neutrinos. After inflation the\ninflaton predominantly decays into right-handed neutrinos and its decay rate is\nmodulated by the fluctuations of Higgs field which act as the source of\ncurvature perturbations. We demonstrate that this modulation produces\nprimordial non-Gaussian signatures, which can be measured by the forthcoming\nlarge-scale structure surveys. We find that these surveys have the potential to\nprobe a large portion of the neutrino seesaw parameter space, opening up a new\nwindow for testing the high scale seesaw mechanism.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vGGIzjGBKcrp2zLBXQVerUga9OWSq0xS97sj1lb7vHQ","pdfSize":"1736616"}
