We provide\nexplicit bounds on the stability of optimal transport potentials and maps,\nwhich are relevant for both theoretical and practical applications. Our results\napply to a wide range of costs, including all Wasserstein distances with power\ncost exponent strictly larger than $1$ and leverage mostly assumptions on the\nsource measure, such as log-concavity and bounded support. Our work provides a\nsignificant step forward in the understanding of stability of optimal transport\nproblems, as previous results where mostly limited to the case of the quadratic\ncost.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"fDzImlF4JR7XsboYK68c5B50qgjDl1012wUC4-Pl8Pg","pdfSize":"385921"}
