  "abstract": "  We characterize the Leray--Hopf solutions of the 2D inhomogeneous\nNavier--Stokes system that become strong for positive times. This\ncharacterization relies on the strong energy inequality and the regularity\nproperties of the pressure. As an application, we establish a weak-strong\nuniqueness result and provide a unified framework for several recent advances\nin the field.\n",
