We propose\ncreating a robotic intrusion prevention system (RIPS) that follows a novel\napproach to detect and mitigate intrusions in cognitive social robot systems\nand other cyber-physical systems. The RIPS detects threats at the robotic\ncommunication level and enables mitigation of the cyber-physical threats by\nusing System Modes to define what part of the robotic system reduces or limits\nits functionality while the system is compromised. We demonstrate the validity\nof our approach by applying it to a cognitive architecture running in a real\nsocial robot that preserves the privacy and safety of humans while facing\nseveral cyber attack situations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"9lHjB635wwW95p-56puH3IzGEsInTXXnoTm1365_Eyo","pdfSize":"9258574"}
