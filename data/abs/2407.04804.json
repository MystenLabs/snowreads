In such settings, it is often desirable to\nproduce a diverse solution set that is fairly distributed with respect to these\nattributes. Motivated by this, we initiate the study of Fair Submodular Cover\n(FSC), where given a ground set $U$, a monotone submodular function\n$f:2^U\\to\\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}$, a threshold $\\tau$, the goal is to find a\nbalanced subset of $S$ with minimum cardinality such that $f(S)\\ge\\tau$. We\nfirst introduce discrete algorithms for FSC that achieve a bicriteria\napproximation ratio of $(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}, 1-O(\\epsilon))$. We then present a\ncontinuous algorithm that achieves a $(\\ln\\frac{1}{\\epsilon},\n1-O(\\epsilon))$-bicriteria approximation ratio, which matches the best\napproximation guarantee of submodular cover without a fairness constraint.\nFinally, we complement our theoretical results with a number of empirical\nevaluations that demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on instances\nof maximum coverage.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bcaxjkrPaAsO3mIlv7Nj1lSnZ_jcA-5j0Qq_zheWSFU","pdfSize":"702331"}
