Among all\nthe available tools, CNNs have emerged as a preferred tool due to their\nsuperior classification accuracy and efficiency. Although the accuracy of CNNs\nis comparatively better but it can be improved by introducing some hybrid\nmodels by combining various machine learning and deep learning models.\nTherefore, in this paper, an ensemble learning technique is proposed for early\ndetection and management of DR with higher accuracy. The proposed model is\ntested on the APTOS dataset and it is showing supremacy on the validation\naccuracy ($99\\%)$ in comparison to the previous models. Hence, the model can be\nhelpful for early detection and treatment of the DR, thereby enhancing the\noverall quality of care for affected individuals.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uerNIyiyKbFeP9DReC8ij8Z9eyHs8n_l_KtmFGnu4WQ","pdfSize":"5920879","objectId":"0xa1be0e2c49d897210f9432384609e76eb2a5749677e4fae1f597bec7ec960260","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
