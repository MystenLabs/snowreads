In this paper, the detectability and\nresolvability of multiple quasi-normal modes using space-based gravitational\nwave detectors have been analyzed. The results indicate that TianQin and LISA\nhave the potential to detect and resolve a series of modes, including six\nfundamental modes, one overtone, and two nonlinear second-order modes.\nFurthermore, the analysis of systematic errors in the waveform suggests that\neven modes such as (3,3,1) and (4,3,0), which are unlikely to be directly\ndetected and resolved, need to be taken into account in the ringdown waveform\ntemplates.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FtwQvw8TXr-l9EgGf4YmJToInEhIAA9bLxw99xydueU","pdfSize":"1846434"}
