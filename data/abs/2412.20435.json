  "abstract": "  We show that the cohomological Brauer groups of the moduli stacks of stable\ngenus $g$ curves over the integers and an algebraic closure of the rational\nnumbers vanish for any $g\\geq 2$. For the $n$ marked version, we show the same\nvanishing result in the range $(g,n)=(1,n)$ with $1\\leq n \\leq 6$ and all\n$(g,n)$ with $g\\geq 4.$ We also discuss several finiteness results on\ncohomological Brauer groups of proper and smooth Deligne-Mumford stacks over\nthe integers.\n",
