We\npresent a numerical methodology for estimating the frequency fluctuations; the\nmethodology is based on the reference interaction site model self-consistent\nfield with constrained spatial electron density distribution, a the theoretical\nmodel of solvation fields based on classical statistic mechanics. By applying\nthe present theory to the C--N stretching vibrations of several nitrile\ncompounds, our estimated frequency fluctuation scale and bandwidth shift by\nchanging solvent kinds reproduced the experimental data. Further, we regard the\nstandard deviation of the electrostatic potential as the multiple random\nvariables for analyzing the frequency fluctuations. Our results reveal that the\ndominant fluctuation of the electrostatic field is almost parallel to the\nvibrational axis. Additionally, the fluctuations of electrostatic potential\nbecome spatially nonuniform as the solvents form stronger hydrogen bonds with\nthe solute. The development of the solvation field confirms that the\nnonuniformity of the electrostatic field is crucial to the frequency\nfluctuation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Hd0LWDq-HzoK6x25kdkd_68KGtD4BJAavnjTZXXgkWk","pdfSize":"406861"}
