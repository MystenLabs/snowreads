The model assumes the harmonic approximation of the\ninteractions. We provide bounds for the total number of phonons, and for the\nspecific heat, in terms of the average Wiener capacity, or resistance, of the\nnetwork. Thanks to such bounds, we can distinguish qualitatively different\nbehaviours in terms of the network structure alone.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"A0bUPjmkG6Dm1btJZp40J6WYsO7_qCSFbWWTfOmHy8U","pdfSize":"786135","objectId":"0xf8b0c4f567156caf7bbc6217b211c8ed50be01113b185e31f5b823a670c0ec2f","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
