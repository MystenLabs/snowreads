  "abstract": "  Three-loop electronic vacuum-polarization corrections due to irreducible\ndiagrams are evaluated for two-body muonic ions with nuclear charge numbers 1\n<= Z <= 6. The corrections are of order alpha^3 (Zalpha)^2 m_r, where alpha is\nthe fine-structure constant and m_r is the reduced mass. Numerically, the\nenergy corrections are found to be of the same order-of-magnitude as the\nlargest of the order alpha^2 (Zalpha)^6 m_r corrections, and are thus\nphenomenologically interesting. Our method of calculation eliminates numerical\nuncertainty encountered in other approaches.\n",
