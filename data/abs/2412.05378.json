Imposing some simplifying restrictions on\nthe matter, which amounts to considering nonlinear electromagnetic sources, we\nfind analytical expressions that allow one to design the type of sought\ngeometries. We illustrate our analysis with several examples, including an\nasymmetric, bounded black bounce spacetime which reproduces the standard\nReissner-Nordstrom geometry on the outside all the way down to the throat.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"52K5ThV5PFkPQq-MPznD-m-BTMhITMuL-JBWDk4HSl0","pdfSize":"534922"}
