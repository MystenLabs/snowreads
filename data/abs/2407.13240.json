To\nachieve integrity, procedures have been proposed allowing voters to verify\ntheir vote - however this impacts both the user experience and privacy.\nEspecially, vote verification can lead to vote-buying or coercion, if an\nattacker can obtain documentation, i.e. a receipt, of the cast vote. Thus, some\nvoting protocols go further and provide mechanisms to prevent such receipts. To\nbe effective, this so-called receipt-freeness depends on voters being able to\nunderstand and use these mechanisms. In this paper, we present a study with 300\nparticipants which aims to evaluate the voters' experience of the\nreceipt-freeness procedures in the e-voting protocol Selene in the context of\nvote-buying. This actually constitutes the first user study dealing with\nvote-buying in e-voting. While the usability and trust factors were rated low\nin the experiments, we found a positive correlation between trust and\nunderstanding.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WP6T8ibuiQW_dikg4dydOJI7ZJnlVVhKGWYAOALJ3B4","pdfSize":"240687"}
