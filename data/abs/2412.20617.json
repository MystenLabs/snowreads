  "abstract": "  In the realm of data analysis and bioinformatics, representing time series\ndata in a manner akin to biological sequences offers a novel approach to\nleverage sequence analysis techniques. Transforming time series signals into\nmolecular sequence-type representations allows us to enhance pattern\nrecognition by applying sophisticated sequence analysis techniques (e.g.\n$k$-mers based representation) developed in bioinformatics, uncovering hidden\npatterns and relationships in complex, non-linear time series data. This paper\nproposes a method to transform time series signals into biological/molecular\nsequence-type representations using a unique alphabetic mapping technique. By\ngenerating 26 ranges corresponding to the 26 letters of the English alphabet,\neach value within the time series is mapped to a specific character based on\nits range. This conversion facilitates the application of sequence analysis\nalgorithms, typically used in bioinformatics, to analyze time series data. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by converting real-world time\nseries signals into character sequences and performing sequence classification.\nThe resulting sequences can be utilized for various sequence-based analysis\ntechniques, offering a new perspective on time series data representation and\nanalysis.\n",
