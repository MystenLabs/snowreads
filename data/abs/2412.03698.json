We obtain $\\chi_{pp} (\\omega_m)$ as the ratio of the fully dressed\ndynamical pairing vertex $\\Phi (\\omega_m)$ and the bare $\\Phi_0 (\\omega_m)$\n(both infinitesimally small). For superconductivity out of a Fermi liquid, the\npairing susceptibility is positive above $T_c$, diverges at $T_c$, and becomes\nnegative below it. For superconductivity out of a non-Fermi liquid, the\nbehavior of $\\chi_{pp} (\\omega_m)$ is different in two aspects: (i) it diverges\nat the onset of pairing at $T=0$ only for a certain subclass of bare $\\Phi_0\n(\\omega_m)$ and remains non-singular for other $\\Phi_0 (\\omega_m)$, and (ii)\nbelow the instability, it becomes a non-unique function of a continuous\nparameter $\\phi$ for an arbitrary $\\Phi_0 (\\omega_m)$. The susceptibility is\nnegative in some range of $\\phi$ and diverges at the boundary of this range. We\nargue that this behavior of the susceptibility reflects a multi-critical nature\nof a superconducting transition in a quantum-critical metal when immediately\nbelow the instability an infinite number of superconducting states emerges\nsimultaneously with different amplitudes of the order parameter down to an\ninfinitesimally small one.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DQZYJ4gDwLhJS2CVzOAG5HBO4Ywi-okm3dKjjyqC0oY","pdfSize":"1710434"}
