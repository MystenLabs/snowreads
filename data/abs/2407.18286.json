One of\nthe theorems is the Weierstrass gap theorem that determines a sequence of $g$\nnumbers $1 < n_k < 2g$, $1 \\leq k \\leq g$ for which a meromorphic function with\nthe order with $n_k$ fails to exist at $P$. In this note, we give proof of the\nWeierstrass gap theorem in cohomology terminology. We see that an interesting\ncombinatorial problem may be formed as a byproduct from the statement of the\nWeierstrass gap theorem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"z29W80lWRD0J_v9e6acEZKFXmPf2gBat_MnAhH4N8ak","pdfSize":"126271"}
