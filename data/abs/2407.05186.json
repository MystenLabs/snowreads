This entertainment-oriented live streaming platform allows us to\nobserve the impact of technologies such as ``live-streaming'' and\n``streaming-chat'' on political communication. Despite its entertainment focus,\nTwitch hosts a variety of political actors, including politicians and pundits.\nThis study explores Twitch politics by addressing three main questions: 1) Who\nare the political Twitch streamers? 2) What content is covered in political\nstreams? 3) How do audiences of political streams interact with each other? To\nidentify political streamers, I leveraged the Twitch API and supervised\nmachine-learning techniques, identifying 574 political streamers. I used topic\nmodeling to analyze the content of political streams, revealing seven broad\ncategories of political topics and a unique pattern of communication involving\ncontext-specific ``emotes.'' Additionally, I created user-reference networks to\nexamine interaction patterns, finding that a small number of users dominate the\ncommunication network. This research contributes to our understanding of how\nnew social media technologies influence political communication, particularly\namong younger audiences.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"brlF_-uAXR_xfW4cQ2PwZvAaZRf9uam2xicC2W-OEDw","pdfSize":"1392559"}
