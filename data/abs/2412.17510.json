By employing multiple-precision\nlinear computation, convergence can be stabilized by reducing these round-off\nerrors. In this paper, we present the performance of our accelerated SpMV using\nSIMD instructions, demonstrating its effectiveness through various examples,\nincluding Krylov subspace methods.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Performance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uUOfdIyCFZVCahdPEdP35neUQwroPwJBmuh9Q7Faz-Y","pdfSize":"1140487"}
