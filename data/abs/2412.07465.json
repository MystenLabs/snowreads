  "abstract": "  Total variation (TV) regularization is a popular reconstruction method for\nill-posed imaging problems, and particularly useful for applications with\npiecewise constant targets. However, using TV for medical cone-beam computed\nX-ray tomography (CBCT) has been limited so far, mainly due to heavy\ncomputational loads at clinically relevant 3D resolutions and the difficulty in\nchoosing the regularization parameter. Here an efficient minimization algorithm\nis presented, combined with a dynamic parameter adjustment based on control\ntheory. The result is a fully automatic 3D reconstruction method running in\nclinically acceptable time. The input on top of projection data and system\ngeometry is desired degree of sparsity of the reconstruction. This can be\ndetermined from an atlas of CT scans, or alternatively used as an easily\nadjustable parameter with straightforward interpretation.\n",
