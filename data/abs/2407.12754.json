Our analysis focuses on the\nwidely-used cap-and-trade pollution regulation. Under this regulation, firms\nhave the flexibility to respond by implementing pollution abatement, reducing\noutput, and participating in emission trading, while a regulator dynamically\nallocates emission allowances to each firm. The resulting mean-field game is of\nlinear quadratic type and equivalent to a mean-field type control problem,\ni.e., it is a potential game. We find explicit solutions to this problem\nthrough the solutions to differential equations of Riccati type. Further, we\ninvestigate the carbon emission equilibrium price that satisfies the market\nclearing condition and find a specific form of FBSDE of McKean-Vlasov type with\ncommon noise. The solution to this equation provides an approximate equilibrium\nprice. Additionally, we demonstrate that the degree of competition is vital in\ndetermining the economic consequences of pollution regulation.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kirGISnLfmqTjiICxi2D_il5Hsj-tsOSEt2FG-xUnok","pdfSize":"1452283"}
