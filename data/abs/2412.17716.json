The magnetic field threading the ISF\nseen in the JCMT POL-2 map appears as a tale of three: pinched for OMC-1,\ntwisted for OMC-2, and nearly uniform for OMC-3. A multi-scale analysis shows\nthat the magnetic field structure in OMC-3 is very consistent at all the\nscales, whereas the field structure in OMC-2 shows no correlation across\ndifferent scales. In OMC-1, the field retains its mean orientation from large\nto small scales, but shows some deviations at small scales. Histograms of\nrelative orientations between the magnetic field and filaments reveal a bimodal\ndistribution for OMC-1, a relatively random distribution for OMC-2, and a\ndistribution with a predominant peak at 90$^\\circ$ for OMC-3. Furthermore, the\nmagnetic fields in OMC-1 and OMC-3 both appear to be aligned perpendicular to\nthe fibers, which are denser structures within the filament, but the field in\nOMC-2 is aligned along with the fibers. All these suggest that gravity,\nturbulence, and magnetic field are each playing a leading role in OMC-1, 2, and\n3, respectively. While OMC-2 and 3 have almost the same gas mass, density, and\nnon-thermal velocity dispersion, there are on average younger and fewer young\nstellar objects in OMC-3, providing evidence that a stronger magnetic field\nwill induce slower and less efficient star formation in molecular clouds.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"As7rim5VXapPhw9C1clpVLRMyIikNEFFLmNrbq3RLT0","pdfSize":"4320495"}
