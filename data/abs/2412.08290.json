These two arrangements are defined by the determinants of the\nVandermonde and the Moore matrix, respectively. These two matrices are\ntransformed to each other by replacing a natural number $n$ with $q^n$\n($q$-deformation).\n  In this paper, we introduce the notion of ``$q$-deformation of graphical\narrangements'' as certain subarrangements of the arrangement of all hyperplanes\nover $\\mathbb{F}_q$. This new class of arrangements extends the relationship\nbetween the Vandermonde and Moore matrices to graphical arrangements. We show\nthat many invariants of the ``$q$-deformation'' behave as ``$q$-deformation''\nof invariants of the graphical arrangements. Such invariants include the\ncharacteristic (chromatic) polynomial, the Stirling number of the second kind,\nfreeness, exponents, basis of logarithmic vector fields, etc.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ePXbVBV_ML9zuiYaIdYp7Ak2uvH6x_9FReWFmYdV5Mk","pdfSize":"217907"}
