{"id":"2412.03695","title":"Mixed 't Hooft Anomalies and the Witten Effect for AdS Black Holes","authors":"Matthew Heydeman, Chiara Toldo","authorsParsed":[["Heydeman","Matthew",""],["Toldo","Chiara",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2024 20:20:01 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-06","timestamp":1733343601000,"abstract":"  For a variety of BPS black holes in string theory, the supersymmetric index\nhas provided a microscopic validation of the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. In the\nnear-BPS limit, a gravitational path integral analysis previously revealed the\nsemiclassical spectrum is modified, having a large extremal degeneracy\n(consistent with the index) and a mass gap up to a continuum of non-BPS black\nholes. Presently, we study examples in which these sharp features of the\nspectrum are altered due to the presence of anomalies in the form of\n$\\vartheta$-angle terms in the action. These may appear generally, but we focus\non near-BPS dyonic AdS$_4$ black holes in M-theory, dual to 3d $\\mathcal{N}=2$\nSCFTs of Class $R$ obtained by twisted compactification of $N$ wrapped M5\nbranes. Due to the Witten effect, the dyonic black holes receive quantum\ncorrections to their charges, and when $\\vartheta = \\pi$ one may find a mixed\n`t Hooft anomaly between the $U(1)_R$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ time reversal\nsymmetries. Using results from $\\mathcal{N}=2$ JT supergravity, we find these\neffects result in a spectrum in which both the gap and index are reduced, and\nmay even vanish. Surprisingly, for $\\vartheta \\rightarrow \\pi$, neither the\nBekenstein-Hawking formula nor the index correctly account for the extremal\ndegeneracies.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3NhSD5knJ2yP4JGZ80d9gC5NXA4EGrZ9al_nZcKhuWg","pdfSize":"1681580"}
