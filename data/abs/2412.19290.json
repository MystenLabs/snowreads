  "abstract": "  We study Schr\\\"odinger operators $H:= -\\Delta + V$ with potentials $V$ that\nhave power-law growth (not necessarily polynomial) at 0 and at $\\infty$ using\nmethods of Lie theory (Lie-Rinehart algebras) and microlocal analysis. More\nprecisely, we show that $H$ is ''generated'' in a certain sense by an explicit\nLie-Rinehart algebra. This allows then to construct a suitable (microlocal)\ncalculus of pseudodifferential operators that provides further properties of\n$H$. Classically, this microlocal analysis method was used to study $H$ when\nthe power-laws describing the potential $V$ have integer exponents. Thus, the\nmain point of this paper is that this integrality condition on the exponents is\nnot really necessary for the microlocal analysis method to work. While we\nconsider potentials following (possibly non-integer) power-laws both at the\norigin and at infinity, our results extend right away to potentials having\npower-law singularities at several points. The extension of the classical\nmicrolocal analysis results to potentials with non-integer power-laws is\nachieved by considering the setting of Lie-Rinehart algebras and of the\ncontinuous family groupoids integrating them. (The classical case relies\ninstead on Lie algebroids and Lie groupoids.)\n",
