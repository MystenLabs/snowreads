In particular, we investigate the model's semi-metal (SM) to\nKekul{\\'e} Valence Bond Solid (KVBS) phase transition at zero and finite\ntemperatures as a function of phonon energy and interaction strength. Using\nhybrid Monte Carlo sampling methods we can simulate the model near the\nadiabatic regime, allowing us to access regions of parameter space relevant to\ngraphene. Our simulations suggest that the SM-KVBS transition is weakly\nfirst-order at all temperatures, with graphene situated close to the phase\nboundary in the SM region of the phase diagram. Our results highlight the\nimportant role bond-stretching phonon modes play in the formation of KVBS order\nin strained graphene-derived systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vDeFcdGgK1wjnLF8Swd_cuaH-JHCUQHbl34db66elMo","pdfSize":"1318916"}
