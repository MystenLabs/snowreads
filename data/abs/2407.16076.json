We propose PlayerTV, an innovative\nframework which harnesses state-of-the-art AI technologies for automatic player\ntracking and identification in soccer videos. By integrating object detection\nand tracking, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and color analysis, PlayerTV\nfacilitates the generation of player-specific highlight clips from extensive\ngame footage, significantly reducing the manual labor traditionally associated\nwith such tasks. Preliminary results from the evaluation of our core pipeline,\ntested on a dataset from the Norwegian Eliteserien league, indicate that\nPlayerTV can accurately and efficiently identify teams and players, and our\ninteractive Graphical User Interface (GUI) serves as a user-friendly\napplication wrapping this functionality for streamlined use.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XC98e0agJY_mAL85XA1t2qUlRuhS2QkLgz67Q7DU_Qk","pdfSize":"3262828"}
