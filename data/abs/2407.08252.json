Our method also benefits\nfrom having a significantly smaller number of learnable parameters compared to\ndata-driven spatially-variant BISR methods. Concretely, each pixel's\ndegradation kernel is expressed as a linear combination of a learnable\ndictionary composed of a small number of spatially-variant atom kernels. The\ncoefficient matrices of the atom degradation kernels are derived using\nmembership functions of fuzzy set theory. We construct a novel Probabilistic\nBISR model with tailored likelihood function and prior terms. Subsequently, we\nemploy the Monte Carlo EM algorithm to infer the degradation kernels for each\npixel. Our method achieves a significant improvement over other\nstate-of-the-art BISR methods, with an average improvement of 1 dB (2x).Code\nwill be released at https://github.com/shaojieguoECNU/SVDSR.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Dm1qO_l0B2rRm9oaYJ2Xvmu9wM0_-L6st3peCaXa5T0","pdfSize":"4385889","objectId":"0x9e82839ee0db9c5b835431669572604d6ac86887d511ade8f9aa53d0a8b9a636","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
