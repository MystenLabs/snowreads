Here, we extend our work\nto provide similar analytic formulae for explosions of blue supergiants with\nradiative polytropic envelopes. The analytic formulae are calibrated against a\nlarge set of spherically symmetric multi-group (frequency-dependent)\ncalculations for a wide range of progenitor parameters (mass, radius,\ncore/envelope mass ratios) and explosion energies. In these calculations we use\nthe opacity tables we constructed (and made publicly available), that include\nthe contributions of bound-bound and bound-free transitions. They reproduce the\nnumeric $L$ and $T_{\\rm col}$ to within 10\\% and 5\\% accuracy, and the spectral\nenergy distribution to within $\\sim20-40\\%$. The accuracy is similar to that\nachieved for RSG explosions.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ixuE1SqGgQdWS8rAXE1FRBU6bVGJMS9f3aAPymg7hY0","pdfSize":"1013354"}
