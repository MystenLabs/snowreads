This rework consists of new theoretical\nideas, a new implementation, and a dedicated strategy schedule. The theoretical\nideas are still under development, so we discuss them at a high level in this\npaper. We also describe the implementation of the calculus in the Vampire\ntheorem prover, the strategy schedule construction and several empirical\nperformance statistics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oPWqoDndG70Fx3wet0gXbfxO0gr_EGAxscCV0duOjbs","pdfSize":"782795"}
