Relying on twenty-three\nsemi-structured interviews with parents whose children contracted COVID, we\nanalyzed how the use of social media moderated parental uncertainty about the\nsymptoms, prognosis, long-term potential health ramifications of infection,\nvaccination, and other issues. We framed our findings using Mishel's\nUncertainty in Illness theory. We propose new components to the theory that\naccount for technological mediation in uncertainty. We also propose design\nrecommendations to help parents cope with health uncertainty using social\nmedia.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fyDI3o_jkXk-uehnFcJ0FdZe--mgd7fDf8thzzixpYU","pdfSize":"1001447"}
