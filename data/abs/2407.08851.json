As a corollary, we give an obstruction to the\nexistence of self-dual Poincar\\'e-Einstein metrics in terms of conformal\ninvariants of the boundary and the topology of the bulk. As a by-product of our\nproof we identify a new scalar conformal invariant of three-dimensional\nRiemannian manifolds.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"kU3kSZ9s31Opl55suStUevssIJWsQDpu0Ct2RayThoA","pdfSize":"341461"}
