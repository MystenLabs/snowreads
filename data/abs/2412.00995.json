  "abstract": "  We prove the existence of secondary terms of order $X^{3/4}$, with power\nsaving error terms, in the counting functions of $|{\\rm Sel}_2(E)|$, the\n2-Selmer group of E, for elliptic curves E having height bounded by X. This is\nthe first improvement on the error term of $o(X^{5/6})$, proved by\nBhargava--Shankar, where the primary term of order $X^{5/6}$ for this counting\nfunction was obtained.\n",
