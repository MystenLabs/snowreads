The dataset features literary and critical\ntexts from 19th-century Ottoman Turkish and Russian. It is the first study to\napply large language models (LLMs) to this dataset, sourced from prominent\nliterary periodicals of the era. The texts have been meticulously organized and\nlabeled. This was done according to a taxonomic framework that takes into\naccount both their structural and semantic attributes. Articles are categorized\nand tagged with bibliometric metadata by human experts. We present baseline\nclassification results using a classical bag-of-words (BoW) naive Bayes model\nand three modern LLMs: multilingual BERT, Falcon, and Llama-v2. We found that\nin certain cases, Bag of Words (BoW) outperforms Large Language Models (LLMs),\nemphasizing the need for additional research, especially in low-resource\nlanguage settings. This dataset is expected to be a valuable resource for\nresearchers in natural language processing and machine learning, especially for\nhistorical and low-resource languages. The dataset is publicly available^1.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"rumL8wA1AIdHO16_p4T-Kh_lulvIabZ0KJNPk-6AOxw","pdfSize":"734556"}
