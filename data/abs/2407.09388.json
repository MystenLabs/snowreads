Prior work in automated game generation has largely\nfocused on relatively restricted rule representations and relied on\ndomain-specific heuristics. In this work, we explore the generation of novel\ngames in the comparatively expansive Ludii game description language, which\nencodes the rules of over 1000 board games in a variety of styles and modes of\nplay. We draw inspiration from recent advances in large language models and\nevolutionary computation in order to train a model that intelligently mutates\nand recombines games and mechanics expressed as code. We demonstrate both\nquantitatively and qualitatively that our approach is capable of generating new\nand interesting games, including in regions of the potential rules space not\ncovered by existing games in the Ludii dataset. A sample of the generated games\nare available to play online through the Ludii portal.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TlFcT8KJWkUP4AaHFc-66BtC9GBjyEi0UKKrRMVPN9Q","pdfSize":"1591491"}
