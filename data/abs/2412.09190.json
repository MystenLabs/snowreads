In this work, we experimentally study the generation and verification\nof bipartite path-entangled states using single photons produced by a\nnitrogen-vacancy center within a nanodiamond. We perform a range of\nmeasurements to characterize the photons being generated and verify the\npresence of path entanglement. The experiment is performed using\ncontinuous-wave laser excitation and a novel state generation 'time-window'\nmethod. This approach to path entanglement verification is different to\nprevious work as it does not make use of a pulsed laser excitation source.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9NQzx55cOE50iSslUtv2BhlkeDfNvz_VrqLu5j-B8Xg","pdfSize":"2023534"}
