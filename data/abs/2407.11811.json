These\nmaterials provide a unique platform for investigating phenomena related to\nlight localization. Meantime, the interaction between flat-band physics and\nnonlinearity in continuous systems remains largely unexplored, particularly in\ncontinuous systems where the band flatness deviates slightly from zero, in\ncontrast to simplified discrete systems with exactly flat bands. Here, we use a\ncontinuous superhoneycomb lattice featuring a flat band in its spectrum to\ntheoretically and numerically introduce a range of stable flatband solitons.\nThese solutions encompass fundamental, dipole, multi-peak, and even vortex\nsolitons. Numerical analysis demonstrates that these solitons are stable in a\nbroad range of powers. They do not bifurcate from the flat band and can be\nanalyzed using Wannier function expansion leading to their designation as\nWannier solitons. These solitons showcase novel possibilities for light\nlocalization and transmission within nonlinear flat-band systems.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"-ge7934lQKCzDGZzCiMmJLE56ZIA2riWojI4jDaTXG0","pdfSize":"2536727"}
