While\nthinking of the Reynolds and Bond numbers as fixed and finite, we vary the\nspeed of the traveling frame and the degree of the incline and identify a set\nof the latter two parameters that classifies from which combinations nontrivial\nand small amplitude solution curves originate. Our principal technical tools\nare a combination of the implicit function theorem and a local multiparameter\nbifurcation theorem. To the best of the author's knowledge, this paper\nconstitutes the first construction and mathematical study of properly two\ndimensional examples of viscous roll waves.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-3oPRkmD_ny53sy00aOeo9Q9UCcHGVO6KstfNJ99ubo","pdfSize":"2100174"}
