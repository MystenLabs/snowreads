The study of some special anti-Leibniz bialgebras leads\nto the introduction of the anti-Leibniz Yang-Baxter equation in an anti-Leibniz\nalgebra. A symmetric (or an invariant) solution of the anti-Leibniz Yang-Baxter\nequation gives an anti-Leibniz bialgebra. The notion of a relative Rota-Baxter\noperator of an anti-Leibniz algebra is introduced to construct symmetric\nsolutions of the anti-Leibniz Yang-Baxter equation. Moreover, we introduce the\nnotions of factorizable anti-Leibniz bialgebras and skew-symmetric Rota-Baxter\nanti-Leibniz algebras, and show that a factorizable anti-Leibniz bialgebra\nleads to a factorization of the underlying anti-Leibniz algebra. There is a\none-to-one correspondence between factorizable anti-Leibniz bialgebras and\nskew-quadratic Rota-Baxter anti-Leibniz algebras. Finally, we constrict\nanti-Leibniz bialgebras form Leibniz bialgebras by the tensor product and\nconstrict infinite-dimensional anti-Leibniz bialgebras form finite-dimensional\nanti-Leibniz bialgebras by the completed tensor product.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"9zdE0kGVskO80q9jZdfCCHzzWP7rtje6iGFlGEdzDwk","pdfSize":"328852"}
