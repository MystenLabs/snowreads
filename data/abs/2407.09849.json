Contact centers should instruct their agents to use special\non-hold scripts to maintain positive interactions with clients. This study\npresents a natural language processing model that detects on-hold phrases in\ncustomer service calls transcribed by automatic speech recognition technology.\nThe task of finding hold scripts in dialogue was formulated as a multiclass\ntext classification problem with three mutually exclusive classes: scripts for\nputting a client on hold, scripts for returning to a client, and phrases\nirrelevant to on-hold scripts. We collected an in-house dataset of calls and\nlabeled each dialogue turn in each call. We fine-tuned RuBERT on the dataset by\nexploring various hyperparameter sets and achieved high model performance. The\ndeveloped model can help agent monitoring by providing a way to check whether\nan agent follows predefined on-hold scripts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PqunPaTHXvlLbxumYJker74igZpq2tyJ0MVRw7wi5p8","pdfSize":"822081"}
