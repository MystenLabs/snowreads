  "abstract": "  We show that floating ice blocks with asymmetric shapes can self-propel with\nsignificant speeds due to buoyancy driven currents caused by the melting ice.\nModel right-angle ice wedges are found to move in the direction opposite to the\ngravity current which descends along the longest inclined side in water, with\ntemperatures above 4{\\deg}C. We describe the measured speed as a function of\nthe length and angle of the inclined side, and the temperature of the bath in\nterms of a propulsion model which incorporates the cooling of the surrounding\nfluid by the melting ice. We show the heat pulled from the surrounding liquid\nby the melting ice block leads to net propulsion which is balanced by drag. We\nfurther show that the ice block moves robustly in a salt water bath with\nsalinity similar to that of the ocean, in the same direction as in fresh water,\nimplying that this propulsion mechanism may be relevant to icebergs in\nsufficiently warm oceans.\n",
