Electromagnetic neutrino processes induce spectral\ndistortions in neutrino scattering data, which are especially visible at\nexperiments characterized by low recoil thresholds. We investigate how neutrino\nelectromagnetic properties confront the recent indication of coherent elastic\nneutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\\nu$NS) from $^8$B solar neutrinos in dark\nmatter direct detection experiments. We focus on three possibilities: neutrino\nmagnetic moments, neutrino electric charges, and the active-sterile transition\nmagnetic moment portal. We analyze recent XENONnT and PandaX-4T data and infer\nthe first \\cevns-based constraints on electromagnetic properties using solar\n$^8$B neutrinos.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GXTvhyOhD4sRsmoJyCthtNAPyIWH8fq3TvKBWQN2OHE","pdfSize":"1066577"}
