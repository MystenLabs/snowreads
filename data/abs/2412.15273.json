In\nthe US, state election commissions (SECs), often required by law, are the\nprimary providers of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) to voters, and secondary\nsources like non-profits such as League of Women Voters (LWV) try to complement\ntheir information shortfall. However, surprisingly, to the best of our\nknowledge, there is neither a single source with comprehensive FAQs nor a study\nanalyzing the data at national level to identify current practices and ways to\nimprove the status quo. This paper addresses it by providing the {\\bf first\ndataset on Voter FAQs covering all the US states}. Second, we introduce metrics\nfor FAQ information quality (FIQ) with respect to questions, answers, and\nanswers to corresponding questions. Third, we use FIQs to analyze US FAQs to\nidentify leading, mainstream and lagging content practices and corresponding\nstates. Finally, we identify what states across the spectrum can do to improve\nFAQ quality and thus, the overall information ecosystem. Across all 50 U.S.\nstates, 12% were identified as leaders and 8% as laggards for\nFIQS\\textsubscript{voter}, while 14% were leaders and 12% laggards for\nFIQS\\textsubscript{developer}.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computers and Society","Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vVulpKyretgjJjMsQoUBws1sdkTNCRf5HKRuTVTt7GU","pdfSize":"5343987"}
