  "abstract": "  As some of the most ancient materials in our Solar System, chondritic\nmeteorites offer a valuable window into the early stages of planetary\nformation, particularly the accretion processes that built the most primitive\nasteroids. Until now, high energy shocks and collisions have been invoked to\nexplain the deformation and fragmentation of chondrules, the main component of\nchondrites. However, simulating the cooling of chondrules using continuum\nmechanics and finite elements, we demonstrate that plastic deformation of\nchondrules can occur at low collision velocities of just a few meters per\nsecond and with kinetic energies less than tenths of a millijoule when\ntemperatures exceed the glass transition temperature Tg ~ 1000 K. Conversely,\nbelow Tg, spontaneous chondrule cracking occurs due to differential thermal\ncontraction between phases and is more pronounced in larger chondrules.\nCounterintuitively, our findings suggest that both ordinary and carbonaceous\nchondrites formed through similar low-energy processes, with varying degrees of\nductility and brittleness depending on the amount of processed material. This\nimplies that the environments where chondrites formed were likely less\nturbulent and more thermally active than previously thought.\n",
