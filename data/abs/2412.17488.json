  "abstract": "  Photocatalytic water splitting has attracted considerable attention for\nrenewable energy production. Since the first reported photocatalytic water\nsplitting by titanium dioxide, this material remains one of the most promising\nphotocatalysts, due to its suitable band gap and band-edge positions. However,\npredicting both of these properties is a challenging task for existing\ncomputational methods. Here we show how Koopmans spectral functionals can\naccurately predict the band structure and level alignment of rutile, anatase,\nand brookite TiO$_2$ using a computationally efficient workflow that only\nrequires (a) a DFT calculation of the photocatalyst/vacuum interface and (b) a\nKoopmans spectral functional calculation of the bulk photocatalyst. The success\nof this approach for TiO$_2$ suggests that this strategy could be deployed for\nassessing the suitability of novel photocatalyst candidates.\n",
