  "abstract": "  This paper considers the problem of modeling epidemic outbreaks in different\nregions with a common model, that uses additional information about these\nregions to adjust its parameters and relieve us of mundanity of data\ncollecting, and inverse problem solving for each region separately. To that\nend, we study tuberculosis and HIV dynamics in regions of Russian Federation\nfrom 2009 to 2023 in connection with number of socio-economic parameters.\nSIR-like model was taken and modified as a dynamic model for tuberculosis-HIV\nco-infection and inverse problem of transfer rates between compartments was\nsolved, based on statistical data of diseases incidence. To shorten the list of\nsocio-economic parameters we make use of Shapley vector that allows us to\nestimate importance of these parameters in reconstruction of differential model\nparameters using regression algorithms.\n",
