We examined the temporal behavior and broadband spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) during the flare. The size of the $\\gamma$-ray emission\nregion was estimated based on the variability timescale. To explore the\nmulti-wavelength properties of S5 0716+714, we employed three one-zone models:\nthe SSC model, the SSC plus EC model, and the SSC plus pp interactions model,\nto reproduce the SEDs. Our findings indicate that while the SSC model can\ndescribe the SEDs, it requires an extreme Doppler factor. In contrast, the SSC\nplus EC model successfully fits the SEDs under the assumption of weak external\nphoton fields but requires a high Doppler factor. Additionally, the SSC plus\ninteractions model also reproduces the SEDs, with $\\gamma$-ray emission\noriginating from $\\pi^{0}$ decay. However, this model leads to a jet power that\nexceeds the Eddington luminosity, which remains plausible due to the flaring\nstate or the presence of a highly collimated jet.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Wg_MQzXJ44SOz2Bc3ZNRVnzR7v7DMdN5VYsyYSMcPQU","pdfSize":"1146657"}
