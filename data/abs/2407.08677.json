These currents are induced by the time-dependent variations in the\nlocal magnetic-flux density associated with the imposed change of state. They\nmay not only lead to certain deviations of the magnetic-field distribution from\ntextbook Meissner profiles, but also cause dissipative Joule heating, which\nappears to be at odds with the expected reversibility in a truly thermodynamic\nsuperconducting state. We show that these normal currents also produce a\nmagnetocaloric cooling, which in total instantaneously and precisely\ncompensates for the dissipated heat, thus ensuring overall energy conservation\nand reversibility in terms of energy. However, the time-dependent Joule heating\nand magnetocaloric cooling processes are spatially distinct and therefore must\nresult in small temperature inhomogeneities that will only fade away towards\nthermodynamic equilibrium after the thermodynamic change of state has halted.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"m2meNu0SoBZ6ax9qH0zDCrSgCjqpOVyEE4ZTJJ38hrY","pdfSize":"2654882"}
