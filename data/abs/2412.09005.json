We first conduct a detailed analysis of the\ncomputational complexity of this rule, demonstrating that no approach can\nsignificantly outperform the brute-force algorithm under common computational\ncomplexity assumptions and various natural input restrictions. In response, we\npropose two practical restrictions (the first in the literature) that make the\nproblem computationally tractable and show that these restrictions are\nessentially tight. Overall, this work provides a clear picture of the\ntractability landscape of the problem, contributing to a comprehensive\nunderstanding of the complications introduced by conditional ballots and\nindicating that conditional approval voting can be applied in practice, albeit\nunder specific conditions.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computer Science/Computational Complexity","Computer Science/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7DN6cck8N2WNirkv0aiCfUenbeZhzMFkV6XxkH8_DnA","pdfSize":"448157"}
