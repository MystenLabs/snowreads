  "abstract": "  The hot spots conjecture asserts that for any convex bounded domain $\\Omega$\nin $\\mathbb R^d$, the first non-trivial Neumann eigenfunction of the Laplace\noperator in $\\Omega$ attains its maximum at the boundary. We construct\ncounterexamples to the conjecture for all sufficiently large values of $d$. The\nconstruction is based on an extension of the conjecture from convex sets to\nlog-concave measures.\n",
