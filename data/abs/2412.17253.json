We introduce\nthe concept of homotopy Nijenhuis associative algebras and demonstrate that the\ndifferential graded (=dg) operad $\\NjAoperad_{\\infty}$ governing these\nstructures serves as the minimal model of the operad $\\NjAoperad$ for Nijenhuis\nassociative algebras. Additionally, we determine the Koszul dual homotopy\ncooperad of $\\NjAoperad$. We construct an $L_\\infty$-algebra that controls the\nsimultaneous deformations of associative products and Nijenhuis operators. The\nMaurer-Cartan elements of this $L_\\infty$-algebra correspond bijectively to\nNijenhuis associative algebra structures. From this, we derive a cochain\ncomplex (deformation complex) and an associated cohomology theory of Nijenhuis\nassociative algebras. Finally, we explore the connection between homotopy\nrelative Rota-Baxter associative algebras of weight $0$ and homotopy Nijenhuis\nassociative algebras. A sequel to this work will extend the study to Nijenhuis\nLie algebras, with applications to Nijenhuis geometry.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RKKlaKjx-OY6K5tT_2_M9_KEJojcaMChECVcEU2bQMg","pdfSize":"309616"}
