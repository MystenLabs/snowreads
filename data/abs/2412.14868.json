To exploit the\nadvantages of quantum computers, we propose quantum algorithms for linear\nstochastic differential equations, utilizing the Schr\\\"odingerisation method\nfor the corresponding approximate equation by treating the noise term as a\n(discrete-in-time) forcing term. Our algorithms are applicable to stochastic\ndifferential equations with both Gaussian noise and $\\alpha$-stable L\\'evy\nnoise. The gate complexity of our algorithms exhibits an\n$\\mathcal{O}(d\\log(Nd))$ dependence on the dimensions $d$ and sample sizes $N$,\nwhere its corresponding classical counterpart requires nearly exponentially\nlarger complexity in scenarios involving large sample sizes. In the Gaussian\nnoise case, we show the strong convergence of first order in the mean square\nnorm for the approximate equations. The algorithms are numerically verified for\nthe Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, geometric Brownian motions, and\none-dimensional L\\'evy flights.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6i8MGlwexC04ojZVRQIR35vJkSqtdLjzRI5YleC11qU","pdfSize":"8033009"}
