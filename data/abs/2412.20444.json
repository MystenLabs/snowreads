We use the paradigmatic transverse-field Ising\nmodel in one-dimension to demonstrate the strategy of the improved swapping\noperation. In particular, we study the second Renyi entropy with two, three and\nfour disjoint intervals. We find that the results from the above two methods\nmatch each other very well within errors, which indicates that the machine\nlearning method is applicable for calculating the Renyi entropy with multiple\ndisjoint intervals. Moreover, as the magnetic field increases, the Renyi\nentropy grows as well until the system arrives at the critical point of the\nphase transition. However, as the magnetic field exceeds the critical value,\nthe Renyi entropy will decrease since the system enters the paramagnetic phase.\nOverall, these results match the theoretical predictions very well and\ndemonstrate the high accuracy of the machine learning methods with neural\nnetworks.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HdsUCsq9k914de6Ll16Q-WCh6Er1d8KCLY6kpl4TVh8","pdfSize":"498430"}
