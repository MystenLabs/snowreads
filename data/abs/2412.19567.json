In this case the\ntime dimension should be taken into account that further increases the\ncomplexity of planning. To mitigate this issue we suggest to combine\nsafe-interval path planning (a prominent technique in heuristic search) with\nthe randomized planning, specifically, with the bidirectional rapidly-exploring\nrandom trees (RRT-Connect) - a fast and efficient algorithm for\nhigh-dimensional planning. Leveraging a dedicated technique of fast computation\nof the safe intervals we end up with an efficient planner dubbed SI-RRT. We\ncompare it with the state of the art and show that SI-RRT consistently\noutperforms the competitors both in runtime and solution cost.\n  Our implementation of SI-RRT is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/PathPlanning/ManipulationPlanning-SI-RRT\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"O0d9zvTj3OFTDmLVQpvCiBYxDYFaSZ9SDpMGzvez_U0","pdfSize":"1375276"}
