The result extends to\nlower $p_{\\rm T}^{\\gamma}$ and $x_{\\rm T}^{\\gamma} = 2p_{\\rm\nT}^{\\gamma}/\\sqrt{s}$ ranges, the lowest $x_{\\rm T}^{\\gamma}$ of any isolated\nphoton measurements to date, extending significantly those measured by the\nATLAS and CMS experiments towards lower $p_{\\rm T}^{\\gamma}$ at the same\ncollision energy with a small overlap between the measurements. The measurement\nis compared with next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations and the\nresults from the ATLAS and CMS experiments as well as with measurements at\nother collision energies. The measurement and theory prediction are in\nagreement with each other within the experimental and theoretical\nuncertainties.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wf51VIqrXufAOAk3EjYKka6Rg5jTRYgBQR7gPpI6aI8","pdfSize":"1243865","objectId":"0x149183488ba3dcea48f25dfce1dd59f80fe92e07b4a5f1dba9d24fb69bcbff3a","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
