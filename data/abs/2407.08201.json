We select foreground galaxy clusters with a $5\\sigma$-level\nSZ threshold in CMB observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, while we\ndefine background source galaxies for the lensing analysis with secure\nphotometric redshift cuts in Year 3 data of the Subaru Hyper Suprime Cam\nsurvey. We detect the stacked lensing signal in the range of $0.1 < R\\,\n[h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}] < 100$ in each of three cluster redshift bins,\n$0.092<z\\le0.445$, $0.445<z\\le0.695$, and $0.695<z\\le1.180$, with 32 galaxy\nclusters in each bin. The cumulative signal-to-noise ratios of the lensing\nsignal are $14.6$, $12.0$, and $6.6$, respectively. Using a halo-based forward\nmodel, we then constrain statistical relationships between the mass inferred\nfrom the SZ observation (i.e. SZ mass) and the total mass derived from our\nstacked lensing measurements. At the average SZ mass in the cluster sample\n($2.1-2.4\\times10^{14}\\, h^{-1}M_\\odot$), our likelihood analysis shows that\nthe average total mass differs from the SZ counterpart by a factor of $1.3 \\pm\n0.2$, $1.6 \\pm 0.2$, and $1.6 \\pm 0.3$ ($68\\%$) in the aforementioned redshift\nranges, respectively. Our limits are consistent with previous lensing\nmeasurements, and we find that the cluster modeling choices can introduce a\n$1\\sigma$-level difference in our parameter inferences.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-CGCsOlm-Z6jihwSFgAS3AKk8YAYmJbPr-soXXlQoxc","pdfSize":"1679546","objectId":"0x8d714b8618583540f2a2be1a8da0a1ad241662c42a615286920227ced5d53687","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
