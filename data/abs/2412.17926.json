As the most\nbio-similar of all neural networks, spiking neural networks not only allow the\nsolution of recognition and clustering problems (including dynamics), but also\ncontribute to the growing knowledge of the human nervous system. Our analysis\nhas shown that the hardware implementation is of great importance, since the\nspecifics of the physical processes in the network cells affect their ability\nto simulate the neural activity of living neural tissue, the efficiency of\ncertain stages of information processing, storage and transmission. This survey\nreviews existing hardware neuromorphic implementations of bio-inspired spiking\nnetworks in the \"semiconductor\", \"superconductor\" and \"optical\" domains.\nSpecial attention is given to the possibility of effective \"hybrids\" of\ndifferent approaches\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2zCztKV6YNF2miG0fPgIq74gZuqHAeOlb2pz_dmh10Y","pdfSize":"25182560"}
