The model parameters are constrained using current Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMB) data. The curvature perturbations that exit the\nhorizon at small scales show sufficiently large amplitudes to produce\nprimordial black holes (PBHs). We then consider the quantum one-loop\ncorrections in these models from both the self-interaction of the inflaton and\nits interaction with the waterfall field. We show the loop corrections in both\ncases for 60 e-folds of inflation are negligible, ensuring the tree-level\nresults are reliable within the chosen parameter regime.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hruttCr0TwBIzNptd8DfDEHMONpKZ7V9OqYhzZ-9gXU","pdfSize":"544772"}
