In order to\ngain more insights into the nature of physical processes, these unknown\nfunctions have to be identified or reconstructed. Mathematically, we can\nformulate this research question within the framework of inverse problems. In\nthis work, we consider optimization techniques to solve the inverse problem\nusing Tikhonov regularization and data from laboratory experiments. We propose\nan iterative strategy that eliminates the need for laboratory experiments. Our\nmethod is applied to identify the coupling and damping coefficients in a system\nof oscillators, ensuring an efficient and experiment-free approach. We present\nour results and compare them with those obtained from an alternative, purely\nexperimental approach. By employing our proposed strategy, we demonstrate a\nsignificant reduction in the number of laboratory experiments required.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"CswgptoQMBdA-FOtuU6MBljqDsGRSny6_9k8FsudjYc","pdfSize":"4386879"}
