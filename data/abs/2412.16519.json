Existing methods only focus on how to dynamically\nlearn anchors from the original data and simultaneously construct anchor graphs\ndescribing the relationships between samples and perform clustering, while\nignoring the reality of anchors, i.e., high-quality anchors should be generated\nuniformly from different clusters of data rather than scattered outside the\nclusters. To deal with this problem, we propose a noval method termed Anchor\nLearning with Potential Cluster Constraints for Multi-view Clustering (ALPC)\nmethod. Specifically, ALPC first establishes a shared latent semantic module to\nconstrain anchors to be generated from specific clusters, and subsequently,\nALPC improves the representativeness and discriminability of anchors by\nadapting the anchor graph to capture the common clustering center of mass from\nsamples and anchors, respectively. Finally, ALPC combines anchor learning and\ngraph construction into a unified framework for collaborative learning and\nmutual optimization to improve the clustering performance. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to\nsome state-of-the-art MVC methods.
