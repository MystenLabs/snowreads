  "abstract": "  In causal inference, randomized experiment is a de facto method to overcome\nvarious theoretical issues in observational study. However, the experimental\ndesign requires expensive costs, so an efficient experimental design is\nnecessary. We propose ABC3, a Bayesian active learning policy for causal\ninference. We show a policy minimizing an estimation error on conditional\naverage treatment effect is equivalent to minimizing an integrated posterior\nvariance, similar to Cohn criteria \\citep{cohn1994active}. We theoretically\nprove ABC3 also minimizes an imbalance between the treatment and control groups\nand the type 1 error probability. Imbalance-minimizing characteristic is\nespecially notable as several works have emphasized the importance of achieving\nbalance. Through extensive experiments on real-world data sets, ABC3 achieves\nthe highest efficiency, while empirically showing the theoretical results hold.\n",
