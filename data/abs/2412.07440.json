Later, a more general extension, joint weak measurement has been\nproposed to extract weak value from a joint quantum measurement. However, the\ndetection of joint weak value in the realm of classical optics remains less\nexplored. Here, using the polarization-dependent longitudinal and transverse\noptical beam shift as a platform, we experimentally realize the quantum joint\nweak measurement in a classical optical setting. Polarization states are\ncleverly pre and post-selected, and different single and joint canonical\nposition-momentum observables of the beam are experimentally extracted and\nsubsequently analyzed for successful detection of complex joint weak value. We\nenvision that this work will find usefulness for gaining fundamental insights\non quantum measurements and to tackle analogous problems in optics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"p-wZd0AFfSfrhF_2mmF2PzXNXEDbjuIEZ0ozWTrJhAU","pdfSize":"1817230"}
