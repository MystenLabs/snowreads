  "abstract": "  Cathodoluminescence microscopy is now a well-established and powerful tool\nfor probing the photonic properties of nanoscale materials, but in many cases,\nnanophotonic materials are easily damaged by the electron-beam doses necessary\nto achieve reasonable cathodoluminescence signal-to-noise ratios.\nTwo-dimensional materials have proven particularly susceptible to beam-induced\nmodifications, yielding both obstacles to high spatial-resolution measurement\nand opportunities for beam-induced patterning of quantum photonic systems. Here\npan-sharpening techniques are applied to cathodoluminescence microscopy in\norder to address these challenges and experimentally demonstrate the promise of\npan-sharpening for minimally-perturbative high-spatial-resolution spectrum\nimaging of beam-sensitive materials.\n",
