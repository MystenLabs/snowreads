  "abstract": "  While three-dimensional visualization has become a common tool in various\ncultural heritage applications, the emphasis has been on high fidelity\nrepresentation, essentially the generation of digital twins or digital\nreconstructions. Overlooked appears to be the utility of 3D in research\ncollaboration where one of the researchers has access to the original,\npotentially fragile object while the others are based in remote locations. This\npaper describes the application of a low-cost, mobile and swiftly executable 3D\nscanning process and discusses the benefits of this for remote collaboration of\nthree-dimensional objects of material culture\n",
