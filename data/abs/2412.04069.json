However, protein design methods utilizing large language models\nwith solely pretraining and fine-tuning struggle to capture relationships in\nmulti-modal protein data. To address this, we propose ProtDAT, a de novo\nfine-grained framework capable of designing proteins from any descriptive\nprotein text input. ProtDAT builds upon the inherent characteristics of protein\ndata to unify sequences and text as a cohesive whole rather than separate\nentities. It leverages an innovative multi-modal cross-attention, integrating\nprotein sequences and textual information for a foundational level and seamless\nintegration. Experimental results demonstrate that ProtDAT achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance in protein sequence generation, excelling in\nrationality, functionality, structural similarity, and validity. On 20,000\ntext-sequence pairs from Swiss-Prot, it improves pLDDT by 6%, TM-score by 0.26,\nand reduces RMSD by 1.2 {\\AA}, highlighting its potential to advance protein\ndesign.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"RPPaAg9JFtsXnlyQJkJsFUSmFOQl5D8O1447GA2zjWw","pdfSize":"4986191"}
