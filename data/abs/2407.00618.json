In addition, they seem to\nbe exploring various supergeneralizations of other algebraic structures, such\nas Super-associative, left (right) Super-Leibniz, and\nSuper-left(right)-symmetric superalgebras, then we give some examples and\nrelated fundamental results. The notion of Rota-Baxter operators with any\nparity on the Super-Lie superalgebras is given. Moreover, we study a\nrepresentations of Super-Lie superalgebras and its associate dual\nrepresentations. The notion of derivations of Super-Lie superalgebras is\nintroduced thus we show that the converse of a bijective derivation defines a\nRota-Baxter operator. Finally, we give a generalization of the Super-Lie\nsuperalgebras and some other structures in the ternary case which we supported\nthis with some examples and interesting results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"EC7fhEOTfnW8P17J5yoNlzboFG1tiXlGfye8W7hiKe0","pdfSize":"201698"}
