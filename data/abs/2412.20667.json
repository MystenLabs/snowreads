  "abstract": "  This paper investigates managed lane (ML) toll setting and its effect under\nmixed traffic of connected automated vehicles (CAVs), high-occupancy vehicles\n(HOVs), and human-driven vehicles (HDVs), with a goal to avoid flow breakdown\nand minimize total social cost. A mesoscopic finite-difference traffic\nsimulation model considers the flow-density relationship at different CAV\nmarket penetration rates, lane-changing behavior, and multiple entries/exits,\ninteracting with a reactive toll setting mechanism. The results of the Monte\nCarlo simulation suggest an optimal policy of untolled HOV/CAV use with HDV\ntolls in particular scenarios of limited CAV market penetration. Small and\ntargeted tolling avoids flow breakdown in ML while prioritizing HOVs and other\nvehicles with high values of time. Extensions of the formulation and\nsensitivity analysis quantify the benefits of converting high-occupancy HDVs to\nCAVs. The optimal tolling regime combines traffic science notions of flow\nstability and the economics of resource allocation.\n",
