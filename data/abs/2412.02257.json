In this paper our main goal is to\nderive an asymptotic expansion up to order $N$ (for any fixed positive integer\n$N$) along with estimates for error bounds for the shifted quotient of the\npartition function, namely $p(n+k)/p(n)$ with $k\\in \\mathbb{N}$, which\ngeneralizes a result of Gomez, Males, and Rolen. In order to do so, we derive\nasymptotic expansions with error bounds for the shifted version $p(n+k)$ and\nthe multiplicative inverse $1/p(n)$, which is of independent interest.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Computer Science/Symbolic Computation","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zCeK-F3dOkWbu4caf_bptu4G9XfTbzz6X7FfK0y7evk","pdfSize":"480516"}
