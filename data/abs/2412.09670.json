  "abstract": "  We demonstrate that formulating the composite-fermion theory of the\nfractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect in terms of quaternions greatly expands\nits reach and opens the door into many interesting issues that were previously\nbeyond the reach of quantitative theoretical investigation. As an illustration,\nwe investigate the possibility of a nematic or a charge-density wave\ninstability of the composite-fermion Fermi sea at half-filled Landau level and\nof the nearby FQH states by looking for a magneto-roton instability. Our\nquaternion formulation of the FQH effect has been inspired by mathematical\ndevelopments in the theoretical analyses of gravitational wave modes and cosmic\nmicrowave background radiation, where an important role is played by\nspin-weighted spherical harmonics which are nothing but monopole harmonics\nappearing in the spherical geometry for the FQH effect.\n",
