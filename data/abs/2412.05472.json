A recent theory\nargues that the currents driven at the boundary of the plasma excite a Surface\nPlasmon Polariton (SPP) surface wave (in particular a Sommerfeld-Goubau wave\ngiven the cylindrical symmetry), which proceeds to detach from the end of the\nplasma to become the RF pulse. We have performed near-field measurements of\nthese plasmas with a D-dot probe, and find an excellent agreement with this\ntheory. The radial field dependence is precisely fit by a Hankel function, with\nan outer length scale in agreement with plasma conductivity and radius, and a\nmeasured longitudinal drift in frequency maxima closely matches both SPP\nsimulations and analytic expectations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xS9w2wv-MfXuCujiZy1KNTYHfB5VNhvfYRZzwfL0ANU","pdfSize":"8850252"}
