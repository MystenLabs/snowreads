Here, we report an optical spectroscopy study of a\ntopological hourglass semimetal Nb3SiTe6 with the electric field of the\nincident light parallel to its crystalline ab-plane. The ab-plane optical\nconductivity spectra of Nb3SiTe6 single crystals exhibit a remarkable peak-like\nfeature around 1.20 eV, which is mainly contributed by the direct optical\ntransitions between the two ab-initio-calculation-derived flat bands along the\nmomentum direction Z-U. Our results pave the way for investigating exotic\nquantum phenomena based on the flat bands in topological hourglass semimetals.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"fbZXBYgSnknS7Nuiczf90r38C-_bO50bR5HPTZJ2qnk","pdfSize":"728129"}
