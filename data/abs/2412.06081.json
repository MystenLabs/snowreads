Next it is shown that double\nproduct of theta functions of genus $g=1$ is written by a sum of $g=2$ theta\nfunctions, which is a subset having a special period matrix of\n$\\tau_{11}=\\tau_{22}$. Several applied examples are shown, which include the\ncubic identity of Borwein and Borwein.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ozfOlWy9eDTIJGgJqj_0cx08XKy_pXXekT_5qWm-JEc","pdfSize":"168320"}
