  "abstract": "  For an arbitrary positive integer $p$, Landen's formula is extended to\nexpress theta function with modulus $p\\tau$ by $p$ product of theta functions\nwith $\\tau$, which is applied to several examples. Next it is shown that double\nproduct of theta functions of genus $g=1$ is written by a sum of $g=2$ theta\nfunctions, which is a subset having a special period matrix of\n$\\tau_{11}=\\tau_{22}$. Several applied examples are shown, which include the\ncubic identity of Borwein and Borwein.\n",
