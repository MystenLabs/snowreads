  "abstract": "  The modestly eccentric and non-coplanar orbits of the giant planets pose a\nchallenge to solar system formation theories which generally indicate that the\ngiant planets emerged from the protoplanetary disk in nearly perfectly circular\nand coplanar orbits. We demonstrate that a single encounter with a 2-50\nJupiter-mass object, passing through the solar system at a perihelion distance\nless than 20 AU and a hyperbolic excess velocity less than 6 km/s, can excite\nthe giant planets' eccentricities and mutual inclinations to values comparable\nto those observed. We estimate that there is about a 1-in-100 chance that such\na flyby produces a dynamical architecture similar to that of the solar system.\nWe describe a metric to evaluate how closely a simulated system matches the\neccentricity and inclination secular modes of the solar system. The scenario of\na close encounter with a substellar object offers a plausible explanation for\nthe origin of the moderate eccentricities and inclinations and the secular\narchitecture of the planets.\n",
