On X (formerly\nTwitter), for instance, an author might simply use the hashtag #anger, while in\na news headline, emotions are typically written in a more polite, indirect\nmanner. To enable conditional text generation models to create emotionally\nconnotated texts that fit a domain, users need to have access to a parameter\nthat allows them to choose the appropriate way to express an emotion. To\nachieve this, we introduce MOPO, a Multi-Objective Prompt Optimization\nmethodology. MOPO optimizes prompts according to multiple objectives (which\ncorrespond here to the output probabilities assigned by emotion classifiers\ntrained for different domains). In contrast to single objective optimization,\nMOPO outputs a set of prompts, each with a different weighting of the multiple\nobjectives. Users can then choose the most appropriate prompt for their\ncontext. We evaluate MOPO using three objectives, determined by various\ndomain-specific emotion classifiers. MOPO improves performance by up to 15 pp\nacross all objectives with a minimal loss (1-2 pp) for any single objective\ncompared to single-objective optimization. These minor performance losses are\noffset by a broader generalization across multiple objectives - which is not\npossible with single-objective optimization. Additionally, MOPO reduces\ncomputational requirements by simultaneously optimizing for multiple\nobjectives, eliminating separate optimization procedures for each objective.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"M8DP0USK4IqXDNqE_FjxQ1hTVuzHMJV_hJN87mFbUMI","pdfSize":"4772438"}
