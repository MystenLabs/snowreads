This measurement uses $pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV,\ncollected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider during Run 2,\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of 140 fb$^{-1}$. The $W \\to \\tau\n\\nu_\\tau$ (with $\\tau \\to e \\nu_e \\nu_\\tau$) and $W \\to e \\nu_e$ decays are\ndistinguished using the differences in the impact parameter distributions and\ntransverse momentum spectra of the electrons. The measured ratio of branching\nfractions $R_{\\tau/e} = 0.975 \\pm 0.012 \\textrm{(stat.)} \\pm 0.020\n\\textrm{(syst.)}$, is consistent with the Standard Model assumption of lepton\nflavour universality in $W$-boson decays.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZMP1uwqBu-V6TSbC9TGl5M6_9UXaTxrXyYU-v7WKtnA","pdfSize":"1847388"}
