The basic idea behind the approach is that mixtures with\nsimilar pairs of components will have similar thermodynamic properties. The SBM\nis trained on a matrix that contains some data for a given property for\ndifferent binary mixtures; the missing entries are then predicted by the SBM.\nAs an example, we consider the prediction of isothermal activity coefficients\nat infinite dilution ($\\gamma^\\infty_{ij}$) and show that the SBM outperforms\nthe well-established physical methods modified UNIFAC (Dortmund) and\nCOSMO-SAC-dsp. In this case, the matrix is only sparsely occupied, and it is\nshown that the SBM works also if only a limited number of data for similar\nmixtures is available. The SBM idea can be transferred to any mixture property\nand is a powerful tool for generating essential data for many applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3-36wkq7EOKPQtxc5VU0B0D-n2yyveLrDLG5OVhTIUQ","pdfSize":"1572751"}
