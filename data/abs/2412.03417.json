ARM is used in the Internet of Things\n(IoT) for different tasks including monitoring and decision-making. However,\nexisting methods give limited consideration to IoT-specific requirements such\nas heterogeneity and volume. Furthermore, they do not utilize important static\ndomain-specific description data about IoT systems, which is increasingly\nrepresented as knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel ARM pipeline\nfor IoT data that utilizes both dynamic sensor data and static IoT system\nmetadata. Furthermore, we propose an Autoencoder-based Neurosymbolic ARM method\n(Aerial) as part of the pipeline to address the high volume of IoT data and\nreduce the total number of rules that are resource-intensive to process. Aerial\nlearns a neural representation of a given data and extracts association rules\nfrom this representation by exploiting the reconstruction (decoding) mechanism\nof an autoencoder. Extensive evaluations on 3 IoT datasets from 2 domains show\nthat ARM on both static and dynamic IoT data results in more generically\napplicable rules while Aerial can learn a more concise set of high-quality\nassociation rules than the state-of-the-art with full coverage over the\ndatasets.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zFiuOABXXCplDdfFKRDEPt5lEQMPLZUUZqNCUfvZ3Fc","pdfSize":"1339931"}
