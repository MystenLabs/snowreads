The height of a uniform random leaf can be represented as the\nabsorption time of a certain {\\em harmonic descent} Markov chain. Recent work\non these heights $D_n$ and $L_n$ (corresponding to discrete or continuous\nversions of the tree) has led to quite sharp expressions for their asymptotic\ndistributions, based on their Markov chain description. This article gives even\nsharper expressions, based on an $n \\to \\infty$ limit tree structure described\nvia exchangeable random partitions in the style of Haas et al (2008). Within\nthis structure, calculations of moments lead to expressions for Mellin\ntransforms, and then via Mellin inversion we obtain sharp estimates for the\nexpectation, variance, Normal approximation and large deviation behavior of\n$D_n$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Q_vUGxqKxZo9PsiprEOcXdDarG1qg_3bSj8K1y42tHk","pdfSize":"525366"}
