Using this result, we obtain the evolution kernel for the\ncorresponding operators at three loops. The explicit expression for the\nanomalous dimension matrix in the Gegenbauer basis is given for the first few\noperators.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kg1nKcOwd0vCEJhgyEAVpoUOSNc8IkkKAyJtukBKrWk","pdfSize":"909932"}
