This\nstudy utilizes advanced natural language processing (NLP) and the BERT model to\nanalyze user reviews, extracting insights into customer satisfaction and\nguiding service improvements. By transforming reviews into feature vectors, the\nBERT model accurately classifies emotions, uncovering patterns of satisfaction\nand dissatisfaction. This approach provides valuable data for hotel management,\nhelping them refine service offerings and improve customer experiences. From a\nfinancial perspective, understanding sentiment is vital for predicting market\nperformance, as shifts in consumer sentiment often correlate with stock prices\nand overall industry performance. Additionally, the study addresses data\nimbalance in sentiment analysis, employing techniques like oversampling and\nundersampling to enhance model robustness. The results offer actionable\ninsights not only for the hotel industry but also for financial analysts,\naiding in market forecasts and investment decisions. This research highlights\nthe potential of sentiment analysis to drive business growth, improve financial\noutcomes, and enhance competitive advantage in the dynamic tourism and\nhospitality sectors, thereby contributing to the broader economic landscape.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"go9bvAxRsksTVEs2h3GfZ-xz-vrL4gM79r-IPsqjbg8","pdfSize":"305142"}
