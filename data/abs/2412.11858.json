  "abstract": "  The model problem of a plane angle for a second-order elliptic system with\nDirichlet, mixed, and Neumann boundary conditions is analyzed. The existence of\nsolutions of the form $r^\\lambda v$ is, for each boundary condition, reduced to\nsolving a matrix equation. Leveraging these matrix equations and focusing on\nDirichlet and mixed boundary conditions, optimal bounds on $|\\Re \\lambda|$ are\nderived, employing tools from numerical range analysis and accretive operator\ntheory. The developed framework is novel and recovers known bounds for\nDirichlet boundary conditions. The results for mixed boundary conditions are\nnew and represent the central contribution of this work. Immediate applications\nof these findings are new regularity results in linear elasticity.\n",
