Their generality allow them to cover\na number of different approaches with varying forms of representing the\nargumentation structure. Boolean regulatory networks are used to model the\ndynamics of complex biological processes, taking into account the interactions\nof biological compounds, such as proteins or genes. These models have proven\nhighly useful for comprehending such biological processes, allowing to\nreproduce known behaviour and testing new hypotheses and predictions in silico,\nfor example in the context of new medical treatments. While both these\napproaches stem from entirely different communities, it turns out that there\nare striking similarities in their appearence. In this paper, we study the\nrelation between these two formalisms revealing their communalities as well as\ntheir differences, and introducing a correspondence that allows to establish\nnovel results for the individual formalisms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"O2rycWotY7JKGTC1aDBtjQOIS9KDBynxCW_QATbwchs","pdfSize":"1350014"}
