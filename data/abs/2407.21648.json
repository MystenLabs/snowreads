This limit\nleads to a theory with an underlying membrane Newton-Cartan geometry.\nConsistency of the non-relativistic limit requires the imposition of\nconstraints, requiring that certain bosonic and fermionic torsions and\ncurvatures vanish. We investigate the implications of two versions of these\nconstraints. In one version, we keep only 16 supersymmetry transformations,\nleading to a simple (purely bosonic) constraint structure but an unusual\nrealisation of the supersymmetry algebra which does not close into\ndiffeomorphisms. In the other, we keep all 32 supersymmetry transformations.\nThis requires a complicated sequence of bosonic and fermionic constraints,\neventually involving three derivatives of bosonic fields. We argue, with a\nlinearised calculation, that this sequence of constraints terminates.\nFurthermore, we show that there exists a family of supersymmetric solutions\nsatisfying these constraints, containing the non-relativistic limit of the M2\nsupergravity solution recently obtained by Lambert and Smith as a background\nrelevant for non-relativistic holography.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"soJd0mTMi4poOVF62Q5JT0NT67gCjBuNXyNwYCeiDpg","pdfSize":"709198"}
