  "abstract": "  A measurement of the redshift drift constitutes a model-independent probe of\nfundamental cosmology. Several approaches are being considered to make the\nnecessary observations, using (i) the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), (ii) the\nCosmic Accelerometer, and (iii) the differential redshift drift methodology.\nOur focus in this {\\it Letter} is to assess how these upcoming measurements may\nbe used to compare the predictions of $\\Lambda$CDM with those of the\nalternative Friedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker cosmology known as the\n$R_{\\rm h}=ct$ universe, and several other models, including modified gravity\nscenarios. The ELT should be able to distinguish between $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ and the\nother models at better than $3\\sigma$ for $z\\gtrsim 3.6$ after 20 years of\nmonitoring, while the Cosmic Accelerometer may be able to achieve the same\nresult with sources at $z\\gtrsim 2.6$ after only 10 years.\n",
