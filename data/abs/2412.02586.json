  "abstract": "  Based on neural network and adaptive subspace approximation method, we\npropose a new machine learning method for solving partial differential\nequations. The neural network is adopted to build the basis of the finite\ndimensional subspace. Then the discrete solution is obtained by using the\nsubspace approximation. Especially, based on the subspace approximation, a\nposteriori error estimator can be derivated by the hypercircle technique. This\na posteriori error estimator can act as the loss function for adaptively\nrefining the parameters of neural network.\n",
