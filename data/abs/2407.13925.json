Most of these GNN-based methods, including the\nedge classification (EC) and the object condensation (OC) approach, require an\ninput graph that needs to be constructed beforehand. In this work, we consider\na one-shot OC approach that reconstructs particle tracks directly from a set of\nhits (point cloud) by recursively applying graph attention networks with an\nevolving graph structure. This approach iteratively updates the graphs and can\nbetter facilitate the message passing across each graph. Preliminary studies on\nthe TrackML dataset show better track performance compared to the methods that\nrequire a fixed input graph.\n","subjects":["Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"T0pasRp1dTIp4J6_W5ErG75DVm-0sVyEBQNUcCMMySo","pdfSize":"848191"}
