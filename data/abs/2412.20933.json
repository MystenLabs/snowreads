  "abstract": "  CLIP-seq methods are valuable techniques to experimentally determine\ntranscriptome-wide binding sites of RNA-binding proteins. Despite the constant\nimprovement of such techniques (e.g. eCLIP), the results are affected by\nvarious types of noise and depend on experimental conditions such as cell line,\ntissue, gene expression levels, stress conditions etc., paving the way for the\nin silico modeling of RNA-protein interactions. Here we present ProtScan, a\npredictive tool based on consensus kernelized SGD regression. ProtScan denoises\nand generalizes the information contained in CLIP-seq experiments. It\noutperforms competitor state-of the-art methods and can be used to model\nRNA-protein interactions on a transcriptome-wide scale.\n",
