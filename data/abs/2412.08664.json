From the time shifts of the creep compliance\ncurves under stresses from 1 to 15~\\si{\\mega\\pascal} and in the temperature\nrange between $T_g -10K$ and $T_g$, where $T_g$ is the glass transition, we\ndetermine a macroscopic acceleration factor. The macroscopic acceleration is\nshown to vary as $e^{-(\\Sigma/Y)^n} $ with $n=2 \\pm 0.2$, where $\\Sigma$ is the\nmacroscopic stress and $Y$ is a decreasing function of compliance. Because at\nthe beginning of creep, the stress is homogeneous, the macroscopic acceleration\nis thus similar to the local one, in agreement with the recent theory of Long\n\\textit{et al.} (\\textit{Phys. Rev. Mat.} (2018) \\textbf{2}, 105601 ) which\npredicts $n=2$. For larger compliances, the decrease of the of $Y$ is\ninterpreted as a signature of the development of stress disorder during creep.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0j7fbpibzw1OLYHjBRIMr_hX7ph9inIGZ4idOwONmkk","pdfSize":"720781"}
