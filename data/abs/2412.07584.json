However, queries often describe an action or\nevent over a series of frames, not a specific image. This results in\ninsufficient information when analyzing a single frame, leading to less\naccurate query results. Moreover, extracting embeddings solely from images\n(keyframes) does not provide enough information for models to encode\nhigher-level, more abstract insights inferred from the video. These models tend\nto only describe the objects present in the frame, lacking a deeper\nunderstanding. In this work, we propose a system that integrates the latest\nmethodologies, introducing a novel pipeline that extracts multimodal data, and\nincorporate information from multiple frames within a video, enabling the model\nto abstract higher-level information that captures latent meanings, focusing on\nwhat can be inferred from the video clip, rather than just focusing on object\ndetection in one single image.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Krh37brERH8gNy1rk5zJEzlqe1sTvK9nWdC7Si_lM6o","pdfSize":"3208479"}
