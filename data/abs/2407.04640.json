We prove the existence\nof a global in space/uniform spectral gap between the ground state and first\nexcited state energies. To do so, we improve upon previous results using a\ndifferent tool, the time-independent Feshbach-Schur map.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IhvI2eoeBOJWr9v-I1Lzy4T0JdXhzsSSmHyo1nLuoxA","pdfSize":"429143"}
