In our\nrecent study we have found a novel lattice which apparently is not related to\nthe known ones by Miura type transformation. In the article we described higher\nsymmetries to this lattice and derived a new coupled system of the DS type.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZvIt1G4zvropz4myaiHGvcqQj-yBvlVlF35Qw5ej30A","pdfSize":"180837"}
