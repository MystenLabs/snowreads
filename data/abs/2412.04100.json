However, the performance and versatility of\nthese systems across musical genres are heavily influenced by the availability\nof training data. We conducted an extensive analysis of over one million hours\nof audio datasets used in AI music generation research and manually reviewed\nmore than 200 papers from eleven prominent AI and music conferences and\norganizations (AAAI, ACM, EUSIPCO, EURASIP, ICASSP, ICML, IJCAI, ISMIR,\nNeurIPS, NIME, SMC) to identify a critical gap in the fair representation and\ninclusion of the musical genres of the Global South in AI research. Our\nfindings reveal a stark imbalance: approximately 86% of the total dataset hours\nand over 93% of researchers focus primarily on music from the Global North.\nHowever, around 40% of these datasets include some form of non-Western music,\ngenres from the Global South account for only 14.6% of the data. Furthermore,\napproximately 51% of the papers surveyed concentrate on symbolic music\ngeneration, a method that often fails to capture the cultural nuances inherent\nin music from regions such as South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. As AI\nincreasingly shapes the creation and dissemination of music, the significant\nunderrepresentation of music genres in datasets and research presents a serious\nthreat to global musical diversity. We also propose some important steps to\nmitigate these risks and foster a more inclusive future for AI-driven music\ngeneration.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Sound","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GiPFMkpQhppAlmx4umMRjBkTixMfYv8-lZqqV8YaopI","pdfSize":"1122920"}
