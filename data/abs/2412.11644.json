  "abstract": "  A set of measurements for the production of a $W$-boson in association with\nhigh-transverse-momentum jets is presented using 140 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton\ncollision data at a centre-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV collected by the\nATLAS detector at the LHC. The measurements are performed in final states in\nwhich the $W$-boson decays into an electron or muon plus a neutrino and is\nproduced in association with jets with $p_{\\text{T}}>30$ GeV, where the leading\njet has $p_{\\text{T}}>500$ GeV. The angular separation between the lepton and\nthe closest jet with $p_{\\text{T}}>100$ GeV is measured and used to define a\ncollinear phase space, wherein measurements of kinematic properties of the\n$W$-boson and the associated jet are performed. The collinear phase space is\npopulated by dijet events radiating a $W$-boson and events with a $W$-boson\nproduced in association with several jets and it serves as an excellent data\nsample to probe higher-order theoretical predictions. Measured differential\ndistributions are compared with predictions from state-of-the-art\nnext-to-leading order multi-leg merged Monte Carlo event generators and a\nfixed-order calculation of the $W$+1-jet process computed at\nnext-to-next-to-leading order in the strong coupling constant.\n",
