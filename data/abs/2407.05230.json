In this paper, we introduce a new method to deduce\nmatrix perturbation bounds, which we call \"contour bootstrapping\". As\napplications, we work out several new bounds for eigensubspace computation and\nlow rank approximation. Next, we use these bounds to study utility problems in\nthe area of differential privacy.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"sruCHg8pXUqLgbfvy1zlmYsF9-bgg0u-B8LPxwVWDKI","pdfSize":"209145"}
