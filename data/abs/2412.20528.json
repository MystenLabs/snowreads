Our recently developed\nmodel for these nanoassembled plasmonic structures is composed of a dielectric\nspherical core surrounded by a concentric spherical shell containing a random\ndistribution of AuNPs. This model provides a useful platform for studying the\nrole of a controlled amount of disorder on scattering by a particle. In that\ncontext, we explore the angular distribution of scattered light for different\nsizes (5 - 20 nm) and filling fractions (0.1 - 0.3) of the AuNP in the\ncoatings. The simulations reveal that the coating of AuNPs redistributes power\nin a way that suppresses angular side lobes, thereby guiding the scattered\npower preferentially in the forward direction. These results highlight that\nwith the ability to tune both the spatial and the spectral aspects of the\nscattering profile, these coated structures may serve as a platform for a\nvariety of applications, including passive cloaking, scattering enhancement,\nand high-resolution imaging.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YjjDK9ZbGCxqmoJE7Ie-tGOgy2TW6Gi3xqZrfW6pwSo","pdfSize":"605327"}
