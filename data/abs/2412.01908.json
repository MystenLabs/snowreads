  "abstract": "  Increasing the angular resolution of an interferometric array requires\nplacing its elements at large separations. This often leads to sparse coverage\nand introduces challenges to reconstructing images from interferometric data.\nWe introduce a new interferometric imaging algorithm, KRISP, that is based on\nkernel methods, is statistically robust, and is agnostic to the underlying\nimage. The algorithm reconstructs the complete Fourier map up to the maximum\nobserved baseline length based entirely on the data without tuning by a user or\ntraining on prior images and reproduces images with high fidelity. KRISP works\nefficiently for many sparse array configurations even in the presence of\nsignificant image structure as long as the typical baseline separation is\ncomparable to or less than the correlation length of the Fourier map, which is\ninversely proportional to the size of the target image.\n",
