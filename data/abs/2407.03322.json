Traditionally, the theory utilizes a positive K\nto extend the length of data strings, enhancing their testability and\ncompressibility. We propose a paradigm shift by employing a negative K, which\nshortens data strings and potentially improves compression efficiency. However,\nthis approach sacrifices the local testability of the data, a cornerstone in\ntraditional Set Shaping Theory. We examine the theoretical implications,\npractical benefits, and challenges of this new methodology.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"beyAJd-AXQyBA35Y0VZCIKdvky9a-kH4-wZJgKdMz8c","pdfSize":"133280"}
