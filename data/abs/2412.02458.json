Among the many possible applications, one surely is to\nmake use of their pattern recognition power when dealing with the study of\nequilibrium phase diagram. Within this context, Learning by Confusion has\nemerged as an interesting, unbiased scheme. The idea behind it briefly consists\nin iteratively label numerical results in a random way and then train and test\na Neural Network; while for a generic random labeling the Network displays low\naccuracy, the latter shall display a peak when data are divided into a correct,\nyet unknown way. Here, we propose a generalization of this confusion scheme for\nsystems with more than two phases, for which it was originally proposed. Our\nconstruction simply relies on the use of a slightly different Neural Network:\nfrom a binary classificator we move to a ternary one, more suitable to detect\nsystems exhibiting three phases. After introducing this construction, we test\nis onto the free and the interacting Kitaev chain and on the one-dimensional\nExtended Hubbard model, always finding results compatible with previous works.\nOur work opens the way to wider use of Learning by Confusion, showing once more\nthe usefulness of Machine Learning to address quantum many-body problems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"c_5uwQd15IjgadeA0Nud7S9L1jeYQkxUHi66XjfuFbE","pdfSize":"726732"}
