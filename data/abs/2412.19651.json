For parameter space, we consider a space which\nresolves the discontinuity of the iterate map. We show that the measure of\nmaximal entropy extends continuously to this resolution space. For moduli\nspace, we consider a space which resolves the discontinuity of the iterate map\nacting on its geometric invariant theory compactification. We show that the\nmeasure of maximal entropy, barycentered and modulo rotations, also extends\ncontinuously to this resolution space. Thus, answering in the positive a\nquestion raised by DeMarco. A main ingredient is a description of limiting\ndynamics for some sequences.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0FI2_1lCwJocDg6I6zEWAXCsiwXTUJoc6gb-0e0Aj3g","pdfSize":"642649"}
