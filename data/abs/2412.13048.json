  "abstract": "  In this work we investigate some non-Newtonian effects in exact solutions of\nthe Einstein equations, which describe stationary and axisymmetric\nconfigurations of self-gravitating dust. A distinctive feature of these\nsolutions is the potential presence of conical singularities along the rotation\naxis, manifesting as angular deficits. While such singularities can be removed\nby imposing suitable boundary conditions along the axis, asymptotically far\naway from it the geometry becomes locally flat, in the sense that the Riemann\ntensor vanishes, but globally, instead of reducing to Minkowski space, it takes\nthe form of a cone. We refer to these spacetimes as Asymptotically Conically\nMinkowskian (ACM). We show that such conical structure can originate some\ninteresting effects as seen by asymptotic local observers. These include\nmodifications to the gravitational lensing and the misinterpretation of the\nvacuum state of a scalar field as a distribution of scalar particles.\n",
