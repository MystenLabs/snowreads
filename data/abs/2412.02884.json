  "abstract": "  This project investigates factors that influence the perceived helpfulness of\nAmazon product reviews through machine learning techniques. After extensive\nfeature analysis and correlation testing, we identified key metadata\ncharacteristics that serve as strong predictors of review helpfulness. While we\ninitially explored natural language processing approaches using TextBlob for\nsentiment analysis, our final model focuses on metadata features that\ndemonstrated more significant correlations, including the number of images per\nreview, reviewer's historical helpful votes, and temporal aspects of the\nreview.\n  The data pipeline encompasses careful preprocessing and feature\nstandardization steps to prepare the input for model training. Through\nsystematic evaluation of different feature combinations, we discovered that\nmetadata elements we choose using a threshold provide reliable signals when\ncombined for predicting how helpful other Amazon users will find a review. This\ninsight suggests that contextual and user-behavioral factors may be more\nindicative of review helpfulness than the linguistic content itself.\n",
