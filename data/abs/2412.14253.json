  "abstract": "  Effective field theories (EFTs) provide an excellent framework for the search\nof heavy physics beyond the Standard Model, using the so-called bottom-up and\ntop-down approaches. However, the vastness of possible UV scenarios makes the\ncomplete connection between the two approaches a difficult challenge at the\nloop-level. UV/IR dictionaries fill precisely this gap, efficiently connecting\nthe EFT with the UV. In this work we present the complete one-loop dictionary\nfor the Standard Model EFT at dimension six for completions with an arbitrary\nnumber of heavy fermions and scalars. Our results (as well as several new\nfunctionalities) are added to the previously partial package SOLD. In this new\nform, SOLD is prepared to serve as an important guiding tool for systematic and\ncomplete phenomenological studies. To illustrate this, we use the package to\nexplore possible explanations for the tension on the measurement of\n$\\mathcal{B}(B\\rightarrow K \\overline{\\nu}\\nu)$.\n",
