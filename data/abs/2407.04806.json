We perform time-analysis on a neural tangent kernel\n(NTK) two-sample test. In particular, we derive the theoretical minimum\ntraining time needed to ensure the NTK two-sample test detects a\ndeviation-level between the datasets. Similarly, we derive the theoretical\nmaximum training time before the NTK two-sample test detects a deviation-level.\nBy approximating the neural network dynamics with the NTK dynamics, we extend\nthis time-analysis to the realistic neural network two-sample test generated\nfrom time-varying training dynamics and finite training samples. A similar\nextension is done for the neural network two-sample test generated from\ntime-varying training dynamics but trained on the population. To give\nstatistical guarantees, we show that the statistical power associated with the\nneural network two-sample test goes to 1 as the neural network training samples\nand test evaluation samples go to infinity. Additionally, we prove that the\ntraining times needed to detect the same deviation-level in the null and\nalternative hypothesis scenarios are well-separated. Finally, we run some\nexperiments showcasing a two-layer neural network two-sample test on a hard\ntwo-sample test problem and plot a heatmap of the statistical power of the\ntwo-sample test in relation to training time and network complexity.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jvgEEFF2AD6UQpF6DOhU_3_Czu3sug5ZzBvTlMs_Om0","pdfSize":"1118161"}
