  "abstract": "  Constrained dynamical systems are systems such that, by some means, the state\nstays within a given set. Two such systems are the (perturbed) Moreau sweeping\nprocess and the recently proposed extended Projected Dynamical System (ePDS).\nWe show that under certain conditions solutions to the ePDS correspond to the\nsolutions of a dynamic complementarity system, similar to the one equivalent to\nordinary PDS. We then show that the perturbed sweeping process with time\nvarying set can, under similar conditions, be reformulated as an ePDS. In this\npaper, we leverage these equivalences to develop an accurate discretization\nmethod for perturbed first-order Moreau sweeping processes via the finite\nelements with switch detection method. This allows the efficient optimal\ncontrol of systems governed by ePDS and perturbed first-order sweeping\nprocesses.\n",
