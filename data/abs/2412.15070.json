  "abstract": "  The quantum extremal island rule allows us to compute the Page curves of\nHawking radiation in semi-classical gravity. In this work, we study the\nconnection between these calculations and the thermalisation of chaotic quantum\nmany-body systems, using a coarse-grained description of entanglement dynamics\nknown as the entanglement membrane. Starting from a double-holographic model of\neternal two-sided asymptotically AdS$_d$ ($d>2$) black hole each coupled to a\nflat $d$-dimensional bath, we show that the entanglement dynamics in the\nlate-time, large-subregion limit is described by entanglement membrane, thereby\nestablishing a quantitative equivalence between a semi-classical gravity and a\nchaotic quantum many-body system calculation of the Page curve.\n",
