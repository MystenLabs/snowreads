We use\na variational approach to study these invariants by investigating a suitably\ntruncated knot energy, the tangent-point energy. We prove existence of energy\nminimizers for each truncation parameter ${\\delta} > 0$ in a class of\nimmersions with prescribed winding number and Arnold invariants, and establish\nGamma convergence of the truncated tangent-point energies to a limiting\nrenormalized tangent-point energy as ${\\delta\\to 0}$. Moreover, we show that\nany sequence of minimizers subconverges in ${C^1}$, and the corresponding limit\ncurve has the same topological invariants, self-intersects exclusively at right\nangles, and minimizes the renormalized tangent-point energy among all curves\nwith right self-intersection angles. In addition, the limit curve is an\nalmost-minimizer for all of the original truncated tangent-point energies as\nlong as the truncation parameter ${\\delta}$ is sufficiently small. Therefore,\nthis limit curve serves as an \"optimal\" curve in the class of generic planar\nimmersions with prescribed winding number and Arnold invariants.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"KbAufVqg9kSFbfMciPZZBbC3G_qDShZLsVQHtq0ShDc","pdfSize":"2059790"}
