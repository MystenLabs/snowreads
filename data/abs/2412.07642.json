The explicit $\\mu$-term is prohibited by modular\nsymmetry, and an effective $\\mu$-term is regenerated following the\nstabilization of the modulus field. We examine the stabilization mechanism of a\nsingle modulus field with the presence of SUSY breaking contributions described\nby the non-linear SUSY realization scheme involving a nilpotent Goldstino\n$\\textbf{X}_{nl}$ superfield. The inclusion of $\\textbf{X}_{nl}$ contributions\ncan slightly alter the original stabilized modulus VEV to a value near some\nfixed point. A natural small $\\mu_{eff}$, significantly smaller than the SUSY\nscale, can result from either the expansion of typical modular forms using a\nsmall deviation parameter near the fixed point $\\omega$, or from the combined\neffects of suppression by powers of $q^{1/24}$ [or $(2\\Im\\tau)^{-1}$] along\nwith the asymptotic suppression behavior of typical modular forms away from the\nfixed point $i\\infty$, taking the form of appropriate power of the tiny\ndeviation parameter.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6bpBfdq52r-UrYfZwCMO-HPQC9SLnXJ2Pbx-ZM550uQ","pdfSize":"688354"}
