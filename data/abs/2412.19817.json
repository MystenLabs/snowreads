A systematic investigation from the corporate finance\nperspective has not yet been formed. This paper combines bibliometric and\ncontent analysis methods to systematically review the evolutionary trend,\nstatus quo, hotspots and overall structure of research in digital\ntransformation from 2011 to 2024. The study reveals an emerging and rapidly\ngrowing focus on digital transformation research, particularly in developed\ncountries. We categorize the literature into three areas according to\nbibliometric clustering: the measurements (qualitative and quantitative),\nimpact factors (internal and external), and the economic consequences\n(investment, financing, and firm value). These areas are divided into ten\nsub-branches, with a detailed literature review. We also review the existing\ntheories related to digital transformation, identify the current gaps in these\npapers, and provide directions for future research on each sub-branches.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/General Finance","Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"p0xwULwQZKjb2K_sMZqKgVJ23_dN6jdrg7inZnNn-Ek","pdfSize":"2075855"}
