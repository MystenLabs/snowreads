  "abstract": "  Domain walls represent two-dimensional topological defects that emerge from\nthe spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetries in various new physics models.\nIn this study, we undertake the first calculation of gravitational waves\nproduced by scalar perturbations generated from the domain wall network. Our\nfindings indicate that the gravitational wave spectrum is notably distinct from\nthat of other sources. This opens up a promising avenue for future\ngravitational wave experiments aimed at exploring the role of domain walls in\nthe early Universe. Our results could significantly enhance the capabilities of\ngravitational wave experiments, serving as a valuable method for testing new\nphysics and better identifying diverse sources of gravitational waves.\n",
