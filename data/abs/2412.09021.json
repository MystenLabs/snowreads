  "abstract": "  Although pandemics are often studied as if populations are well-mixed,\ndisease transmission networks exhibit a multi-scale structure stretching from\nthe individual all the way up to the entire globe. The COVID-19 pandemic has\nled to an intense debate about whether interventions should prioritize public\nhealth or the economy, leading to a surge of studies analyzing the health and\neconomic costs of various response strategies. Here we show that describing\ndisease transmission in a self-similar (fractal) manner across multiple\ngeographic scales allows for the design of multi-scale containment measures\nthat substantially reduce both these costs. We characterize response strategies\nusing multi-scale reproduction numbers -- a generalization of the basic\nreproduction number $R_0$ -- that describe pandemic spread at multiple levels\nof scale and provide robust upper bounds on disease transmission. Stable\nelimination is guaranteed if there exists a scale such that the reproduction\nnumber among regions of that scale is less than $1$, even if the basic\nreproduction number $R_0$ is greater than $1$. We support our theoretical\nresults using simulations of a heterogeneous SIS model for disease spread in\nthe United States constructed using county-level commuting, air travel, and\npopulation data.\n",
