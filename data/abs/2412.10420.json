Reynolds in 1986, is one of the earliest\nemergent models where the global pattern emerges from the interaction between\nmany individuals within the local scale. In the original model, Boids follow\nthree rules: separation, alignment, and cohesion; which allow them to move\naround and create a flock without intention in the empty environment. In the\nreal world, however, the Boids' movement also faces obstacles preventing the\nflock's direction. In this project, I propose two new simple rules of the Boids\nmodel to represent the more realistic movement in nature and analyze the model\nfrom the physics perspective using the Monte Carlo method. From those results,\nthe physics metrics related to the forming of the flocking phenomenon show that\nit is reasonable to explain why birds or fishes prefer to move in a flock,\nrather than sole movement.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Computer Science/Mathematical Software","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TqVwlv9XXzzsmNletC8rHSfX2ibqHEyNs_zI4QIq57Y","pdfSize":"778326"}
