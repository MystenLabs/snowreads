We present an example of a realizable\nGauss diagram and an unrealizable Gauss diagram that differ only by a choice of\nthe Hamiltonian cycle. We present an example of two Gauss diagrams that\ncorrespond to different curves and differ only by a choice of the Hamiltonian\ncycle. We prove that a certain natural type of change of the Hamiltonian cycle\npreserves the realizability of the Gauss diagram.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vJCxKB0yc4a6L5o9dfCFzzNOkk3bqFOJ8ts4NyP0Ytw","pdfSize":"91284"}
