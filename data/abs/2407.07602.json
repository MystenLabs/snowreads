In this model, proximity coupling plays a pivotal\nrole, influencing the magnetization orientations of the graphene layers and\nsignificantly impacting the \\textit{in-plane} conductivity of the ${CrBr}_3$\nlayers. In this present work, we position the graphene bilayer between two\nlayers of the ferromagnetic insulator ${CrBr}_3$ to establish this\nconfiguration. Using density functional theory, we conduct detailed\ncomputations to analyze the electronic structure of this sandwiched system. Our\nfindings reveal a notable finite gap at specific \\textit{k}-points,\nparticularly evident in the antiparallel configuration of the magnetizations.\nThis finding represents a significant advancement in spintronics, underscoring\nthe potential of our spin valve prototype to drive innovation in electronic\ndevice technologies.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"m2Kq6tqIU7K8uQl-WQzOvpcpXHgPndwNbakua2JzjeQ","pdfSize":"1732945"}
