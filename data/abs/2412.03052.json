  "abstract": "  In recent years, the challenge of 3D shape analysis within point cloud data\nhas gathered significant attention in computer vision. Addressing the\ncomplexities of effective 3D information representation and meaningful feature\nextraction for classification tasks remains crucial. This paper presents\nPoint-GR, a novel deep learning architecture designed explicitly to transform\nunordered raw point clouds into higher dimensions while preserving local\ngeometric features. It introduces residual-based learning within the network to\nmitigate the point permutation issues in point cloud data. The proposed\nPoint-GR network significantly reduced the number of network parameters in\nClassification and Part-Segmentation compared to baseline graph-based networks.\nNotably, the Point-GR model achieves a state-of-the-art scene segmentation mean\nIoU of 73.47% on the S3DIS benchmark dataset, showcasing its effectiveness.\nFurthermore, the model shows competitive results in Classification and\nPart-Segmentation tasks.\n",
