It is particularly challenging in\nbin-picking applications, where objects may be textureless and in difficult\nposes, and occlusion between objects of the same type may cause confusion even\nin well-trained models. We propose a novel method of hard example synthesis\nthat is model-agnostic, using existing simulators and the modeling of pose\nerror in both the camera-to-object viewsphere and occlusion space. Through\nevaluation of the model performance with respect to the distribution of object\nposes and occlusions, we discover regions of high error and generate realistic\ntraining samples to specifically target these regions. With our training\napproach, we demonstrate an improvement in correct detection rate of up to 20%\nacross several ROBI-dataset objects using state-of-the-art pose estimation\nmodels.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"PG9-m1xEXqJHM33NPSvERJQH0EEaiF5jizH7i3iTuzg","pdfSize":"5531379"}
