It employs the KISS (KIDs Interferometer Spectrum Survey)\ninstrument coupled to a sky simulator and to sources such as point-like black\nbodies (simulating planets), a dipole (extended source) and a polarizer. We use\nfilled-arrays Lumped Element Kinetic Inductance Detectors (LEKIDs) since they\nhave multiple advantages when observing both in a photometry and in a\npolarimetry configuration\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bySGAzUsufXwZBttGMRU30ZpFyci4r0lv2Ygl4VNi_w","pdfSize":"36124868"}
