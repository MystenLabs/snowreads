  "abstract": "  In the last ten years a technique of Schur generating functions and\nHarish-Chandra transforms was developed for the study of the asymptotic\nbehavior of discrete particle systems and random matrices. In the current paper\nwe extend this toolbox in several directions. We establish general results\nwhich allow to access not only the Law of Large Numbers, but also next terms of\nthe asymptotic expansion of averaged empirical measures. In particular, this\nallows to obtain an analog of a discrete Baik-Ben Arous-Peche phase transition.\nA connection with infinitesimal free probability is shown and a quantized\nversion of infinitesimal free probability is introduced. Also, we establish the\nLaw of Large Numbers for several new regimes of growth of a Harish-Chandra\ntransform.\n",
