The primary focus is to assess the\nfeasibility of employing laser pulses exposed at the airfoil surface to\nmitigate TE noise. However, the weak pressure fluctuations accompanying TE\nnoise pose a challenge, as they are overshadowed by image sensor noise in\nhigh-speed cameras capturing PSP emission changes. A novel time-resolved\nphase-locking technique was introduced to address this issue, utilizing the\nsignal from a semiconductor pressure transducer at the trailing edge as a\nphase-lock trigger source. By repetitively conducting phase-locked measurements\n(1150 times), time series ensemble-averaged data based on PSP emission images\nwere obtained, enabling the capture of these subtle pressure fluctuations.\nQuantitatively, fluctuations with a dominant frequency of 679 Hz and an\namplitude of 50 Pa are resolved within an accuracy of about 15 Pa, achieved at\na recording rate of 19.2 kHz. Both the suppression and subsequent redevelopment\nof the pressure field with the TE noise offer valuable insights into the\ndynamics of TE noise and open avenues for targeted noise reduction strategies\nin aerodynamic applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"irTrVp_yQMbEamrcG67GVfa4-lUameXnkZDGQrfPw6A","pdfSize":"3799631"}
