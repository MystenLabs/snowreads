In the strong light--matter coupling\nlimit, multi-phonon contributions to the transition and dephasing rates\nstrongly dominate over single phonon contributions for typical molecular\nparameters. This leads to novel dependencies of the rates and spectral line\nwidths on the number of molecules in the cavity. We also find that vibrational\nLamb shifts can substantially modify the polariton energies in the strong\nlight--matter coupling limit.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BSo9LKGpxlCaH2N235tQpq1SeRJizSjQ9_VPaIQ13hY","pdfSize":"985434"}
