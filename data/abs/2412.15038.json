  "abstract": "  An optical flux lattice is a set of light beams that couple different\ninternal states of an atom, thereby producing topological energy bands. Here we\npresent a configuration in which the atoms exhibit a dark state, i.e. an\ninternal state that is not coupled to the light. At large light intensity, the\nlow-energy dynamics is restricted to the dark state, leading to an effective\ncontinuum model with a Landau-level-like structure. This structure is\ndramatically different from that of usual topological optical lattices, which\nlead to discrete models in the tight-binding limit. The proposed system is\nessentially immune to heating due to photon scattering, making it a highly\npromising way to emulate the integer or fractional quantum Hall effect.\n",
