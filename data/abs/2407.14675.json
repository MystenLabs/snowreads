The optimal control problem is\ntreated with Dynamic Programming techniques which require solving the\nHamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation on a suitable state space, with the\nreconstruction of the optimal controls made in the form of a static feedback.\nIn order to validate the numerical scheme without the complexity of the full\nmodel, this first study sets the problem in planar form, thus working in a\nfour-dimensional state space. We will study various techniques to speed up the\ncomputation, and assess the accuracy of the numerical solution.\n  This project is born from the attempt of evaluating and applying direct\nmethod of optimal control techniques based on Dynamic Programming as a\ncomplementary approach to the well known indirect methods, as Pontryagin or\nLawden. In particular, the final aim is to treat the case of low thrust engines\nfrom real use cases, in the full 3-D problem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uarisfpVcP3sA47dtnEEKlk9Iip3TOINIe2ofM2xXWE","pdfSize":"1653040"}
