{"id":"2412.06811","title":"Capillary phenomena: New fundamental formula","authors":"Noureddine Djama","authorsParsed":[["Djama","Noureddine",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 11:04:03 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-11","timestamp":1732791843000,"abstract":"  This study proposes a new fundamental formula that describes in a more\ncoherent way, the rise and fall of liquids in capillaries. The variation of the\ncontact angle classically associated with these phenomena appears to be the\nindirect result of a more authentic physical parameter, which we call the\napparent capillary range. This range depends on factors expected to affect the\ncontact angle, such as liquid-solid adhesion forces, liquid-liquid cohesion\nforces, liquid density, gravitational forces and the geometric shape of the\ncapillary section. Our main objective in this work is not to criticize the\nclassical theory, a task that has been largely accomplished, but to present a\nmore general and coherent approach, which perfectly reconciles the\nthermodynamic and mechanical points of view and makes the interpretation of\nvarious configurations clearer. This new perspective can serve as a platform to\nguide researcher's efforts toward more promising results. In the first part of\nthis work, we discuss the theoretical basis of the new formula using common\nexamples. In the second part, we introduce the more explicit form of this\nformula, thus allowing a more precise quantification of wettability by\nproviding access to the direct measurement of liquid-solid adhesive forces. The\nthird part proposes a method for measuring static surface tension without the\nadverse effects of the substrate.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"lu546pzMgZeY6gKAmIAP3_ZxK-yQXb7Zf60emDRGK90","pdfSize":"1526757"}
