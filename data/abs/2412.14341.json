  "abstract": "  Natural protein sequences serve as a natural record of the evolutionary\nconstraints that shape their functional structures. We show that it is possible\nto use sequence information to go beyond predicting native structures and\nglobal stability to infer the folding dynamics of globular proteins. The one-\nand two-body evolutionary energy fields at the amino-acid level are mapped to a\ncoarse-grained description of folding, where proteins are divided into\ncontiguous folding elements, commonly referred to as foldons. For 15 diverse\nprotein families, we calculated the folding dynamics of hundreds of proteins by\nsimulating an Ising chain of foldons, with their energetics determined by the\namino acid sequences. We show that protein topology imposes limits on the\nvariability of folding cooperativity within a family. While most beta and\nalpha/beta structures exhibit only a few possible mechanisms despite high\nsequence diversity, alpha topologies allow for diverse folding scenarios among\nfamily members. We show that both the stability and cooperativity changes\ninduced by mutations can be computed directly using sequence-based evolutionary\nmodels.\n",
