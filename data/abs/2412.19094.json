  "abstract": "  We explore a KSVZ-like extension of the Standard Model with a Dirac fermion\nand three right-handed neutrinos. PQ symmetry allows the Dirac mass for\nneutrinos and prevents the Majorana mass. A $\\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry guarantees\nthe stability of Dirac fermion dark matter. The breakdown of PQ symmetry\ngenerates the QCD axion at a high scale. The fermion dark matter relic\nabundance arises from the UV-freeze-in mechanism through the axion portal. We\ndetermine the fermion DM relic by solving stiff Boltzmann equations and finding\nthe allowed parameter space using the relic density constraints. Having\ndetermined the allowed parameter space for fermion DM, we also look for the\ntwo-component scenario where the axion produced from the misalignment mechanism\ncan co-exist as DM too. We find that both FIMP and axion dark matter have\nsufficient parameter space that is not excluded while considering several\ncurrent bounds and future sensitivities on axion and dark matter. Our study\nhighlights the interlinking of dark matter, axion, and neutrinos while\naddressing the strong CP problem and small neutrino masses.\n",
