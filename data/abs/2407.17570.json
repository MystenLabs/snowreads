Utilizing JWST NIRCam Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS), we\nperform a systematic search for broad-line ${\\rm H\\alpha}$ emitters (BHAEs) at\n$z\\approx 4-5$ in 25 fields of the ASPIRE (A SPectroscopic survey of biased\nhalos In the Reionization Era) project, covering a total area of 275\narcmin$^2$. We identify 16 BHAEs with FWHM of the broad components spanning\nfrom $\\sim$ 1000 km s$^{-1}$ to 3000 km s$^{-1}$. Assuming the broad linewidths\narise due to Doppler broadening around BHs, the implied BH masses range from\n$10^7$ to $10^{8}~M_\\odot$, with broad ${\\rm H\\alpha}$-converted bolometric\nluminosity of $10^{44.5}-10^{45.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and Eddington ratios of\n$0.07-0.47$. The spatially extended structure of the F200W stacked image may\ntrace the stellar light from the host galaxies. The ${\\rm H\\alpha}$ luminosity\nfunction indicates an increasing AGN fraction towards the higher ${\\rm\nH\\alpha}$ luminosities. We find possible evidence for clustering of BHAEs: two\nsources are at the same redshift with a projected separation of 519 kpc; one\nBHAE appears as a composite system residing in an overdense region with three\nclose companion ${\\rm H\\alpha}$ emitters. Three BHAEs exhibit blueshifted\nabsorption troughs indicative of the presence of high-column-density gas. We\nfind the broad-line and photometrically selected BHAE samples exhibit different\ndistributions in the optical continuum slopes, which can be attributed to their\ndifferent selection methods. The ASPIRE broad-line ${\\rm H\\alpha}$ sample\nprovides a good database for future studies of faint AGN populations at high\nredshift.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JEWjyIyUe6NnW8ouOZRZZ4HY-DH0yHu-g8_MiWs_RuI","pdfSize":"4060722","objectId":"0xcda61214ddb37782e6c73f22cf7e4d6a7a7fd8e0c7da6c480d9f37159c5126a1","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
