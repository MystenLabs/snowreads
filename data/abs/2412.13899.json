  "abstract": "  A first-principles approach for calculating ion separation in solution\nthrough two-dimensional (2D) membranes is proposed and applied. Ionic energy\nprofiles across the membrane are obtained first, where solvation effects are\nsimulated explicitly with machine-learning molecular dynamics, electrostatic\ncorrections are applied to remove finite-size capacitive effects, and a\nmean-field treatment of the charging of the electrochemical double layer is\nused. Entropic contributions are assessed analytically and validated against\nthermodynamic integration. Ionic separations are then inferred through a\nmicrokinetic model of the filtration process, accounting for steady-state\ncharge separation effects across the membrane. The approach is applied to\nLi$^{+}$, Na$^{+}$, K$^{+}$ sieving through a crown-ether functionalized\ngraphene membrane, with a case study of the mechanisms for a highly selective\nand efficient extraction of lithium from aqueous solutions.\n",
