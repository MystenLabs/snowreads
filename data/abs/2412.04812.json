Engaging and developing deep learning\ntechniques can help to analyse large and diverse medical data, including brain\nscans, medical reports and other sensor information, such as EEG, ECG, EMG and\nso on. Despite the common data standardisation challenge within medical image\nanalysis domain, the future of deep learning in stroke outcome prediction lie\nin using multimodal information, including final infarct data, to achieve\nbetter prediction of long-term functional outcomes. This article provides a\nbroad review of recent advances and applications of deep learning in the\nprediction of stroke outcomes, including (i) the data and models used, (ii) the\nprediction tasks and measures of success, (iii) the current challenges and\nlimitations, and (iv) future directions and potential benefits. This\ncomprehensive review aims to provide researchers, clinicians, and policy makers\nwith an up-to-date understanding of this rapidly evolving and promising field.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"vr-HZx4ZEiO8SMVLGEAQiblrGnlNUNL8qC4rBJc63hI","pdfSize":"3334226"}
