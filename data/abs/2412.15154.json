  "abstract": "  The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a long-baseline neutrino\noscillation experiment aiming to measure the oscillation parameters with an\nunprecedented precision that will allow determining the CP violation phase in\nthe leptonic sector and the neutrino mass ordering. The Far Detector of DUNE\nwill consist of four 17 kton liquid argon Time Projection Chambers (LAr-TPC).\nInside a LAr-TPC, a Photon Detection System (PDS) is needed to detect the\nscintillation light produced by the interacting particles. The PDS signal\nprovides the interaction time for non-beam events and improves the calorimetric\nreconstruction. To validate DUNE technology, two large-scale prototypes, of 750\nton of LAr each, have been constructed at CERN, ProtoDUNE-HD and ProtoDUNE-VD.\nThe PDS of both prototypes is based on the XArapuca concept, a SiPM-based\ndevice that provides good detection efficiency covering large surfaces at a\nreasonable cost. This document presents the preliminary performance of the\nProtoDUNE-HD Photon Detection System, which has taken data from April to\nNovember 2024.\n",
