In this context, there is a growing need for\nopen-source industry-grade exemplars of languages with available language\nengineering artifacts, in particular, editors and notations for supporting the\ncreation of models based on a single metamodel in different representations\n(e.g., textual, graphical, and tabular ones). These exemplars can support the\ndevelopment of advanced solutions to address the practical challenges posed by\nblended modeling requirements.\n  As one such exemplar, this paper introduces EATXT, a textual concrete syntax\nfor automotive architecture modeling with EAST-ADL, developed in cooperation\nwith an industry partner in the automotive domain. The EATXT editor is based on\nXtext and provides basic and advanced features, such as an improved\ncontent-assist and serialization specifically addressing blended modeling\nrequirements. We present the editor features and architecture, the\nimplementation approach, and previous use of EATXT in research. The EATXT\neditor is publicly available, rendering it a valuable resource for language\ndevelopers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"H2VghtC4AuNSq5Ne8OC9mIhhj-4fryMoQNUxr49wIeI","pdfSize":"4421878"}
