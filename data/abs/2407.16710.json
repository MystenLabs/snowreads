Consequently, the solid-state detectors used in the experiments\nwill exhibit more severe radiation-induced damage. To ensure sufficiently long\nsensor lifetimes, alternative materials to the established silicon sensors,\nwith improved resilience to radiation, are investigated. For one of the\npromising candidate materials, silicon carbide, only recently a model\ndescribing the radiation damage in technology aided computer design (TCAD)\nsimulations has been proposed.\n  In this paper we present our latest achievements towards modeling radiation\ndamage of 4H-SiC in TCAD tools. We first verify the utilized TCAD framework\nagainst published silicon data and then use it to approximate measurements of\nneutron-irradiated 4H-SiC particle detectors. We are able to confirm in\nsimulations the measurement results, i.e., an almost flat capacitance as a\nfunction of bias voltage and a decreasing forward current with increasing\nparticle fluence. Based on our simulations we are able to explain the latter by\ntrapped charge carriers that create a space charge region within the device.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wEPvCoL0ymAPmezl0z-jCQijGK5bQ0qgYLMfkPk4Vhs","pdfSize":"518928"}
