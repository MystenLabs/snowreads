Nevertheless, the hindrances posed by gravity's nonlinearity can be\ncircumvented by focusing on the strict extreme mass ratio limit, in which one\nof the black holes is infinitely larger than the other. Such an approach has\nbeen developed by Emparan and Mart\\'inez and applied within General Relativity\nto investigate the time evolution of event horizons melding, using nothing but\nelementary concepts in gravitational physics and simple integrations of\ngeodesics. We apply this strategy to study black hole mergers in higher\nderivative gravity, in order to assess how the defining characteristics of the\nfusion process change as the gravitational theory is modified. We adopt the\ncase of Einsteinian cubic gravity for concreteness, and determine how the\nmergers' duration and the relative area increment change as the theory's single\ncoupling parameter is varied.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mH3KxKnIOzgFODZLaKfgUyg3NzQ6ZSpSECoyUv_PONY","pdfSize":"1032388"}
