However, existing approaches prioritize\nprediction accuracy without considering deployment constraints or the dynamism\nof network traffic, leading to potentially suboptimal performance. Because of\nthis, deploying ML models in real-world networks with tight performance\nconstraints remains an open challenge. In contrast with existing work that aims\nto select an optimal candidate model for each task based on offline\ninformation, we propose an online, system-driven approach to dynamically select\nthe best ML model for network traffic analysis. To this end, we present Cruise\nControl, a system that pre-trains several models for a given task with\ndifferent accuracy-cost tradeoffs and selects the most appropriate model based\non lightweight signals representing the system's current traffic processing\nability. Experimental results using two real-world traffic analysis tasks\ndemonstrate Cruise Control's effectiveness in adapting to changing network\nconditions. Our evaluation shows that Cruise Control improves median accuracy\nby 2.78% while reducing packet loss by a factor of four compared to\noffline-selected models.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"5v74ECn6mLEPKFYckLlWaCR9cKCBT8WKGZGviEUzvjc","pdfSize":"1361962"}
