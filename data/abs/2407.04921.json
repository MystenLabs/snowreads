Focusing on aortic root landmark localization, the three hinge\npoints of the aortic valve can reduce the burden by automatically determining\nthe valve size required for transcatheter aortic valve implantation surgery.\nExisting methods for landmark prediction of the aortic root mainly use\ntime-consuming two-step estimation methods. We propose a highly accurate\none-step landmark localization method from even coarse images. The proposed\nmethod uses an optimal transport loss to break the trade-off between prediction\nprecision and learning stability in conventional heatmap regression methods. We\napply the proposed method to the 3D CT image dataset collected at Sendai Kousei\nHospital and show that it significantly improves the estimation error over\nexisting methods and other loss functions. Our code is available on GitHub.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xmlpWxPmIepgRz6IJ_XNYxeXSfGj0CdOV6ahWikgM14","pdfSize":"1398078"}
