However, finding all structures compatible with reflectometry data is\ncomputationally prohibitive for standard algorithms, which typically results in\nunreliable analysis with only a single potential solution identified. We\naddress this lack of reliability with a probabilistic deep learning method that\nidentifies all realistic structures in seconds, setting new standards in\nreflectometry. Our method, Prior-Amortized Neural Posterior Estimation (PANPE),\ncombines simulation-based inference with novel adaptive priors that inform the\ninference network about known structural properties and controllable\nexperimental conditions. PANPE networks support key scenarios such as\nhigh-throughput sample characterization, real-time monitoring of evolving\nstructures, or the co-refinement of several experimental data sets, and can be\nadapted to provide fast, reliable, and flexible inference across many other\ninverse problems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"_WU18EfnL91uplL0VORaqUn_8MOGvLBODVXjTaPDWHs","pdfSize":"7229482"}
