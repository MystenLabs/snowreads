This\nstructure is considered as a diquark-antidiquark state built of scalar diquark\nand antidiquark components. The mass and current coupling of $T_{\n\\mathrm{2bc}}$ are evaluated in the context of the two-point sum rule approach.\nThe full width of this tetraquark is estimated by taking into account two types\nof its possible strong decay channels. First class includes dissociation of\n$T_{\\mathrm{2bc}}$ to mesons $\\eta_c\\eta_{b}$, $ B_{c}^{+}B_{c}^{-}$,\n$B_{c}^{\\ast +}B_{c}^{\\ast -}$ and $ B_{c}^{+}(1^3P_{0})B_{c}^{\\ast-}$. Another\ntype of processes are generated by annihilations $\\overline{b}b \\to\n\\overline{q}q$ of constituent $b$-quarks which produces the final-state charmed\nmeson pairs $D^{+}D^{-}$, $D^{0} \\overline{D}^{0}$, $D^{*+}D^{*-}$, and\n$D^{*0}\\overline{D}^{*0}$. Partial width all of these decays are found using\nthe three-point sum rule method which is required to calculate strong couplings\nat corresponding meson-meson-tetraquark vertices. Predictions obtained for the\nmass $m=(12697 \\pm 90)~\\mathrm{MeV}$ and width $\\Gamma[T_{\\mathrm{2bc}}]=(142.4\n\\pm 16.9)~ \\mathrm{MeV}$ of the state $T_{\\mathrm{2bc}}$ are compared with\nalternative results, and are useful for further experimental investigations of\nfully heavy resonances.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sRtG26oLS63JbW2ceGQLFsSzg0C9Ma3objd2ZHxj1B8","pdfSize":"341614"}
