Current research on tool learning with\nLLMs often assumes mandatory tool use, which does not always align with\nreal-world situations, where the necessity for tools is uncertain, and\nincorrect or unnecessary use of tools can damage the general abilities of LLMs.\nTherefore, we propose to explore whether LLMs can discern their ability\nboundaries and use tools flexibly. We then introduce the Whether-or-not tool\nusage Evaluation benchmark (WTU-Eval) to assess LLMs with eleven datasets,\nwhere six of them are tool-usage datasets, and five are general datasets. LLMs\nare prompted to use tools according to their needs. The results of eight LLMs\non WTU-Eval reveal that LLMs frequently struggle to determine tool use in\ngeneral datasets, and LLMs' performance in tool-usage datasets improves when\ntheir ability is similar to ChatGPT. In both datasets, incorrect tool usage\nsignificantly impairs LLMs' performance. To mitigate this, we also develop the\nfinetuning dataset to enhance tool decision-making. Fine-tuning Llama2-7B\nresults in a 14\\% average performance improvement and a 16.8\\% decrease in\nincorrect tool usage. We will release the WTU-Eval benchmark.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4p0BAkpLNeV-9xa7kpTy3Ge6g_0IsQBJRvsRvrGVcU8","pdfSize":"2148712","objectId":"0x315f50eb91e21cd888fff26d3f2f093379c84f9c37a41999779c167406c74366","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
