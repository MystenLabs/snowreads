  "abstract": "  We propose 4Real-Video, a novel framework for generating 4D videos, organized\nas a grid of video frames with both time and viewpoint axes. In this grid, each\nrow contains frames sharing the same timestep, while each column contains\nframes from the same viewpoint. We propose a novel two-stream architecture. One\nstream performs viewpoint updates on columns, and the other stream performs\ntemporal updates on rows. After each diffusion transformer layer, a\nsynchronization layer exchanges information between the two token streams. We\npropose two implementations of the synchronization layer, using either hard or\nsoft synchronization. This feedforward architecture improves upon previous work\nin three ways: higher inference speed, enhanced visual quality (measured by\nFVD, CLIP, and VideoScore), and improved temporal and viewpoint consistency\n(measured by VideoScore and Dust3R-Confidence).\n",
