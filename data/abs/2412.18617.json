In education, many GenAI tools have been developed to aid teachers\nin preparing proper educational material and offering personalized learning to\ntheir students, tailored to their educational needs. In this paper, we present\na custom GPT (IBL Educator GPT) that is designed and developed based on\nInquiry-based Learning and offers physics teachers a framework in which they\ncan interact with ChatGPT and design educational strategies. The utilization of\nthe IBL Educator GPT has led to an improvement in teachers' perspectives\nregarding the adoption of artificial intelligence-based tools for personalizing\nteaching.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VXgvZMJmjdPwRRKtVlm7efTj-IIMG5fYT0qjVnpNJvo","pdfSize":"436330"}
