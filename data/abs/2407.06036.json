In the integrable\nchain with nearest-neighbor (NN) interactions, the nature, origin, and decay of\npost-transition oscillations are tied to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM).\nHowever, when coupling to the next nearest neighbor (NNN) is added, the\nresulting nonintegrable Ising chain (still in the quantum Ising chain\nuniversality class) supports persistent post-transition oscillation: KZM-like\noscillations turn into persistent oscillations of transverse magnetization.\nTheir longevity in our simulations is likely limited only by the numerical\naccuracy. Their period differs from the decaying KZM oscillation but their\namplitude depends on quench rate. Moreover, they can be excited by driving in\nresonance with the excitations' energy gap. Thus, while one might have expected\nthat the integrability-breaking NNN coupling would facilitate relaxation, the\noscillations we identify are persistent. At low to medium transverse fields,\nthey are associated with Cooper pairs of Bogoliubov quasiparticles -- kinks.\nThis oscillation of the pair condensate is a manifestation of quantum\ncoherence.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LvD8NtmpJzm87L3Vd9TO-MyovR2vLzeX6Lrvsuu1bGA","pdfSize":"1376861"}
