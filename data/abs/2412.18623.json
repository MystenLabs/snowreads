A total restrained coalition is made up of two disjoint sets of\nvertices $X$ and $Y$ of $G$, neither of which is a TRD-set but their union\n$X\\cup Y$ is a TRD-set. A total restrained coalition partition of a graph $G$\nis a partition $\\Phi=\\{V_1, V_2,\\dots,V_k\\}$ such that for all $i \\in [k]$, the\nset $V_i$ forms a total restrained coalition with another set $V_j$ for some\n$j$, where $j\\in [k]\\setminus{i}$. The total restrained coalition number\n$C_{tr}(G)$ in $G$ equals the maximum order of a total restrained coalition\npartition in $G$. In this work, we initiate the study of total restrained\ncoalition in graphs and its properties.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"6YuRuf_Sg8o8BAiURkdRZQJiWeH4dJTHkQwoelrp4_o","pdfSize":"184815"}
