However, computing phonon-mediated properties in MOFs, like thermal\nexpansion and mechanical stability, remains challenging due to the large number\nof atoms per unit cell, making traditional Density Functional Theory (DFT)\nmethods impractical for high-throughput screening. Recent advances in machine\nlearning potentials have led to foundation atomistic models, such as MACE-MP-0,\nthat accurately predict equilibrium structures but struggle with phonon\nproperties of MOFs. In this work, we developed a workflow for computing phonons\nin MOFs within the quasi-harmonic approximation with a fine-tuned MACE model,\nMACE-MP-MOF0. The model was trained on a curated dataset of 127 representative\nand diverse MOFs. The fine-tuned MACE-MP-MOF0 improves the accuracy of phonon\ndensity of states and corrects the imaginary phonon modes of MACE-MP-0,\nenabling high-throughput phonon calculations with state-of-the-art precision.\nThe model successfully predicts thermal expansion and bulk moduli in agreement\nwith DFT and experimental data for several well-known MOFs. These results\nhighlight the potential of MACE-MP-MOF0 in guiding MOF design for applications\nin energy storage and thermoelectrics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TURBQSmqG2FQ1egqRxsbtbp1kGqCyubSzJVrbB93a5E","pdfSize":"2498558"}
