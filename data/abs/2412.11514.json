This extends and\nunifies the finiteness characterisations previously known for euclidean spaces\nand for finitely generated groups and their duals. We place particular emphasis\non Fourier invariance throughout, reflecting the fundamental Fourier invariance\nof Brascamp--Lieb multilinear forms in this context.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"s9bopFc5CC84TYcWFtsj0XGKLb8PA6pZz4-yEdqTmuc","pdfSize":"333607"}
