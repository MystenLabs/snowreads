Public-key cryptosystems relying on prime\nfactorization or discrete logarithms are particularly vulnerable, whereas block\nciphers (BCs) remain secure through increased key lengths. In this study, we\nintroduce a novel quantum implementation of SLIM, a lightweight block cipher\noptimized for 32-bit plaintext and an 80-bit key, based on a Feistel structure.\nThis implementation distinguishes itself from other BC quantum implementations\nin its class (64-128-bit) by utilizing a minimal number of qubits while\nmaintaining robust cryptographic strength and efficiency. By employing an\ninnovative design that minimizes qubit usage, this work highlights SLIM's\npotential as a resource-efficient and secure candidate for quantum-resistant\nencryption protocols.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computer Science/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zy67BX2NNlQZvFbOxLwubeTVV9M8RGmwBxaA4PP2K-Y","pdfSize":"2463680"}
