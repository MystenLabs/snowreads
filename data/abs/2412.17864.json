  "abstract": "  Growing demand for high data rates is driving interest in the upper mid-band\n(FR 3) spectrum (6-24 GHz). While some propagation measurements exist in\nliterature, the impact of vegetation on link performance remains\nunder-explored. This study examines vegetation-induced losses in an urban\nscenario across 6-18 GHz. A simple method for calculating vegetation depth is\nintroduced, along with a model that quantifies additional attenuation based on\nvegetation depth and frequency, divided into 1 GHz sub-bands. We see that\nexcess vegetation loss increases with vegetation depth and higher frequencies.\nThese findings provide insights for designing reliable, foliage-aware\ncommunication networks in FR 3.\n",
