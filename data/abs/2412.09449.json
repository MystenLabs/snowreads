Surprisingly, we find that the dimensionally reduced\nfour-dimensional theory does not violate NEC and therefore we do not see either\na bouncing or an ekpyrotic phase. Instead, our four-dimensional setup shows a\ntransient de Sitter phase that lies well within the trans-Planckian bound. This\nopens up a myriad of possibilities of addressing both phenomenological and\ncosmological issues, and here we concentrate on one such interesting model, an\naxionic cosmology with temporally varying axionic coupling.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1wIhS6jc2gp2hnE95n_l9xBVfy_l4k_5hCj9czFORzk","pdfSize":"215210"}
