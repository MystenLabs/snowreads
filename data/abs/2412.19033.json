  "abstract": "  This paper investigates the connection between neural networks and sufficient\ndimension reduction (SDR), demonstrating that neural networks inherently\nperform SDR in regression tasks under appropriate rank regularizations.\nSpecifically, the weights in the first layer span the central mean subspace. We\nestablish the statistical consistency of the neural network-based estimator for\nthe central mean subspace, underscoring the suitability of neural networks in\naddressing SDR-related challenges. Numerical experiments further validate our\ntheoretical findings, and highlight the underlying capability of neural\nnetworks to facilitate SDR compared to the existing methods. Additionally, we\ndiscuss an extension to unravel the central subspace, broadening the scope of\nour investigation.\n",
