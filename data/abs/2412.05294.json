  "abstract": "  Due to the processes that occur during the functioning of modern\nelectromechanical systems, these systems can be considered complex nonlinear\ndynamic systems from the point of view of the theory of dynamic systems. The\nmovement of such systems is completely determined by external influences acting\non the EMS, their parameters, and initial operating conditions. The\nabove-mentioned factors complicate the study of electromechanical systems and,\nin the general case, make it impossible to use classical methods of analyzing\nthe dynamics of the EMS since the latter neglect the features of nonlinear\nsystems and describe their dynamics using ordinary linear differential\nequations with constant coefficients. At the same time, many methods and\napproaches have been developed in control theory for analyzing stability and\nsynthesizing motion trajectories based on linear differential equations.\nTherefore, an important task arises to create mathematical models of nonlinear\nEMS that consider the peculiarities of their motion but have a form similar to\nlinear models.\n",
