  "abstract": "  Electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves are discrete electromagnetic\nemissions separated by multiple ion gyrofrequencies. Harmonic EMIC waves are\ndefined as waves with a strong electric or magnetic field (or both) at the\nharmonics of the fundamental EMIC mode. In this paper, for the first time, we\npresent a statistical study on harmonic EMIC waves by the Van Allen Probes. The\nEMIC waves are categorized into three types based on their harmonics: (1)\nfundamental mode only (without higher harmonics), (2) electrostatic (ES)\nharmonics, and (3) electromagnetic (EM) harmonics. Our statistical study shows\nthat ES and EM harmonic EMIC waves predominantly occur on the dayside, outside\nthe plasmasphere with $L >5$ and are associated with a low $f_{pe}/f_{ce}$, a\nhigh proton $\\beta_H$, and a strong fundamental EMIC mode. The results will\nadvance our understanding of harmonic EMIC waves and their generation\nmechanisms.\n",
