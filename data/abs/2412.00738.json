Using the unique\ncontinuation property of the fractional Laplacian, we further prove the unique\ncontinuation of the fractional divergent beam ray transform for both vector\nfields and symmetric 2-tensor fields. Additionally, we derive explicit\nreconstruction formulas and stability results for vector fields and symmetric\n2-tensor fields in terms of fractional divergent beam ray transform data.\nFinally, we conclude by proving a unique continuation result for the divergent\nbeam ray transform for functions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"c2sxU3Bxzd-CZlN2O_0a_c0aMQGuOBWe30OlVbpD5gY","pdfSize":"428282"}
