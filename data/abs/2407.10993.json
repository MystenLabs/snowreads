We\nextend an existing personality-driven conversational agent framework by\nintegrating LLM-based conversation support tailored to an educational\napplication. We describe a user study built on this system to evaluate two\ndistinct personality styles: high extroversion and agreeableness and low\nextroversion and agreeableness. For each personality style, we assess three\nmodels: (1) a dialogue-only model that conveys personality through dialogue,\n(2) an animated human model that expresses personality solely through dialogue,\nand (3) an animated human model that expresses personality through both\ndialogue and body and facial animations. The results indicate that all models\nare positively perceived regarding both personality and learning outcomes.\nModels with high personality traits are perceived as more engaging than those\nwith low personality traits. We provide a comprehensive quantitative and\nqualitative analysis of perceived personality traits, learning parameters, and\nuser experiences based on participant ratings of the model types and\npersonality styles, as well as users' responses to open-ended questions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NGDp1FQmywA7mWMLRkw-J5B6V8TzWOf5GuSEeDr3TRQ","pdfSize":"6123203"}
