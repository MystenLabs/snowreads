They are believed to arise from the rapid unpinning of\nvortices in the neutron star inner crust. The analogy between the inner crust\nof neutron stars and dipolar supersolids allows to investigate glitches.\nEmploying such analogy, we numerically analyze the vortex trapping mechanism\nand how the matter density distribution influences glitches. These results pave\nthe way for the quantum simulation of celestial bodies in laboratories.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"isrxH7ibO7_G4BiLuFquj4NkTXJfWqC4RYgAf4YN2Hc","pdfSize":"7334663"}
