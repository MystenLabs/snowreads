  "abstract": "  The neutron capture cross-section for the $^{181}$Ta(n,$\\gamma$)$^{182}$Ta\nreaction has been experimentally measured at the neutron energies 0.53 and 1.05\nMeV using off-line $\\gamma$-ray spectrometry.\n$^{115}$In(n,n'$\\gamma$)$^{115m}$In is used as a reference monitor reaction\ncross-section. The neutron was produced via the $^{7}$Li(p,n)$^{7}$Be reaction.\nThe present study measures the cross-sections with their uncertainties and\ncorrelation matrix. The self-attenuation process, $\\gamma$-ray correction\nfactor, and low background neutron energy contribution have been calculated.\nThe measured neutron spectrum averaged cross-sections of\n$^{181}$Ta(n,$\\gamma$)$^{182}$Ta are discussed and compared with the existing\ndata from the EXFOR database and also with the ENDF/B-VIII.0, TENDL-2019,\nJENDL-5, JEFF-3.3 evaluated data libraries.\n",
