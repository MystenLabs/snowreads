Our focus is on the existence of allocations that give each agent their\nmaximin fair share--the value they are guaranteed if they divide the goods into\nas many bundles as there are agents, and receive their lowest valued bundle. An\nMMS allocation is one where every agent receives at least their maximin fair\nshare. We examine the existence of such allocations when agents have cost\nutilities. In this setting, each item has an associated cost, and an agent's\nvaluation for an item is the cost of the item if it is useful to them, and zero\notherwise.\n  Our main results indicate that cost utilities are a promising restriction for\nachieving MMS. We show that for the case of three agents with cost utilities,\nan MMS allocation always exists. We also show that when preferences are\nrestricted slightly further--to what we call laminar set approvals--we can\nguarantee MMS allocations for any number of agents. Finally, we explore if it\nis possible to guarantee each agent their maximin fair share while using a\nstrategyproof mechanism.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CNvCj7SHopLhPCEhI4LxPaav7gK5ouPjejpPnp9rtG0","pdfSize":"605626"}
