Observation of this\nangular pattern is the ``smoking gun'' that GWs are present, so PTAs\n``reconstruct the HD curve'' by estimating the correlation using pulsar pairs\nseparated by similar angles. Several studies have examined the amount by which\nthis curve is expected to differ from the HD mean. The variance arises because\n(a) a finite set of pulsars at specific sky locations is used, (b) the GW\nsources interfere, and (c) the data are contaminated by noise. Here, for a\nGaussian ensemble of sources, we predict that variance by constructing an\noptimal estimator of the HD correlation, taking into account the pulsar sky\nlocations and the frequency distribution of the GWs and the pulsar noise. The\nvariance is a ratio: the numerator depends upon the pulsar sky locations, and\nthe denominator is the (effective) number of frequency bins for which the GW\nsignal dominates the noise. In effect, after suitable combination, each\nfrequency bin gives an independent estimate of the HD correlation.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oqJOxDSY_7KHnhxkbZREWc9R3KNI8k71r8IZkXpUrxQ","pdfSize":"584934"}
