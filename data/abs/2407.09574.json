So, the operation\nof these devices can be enhanced by clever design of a nanoscopic, quantum\nmechanical system where the quantum coherence plays a crucial role in this\nprocess. In this investigation, we develop a donor-acceptor two-level trap\ndipole model converging the key role of quantum coherence and aggregation\neffects along with different initial states. Our analysis reveals that\nquenching unwanted emissions is achievable by preparing the system in specific\ninitial state under the effect of optimal spatial aggregation. Interestingly it\nis observed that characterizing aggregation-induced properties and quantum\neffects of bandgap engineering can increase the power enhancement up to 35.87%\ncompared with classical counterparts. This encouraging trend suggests a\npromising novel design aspect of nature-mimicking photovoltaic devices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UNVbyVElfNxcUPAq7a6QUJHuyW3Xb7E3_1Hzjn5hWYU","pdfSize":"316556","objectId":"0x11afbc9fa681c59acb8f9027c6e800a106448627f0440b03aef9e0ef70697516","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
