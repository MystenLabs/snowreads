We study\nexperimentally three conjectures stated by Mazur and Tate using SageMath. Our\nfindings indicate discrepancies in some of the original statements of some of\nthe conjectures presented by Mazur and Tate. However, a slight modification on\nthe statement of these conjectures does appear to hold.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TQInVh6yB0rv3_Olq-_StxwpTjy4HWidIYQu-xFmxn0","pdfSize":"275149"}
