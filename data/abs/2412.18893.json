  "abstract": "  A connected graph $\\Gamma$ of diameter ${\\rm diam}(\\Gamma) \\ge \\ell$ is\n$\\ell$-distance-balanced if $|W_{xy}(\\Gamma)|=|W_{yx}(\\Gamma)|$ for every\n$x,y\\in V(\\Gamma)$ with $d_{\\Gamma}(x,y)=\\ell$, where $W_{xy}(\\Gamma)$ is the\nset of vertices of $\\Gamma$ that are closer to $x$ than to $y$. $\\Gamma$ is\nsaid to be highly distance-balanced if it is $\\ell$-distance-balanced for every\n$\\ell\\in [{\\rm diam}(\\Gamma)]$. It is proved that every cubic Cayley graph\nwhose generating set is one of $\\{a,a^{n-1},ba^r\\}$ and $\\{a^k,a^{n-k},ba^t\\}$\nis highly distance-balanced. This partially solves a problem posed by\nMiklavi\\v{c} and \\v{S}parl.\n",
