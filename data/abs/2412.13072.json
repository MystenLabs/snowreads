  "abstract": "  We study the class of functions on Lipschitz-graph domains satisfying a\ndifferential-oscillation condition and show that such functions are\n$\\epsilon$-approximable. As a consequence we obtain the quantitative Fatou\ntheorem in the spirit of works e.g. by Garnett and Bortz-Hofmann. Such a class\ncontains harmonic functions, as well as non-harmonic ones, for example\nnonnegative subharmonic functions, as illustrated by our discussion.\n",
