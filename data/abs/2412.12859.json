  "abstract": "  We study a Bayesian persuasion problem with externalities. In this model, a\nprincipal sends signals to inform multiple agents about the state of the world.\nSimultaneously, due to the existence of externalities in the agents' utilities,\nthe principal also acts as a correlation device to correlate the agents'\nactions. We consider the setting where the agents are categorized into a small\nnumber of types. Agents of the same type share identical utility functions and\nare treated equitably in the utility functions of both other agents and the\nprincipal. We study the problem of computing optimal signaling strategies for\nthe principal, under three different types of signaling channels: public,\nprivate, and semi-private. Our results include revelation-principle-style\ncharacterizations of optimal signaling strategies, linear programming\nformulations, and analysis of in/tractability of the optimization problems. It\nis demonstrated that when the maximum number of deviating agents is bounded by\na constant, our LP-based formulations compute optimal signaling strategies in\npolynomial time. Otherwise, the problems are NP-hard.\n",
