  "abstract": "  We construct infinitely many examples of macroscopically large manifolds of\ndimension $m \\geq 4$ equipped with circle bundles whose total spaces admit\nmetrics of positive scalar curvature and have macroscopic dimension at most\n$\\lceil m/2 \\rceil + 1$. In particular, we answer a question of Gromov on the\nexistence of circle bundles over enlargeable manifolds whose total spaces admit\nmetrics of positive scalar curvature, in all dimensions. Our constructions are\nbased on techniques from symplectic geometry.\n",
