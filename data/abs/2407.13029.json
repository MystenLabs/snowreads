Direct observations of state variables enter the\nlikelihood and modify posterior probabilities through consistent updating.\nInformation in terms of expected values of state variables modify posterior\nprobabilities by constraining prior probabilities to be consistent with the\ninformation. Constraints on the prior can be exact, limiting hypothetical\nfrequency distributions to only those that satisfy the constraints, or be\napproximate, allowing residual deviations from the exact constraint to some\ndegree of tolerance. When the model parameters and constraint tolerances are\nknown, posterior probability follows directly from Bayes' theorem. When\nparameters and tolerances are unknown a prior for them must be specified. When\nthe system is close to statistical equilibrium the computation of posterior\nprobabilities is simplified due to the concentration of the prior on the\nmaximum entropy hypothesis. The relationship between maximum entropy reasoning\nand Bayes' theorem from this point of view is that maximum entropy reasoning is\na special case of Bayesian inference with a constrained entropy-favoring prior.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"OYuwt4HiJniOfgmnaPHB730xmu3nWrfQmXrtJLHVpEI","pdfSize":"224224"}
