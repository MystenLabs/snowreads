  "abstract": "  Beyond mere formality, small talk plays a pivotal role in social dynamics,\nserving as a verbal handshake for building rapport and understanding. For\nconversational AI and social robots, the ability to engage in small talk\nenhances their perceived sociability, leading to more comfortable and natural\nuser interactions. In this study, we evaluate the capacity of current Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to drive the small talk of a social robot and identify\nkey areas for improvement. We introduce a novel method that autonomously\ngenerates feedback and ensures LLM-generated responses align with small talk\nconventions. Through several evaluations -- involving chatbot interactions and\nhuman-robot interactions -- we demonstrate the system's effectiveness in\nguiding LLM-generated responses toward realistic, human-like, and natural\nsmall-talk exchanges.\n",
