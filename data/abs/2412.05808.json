  "abstract": "  Effective compression technology is crucial for 3DGS to adapt to varying\nstorage and transmission conditions. However, existing methods fail to address\nsize constraints while maintaining optimal quality. In this paper, we introduce\nSizeGS, a framework that compresses 3DGS within a specified size budget while\noptimizing visual quality. We start with a size estimator to establish a clear\nrelationship between file size and hyperparameters. Leveraging this estimator,\nwe incorporate mixed precision quantization (MPQ) into 3DGS attributes,\nstructuring MPQ in two hierarchical level -- inter-attribute and\nintra-attribute -- to optimize visual quality under the size constraint. At the\ninter-attribute level, we assign bit-widths to each attribute channel by\nformulating the combinatorial optimization as a 0-1 integer linear program,\nwhich can be efficiently solved. At the intra-attribute level, we divide each\nattribute channel into blocks of vectors, quantizing each vector based on the\noptimal bit-width derived at the inter-attribute level. Dynamic programming\ndetermines block lengths. Using the size estimator and MPQ, we develop a\ncalibrated algorithm to identify optimal hyperparameters in just 10 minutes,\nachieving a 1.69$\\times$ efficiency increase with quality comparable to\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n",
