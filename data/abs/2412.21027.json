In this note we describe a canonical\nset of functions we call surface functions, associated to all orders in the\ntopological expansion, that are naturally suggested by this point of view.\nSurface functions are generating functions for all inequivalent triangulations\nof the surface. They generalize matrix model correlators, and in the planar\nlimit, coincide with field theoretic loop integrands. We show that surface\nfunctions satisfy a universal recursion relation, the cut equation, that can be\nsolved without introducing spurious poles, to all orders in the genus\nexpansion. The formalism naturally extends to include triangulations with\nclosed curves, corresponding to theories with uncolored particles. This new\nrecursion is quite different from the topological recursion relations satisfied\nby matrix models. Applied to field theory, the new recursion efficiently\ncomputes all-order planar integrands for general colored theories, together\nwith uncolored theories at tree-level. As an example we give the all-order\nrecursion for the planar NLSM integrand. We attach a Mathematica notebook for\nthe efficient computation of these planar integrands, with illustrative\nexamples through four loops.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jtmIOjNgPw48bSp21pZEyklN_DK1lGi5QFPoy2OHYto","pdfSize":"673175"}
