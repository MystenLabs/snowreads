  "abstract": "  Data centers have become one of the major energy consumers, making their\nlow-carbon operations critical to achieving global carbon neutrality. Although\ndistributed data centers have the potential to reduce costs and emissions\nthrough cooperation, they are facing challenges due to uncertainties. This\npaper proposes an online approach to co-optimize the workload, energy, and\ntemperature strategies across distributed data centers, targeting minimal total\ncost, controlled carbon emissions, and adherence to operational constraints.\nLyapunov optimization technique is adopted to derive a parametric real-time\nstrategy that accommodates uncertainties in workload demands, ambient\ntemperature, electricity prices, and carbon intensities, without requiring\nprior knowledge of their distributions. A theoretical upper bound for the\noptimality gap is derived, based on which a linear programming problem is\nproposed to optimize the strategy parameters, enhancing performance while\nensuring operational constraints. Case studies and method comparison validate\nthe proposed method's effectiveness in reducing costs and carbon emissions.\n",
