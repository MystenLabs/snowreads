The kaon\nEMFFs thereby serve an ideal platform to critically examine the validity and\neffectiveness of perturbative QCD (pQCD) in accounting for hard exclusive\nprocesses. In this work we confront the pQCD predictions that incorporate the\nnext-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) perturbative corrections, with the\navailable kaon EMFFs data set from experimental measurements and from lattice\npredictions. The inclusion of the NNLO corrections turns out to have a\nsubstantial and positive impact. If the profiles of the kaon light-cone\ndistribution amplitudes (LCDAs) are taken from the recent lattice QCD\nprediction by {\\tt LPC} Collaboration, the satisfactory agreement between\ntheory and data can be reached for both charged and neutral kaons, in both\nspacelike and timelike large-$Q^2$ domains.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pMtd-pdifjQJAeAg7BXHw8lZL_e3GOvcJ5Vyva-lczM","pdfSize":"561340","objectId":"0x7da967d0b01e7cc9b72d6374131f1c3e63d3f1b0b2a5e1198f2f968a6757efb5","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
