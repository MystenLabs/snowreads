Intermixed with many exciting and creative applications are malicious\napplications that harm individuals, organizations, and democracies. We describe\nan effective and robust technique for distinguishing real from AI-generated\nhuman motion. This technique leverages a multi-modal semantic embedding, making\nit robust to the types of laundering that typically confound more low- to\nmid-level approaches. This method is evaluated against a custom-built dataset\nof video clips with human actions generated by seven text-to-video AI models\nand matching real footage.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xSjehrGV3e2Ci5pYNQfgC0sdSziZdGDtp0cGjMCb93U","pdfSize":"19365856"}
