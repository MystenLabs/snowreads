These chemical potentials qualitatively influence the differential\nemission rates of circularly polarized photons. A nonzero net electric charge\ndensity, induced by quark-number chemical potentials, enhances the overall\nemission of one circular polarization over the other, while a nonzero chiral\ncharge density introduces a spatial asymmetry in the emission with respect to\nreflection in the transverse plane. The signs of the electrical and chiral\ncharge densities determine which circular polarization dominates overall and\nwhether the emission preferentially aligns with or opposes the magnetic field.\nBased on these findings, we propose that polarized photon emission is a\npromising observable for characterizing the quark-gluon plasma produced in\nheavy-ion collisions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"p3qFZivFnWgx4MwqU4-UG07w7d4x3GfJCkfwCAMeBDc","pdfSize":"705440"}
