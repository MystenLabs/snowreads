The shape and extremal parameters (maximum height\n$\\mathcal{H}$, break-off volume $\\mathcal{V}$) of the meniscus formed, as\nfunctions of $\\sigma, \\rho$, are found by an exact analysis. Having knowledge\nof the explicit relationship between these parameters allows to perform in one\nprocedure both diagnosis and treatment.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Tissues and Organs","Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Physics/Biological Physics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NsL9SYxEH3NYzRCQH9KSjOymGcSrtaG5g8MEcq46m9Y","pdfSize":"503639"}
