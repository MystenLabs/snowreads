Moser consists in tiling the\nunit square with rectangles (details), whose side lengths equal\n$\\frac1n\\times\\frac1{n+1}$, where indices $n$ range from 1 to infinity.\nRecently, Terence Tao has proved that it is possible to tile with\n$\\bigl(\\frac1n\\bigr)^t\\times\\bigl(\\frac1{n+1}\\bigr)^t$ rectangles (squares with\nthe side length of $\\bigl(\\frac1n\\bigr)^t$), $1/2<t<1$, the square, whose area\nequals the sum of areas of these details, provided that only those details,\nwhose indices exceed certain $n_0$, are taken into consideration. We adduce\narguments in favor of the assumption that the result obtained by T. Tao is also\nvalid for $t=1$. We use a new tiling method (the Slack-Pack algorithm), which\ninitially admits gaps between stacks of details. The algorithm uses a pre-fixed\nparameter $\\gamma$, $\\sqrt{3/2}<\\gamma<3/2$, connected with the gap value. The\nnew algorithm allows one to control the ratio of the area of the large\nrectangular part, which is free of details, to the whole area of the remaining\nempty space. This ratio (under certain natural assumptions) always exceeds\n$1-1/\\gamma-\\delta$, where $\\delta$ tends to zero as $n_0$ increases.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6sGn-3LtEbVuv3M9hM3J3cFFR7_b6bvEUfCqeZZvh3o","pdfSize":"1514016"}
