We compare the effectiveness of this model in terms of accuracy and\nprecision aggregated across ecoregions and class heights versus three other\nbenchmark peer-reviewed models. Key findings suggest that, while other\nbenchmark models can provide high precision in localized areas, the VibrantVS\nmodel has substantial advantages across a broad reach of ecoregions in the\nwestern United States with higher accuracy, higher precision, the ability to\ngenerate updated inference at a cadence of three years or less, and high\nspatial resolution. The VibrantVS model provides significant value for\necological monitoring and land management decisions, including for wildfire\nmitigation.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yerIUM2wRnfmX-5D75jm2rP8_Xy2GEqch03Dn-j4I40","pdfSize":"31170994"}
