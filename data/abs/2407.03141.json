When the weights are atomless, we\nprove that the matchings of maximal weight converge locally to a matching on\nthe limiting tree. For this purpose, we introduce and study unimodular\nmatchings on weighted unimodular random trees as well as a notion of optimality\nfor these objects. In this context, we prove that, in law, there is a unique\noptimal unimodular matching for a given unimodular tree. We then prove that\nthis law is the local limit of the sequence of matchings of maximal weight.\nAlong the way, we also show that this law is characterised by an equation\nderived from a message passing algorithm.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"u_18iCYSy-yxMGTckvlaXzx9PRdAXXKBk-k-1HK0kx4","pdfSize":"1098198"}
