While\nmost secure deep learning techniques utilize MPC operations to achieve feasible\nprivacy-preserving machine learning on downstream tasks, the overhead of the\ncomputation and communication still hampers their practical application. This\nwork proposes a low-latency secret-sharing-based MPC design that reduces\nunnecessary communication rounds during the execution of MPC protocols. We also\npresent a method for improving the computation of commonly used nonlinear\nfunctions in deep learning by integrating multivariate multiplication and\ncoalescing different packets into one to maximize network utilization. Our\nexperimental results indicate that our method is effective in a variety of\nsettings, with a speedup in communication latency of $10\\sim20\\%$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2cY4tafnCTt4nF4eDVs8vCWYRxwlX88Sdk4FKz4zoUM","pdfSize":"721308"}
