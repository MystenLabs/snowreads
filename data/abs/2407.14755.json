In this paper, we introduce and study a new class of\nsublocales in the category of bilocales, namely (i,j)-remote sublocales. These\nare bilocalic counterparts of remote sublocales and are the sublocales missing\nevery (i,j)-nowhere dense sublocale, with (i,j)-nowhere dense sublocales being\nbilocalic counterparts of (\\tau_{i},\\tau_{j})-nowhere dense subsets in\nbitopological spaces. A comprehensive study of (i,j)-nowhere dense sublocales\nis given and we show that in the class of balanced bilocales, a sublocale is\n(i,j)-nowhere dense if and only if its bilocale closure is nowhere dense. We\nalso consider weakly (i,j)-remote sublocales which are those sublocales missing\nevery clopen (i,j)-nowhere dense sublocale. Furthermore, we extend\n(i,j)-remoteness to the categories of bitopological spaces as well as normed\nlattices. In the class of \\sup-T_{D} bitopological spaces, a subset A of a\nbitopological space (X,\\tau_{1},\\tau_{2}) is (\\tau_{i},\\tau_{j})-remote if and\nonly if the induced sublocale \\widetilde{A} of \\tau_{1}\\vee\\tau_{2} is\n(i,j)-remote.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Bnef5yezQk45HnDIfB3zc5PAwFHPinwKeQFznFLkmhc","pdfSize":"279352"}
