We mainly focus on the\neffects of the scalar charge and electric charge on the marginally bound orbits\n(MBO), innermost stable circular orbits (ISCO) and on the precessing orbits\naround this black hole. Our results show that both the scalar and electric\ncharges suppress the energy as well as the angular momentum of the particles in\nthe bound orbits. Then, we study the relativistic periastron precessions of the\nparticles and constrain the charge parameters by employing the observational\nresult of the S2 star's precession in SgrA*. It is found that the constraints\non the charge parameters from S2 star's motion are tighter than those from\nblack hole shadow. Finally, we analyze the periodic motions of the particles\nand figure out samples of periodic orbits' configurations around the hairy\nblack hole.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DZl6mVxzJKfDRKFzE-GUe9sDKUg9eFdgOag-pgKPhU0","pdfSize":"6388557"}
