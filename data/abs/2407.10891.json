To illustrate the result geometrically, we begin by defining a\nrigid transformation of the $(n+1)$-permutahedron into a $n$-cube of dimensions\n$1 \\times 2 \\times \\cdots \\times n$. With a fictitious assumption, we 'define'\nthe corresponding coherence relations 'up to associativity' as an instance of a\nsemi-simplicial type in the language of Displayed Type Theory. This is not a\nformal result in type theory, but we expect this to translate into one as soon\nas the problem of defining associahedral coherences is solved in a type theory\nwith semi-simplicial types. On the other hand, this not-strictly-well-typed\ndefinition may be used to produce well-typed formulas in a restricted setting.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Category Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EMK_D1W3a3ie4akPNVbKPVRJGefIuxMvcpHstYkYfhM","pdfSize":"1661312"}
