  "abstract": "  In this work, we studied the characteristics of wormholes with multiple\nthroats/anti-throats in the context of general relativity. The presence of\nthese structures is verified through the minima and maxima in the area of these\nwormholes. Using embedding diagrams, we demonstrate that these compact objects\nexhibit a structure that stands out significantly compared to usual wormholes.\nWe also performed a study of the geodesics in this type of spacetime. We showed\nthat these objects can be obtained from Einstein's equations when considering\nthe coupling of a nonlinear electrodynamics with a phantom scalar field. We\ndemonstrated that different scalar field profiles can generate the same\nsolution. Furthermore, we analyzed the energy conditions and verified that,\ndepending on the chosen parameters, it is always possible to satisfy them in\ncertain regions of the spacetime.\n",
