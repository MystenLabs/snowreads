  "abstract": "  Online planning under uncertainty remains a critical challenge in robotics\nand autonomous systems. While tree search techniques are commonly employed to\nconstruct partial future trajectories within computational constraints, most\nexisting methods discard information from previous planning sessions\nconsidering continuous spaces. This study presents a novel, computationally\nefficient approach that leverages historical planning data in current\ndecision-making processes. We provide theoretical foundations for our\ninformation reuse strategy and introduce an algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch (MCTS) that implements this approach. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat our method significantly reduces computation time while maintaining high\nperformance levels. Our findings suggest that integrating historical planning\ninformation can substantially improve the efficiency of online decision-making\nin uncertain environments, paving the way for more responsive and adaptive\nautonomous systems.\n",
