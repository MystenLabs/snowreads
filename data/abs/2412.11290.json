Dyn.}$,\nforthcoming) to describe the split left-invariant Riemannian distances on\nhigher-rank Sol-type groups $G=\\mathbf{N}\\rtimes \\mathbb{R}^k$. We show that\nthe rough isometry type of such a distance is determined by a specific\nrestriction of the metric to $\\mathbb{R}^k$, and therefore the space of rough\nsimilarity types of distances is parameterized by the symmetric space\n$SL_k(\\mathbb{R})/SO_k(\\mathbb{R})$. In order to prove this result, we describe\na family of uniformly roughly geodesic paths, which arise by way of the new\ntechnique of $\\textit{Euclidean curve surgery}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"F2UzGCpGF_5xwLHrVaZW3qwSCkAtHqXCDy1xzJFhzsY","pdfSize":"325604"}
