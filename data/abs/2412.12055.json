Our motivation has\nthree sources relevant in $p$-adic local Langlands correspondence: one is the\ncorresponding foundation from Bambozzi-Ben-Bassat-Kremnizer on derived\nfunctional analysis and Clausen-Scholze on derived topologicalization, and the\nsecond one is representations of derived $E_1$-rings which is relevant in\nintegral deformed version of the $p$-adic local Langlands correspondence with\neventually Banach coefficients, and the third one is the corresponding\ncomparison of the solid quasicoherent sheaves over two kinds of generalized\nprismatization stackifications over small arc stacks and small $v$-stacks: one\nfrom the de Rham Robba stackification, and the other one from the de Rham\nprismatization stackification. Small arc stacks imperfectize the prismatization\nstackification, which will then perfectize the prismatization stackification\nwhen we regard them as small $v$-stacks. After Scholze's philosophy, one can in\nfact imperfectize those significant $v$-stacks in Fargues-Scholze to still have\nthe geometrization at least by using Berkovich motives. Both small arc-stacks\nand small $v$-stacks can be studied using local totally disconnectedness which\nis the key observation for condensed mathematics, theory of diamonds and\nperfectoid rings. Following Scholze, Richarz-Scholbach and Ayoub we then study\nthe $p$-adic local Langlands correspondence by using $p$-adic motivic\ncohomology theories. We study in some uniform way many significant $p$-adic\nmotivic cohomology theories in families, after the general framework and\nformalism in the recent work of Ayoub. We extend in some sense Ayoub's\nformalism after Scholze's recent theory of Berkovich motives, Scholze's theory\nof small $v$-stacks and Clausen-Scholze's analytic stacks.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UjplPmRgNJZXcVU88vwnwneiksfutuU-aTnJkXTprac","pdfSize":"806688"}
