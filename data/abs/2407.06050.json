In contrast to the available short-term methods, where an iterative\nalgorithm is run for every instantaneous channel realization, we derive an\niterative algorithm that can be run only sporadically leveraging known channel\nstatistics, with minor performance loss. In addition, our algorithm also\napplies to the design of non-trivial cooperative beamforming schemes subject to\nlimited sharing of instantaneous channel state information. Furthermore, our\nalgorithm generalizes and outperforms the competing long-term methods from the\nmassive MIMO literature, which are restricted to long-term power control only\nor to long-term joint power control and large-scale fading decoding design.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-0w04SVPv_T1NRD6FZ9Cfk3lPB44a5w0hUAlW7J4h4w","pdfSize":"416608"}
