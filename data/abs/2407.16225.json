The construction of Chern insulators has been typically\nthrough an guess-and-confirm approach, which can be inefficient and\nunpredictable. In this paper, we introduce a systematic method to directly\nconstruct two-dimensional Chern insulators that can provide any nontrivial\nChern number. Our method is built upon the one-dimensional Rice-Mele model,\nwhich is well known for its adjustable polarization properties, providing a\nreliable framework for manipulation. By extending this model into two\ndimensions, we are able to engineer lattice structures that demonstrate\npredetermined topological quantities effectively. This research not only\ncontributes the development of Chern insulators but also paves the way for\ndesigning a variety of lattice structures with significant topological\nimplications, potentially impacting quantum computing and materials science.\nWith this approach, we are to shed light on the pathways for designing more\ncomplex and functional topological phases in synthetic materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"82Rq1hWTgCYX5PRiCvuGIqCzYKnppd6Dncl3wrGVNQo","pdfSize":"3777171"}
