The system consists of the generalized Navier-Stokes equations with\npower-law type viscosity with a power-law index depending on the concentration,\nand the convection-diffusion equation which describes chemical concentration.\nThis system of partial differential equations arises in the mathematical models\ndescribing the synovial fluid which can be found in the cavities of movable\njoints. We prove the existence of a global strong solution for the two and\nthree-dimensional spatially periodic domain, provided that the power-law index\nis greater than or equal to $(d+2)/2$ where $d$ is the dimension of the spatial\ndomain. Moreover, we also prove that such a solution is unique under the\nfurther assumption that $p^+ < \\frac{3}{2} p^-$ for the two-dimensional case\nand $p^+ < \\frac{7}{6}p^-$ for the three-dimensional case, where $p^-$ and\n$p^+$ are the lower and upper bounds of the power-law index $p(\\cdot)$\nrespectively.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"r1H3QKoWK8Uk-gnV6xBpLhzlhJKdPN_LYs2Y-LTWK0o","pdfSize":"297155"}
