  "abstract": "  This paper presents a novel approach for synthesizing control barrier\nfunctions (CBFs) from high relative degree safety constraints: Rectified CBFs\n(ReCBFs). We begin by discussing the limitations of existing High-Order CBF\napproaches and how these can be overcome by incorporating an activation\nfunction into the CBF construction. We then provide a comparative analysis of\nour approach with related methods, such as CBF backstepping. Our results are\npresented first for safety constraints with relative degree two, then for\nmixed-input relative degree constraints, and finally for higher relative\ndegrees. The theoretical developments are illustrated through simple running\nexamples and an aircraft control problem.\n",
