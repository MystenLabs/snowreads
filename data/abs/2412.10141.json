The work\nconsiders $Zh$ events where the $Z$ boson decays leptonically and the Higgs\nboson $h$ decays into two long-lived dark scalars $s$ which further decay into\nbottom anti-bottom quark pairs. The analysis is performed using a parametrized\nsimulation of the IDEA detector concept and targets dark scalar decays in the\ntracking volume, resulting in multiple displaced vertices in the final state.\nThe sensitivity towards long-lived dark scalars at FCC-ee is estimated using an\nevent selection requiring two opposite-charge, same-flavor leptons compatible\nwith the $Z$ boson, and at least two displaced vertices in the final state. The\nselection is seen to efficiently remove the Standard Model background, while\nretaining sensitivity for dark scalar masses between $m_s=20$ GeV and $m_s=60$\nGeV and mean proper lifetimes $c\\tau$ between approximately 10 mm and 10 m The\nresults show that the search strategy has potential to probe Higgs to dark\nscalar branching ratios as low as $10^{-4}$ for a mean proper lifetime\n$c\\tau\\approx 1$ m. The results provide the first sensitivity estimate for\nexotic Higgs decays at FCC-ee with the IDEA detector concept, using the common\nFCC framework.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YkWVKq11Nr0NwRNDtzQaAMZzurxWGjZlZf_aWkkITsI","pdfSize":"777226"}
