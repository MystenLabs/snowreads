In this work, we address the\nproblem of designing efficient secure techniques to probe large datasets which\nallow a scientist to conduct large-scale medical studies over specific\nattributes of patients' records, while maintaining the privacy of his model. We\nintroduce a set of composable homomorphic operations and show how to combine\nprivate functions evaluation with private thresholds via approximate fully\nhomomorphic encryption. This allows us to design a new system named TETRIS,\nwhich solves the real-world use case of private functional exploration of large\ndatabases, where the statistical criteria remain private to the server owning\nthe patients' records. Our experiments show that TETRIS achieves practical\nperformance over a large dataset of patients even for the evaluation of\nelaborate statements composed of linear and nonlinear functions. It is possible\nto extract private insights from a database of hundreds of thousands of patient\nrecords within only a few minutes on a single thread, with an amortized time\nper database entry smaller than 2ms.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2r6KH3gBbM6cR2gjQvSJcD1UCi4RQwX8l3hNT0ASisE","pdfSize":"878637"}
