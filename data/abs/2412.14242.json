In particular, we present a full\nsubtraction-based calculation of the matching coefficient required to obtain\nthe NLO 3-jet rate. This is achieved through a judicious choice of the\ncounter-terms, which optimises the numerical evaluation of the subtracted\ndouble-real matrix element. We additionally give a consistent prescription for\nincorporating interference effects due to multiple Born states. Finally, we\nbriefly comment on higher-order uncertainty estimates.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"B_3lEnc_Io1mAfnKyCfsZtx-xT4DOf0vsLx--GxRg08","pdfSize":"1834582"}
