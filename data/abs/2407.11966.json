The choice of how to\ninitialize parameters is challenging and may require manual tuning, which can\nbe time-consuming and prone to human error. To overcome such limitations, this\nwork takes a novel step towards building a weight generator to synthesize the\nneural weights for initialization. We use the image-to-image translation task\nwith generative adversarial networks (GANs) as an example due to the ease of\ncollecting model weights spanning a wide range. Specifically, we first collect\na dataset with various image editing concepts and their corresponding trained\nweights, which are later used for the training of the weight generator. To\naddress the different characteristics among layers and the substantial number\nof weights to be predicted, we divide the weights into equal-sized blocks and\nassign each block an index. Subsequently, a diffusion model is trained with\nsuch a dataset using both text conditions of the concept and the block indexes.\nBy initializing the image translation model with the denoised weights predicted\nby our diffusion model, the training requires only 43.3 seconds. Compared to\ntraining from scratch (i.e., Pix2pix), we achieve a 15x training time\nacceleration for a new concept while obtaining even better image generation\nquality.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"--bJnHrMQ-nT8oSZVNvDHXyiYVb10SQenuewPAciSl4","pdfSize":"14269665","objectId":"0x262ce9846d0afee8001712e2ca91c962ce198fbe0f28109d29c37c8f4441df58","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
