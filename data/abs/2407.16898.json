While recent research has shown that school systems are evolving\nto support those developments by strengthening modularity in their curricula,\nthere is often a hurdle that prevents the complete success of such a system:\nthe scheduling process is too complex. While there are many tools that assist\nwith scheduling timetables in an effective way, they usually arrange students\ninto groups and classes with similar interests instead of handling each student\nindividually. In this paper, we propose an extension of the popular XHSTT\nframework that adds two new constraints to model the individual student choices\nas well as the requirements for group formation that arise from them. Those two\nconstraints were identified through extensive interviews with school\nadministrators and other school timetabling experts from six European\ncountries. We propose a corresponding ILP formulation and show first\noptimization results for real-world instances from schools in Germany.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Lkb3fmsEda-qcT-dZ6KLOiUiOOvEkoJDrSNfrcJdNRE","pdfSize":"306289","objectId":"0x2e1a5859c7872cb2cc9f04cfac8c08baaecbda8ad14dbc2273d7f825145c8a40","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
