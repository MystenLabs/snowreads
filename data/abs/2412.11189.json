While\nimmersive interactions have been a focus, negotiations between merchant NPCs\nand players on item prices have not received sufficient attention. First, we\ndefine passive pricing as the limited ability of merchants to modify predefined\nitem prices. Second, passive communication means that merchants can only\ninteract with players in a scripted manner. To tackle these issues and create\nan active merchant NPC, we propose a merchant framework based on large language\nmodels (LLMs), called MART, which consists of an appraiser module and a\nnegotiator module. We conducted two experiments to guide game developers in\nselecting appropriate implementations by comparing different training methods\nand LLM sizes. Our findings indicate that finetuning methods, such as\nsupervised finetuning (SFT) and knowledge distillation (KD), are effective in\nusing smaller LLMs to implement active merchant NPCs. Additionally, we found\nthree irregular cases arising from the responses of LLMs. We expect our\nfindings to guide developers in using LLMs for developing active merchant NPCs.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"02LhHr0aKFwQ1VSd88Urafql9RNnbGnxFYDTFvz-aj8","pdfSize":"987605"}
