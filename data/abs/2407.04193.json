Firstly, we propose combinatorial constructions of\nquaternary additive constant-weight codes, alongside additive anticode\nconstruction. Subsequently, we propose generalized Construction X, which\nfacilitates the construction of non-integer dimensional optimal additive codes\nfrom linear codes. Then, we construct ten classes of optimal quaternary\nnon-integer dimensional additive codes through these two methods. As an\napplication, we also determine the optimal additive $[n,3.5,n-t]_4$ codes for\nall $t$ with variable $n$, except for $t=6,7,12$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"H8qwcbh5xsD7XjjA487b0uq4UeF1UHacnIxXOrsb_OE","pdfSize":"313928"}
