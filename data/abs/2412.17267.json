The\nresults demonstrate that the U-matrix inherently incorporates a larger amount\nof diffraction production into the multi-pomeron vertices, yielding a larger\npomerons' variability regardless of the energy range, while such fluctuations\nbecome significant only beyond a specific high-energy threshold in the eikonal\nand quasi-eikonal schemes. Most importantly, our findings indicate that within\nthe $U$-matrix scheme, an increase in exchanged pomerons results in more\npronounced higher-order pomeron correlations, which are affected by the energy\nand the impact parameter. Interestingly, our outcomes also highlight that the\ncorrelated pomeron exchanges within the U-matrix summation play a key role in\nenhancing multi-parton collisions. In light of these results, we can argue that\nthe U-matrix is fundamentally more valid for theories with growing\ncross-sections with energy, such as QCD at high energies.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nk1rhhRzwb8UO0rxnDIY4_ccV_VLp0ZmCIooevtOeA8","pdfSize":"836712"}
