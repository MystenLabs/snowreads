  "abstract": "  Pellets of frozen material travelling into a magnetically confined fusion\nplasma are accelerated by the so-called pellet rocket effect. The non-uniform\nplasma heats the pellet ablation cloud asymmetrically, producing\npressure-driven, rocket-like propulsion of the pellet. We present a\nsemi-analytical model of this process by perturbing a spherically symmetric\nablation model. Predicted pellet accelerations match experimental estimates in\ncurrent tokamaks ($\\sim 10^5 \\;\\rm m/s^2$). Projections for ITER\nhigh-confinement scenarios ($\\sim 10^6 \\;\\rm m/s^2$) indicate significantly\nshorter pellet penetration than expected without this effect, which could limit\nthe effectiveness of disruption mitigation.\n",
