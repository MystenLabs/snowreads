  "abstract": "  Bilevel optimization, a hierarchical mathematical framework where one\noptimization problem is nested within another, has emerged as a powerful tool\nfor modeling complex decision-making processes in various fields such as\neconomics, engineering, and machine learning. This paper focuses on bilevel\noptimization where both upper-level and lower-level functions are black boxes\nand expensive to evaluate. We propose a Bayesian Optimization framework that\nmodels the upper and lower-level functions as Gaussian processes over the\ncombined space of upper and lower-level decisions, allowing us to exploit\nknowledge transfer between different sub-problems. Additionally, we propose a\nnovel acquisition function for this model. Our experimental results demonstrate\nthat the proposed algorithm is highly sample-efficient and outperforms existing\nmethods in finding high-quality solutions.\n",
