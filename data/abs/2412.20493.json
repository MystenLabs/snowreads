Specifically, what is\nthe largest number of assignments (of Hamming weight $t$) accepted by a $k$-CNF\nformula that only accepts assignments of weight at least $t$? Among others, we\nprovide the following results:\n  - While an optimal solution is known for $t \\leq n/k$, the problem remains\nopen for $t > n/k$. We formulate a (monotone) version of the problem as an\nextremal hypergraph problem and show that for $t = n-k$, the problem is exactly\nthe Tur\\'{a}n problem.\n  - For $t = \\alpha n$ with constant $\\alpha$, we provide a construction and\nshow its optimality for $2$-CNF. Optimality of the construction for $k>2$ would\ngive improved lower bounds for depth-$3$ circuits.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tqIxqTmOTAm0ZCMboSORfweOFj96kAtrEPN-fhicbPE","pdfSize":"603395"}
