  "abstract": "  We explore the production of gravitational waves (GW) resulting from a\nfirst-order phase transition (FOPT) in a non-minimally coupled `Dark Higgs\nInflation' model. Utilizing a dark sector scalar field as the inflaton, we\ndemonstrate how inflationary dynamics naturally set the stage for observable\nFOPT. These transitions, influenced by thermal and quantum effects, generate GW\nspectra potentially detectable by observatories such as LISA, DECIGO, the\nCosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. Our study highlights the inflaton's\ndual role in cosmic inflation and early Universe phase transitions, presenting\na unified framework to probe physics beyond the Standard Model through\ngravitational wave astronomy.\n",
