  "abstract": "  We establish central limit theorems (CLTs) for the linear spectral statistics\nof the adjacency matrix of inhomogeneous random graphs across all sparsity\nregimes, providing explicit covariance formulas under the assumption that the\nvariance profile of the random graphs converges to a graphon limit. Two types\nof CLTs are derived for the (non-centered) adjacency matrix and the centered\nadjacency matrix, with different scaling factors when the sparsity parameter\n$p$ satisfies $np = n^{\\Omega(1)}$, and with the same scaling factor when $np =\nn^{o(1)}$. In both cases, the limiting covariance is expressed in terms of\nhomomorphism densities from certain types of finite graphs to a graphon. These\nresults highlight a phase transition in the centering effect for global\neigenvalue fluctuations. For the non-centered adjacency matrix, we also\nidentify new phase transitions for the CLTs in the sparse regime when $n^{1/m}\n\\ll np \\ll n^{1/(m-1)}$ for $m \\geq 2$. Furthermore, weaker conditions for the\ngraphon convergence of the variance profile are sufficient as $p$ decreases\nfrom being constant to $np \\to c\\in (0,\\infty)$. These findings reveal a novel\nconnection between graphon limits and linear spectral statistics in random\nmatrix theory.\n",
