This work presents a detailed characterisation of stellar model\nuncertainties in asteroseismic red giants, focusing on the mixing-length\nparameter $\\alpha_{\\rm MLT}$, the initial helium fraction $Y_{\\rm init}$, the\nsolar abundance scale, and the overshoot parameters. First, we estimate error\nfloors due to model uncertainties to be $\\approx$0.4\\% in mass, $\\approx$0.2\\%\nin radius, and $\\approx$17\\% in age, primarily due to the uncertain state of\n$\\alpha_{\\rm MLT}$ and $Y_{\\rm init}$. The systematic uncertainties in age\nexceed typical statistical uncertainties, suggesting the importance of their\nevaluation in asteroseismic applications. Second, we demonstrate that the\nuncertainties from $\\alpha_{\\rm MLT}$ can be entirely mitigated by direct\nradius measurements or partially through $\\nu_{\\rm max}$. Utilizing radii from\nKepler eclipsing binaries, we determined the $\\alpha_{\\rm MLT}$ values and\ncalibrated the $\\alpha_{\\rm MLT}$--[M/H] relation. The correlation observed\nbetween the two variables is positive, consistent with previous studies using\n1-D stellar models, but in contrast with outcomes from 3-D simulations. Third,\nwe explore the implications of using asteroseismic modelling to test the\n$\\nu_{\\rm max}$ scaling relation. We found that a perceived dependency of\n$\\nu_{\\rm max}$ on [M/H] from individual frequency modelling can be largely\nremoved by incorporating the calibrated $\\alpha_{\\rm MLT}$--[M/H] relation.\nVariations in $Y_{\\rm init}$ can also affect $\\nu_{\\rm max}$ predictions. These\nfindings suggest that $\\nu_{\\rm max}$ conveys information not fully captured by\nindividual frequencies, and that it should be carefully considered as an\nimportant observable for asteroseismic modelling.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"L2Yx4tclH6-Abq9TUndjL4FD6UBOrV5RmYJVa3j3iZ4","pdfSize":"1449455"}
