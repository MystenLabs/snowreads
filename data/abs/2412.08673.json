The increase\nin current upon filling a nanochannel with NS condensate indicates that its\nelectrophoretic mobility is about half that of a single NS and its effective\nionic strength is $\\sim35$\\% greater than that of 150mM NaCl in phosphate\nbuffer. $\\zeta$-potential measurements before and after exposure to NS show\nthat condensate binds the silica walls of a nanochannel more strongly than\nindividual NS do under identical conditions. This binding increases\nelectroosmotic flow, possibly enough to completely balance, or even exceed, the\nelectrophoretic velocity of NS condensate. Although the current through a flat\nnanochannel is erratic in the presence of NS condensate, tilting the\nnanochannel to accumulate NS condensate at one entrance (and away from the\nother) results in a robust electronic signature of the NS phase transition at\ntemperatures $T_c$ = $f$([NaCl]) that agree with those obtained by other\nmethods. Electrokinetic nanofluidic detection and measurement of NS condensate\nthus provides a foundation for novel biosensing technologies based on\nliquid-liquid phase separation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uwzWc4n44atKmGOLnwBpAN_MUtEXvycqRdAELnhjZok","pdfSize":"8502006"}
