Let $D$ and $\\delta \\Omega$ be the\nmaximum vertex degree and the set of vertices of degree one in a graph\n$\\mathcal{G}$ respectively. Let $\\lambda_2$ be the first (non-trivial) Steklov\neigenvalue of $(\\mathcal{G}, \\delta \\Omega)$. In this paper, using the circle\npacking theorem and conformal mapping, we first show that $\\lambda_2 \\leq 8D /\n|\\delta \\Omega|$ for planar graphs. This can be seen as a discrete analogue of\nKokarev's bound [Variational aspects of Laplace eigenvalues on Riemannian\nsurfaces, Adv. Math. (2014)], that is, $\\lambda_2 < 8\\pi / |\\partial \\Omega|$\nfor compact surfaces with boundary of genus $0$. Let $B$ and $L$ be the maximum\nblock size and the diameter of a block graph $\\mathcal{G}$ repsectively.\nSecondly, we prove that $\\lambda_2 \\leq B^2 (D-1)/ |\\delta \\Omega|$ and\n$\\lambda_2 \\leq (2L + (L-2)(B-2))/L^2$ for block graphs, which extend the\nresults on trees by He and Hua [Upper bounds for the Steklov eigenvalues on\ntrees, Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations (2022)]. In the end, for trees\nwith fixed leaf number and maximum degree, candidates that achieve the maximum\nfirst Steklov eigenvalue are given.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"H3bV1ZSaokJNKX9mA10K64t_AkVSCMfQ97UhKsyT6zk","pdfSize":"195295","objectId":"0x5ccc072b4d00dc6724cef2b4e0aebcf750939dc1e8fe5ba7dd8c13447f9cbad9","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
