RIO prevents finding gadgets for Return-Oriented\nProgramming attacks by encrypting return instructions. This paper shows flaws\nin the design of RIO that allow for the easy retrieval of the plaintext return\ninstructions without decrypting them. Additionally, changes are proposed to\nimprove upon the original idea.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"tlMsJeTeMzf_X3b6X8afESfjARgaZEzdVHmKTN2U6JM","pdfSize":"426012"}
