  "abstract": "  Since the majority of audio DeepFake (DF) detection methods are trained on\nEnglish-centric datasets, their applicability to non-English languages remains\nlargely unexplored. In this work, we present a benchmark for the multilingual\naudio DF detection challenge by evaluating various adaptation strategies. Our\nexperiments focus on analyzing models trained on English benchmark datasets, as\nwell as intra-linguistic (same-language) and cross-linguistic adaptation\napproaches. Our results indicate considerable variations in detection efficacy,\nhighlighting the difficulties of multilingual settings. We show that limiting\nthe dataset to English negatively impacts the efficacy, while stressing the\nimportance of the data in the target language.\n",
