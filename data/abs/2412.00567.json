We show that a coherent\ncombination of these quantum algorithms also provides a quadratic speedup to\ncalculating the expectation value of a random-exist quantified oracle. In this\nproblem, Nature makes a decision randomly, i.e. chooses a bitstring according\nto some probability distribution, and a player has a chance to react by finding\na complementary bitstring such that an black-box oracle evaluates to $1$ (or\nTrue). Our task is to approximate the probability that the player has a valid\nreaction to Nature's initial decision. We compare the quantum algorithm to the\naverage-case performance of Monte-Carlo integration over brute-force search,\nwhich is, under reasonable assumptions, the best performing classical\nalgorithm. We find the performance separation depends on some problem\nparameters, and show a regime where the canonical quadratic speedup exists.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computer Science/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4Rl8RhHqT-huOpumHQhacZbprDabk_7YIDGl6008z-8","pdfSize":"507335"}
