Namely, we prove that the\n$S$-dual of $\\text{SO}(2n+1)\\times \\text{Sp}(2n)$ acting on the tensor product\nof their tautological representations is the symplectic mirabolic space\n$\\text{Sp}(2n)\\times\\text{Sp}(2n)$ acting on the product $T^* \\text{Sp}(2n)$\nand the tautological representations of $\\text{Sp}(2n)$. (Note that due to the\nanomaly, the dual of the second factor $\\text{Sp}(2n)$ is the metaplectic dual,\ni.e. $\\text{Sp}(2n)$). We also formulate the corresponding global conjecture,\nwhich describes explicitly the categorical theta-correspondence on the\nLanglands dual side.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"P3IgMRJP1mXDl8sePFJiAU4n4SX7OGxrgode0N45Im8","pdfSize":"502818"}
