  "abstract": "  Pre-stellar cores are the first steps in the process of star and planet\nformation. However, the dynamical and chemical evolution of pre-stellar cores\nis still not well understood. We aim at estimating the central density of the\npre-stellar core IRAS16293E and at carrying out an inventory of molecular\nspecies towards the density peak of the core. We observed high-$J$ rotational\ntransitions of N$_2$H$^+$ and N$_2$D$^+$, and several other molecular lines\ntowards the dust emission peak using the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX)\ntelescope, and derived the density and temperature profiles of the core using\nfar-infrared surface brightness maps from $Herschel$. The N$_2$H$^+$ and\nN$_2$D$^+$ lines were analysed by non-LTE radiative transfer modelling. Our\nbest-fit core model consists in a static inner region, embedded in an infalling\nenvelope with an inner radius of approximately 3000 au (21\" at 141 pc). The\nobserved high-J lines of N$_2$H$^+$ and N$_2$D$^+$ (with critical densities\ngreater than 10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$) turn out to be very sensitive to depletion; the\npresent single-dish observations are best explained with no depletion of\nN$_2$H$^+$ and N$_2$D$^+$ in the inner core. The N$_2$D$^+$/N$_2$H$^+$ ratio\nthat best reproduces our observations is 0.44, one of the largest observed to\ndate in pre-stellar cores. Additionally, half of the molecules that we observed\nare deuterated isotopologues, confirming the high-level of deuteration towards\nthis source. Non-LTE radiative transfer modelling of N$_2$H$^+$ and N$_2$D$^+$\nlines proved to be an excellent diagnostic of the chemical structure and\ndynamics of a pre-stellar core. Probing the physical conditions immediately\nbefore the protostellar collapse is a necessary reference for theoretical\nstudies and simulations with the aim of understanding the earliest stages of\nstar and planet formation and the time scale of this process.\n",
