  "abstract": "  Warm rocky exoplanets within the habitable zone of Sun-like stars are\nfavoured targets for current and future missions. Theory indicates these\nplanets could be wet at formation and remain habitable long enough for life to\ndevelop. In this work we test the climate-chemistry response, maintenance, and\ndetectability of biosignatures in warm, water-rich atmospheres with Earth\nbiomass fluxes within the framework of the planned LIFE mission. We used the\ncoupled climate-chemistry column model 1D-TERRA to simulate the composition of\nplanetary atmospheres at different distances from the Sun, assuming Earth's\nplanetary parameters and evolution. We increased the incoming instellation by\nup to 50 percent in steps of 10 percent, corresponding to orbits of 1.00 to\n0.82 AU. Simulations were performed with and without modern Earth's biomass\nfluxes. Emission spectra of all simulations were produced using the GARLIC\nradiative transfer model. LIFEsim was then used to add noise to and simulate\nobservations of these spectra to assess how biotic and abiotic atmospheres of\nEarth-like planets can be distinguished. Increasing instellation leads to\nsurface water vapour pressures rising from 0.01 bar (1.13%) to 0.61 bar\n(34.72%). In the biotic scenarios, the ozone layer survives because hydrogen\noxide reactions with nitrogen oxides prevent the net ozone chemical sink from\nincreasing. Synthetic observations with LIFEsim, assuming a 2.0 m aperture and\nresolving power of R = 50, show that O3 signatures at 9.6 micron reliably point\nto Earth-like biosphere surface fluxes of O2 only for systems within 10\nparsecs. Increasing the aperture to 3.5 m increases this range to 22.5 pc. The\ndifferences in atmospheric temperature due to differing H2O profiles also\nenables observations at 15.0 micron to reliably identify planets with a CH4\nsurface flux equal to that of Earth's biosphere.\n",
