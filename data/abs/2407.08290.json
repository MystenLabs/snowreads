These systems utilize\nLiDAR sensors mounted on vehicles to capture vast cityscapes. However, a\nsignificant challenge arises due to occlusions caused by roadside parked\nvehicles, leading to the loss of scene information, particularly on the roads,\nsidewalks, curbs, and the lower sections of buildings. In this study, we\npresent a novel approach that leverages deep neural networks to learn a model\ncapable of filling gaps in urban scenes that are obscured by vehicle occlusion.\nWe have developed an innovative technique where we place virtual vehicle models\nalong road boundaries in the gap-free scene and utilize a ray-casting algorithm\nto create a new scene with occluded gaps. This allows us to generate diverse\nand realistic urban point cloud scenes with and without vehicle occlusion,\nsurpassing the limitations of real-world training data collection and\nannotation. Furthermore, we introduce the Scene Gap Completion Network\n(SGC-Net), an end-to-end model that can generate well-defined shape boundaries\nand smooth surfaces within occluded gaps. The experiment results reveal that\n97.66% of the filled points fall within a range of 5 centimeters relative to\nthe high-density ground truth point cloud scene. These findings underscore the\nefficacy of our proposed model in gap completion and reconstructing urban\nscenes affected by vehicle occlusions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"FpXQaGaewKyF-ooOanG0miB-vRwRyRqSplNjV8D7WfE","pdfSize":"32911417","objectId":"0x8f1506c3b376b29b5f413de3669d3dfc556cc71710866039e0b02bf4cf39a327","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
