While some of the morality neural correlates are known,\nit is currently unclear if we can detect moral violation at a single-trial\nlevel. In a pilot study, here we explore the feasibility of moral judgement\ndecoding from text stimuli with passive brain-computer interfaces. For\neffective moral judgement elicitation, we use video-audio affective priming\nprior to text stimuli presentation and attribute the text to moral agents. Our\nresults show that further efforts are necessary to achieve reliable\nclassification between moral congruency vs. incongruency states. We obtain good\naccuracy results for neutral vs. morally-charged trials. With this research, we\ntry to pave the way towards neuroadaptive human-computer interaction and more\nhuman-compatible large language models (LLMs)\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Me176iZbyhQomIlF1WE6Tqc3R5KN3WoiQnDF-Xs0dR4","pdfSize":"316630","objectId":"0x4739b421a5fcccffb78cd01fb6e88cdfad62f41e038cde48872cadc16d793445","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
