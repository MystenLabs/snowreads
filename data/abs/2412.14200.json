To make larger scale\ndataset available and enable more replicable findings, we developed an\nintelligent online learning platform featuring AI Literacy modules and\nassessments, engaging 1,000 users from 12 secondary schools. Preliminary\nanalysis of the data reveals patterns in prior knowledge levels of AI Literacy,\ngender differences in assessment scores, and the effectiveness of instructional\nactivities. With open access to this de-identified dataset, researchers can\nperform secondary analyses, advancing the understanding in this emerging field\nof AI Literacy education.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"N0wkfIhH_BbXOEAkMN-vDEOWEVHGGnAzKjvu2hXzfDI","pdfSize":"532395"}
