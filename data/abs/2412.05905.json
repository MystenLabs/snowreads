Although traditional QR decomposition is\nessential for matrix operations, it becomes computationally intensive when\ndynamically updating the design matrix in statistical models. The proposed\nalgorithms efficiently update the R matrix without recalculating Q,\nsignificantly reducing computational costs. These algorithms provide a scalable\nsolution for high-dimensional regression models, enhancing the feasibility of\nlarge-scale statistical analyses and model selection in data-intensive fields.\nComprehensive simulation studies and real-world data applications reveal that\nthe methods significantly reduce computational time while preserving accuracy.\nAn extensive discussion highlights the versatility of fast R updating\nalgorithms, illustrating their benefits across a wide range of models and\napplications in statistics and machine learning.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AQFKknPH0TrFxxgVVbMzb86kKW7GJPSTWSfWOr1DzsE","pdfSize":"16337974"}
