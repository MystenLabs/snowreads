Traditional methods, such as the discrete\nwavelet transform, cannot achieve compression ratios of 8 or higher for complex\nturbulent flows without introducing significant encoding/decoding errors. On\nthe other hand, a super-resolution-based generative adversarial network\n(SR-GAN), called ZipGAN, can accurately reconstruct fine-scale features,\npreserving velocity gradients and structural details, even at a compression\nratio of 512, thanks to the more efficient representation of the data in\ncompact latent space. Additional benefits are ascribed to adversarial training.\nThe high GAN training time is significantly reduced with a progressive transfer\nlearning approach and, once trained, they can be applied independently of the\nReynolds number. It is demonstrated that ZipGAN can enhance dataset temporal\nresolution without additional simulation overhead by generating high-quality\nintermediate fields from compressed snapshots. The ZipGAN discriminator can\nreliably evaluate the quality of decoded fields, ensuring fidelity even in the\nabsence of original DNS fields. Hence, ZipGAN compression/decompression method\npresents a highly efficient and scalable alternative for large-scale DNS\nstorage and transfer, offering substantial advantages over the DWT methods in\nterms of compression efficiency, reconstruction fidelity, and temporal\nresolution enhancement.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"7MZR6w5hA2gY009H5i7Meef8efgO0h40XtL7PttUJy8","pdfSize":"940192"}
