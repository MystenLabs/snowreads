In this\npaper, a new model is proposed to quantify uncertainties and noise in data on\nMLMs. Using the concept of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), a new metric called\ndeterministic-non-deterministic ratio (DDR) is proposed to formulate\nperformance of a model. Using synthetic data in experiments, we show how\naccuracy can change with DDR and how we can use DDR-accuracy curves to\ndetermine performance of a model.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UXfEK2NeWVyv3eBYnVNu5mZLlhNBc2it6EgYhVde8x8","pdfSize":"662132"}
