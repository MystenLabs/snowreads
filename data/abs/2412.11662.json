  "abstract": "  We consider the $n$-correlation of eigenvalues of random unitary matrices in\nthe alternative form that is not the tidy determinant common in random matrix\ntheory, but rather the expression derived from averages of ratios of\ncharacteristic polynomials in a method that can be mimicked in number\ntheoretical calculations of the correlations of zeros of $L$-functions. This\nalternative form for eigenvalues of matrices from $U(N)$ was proposed by Conrey\nand Snaith and derived by them when the test function has support in (-2,2),\nderived by Chandee and Lee for support (-4,4) and here we calculate the\nexpression when the support is (-6,6).\n",
