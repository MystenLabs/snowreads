  "abstract": "  In molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, transitions between states are often\nrare events due to energy barriers that exceed the thermal temperature. Because\nof their infrequent occurrence and the huge number of degrees of freedom in\nmolecular systems, understanding the physical properties that drive rare events\nis immensely difficult. A common approach to this problem is to propose a\ncollective variable (CV) that describes this process by a simplified\nrepresentation. However, choosing CVs is not easy, as it often relies on\nphysical intuition. Machine learning (ML) techniques provide a promising\napproach for effectively extracting optimal CVs from MD data. Here, we provide\na note on a recent unsupervised ML method called spectral map, which constructs\nCVs by maximizing the timescale separation between slow and fast variables in\nthe system.\n",
