We discuss\ndependence of entanglement on temperature and interaction strength and show\nthat one can find entangled stationary states only for low temperatures and\nweak interactions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1weko4ElMghn2XMQl_LuezLFKB-Gu8aKD5Zeue5DC0E","pdfSize":"643238","objectId":"0xcf9ee7cb18f9afaece9852ad44a14fd63bcc47891016702d389cdbccfff45378","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
