In the hadronic representation of the correlation function,\nwe carefully select the appropriate Lorentz structures and isolate the\ncontributions from both the $\\Lambda(1520)(J^P=(3/2)^-)$ and the\n$\\Lambda(1890)(J^P=(3/2)^+)$, ensuring that the form factors for\n$\\Lambda_b\\rightarrow{\\Lambda(1520)}$ can be calculated unambiguously. We also\nprovide predictions for various physical observables in the decay\n$\\Lambda_b\\rightarrow{\\Lambda(1520)}l^+l^-$, including the differential\nbranching fraction, the lepton-side forward-backward asymmetry, the\nlongitudinal polarization fraction, and the CP-averaged normalized angular\nobservable. Our prediction for the differential branching fraction of\n$\\Lambda_b\\rightarrow{\\Lambda(1520)}\\mu^+\\mu^-$ is in good agreement with the\nLHCb measurement within the uncertainties.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Qib2rlivTdeZ5sDXxpFEXxwQle9K-VeTU5SatDOgxQU","pdfSize":"1226256"}
