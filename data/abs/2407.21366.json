For intramolecular hydrogen transfer in tropolone, the best\ncomputed splitting including perturbative corrections in the ring-polymer\ninstanton calculations is 0.94 cm$^{-1}$ and compares with 0.974 cm$^{-1}$ from\nexperiments. On the other hand, for intermolecular double hydrogen transfer in\nthe (propiolic acid)-(formic acid) dimer, the computations yield 0.0147\ncm$^{-1}$ which is larger by 40 % compared with experiment (0.0097 cm$^{-1}$)\nbut still in much better agreement than previous attempts (0.63 cm$^{-1}$). The\nstrategy pursued in the present work is applicable to yet larger systems and\nother properties of interest and provides a rational route for highest-accuracy\nenergy functions for prediction and benchmarking electronic structure methods\nvis-a-vis experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"BVic_89fUkp7g2MnfeZt4CySuF7Su2xwwmO0SbD84Pw","pdfSize":"2961755"}
