  "abstract": "  $Ar^+$ ion has been used regularly for the cleaning of semiconductor, metal\nsurfaces for epitaxial nanostructures growth. We have investigated the effect\nof low-energy $Ar^+$ ion sputtering and subsequent annealing on the\n$Si(111)-(7\\times7)$ surfaces under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) condition. Using\n$in-situ$ scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) we have compared the\nmorphological changes to the $Si(111)-(7\\times7)$ surfaces before and after the\nsputtering process. Following $500~eV Ar^+$ ion sputtering, the atomically flat\n$Si(111)-(7\\times7)$ surface becomes amorphous. The average root mean square\n(rms) surface roughness $({\\sigma}_{avg})$ of the sputtered surface and that\nfollowing post-annealing at different temperatures $(500^\\circ-700^\\circ)C$\nunder UHV have been measured as a function of STM scan size. While, annealing\nat $\\sim 500^\\circ C$ shows no detectable changes in the surface morphology,\nrecrystallization process starts at $\\sim 600^\\circ C$. For the sputtered\nsamples annealed at temperatures $\\geq 600^\\circ C, \\,log~\\sigma_{avg}$ varies\nlinearly at lower length scales and approaches a saturation value of $\\sim 0.6\nnm$ for the higher length scales confirming the self-affine fractal nature. The\ncorrelation length increases with annealing temperature indicating gradual\nimprovement in crystallinity. For the present experimental conditions,\n$650^\\circ C$ is the optimal annealing temperature for recrystallization. The\nresults offer a method to engineer the crystallinity of sputtered surface\nduring nanofabrication process.\n",
