  "abstract": "  In this study, we focus on computing the projection onto the $\\ell_p$\nquasi-norm ball, which is challenging due to the non-convex and non-Lipschitz\nnature inherent in the $\\ell_p$ quasi-norm with $0<p<1$. We propose a novel\nlocalized approximation method that yields a Lipschitz continuous concave\nsurrogate function for the $\\ell_p$ quasi-norm with improved approximation\nquality. Building on this approximation, we enhance the state-of-the-art\niterative reweighted algorithm proposed by Yang et al. (J Mach Learn Res\n23:1-31, 2022) by constructing tighter subproblems. This improved algorithm\nsolves the $\\ell_p$ quasinorm ball projection problem through a series of\ntractable projections onto the weighted $\\ell_1$ norm balls. Convergence\nanalyses and numerical studies demonstrate the global convergence and superior\ncomputational efficiency of the proposed method.\n",
