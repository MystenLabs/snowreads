Niederle has shown that this task can be reduced to\nthe characterization of the nice sections of width three having a non-trivial\ntower of nice sections as retract. We solve this problem for a sub-class\n$\\mathfrak{N}_2$ of the finite nice sections of width three. On the one hand,\nwe characterize the posets in $\\mathfrak{N}_2$ having a retract of width three\nbeing a non-trivial tower of nice sections, and on the other hand we\ncharacterize the posets in $\\mathfrak{N}_2$ having a 4-crown stack as retract.\nThe latter result yields a recursive approach for the determination of posets\nin $\\mathfrak{N}_2$ having a 4-crown stack as retract. With this approach, we\ndetermine all posets in $\\mathfrak{N}_2$ with height up to six having such a\nretract. For each integer $n \\geq 2$, the class $\\mathfrak{N}_2$ contains\n$2^{n-2}$ different isomorphism types of posets of height $n$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"04NxiJo0gWWLKobdAR9jGgS8gB98wrZocHefR4GzR84","pdfSize":"773368"}
