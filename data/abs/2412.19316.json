Funct. Anal. 212: 500--512, 2004). We prove that\n$\\Delta$ is the base space of a real analytic fiber bundle constructed in terms\nof geometric objects associated to the Grassmann manifold. As a consequence we\ndetermine the homotopy type of $\\Delta$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aHj4f0JfI-aB2Lf8pFqFHNfoY3VGRo9Snj_dtd_L_dc","pdfSize":"134636"}
