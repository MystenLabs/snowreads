We demonstrate the long-time existence and\nexponential convergence of this flow with a coordinate sphere of large radius\nserving as the initial surface in the asymptotically flat end, which eventually\nconverges to a constant harmonic mean curvature surface. We also establish that\nthese surfaces form a foliation of the space outside a large ball. Finally, we\nutilize this foliation to define the center of mass, proving that it agrees\nwith the center of mass defined by the ADM formulation of the initial data set.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"A6zrqVQHm-sJ-F7XyrsKKJwH6c6i1EwRZfPsO29s7lU","pdfSize":"319077"}
