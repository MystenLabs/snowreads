Three gauge ensembles with different lattice spacings,\nfrom 0.0519 fm to 0.1053 fm, and pion masses, $m_{\\pi}\\sim$ 300 MeV, are\nutilized. After a naive continuum extrapolation using three lattice spacings,\nwe obtain $\\operatorname{Br}(J/\\psi\\rightarrow D_s\ne\\nu_e)=1.90(6)(5)_{V_{cs}}\\times 10^{-10}$ and\n$\\operatorname{Br}(J/\\psi\\rightarrow D e\\nu_e)=1.21(6)(9)_{V_{cd}}\\times\n10^{-11}$, where the first errors are statistical, and the second come from the\nuncertainties of CKM matrix element $V_{cs(d)}$. The ratios of the branching\nfractions between lepton $\\mu$ and $e$ are also calculated as\n$R_{J/\\psi}(D_s)=0.97002(8)$ and $R_{J/\\psi}(D)=0.97423(15)$ after performing a\ncontinuum limit including only $a^2$ term. The ratios provide necessary\ntheoretical support for the future experimental test of lepton flavor\nuniversality.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"m7SUnQ9H17wCnEQG6ZArue8PVzhmd3aF3hi4UbNAowA","pdfSize":"1811663"}
