In this study, we focus on the dynamical transport of MBS in the\nsemiconductor-superconductor (SM-SC) heterostructure via the piano key-type\nsetup, wherein each of the keys of the wire can be tuned from topological to\ntrivial phases. We focus on the transport of MBS under noisy conditions and\nevaluate the feasibility for realistic scenarios. The central emphasis of our\nwork lies in using both numerical and analytical techniques to understand the\neffect of noise in inducing diabatic errors during transport and to establish\nscaling laws that relate these errors to the drive time. To achieve this, we\nderive an effective model that captures the scaling behavior in both noise-free\nand noisy scenarios, providing a unified framework for analyzing the transport\ndynamics. We investigate the optimal number of keys for both noisy and\nnoiseless scenarios. Additionally, we explore the effects of disorder on\ntransport dynamics, highlighting its impact on error scaling and robustness.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5CizbwvfeYz15iSoeS21QLL4jCsuOXS2G4XPzvHiyiM","pdfSize":"1091124"}
