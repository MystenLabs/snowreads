This paper presents a comprehensive\nevaluation of leading NLP models -- SpaCy, XLM-RoBERTa, mLUKE, GeoLM -- and\nLLMs, specifically OpenAI's GPT 3.5 and GPT 4, within the context of\nmultilingual geo-entity detection. Utilizing datasets from Telegram channels in\nEnglish, Russian, and Arabic, we examine the performance of these models\nthrough metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores, to assess\ntheir effectiveness in accurately identifying geospatial references. The\nanalysis exposes each model's distinct advantages and challenges, underscoring\nthe complexities involved in achieving precise geo-entity identification across\nvaried linguistic landscapes. The conclusions drawn from this experiment aim to\ndirect the enhancement and creation of more advanced and inclusive NLP tools,\nthus advancing the field of geospatial analysis and its application to global\nsecurity.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"R7c3u7TbsfVsPnpORnQO6dUV-IP4OrnNZA5RE5lBQFQ","pdfSize":"199727"}
