However, these\nmethods often suffer from a lack of transparency in their decision-making\nprocesses, which undermines the reliability of their predictions. Recent\nresearch indicates that LLMs (large language models) exhibit significant\npotential in metaphor detection. Nevertheless, their reasoning capabilities are\nconstrained by predefined knowledge graphs. To overcome these limitations, we\npropose DMD, a novel dual-perspective framework that harnesses both implicit\nand explicit applications of metaphor theories to guide LLMs in metaphor\ndetection and adopts a self-judgment mechanism to validate the responses from\nthe aforementioned forms of guidance. In comparison to previous methods, our\nframework offers more transparent reasoning processes and delivers more\nreliable predictions. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of DMD,\ndemonstrating state-of-the-art performance across widely-used datasets.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nBvtteZemIjOeHTVAUpGxrSG70vbKAc_n1shNj3NepQ","pdfSize":"326159"}
