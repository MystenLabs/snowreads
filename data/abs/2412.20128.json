In contrast, conventional\nantiferromagnets without spin splitting seem not to have any symmetry breaking\nand have drawn less attention. However, we show that conventional\nantiferromagnets with a nonzero propagation vector (Q vector) bring about\nnontrivial symmetry breakings. The incompatibility between the Q vector and\nnonsymmorphic symmetry leads to macroscopic symmetry breaking without lifting\nspin degeneracy. Moreover, the hidden altermagnetic spin splitting in the\nelectronic structure gives rise to various emergent responses. To examine our\nprediction, we perform first-principles calculations for MnS2 and investigate\nits multiferroic properties, such as nonlinear transport and optical activity.\nOur findings reveal unique properties in conventional antiferromagnets,\nproviding another perspective for designing spintronic materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"3tSZPPaRSMjvSvUilPFhnxkYByiyUSKRHVvXck8fFFE","pdfSize":"2795400"}
