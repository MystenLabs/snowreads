The Korean Baseball Organization (KBO) league\nbecame the first professional baseball league to implement ABS during the 2024\nseason. This study analyzes pitching data for 2,515 games across multiple KBO\nseasons to compare decisions made by human umpires with those made by ABS,\nfocusing specifically on differences within the ``gray zone'' of the strike\nzone. We propose and answer four research questions to examine the differences\nbetween human and robot umpires, player adaptation to ABS, assess the ABS\nsystem's fairness and consistency, and analyze its strategic implications for\nthe game. Our findings offer valuable insights into the impact of technological\nintegration in sports officiating, providing lessons relevant to future\nimplementations in professional baseball and beyond.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"2-hrzBZ4jvY4SdN_Oy8lmy1NR001k2QiRi1kACo4hAo","pdfSize":"4212633"}
