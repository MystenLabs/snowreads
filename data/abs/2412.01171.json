Training\naccurate machine learning models for emotion recognition typically requires a\nlarge amount of labeled data. Due to the subtleness and complexity of emotions,\nmultiple evaluators are usually needed for each affective sample to obtain its\nground-truth label, which is expensive. To save the labeling cost, this paper\nproposes an inconsistency-based active learning approach for cross-task\ntransfer between emotion classification and estimation. Affective norms are\nutilized as prior knowledge to connect the label spaces of categorical and\ndimensional emotions. Then, the prediction inconsistency on the two tasks for\nthe unlabeled samples is used to guide sample selection in active learning for\nthe target task. Experiments on within-corpus and cross-corpus transfers\ndemonstrated that cross-task inconsistency could be a very valuable metric in\nactive learning. To our knowledge, this is the first work that utilizes prior\nknowledge on affective norms and data in a different task to facilitate active\nlearning for a new task, even the two tasks are from different datasets.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"r3fSb41lfkq4mvbiN0PudBEISKigtg7twLB5FwbwNtI","pdfSize":"743496"}
