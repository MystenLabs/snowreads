EuFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$-based iron pnictides could\noffer an interesting plateau to study their relationship that has attracted\nconsiderable attention. So far, two magnetic phase transitions were observed in\nEuFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$-based crystal, which were deemed to originate from the\nitinerant Fe moments ($\\sim$ 190 K) and the localized Eu$^{2+}$ moments ($\\sim$\n19 K), respectively. Here, we systematically studied the heat capacity for the\nEuFe$_{2}$(As$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$)$_{2}$ crystals with \\textit{x} = 0.21 (optimally\ndoped) and \\textit{x} = 0.29 (overdoped). We have found two new magnetic orders\nin the superconducting state (ranging from 0.4 to 1.2 K) in the optimally doped\ncrystal. As more P was introduced into the As site, one of the magnetic orders\nbecomes absent in the overdoped crystal. Additionally, we observed strong field\nand orientation dependence in heat capacity. The present findings in\nEuFe$_{2}$(As$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$)$_{2}$ have detected the new low-temperature\nmagnetic orders, which may originate from the localized Eu$^{2+}$ spins order\nor the spin reorientation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nXbmHEZ7ANDd2TGNxBxe_L6CFQVypUSATLZElZDXXJo","pdfSize":"10642174"}
