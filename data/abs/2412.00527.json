  "abstract": "  In this work we develop a novel algorithm, termed as mixed least-squares deep\nneural network (MLS-DNN), to recover an anisotropic conductivity tensor from\nthe internal measurements of the solutions. It is based on applying the\nleast-squares formulation to the mixed form of the elliptic problem, and\napproximating the internal flux and conductivity tensor simultaneously using\ndeep neural networks. We provide error bounds on the approximations obtained\nvia both population and empirical losses. The analysis relies on the canonical\nsource condition, approximation theory of deep neural networks and statistical\nlearning theory. We also present multiple numerical experiments to illustrate\nthe performance of the method, and conduct a comparative study with the\nstandard Galerkin finite element method and physics informed neural network.\nThe results indicate that the method can accurately recover the anisotropic\nconductivity in both two- and three-dimensional cases, up to 10\\% noise in the\ndata.\n",
