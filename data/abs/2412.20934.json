This paper\nstudies diffusion processes in a different setting, where for a given\nstationary distribution and average variance, it seeks the diffusion process\nwith optimal convergence rate. It is shown that the optimal drift function is a\nlinear function and the convergence rate of the stochastic process is bounded\nby the ratio of the average variance to the variance of the stationary\ndistribution. Furthermore, the concavity of the optimal relaxation time as a\nfunction of the stationary distribution has been proven, and it is shown that\nall Pearson diffusion processes of the Hypergeometric type with polynomial\nfunctions of at most degree two as the variance functions are optimal.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Computer Science/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RLR7m5elUPt4QoAwel1Wi2f6CZR1t-Tup_Y7our7abU","pdfSize":"227607"}
