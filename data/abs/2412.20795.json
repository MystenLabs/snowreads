We include an overview\nof such symmetry maps on unital $C^\\ast$-algebras. We say that $A\\in\\mathcal A$\nis $\\varphi$-symmetric if $\\varphi(A)=A$, $A$ is $\\varphi$-antisymmetric if\n$\\varphi(A)=-A$, and $A$ has a $\\zeta=e^{i\\theta}$ $\\varphi$-phase symmetry if\n$\\varphi(A)=\\zeta A$.\n  Our main result is a new projection characterization of two operators $U$\n(unitary), $B$ that have nearby commuting operators $U'$ (unitary), $B'$. This\ncan be used to ``bootstrap'' symmetry from operators $U, B$ that are nearby\nsome commuting operators $U', B'$ to prove the existence of nearby commuting\noperators $U'', B''$ which satisfy the same symmetries/antisymmetries/phase\nsymmetries as $U, B$, provided that the symmetry maps and\nsymmetries/antisymmetries/phase symmetries satisfy some mild conditions. We\nalso prove a version of this for $X=U$ self-adjoint instead of unitary.\n  As a consequence of the prior literature and the results of this paper, we\nprove Lin's theorem with symmetries: If a $\\varphi$-symmetric matrix $A$ is\nalmost normal ($\\|[A^\\ast, A]\\|$ is small), then it is nearby a\n$\\varphi$-symmetric normal matrix $A'$. We also extend this further to include\nrotational and dihedral symmetries.\n  We also obtain bootstrap symmetry results for two and three almost commuting\nself-adjoint operators. As a corollary, we resolve a conjecture of\narXiv:1502.03498 for two almost commuting self-adjoint matrices in the\nAtland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes related to topological insulators.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"e20QmawHlL2v_2yl4GeTvOX43cKliCrXKL-GfGPzbPY","pdfSize":"569019"}
