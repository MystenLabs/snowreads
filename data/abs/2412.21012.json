  "abstract": "  Non-split Real Tambara-Yamagami categories are a family of fusion categories\nover the real numbers that were recently introduced and classified by Plavnik,\nSanford, and Sconce. We consider which of these categories admit braidings, and\nclassify the resulting braided equivalence classes. We also prove some new\nresults about the split real and split complex Tambara-Yamagami Categories.\n",
