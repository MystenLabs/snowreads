These findings underscore the\ncontemporary valuation of monopoly rents as perceived by financial markets,\nhighlighting the significant impact of monopoly breakup on market\ncapitalization and the need for a deeper understanding of these dynamics.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/General Finance","Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rm4oNLiljT2UnI4DSLk4W0Y6dKSsurNVvhtxuqvB2mc","pdfSize":"729348"}
