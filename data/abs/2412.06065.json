The flows were launched from the bases of the arch along the direction of\nthe magnetic field. It is shown that the interaction has non-equilibrium and\nnon-stationary nature. It is accompanied by an expansion of the resulting\nmagnetic plasma arch due to $E \\times B$ drift with the formation of a region\nwith oppositely directed magnetic fields, in which magnetic reconnection is\nobserved. In the subcritical regime Mm < 1 the reconnection process is slow,\nand in the overcritical one Mm > 1 it is more intense and leads to plasma\nturbulization. Filamentation of flows due to the development of Weibel\ninstability, as well as excitation of surface waves near the ion-cyclotron\nfrequency on the surface of the plasma tube are also observed. The modeling was\ncarried out for the parameters of an experiment planned for the near future,\nwhich made it possible to formulate the conditions for observing the effects\ndiscovered in the modeling.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"138x3edMkhXwmBdSp7u7i4x0TJICJxpYLqI2ktRNOos","pdfSize":"11710854"}
