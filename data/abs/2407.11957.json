With the\nincrease of available computational power, unbiased quantum-mechanical\npredictions of segregation energies, which feed classical thermodynamics models\nof segregation (e.g., McLean isotherm), become available. In recent years, huge\nprogress towards predictions closely resembling experimental observations was\nmade by considering the statistical nature of the segregation process due to\ncompeting segregation sites at a single GB and/or many different types of\nco-existing GBs. In the present work, we further expand this field by\nexplicitly showing how compositional disorder, present in realistic engineering\nalloys (e.g. steels or Ni-based superalloys), gives rise to a spectrum of\nsegregation energies. With the example of a $\\Sigma 5$ GB in a Ni-based model\nalloy (Ni-Co-Cr-Ti-Al), we show that the segregation energies of Fe, Mn, W, Nb\nand Zr are significantly different from those predicted for pure elemental Ni.\nWe further use the predicted segregation energy spectra in a statistical\nevaluation of GB enrichment, which allows for extracting segregation enthalpy\nand segregation entropy terms related to the chemical complexity in\nmulti-component alloys.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"eeUCSm7BYT1sAEYWpl6i-tC_cdTycXIOE_ely1c0ru8","pdfSize":"1643926"}
