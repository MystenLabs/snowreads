We emphasize the role of different kinematic regimes in\nprobing various aspects of bound and unbound problems, as illustrated by the\nHydrogen atom example. Classical predictions of General Relativity, such as the\nShapiro time delay and perihelion precession, emerge from these considerations.\nWe also explain a number of recent approaches to probing black hole physics\nfrom the perspective of amplitudes, including applications of worldline\neffective field theory in astrophysics, predictions of gravitational waveforms,\nand the hierarchical three-body problem.\n  These notes are based on a series of lectures held during the S-Matrix\nMarathon workshop at the Institute for Advanced Study on 11--22 March 2024.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9i2h6HWbi6Sjm88PxaaWzZLYduhWslqroubjZMl-Z0M","pdfSize":"2232650"}
