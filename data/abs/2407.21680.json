This is\nachieved by studying the associated Fourier algebra, which as a byproduct,\nallows us to show that all the linear relations of a certain general form for\nthe entries of the Pascal matrix arise from only three basic relations. We also\nshow that pairs of eigenvectors of the tridiagonal matrix define a natural\neigenbasis for the binomial transform. Lastly, we show that the commuting\ntridiagonal matrices provide a numerically stable means of diagonalizing the\nPascal matrix.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Spectral Theory","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EZkB8VOSwP1weM99SROjp5r1w2yN57tEK7RAqLlesCg","pdfSize":"186592","objectId":"0xb504e21d6084f222405d86a853f0f0aed511c427cbe0f70fc9e77ef0ec93a8a6","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
