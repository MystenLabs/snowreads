Researchers from\ndiverse fields have long worked on this, but we still need better solutions.\nThis article focuses on efficiently preserving key image features like edges\nand structures during denoising. Jump regression analysis is commonly used to\nestimate true image intensity amid noise. One approach is adaptive smoothing,\nwhich uses various local neighborhood shapes and sizes based on empirical data,\nwhile another is local pixel clustering to reduce noise while maintaining\nimportant details. This manuscript combines both methods to propose an\nintegrated denoising technique.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"h3eKOKve1Y8ol8uP7_IcYpmEyKRz0P30EcxZUAw4G9s","pdfSize":"880629"}
