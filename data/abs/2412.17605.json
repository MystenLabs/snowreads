  "abstract": "  The anisotropic quantum spin-1/2 XY model on a linear chain was solved by\nLieb, Schultz, and Mattis in 1961 and shown to display a continuous quantum\nphase transition at the O(2) symmetric point separating two gapped phases with\ncompeting Ising long-range order. For the square lattice, the following is\nknown. The two competing Ising ordered phases extend to finite temperatures, up\nto a boundary where a transition to the paramagnetic phase occurs, and meet at\nthe O(2) symmetric critical line along the temperature axis that ends at a\ntricritical point at the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature\nwhere the two competing phases meet the paramagnetic phase. We show that the\nfirst-order zero-temperature (quantum) phase transition that separates the\ncompeting phases as a function of the anisotropy parameter is smoothed by\nthermal fluctuations into deconfined classical criticality.\n",
