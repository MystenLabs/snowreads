In this scenario,\nexisting approaches rely on a two-step process, where a graph is learned first,\nfollowed by sampling. More generally, graph learning and graph signal sampling\nhave been studied as two independent problems in the literature. This work\nprovides a foundational step towards jointly optimizing the graph structure and\nsampling set. Our main contribution, Vertex Importance Sampling (VIS), is to\nshow that the sampling set can be effectively determined from the vertex\nimportance (node weights) obtained from graph learning. We further propose\nVertex Importance Sampling with Repulsion (VISR), a greedy algorithm where\nspatially -separated \"important\" nodes are selected to ensure better\nreconstruction. Empirical results on simulated data show that sampling using\nVIS and VISR leads to competitive reconstruction performance and lower\ncomplexity than the conventional two-step approach of graph learning followed\nby graph sampling.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9dE26c8ZP_MJQo_yGn5RsPg5ei-JFHYD-d37VT1jh78","pdfSize":"266329"}
