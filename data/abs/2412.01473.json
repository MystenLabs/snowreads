This work\nprovides analytical expressions for quantum Fisher and skew information in a\ngeneral three-qubit X-state and examines their evolution under phase damping,\ndepolarization, and phase-flip decoherence channels. To illustrate the validity\nof our method, we investigate their dynamics for a three-qubit\nGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state subjected to various memoryless\ndecoherence channels. Closed-form expressions for QFI and SQI are derived for\neach channel. By comparing these metrics with the entanglement measure of\nconcurrence, we demonstrate the impact of decoherence on measurement precision\nfor quantum metrology. Our results indicate that phase damping and phase-flip\nchannels generally allow for better parameter estimation compared to\ndepolarization. This study provides insights into the optimal selection of\nnoise channels for enhancing precision in quantum metrological tasks involving\nmulti-qubit entangled states.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"4qy7B_FDYtB4ukRHv3nBreDRxiLxdk1e2SEg5tG5oUY","pdfSize":"1469799"}
