  "abstract": "  The aim of this article is to investigate the convergence properties of a\nheterogeneous consensus model on Stiefel manifolds. We consider each agent,\nwithout interaction, moving according to the flow determined by the fundamental\nvector field of the right multiplication action of the orthogonal group on the\nStiefel manifold. We analyze the asymptotic behavior of N such agents, assuming\nthat, as a result of their interactions, each agent's velocity is the sum of\nits natural velocity and an additional velocity directed towards the average\nposition of the N agents. If the fundamental vector fields of all agents are\nthe same, their movement can be represented as a gradient flow on a product\nmanifold. In this study, we specifically investigate the asymptotic behavior in\na non-gradient flow setting, where the fundamental vector fields are not all\nthe same. Since fewer tools are available to address non-gradient flows, we\nperform an orbital stability analysis to obtain the desired results instead of\nrelying on a gradient flow structure. Our estimate improves upon the previous\nresult in [Ha et al., Automatica 136 (2022)]. Furthermore, as a direct\nconsequence of the asymptotic dynamics, we derive uniform-in-time stability\nwith respect to the initial data.\n",
