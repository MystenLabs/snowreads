The main goal of this paper is to\nestablish global existence of solutions to the coupled system and to explore\ntheir long-time behavior. The results are valid uniformly for mass parameters\nvarying in the interval $[0,1]$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pOVgrqCCxTtmvGka_UEvVh2X0hy3DjcyTxcZH29hlnM","pdfSize":"224851"}
