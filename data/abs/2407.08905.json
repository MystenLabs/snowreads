On the one hand, we prove that the forward and\nbackward Chapman-Kolmogorov equations of the stochastic process are Lorentz\ncovariant when the trajectories are parameterized by their proper time. On the\nother hand, to recast the model as a quantum random evolution, we consider\nrestating the Goldstein-Ka\\c{c} model as a Hamiltonian system, which can then\nbe quantized using the standard correspondence rules. It turns out that the\ndensity for the random quantum evolution satisfies a Chapman-Kolmogorov\nequation similar to that of the classical case, and therefore, it is also\nLorentz covariant. We compute the average quantum variance. To finish, we\nverify that the quantum model is also consistent with special relativity and\nthat transitions outside the light cone, that is, transitions between states\nwith disjoint supports in space-time, cannot occur.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Q-SLOmGWwOutod1YFjgR7MV2DGlV-StBZGtbuh4w6fk","pdfSize":"221618"}
