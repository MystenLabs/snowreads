However, lithium reacts readily\nwith other metals and N$_2$, making Li-M-N the most numerous sub-set of ternary\nnitrides. Here, we use Li$_2$ZrN$_2$, a ternary with a simple synthesis recipe,\nas a precursor for ion exchange reactions towards AZrN$_2$ (A = Mg, Fe, Cu,\nZn). In situ synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction studies show that Li$^+$ and\nMg$^{2+}$ undergo ion exchange topochemically, preserving the layers of\noctahedral [ZrN$_6$] to yield a metastable layered polymorph of MgZrN$_2$\n(spacegroup $R\\overline{3}m$) rather than the calculated ground state structure\n($I41/amd$). UV-vis measurements show an optical absorption onset near 2.0 eV,\nconsistent with the calculated bandgap for this polymorph. Our experimental\nattempts to extend this ion exchange method towards FeZrN$_2$, CuZrN$_2$, and\nZnZrN$_2$ resulted in decomposition products (A + ZrN + 1/6 N$_2$), an outcome\nthat our computational results explain via the higher metastability of these\nphases. We successfully extended this ion exchange method to other Li-M-N\nprecursors by synthesizing MgHfN$_2$ from Li$_2$HfN$_2$. In addition to the\ndiscovery of metastable $R\\overline{3}m$ MgZrN$_2$ and MgHfN$_2$, this work\nhighlights the potential of the 63 unique Li-M-N phases as precursors to\nsynthesize new ternary nitrides.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"csI8CIxrv0F0nAeVoQ1PDb17HAP9qs2p2W3toTiTyL0","pdfSize":"4338939"}
