This cue pops out in the\nsaliency map in the primary visual cortex without being overtly visible. We\ntested this method in an odd-one-out visual search task using eye tracking with\n15 participants in VR. When the target was rendered as an ocularity singleton,\nparticipants' gaze was drawn to the target faster. Conversely, when a\nbackground object served as the ocularity singleton, it distracted gaze from\nthe target. Since ocularity is nearly imperceptible, our method maintains user\nimmersion while guiding attention without noticeable scene alterations and can\nrender object's depth in 3D scenes, creating new possibilities for immersive\nuser experience across diverse VR applications.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"xh9aBvjXdtgKQUY5ymrS9GPpUxk0QBcp79yzObROf_A","pdfSize":"1159664"}
