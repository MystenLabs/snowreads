We find $A_{PV}^e$, of $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$, is\ngenerically one to three orders of magnitude larger than $A_{PV}^p$. We further\nestimate different uncertainty sources including statistics, parton\ndistribution functions, and beam polarization, for both asymmetries, and then\nidentify individually their dominance in different regimes of the Bjorken-$x$.\nBased on these results, we then advocate utilizing $A_{PV}^p$ for the\nextraction of the weak mixing angle at two representative momentum transfer\nscales unexplored before, and we find a relative precision below 10% can be\nachieved at the EicC with an effective one-year operation time.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"ujS4s4E3TR8vLsqmuYIaro8nVAST4gO_HD0mZHVeI7Q","pdfSize":"752172"}
