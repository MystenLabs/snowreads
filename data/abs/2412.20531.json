  "abstract": "  An electric current flowing in a ferromagnetic metal carries spin angular\nmomentum, i.e. it is spin-polarized. Here, we measure the spin-wave Doppler\nshift induced by the transfer of angular momentum from the diffusive\nspin-polarized electric current onto coherent spin waves in epitaxial\nMgO/Fe/MgO thin films. We follow this Doppler shift as function of the\ntemperature and determine that the degree of spin-polarization of the current\nincreases from 77$\\%$ to 86$\\%$ when cooling the device from 303K down to 10K.\nInterpreting these measurements within the two-current model, we separate the\ncontributions from electron-surface, electron-phonon and electron-magnon\nscatterings to the spin-dependent resistivity of Fe.\n",
