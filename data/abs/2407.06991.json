The proposed work improves over\nthe state-of-the-art by allowing wrongly labelled points of already processed\nblocks to be corrected through label propagation. By doing so, instance overlap\nbetween blocks is not anymore necessary to produce the desirable results, which\nis the main limitation of the current art. Our experiments show that the\nproposed block merging algorithm significantly and consistently improves the\nobtained accuracy for all evaluation metrics employed in literature, regardless\nof the underlying network architecture.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KerywZN7WdZSClT-I7JLphG9hWON5dtAW003O2tPdBA","pdfSize":"7352053"}
