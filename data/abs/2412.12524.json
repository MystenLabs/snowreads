  "abstract": "  We discuss selection rules of chiral matters in type IIA intersecting and IIB\nmagnetized D-brane models on toroidal orbifolds. Since the chiral matters on\ntoroidal orbifolds are labeled by a certain conjugacy class of the gauged\norbifold group, the selection rules involve non-trivial fusion rules. We find\nthat the representation of the chiral matters is described by a $D_4$ flavor\nsymmetry for an even number of magnetic fluxes or winding numbers at tree\nlevel. Furthermore, the $D_4$ symmetry still remains even when we take into\naccount loop effects. We also study non-perturbative effects such as D-brane\ninstantons.\n",
