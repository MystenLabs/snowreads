A graph\n$G$ is a \\textit{sum graph} if the vertices of $G$ can be labeled with distinct\npositive integers so that $e = uv$ is an edge of $G$ if and only if the sum of\nthe labels on vertices $u$ and $v$ is also a label in $G.$ An \\textit{integral\nsum graph} is also defined just as sum graph, the difference being that the\nlabels may be any distinct integers. In this survey article, the authors bring\nout several properties of sum and integral sum graphs obtained by different\nauthors.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"s4rjoKN7aUKo-4D5B6DF37D3qIKlvSw1ePru4-BSvNA","pdfSize":"687009","objectId":"0x03ec3f6ec530c7733797c1fba0883b486ff5ff9cda1313f6060c9d80a5ba51ff","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
