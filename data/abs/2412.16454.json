Traditional methods reliant on pose estimation or fancy\nsensor data often struggle to capture these dynamics accurately. We introduce\nFACTS, a novel transformer-based approach for fine-grained action recognition\nthat processes raw video data directly, eliminating the need for pose\nestimation and the use of cumbersome body markers and sensors. FACTS achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, with 90% accuracy on fencing actions and 83.25%\non boxing actions. Additionally, we present a new publicly available dataset\nfeaturing 8 detailed fencing actions, addressing critical gaps in sports\nanalytics resources. Our findings enhance training, performance analysis, and\nspectator engagement, setting a new benchmark for action classification in\ntactical sports.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"4o5-d3LYBuGOp5Zmq8bGDgPodCtshXLeArvLEYnCkQE","pdfSize":"11048953"}
