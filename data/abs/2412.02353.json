We use Green functions and solve parquet\nequations in high spatial dimensions to construct a conserving mean-field\ntheory of the metallic and localized phases with the transition between them in\nthe disordered Anderson model. We find that the static diffusion constant $D$\ndoes not vanish at the Anderson localization transition. The divergence of a\nnew time scale, proportional to the static electrical polarizability, signals\nthe vanishing of diffusion. We introduce an extension of the diffusion equation\nto reach a consistent microscopic picture of the Anderson localization\ntransition and the localized phase. Anderson localization is caused by the\nemergence of a spatially localized quantum bound state.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"b--JfmNo0P_Hxtiu5iTXpGxp7foa6Cb5TqxIjXMiw3Q","pdfSize":"164886"}
