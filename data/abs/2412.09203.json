  "abstract": "  Humor generation is a challenging task in natural language processing due to\nlimited resources and the quality of existing datasets. Available humor\nlanguage resources often suffer from toxicity and duplication, limiting their\neffectiveness for training robust models. This paper proposes CleanComedy, a\nspecialized, partially annotated toxicity-filtered corpus of English and\nRussian jokes collected from various sources. We study the effectiveness of our\ndata filtering approach through a survey on humor and toxicity levels in\nvarious joke groups. In addition, we study advances in computer humor\ngeneration by comparing jokes written by humans with various groups of\ngenerative jokes, including our baseline models trained on the CleanComedy\ndatasets.\n",
