Under a mild\nseparability assumption, we identify when such elements can be combined to form\na regular sequence. Using these regular sequences, we show that the Hilbert\nseries and corresponding $h$-vector can be calculated from a related graph\nusing a simplified calculation on the $f$-vector, or independence vector, of\nthe related graph. In the case when the graph is Cohen-Macaulay with a perfect\nmatching of regular edges satisfying the separability criterion, the $h$-vector\nof $R/I(G)$ will be precisely the $f$-vector of the Stanley-Reisner complex of\na graph with half as many vertices as $G$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Snrx-vjxNPt_vKeOVgYaxaJ_ggc7almmDOrc2v6VEhg","pdfSize":"258005"}
