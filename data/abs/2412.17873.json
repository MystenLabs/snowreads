  "abstract": "  If the circle acts in a Hamiltonian way on a compact symplectic manifold of\ndimension $2n$, then there are at least $n+1$ fixed points. The case that there\nare exactly $n+1$ isolated fixed points has its importance due to various\nreasons. Besides dimension 2 with 2 fixed points, and dimension 4 with 3 fixed\npoints, which are known, the next interesting case is dimension 6 with 4 fixed\npoints, for which the integral cohomology ring and the total Chern class of the\nmanifold, and the sets of weights of the circle action at the fixed points are\nclassified by Tolman. In this note, we use a new different argument to prove\nTolman's results for the dimension 6 with 4 fixed points case. We observe that\nthe integral cohomology ring of the manifold has a nice basis in terms of the\nmoment map values of the fixed points, and the largest weight between two fixed\npoints is nicely related to the first Chern class of the manifold. We will use\nthese ingredients to determine the sets of weights of the circle action at the\nfixed points, and moreover to determine the global invariants the integral\ncohomology ring and total Chern class of the manifold. The idea allows a direct\napproach of the problem, and the argument is short and easy to follow.\n",
