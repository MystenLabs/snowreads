This study aims to investigate the deviation of the intensity ratio of\nthe \\ion{Si}{IV} 1394 \\AA\\ and 1403 \\AA\\ emission lines from the expected value\nof 2 in the optically thin regime, as observed in many recent studies.\n  Methods. We analyzed the integrated intensity ratio ($R$) and the\nwavelength-dependent ratio ($r(\\Delta\\lambda)$) in a small bifurcated eruption\nevent observed by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS).\n  Results. Despite the relatively complex line profiles, most of the intensity\nratio $R$ of \\ion{Si}{IV} lines remained greater than 2 in the loops. The ratio\n$r(\\Delta\\lambda)$ varied in the line core and wings, changing distinctly from\n2.0 to 3.3 along the wavelength. At certain positions, the \\ion{Si}{IV} 1394\n\\AA\\ and 1403 \\AA\\ lines exhibited different Doppler velocities.\n  Conclusions. When diagnosing the spectra of small active region events, not\nonly the impact of opacity but also the influence of resonance scattering\nshould be considered. We propose that the ratio $r(\\Delta\\lambda)$ can serve as\nan indicator of the resonance scattering and opacity effect of the \\ion{Si}{IV}\nline.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cHW-JRa1gOjCx9opFWiTGo0LuTwxGApJiRK62hMQqTI","pdfSize":"536305"}
