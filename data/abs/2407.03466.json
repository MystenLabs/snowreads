Different types of risks may be faced during data\ntransmission in single-hop and multi-hop scenarios. Addressing these\nvulnerabilities is crucial. A systematic literature review of data provenance\nin IoT is presented, exploring existing techniques, practical implementations,\nsecurity requirements, and performance metrics. Respective contributions and\nshortcomings are compared. A taxonomy related to the development of data\nprovenance in IoT is proposed. Open issues are identified, and future research\ndirections are presented, providing useful insights for the evolution of data\nprovenance research in the context of the IoT.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7ijYVSvGM1naHgUh-F3skwkX7e_RXrD-l_qCfalWvSk","pdfSize":"2570510"}
