We also propose a class of\nproximal bundle methods for solving convex-concave nonsmooth composite\nsaddle-point problems and establish the iteration-complexity to find an\napproximate saddle-point. This paper places special emphasis on the primal-dual\nperspective of the proximal bundle method. In particular, we discover an\ninteresting duality between the conditional gradient method and the\ncutting-plane scheme used within the proximal bundle method. Leveraging this\nduality, we further develop novel variants of both the conditional gradient\nmethod and the cutting-plane scheme.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8Gagu-9_vbt81rMpGQuD59oSxFTtLoaFR2Z0wNeAsOs","pdfSize":"428598"}
