This is fundamentally\ndifferent from traditional Image-Aesthetics Assessment (IAA), which judges an\nimage's artistic quality. While previous studies often confuse the concepts of\n``aesthetics'' and ``appeal,'' our work addresses this by being the first to\nstudy ICAA explicitly. To do this, we propose a novel system that automates\ndataset creation and implements algorithms to estimate and boost content\nappeal. We use our pipeline to generate two large-scale datasets (70K+ images\neach) in diverse domains (food and room interior design) to train our models,\nwhich revealed little correlation between content appeal and aesthetics. Our\nuser study, with more than 76% of participants preferring the appeal-enhanced\nimages, confirms that our appeal ratings accurately reflect user preferences,\nestablishing ICAA as a unique evaluative criterion.
