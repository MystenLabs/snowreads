Here we present a novel speckle-based machine\nlearning approach for OAM recognition, which enables recognition using a 1-D\narray detector or even a 0-D single-pixel detector.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"9_WFH0kbgci5nwBZldSAjps7G2tFGGrSCy6VRbsTgyc","pdfSize":"203438"}
