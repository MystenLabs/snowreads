Our findings reveal that most branching\nfractions calculated in this study, such as ${\\cal B}(\\Omega_b^-\\to\\Xi^-\nD^0,\\Xi^{-}D^{*0}) = (1.0^{+0.6}_{-0.4}\\pm 0.2, 2.0^{+1.3}_{-0.8}\\pm\n0.5)\\times10^{-4}$, are ten to one hundred times larger than those reported in\nprevious calculations. Additionally, we interpret the ratio ${\\cal\nB}(\\Omega_b^-\\to\\Omega^- J/\\psi)/{\\cal B}(\\Omega_b^-\\to\\Omega^- \\eta_c)\\simeq\n3.4$ within the helicity framework. While the decay involving external\n$W$-boson emission appears to be suppressed by the $b\\to u \\bar c s$ weak\ntransition, it still yields a significant branching fraction. For instance,\n${\\cal B}(\\Omega_b^-\\to \\Xi^0 D_s^{*-}) = (8.1\\pm 0.5^{+2.0}_{-1.8})\\times\n10^{-5}$ and ${\\cal B}(\\Omega_b^-\\to\\Xi^{*0}D_s^{-},\\Xi^{*0}D_s^{*-}) = (8.0\\pm\n0.5^{+0.9}_{-0.8}, 16.3\\pm 0.9^{+3.2}_{-3.0})\\times10^{-5}$, with values\nreaching as large as $10^{-4}$. These predictions are well within the\nexperimental reach of LHCb.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2dSh961HLj5l0IuML4ylsXgC8OfcVzWEm3HoYNHYFy8","pdfSize":"237680"}
