For a positive integer $k$, a set function is called $k$-distant\nsubmodular if the submodular inequality holds for every pair whose symmetric\ndifference is at least $k$. This paper provides a polynomial time algorithm to\nminimize $k$-distant submodular functions for a fixed positive integer $k$.\nThis result generalizes the tractable result of minimizing 2/3-submodular\nfunctions, which satisfy the submodular inequality for at least two pairs\nformed from every distinct three sets.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Mm6cZgn9sW6Rk3Z5r98FXiHIqNCHN7Wbfkp_JWGGzYo","pdfSize":"168408"}
