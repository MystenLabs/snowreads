  "abstract": "  We perform an analysis on the non-leptonic two-body weak decays of\n$\\Lambda^{0}_{b}$ within the framework of the final-state rescattering\nmechanism. The strong phases can be obtained by realizing complete hadronic\ntriangle loop integrations. Then the CP violation and decay asymmetry\nparameters can be predicted. In this work, we focus on the exclusive decays of\n$\\Lambda^{0}_{b}\\to p\\pi^{-}/K^{-}/\\rho^{-}/K^{*-}$ and $\\Lambda\\phi$ and\nachieve numerical predictions for many observables, including branching ratios,\ndirect and partial-wave CP asymmetries, and decay asymmetry parameters. The\nresults are very consistent with the current data, showing the validity of the\nfinal-state rescattering mechanism for $b$-baryon decays. It is therefore\nexpected to be applied to predict CP asymmetries in many other channels of\n$b$-baryon decays.\n",
