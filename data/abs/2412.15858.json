  "abstract": "  We present Vela, an efficient, modular, easy-to-use Bayesian pulsar timing\nand noise analysis package written in Julia. Vela provides an independent,\nefficient, and parallelized implementation of the full non-linear pulsar timing\nand noise model along with a Python binding named pyvela. One-time operations\nsuch as data file input, clock corrections, and solar system ephemeris\ncomputations are performed by pyvela with the help of the PINT pulsar timing\npackage. Its reliability is ensured via careful design utilizing Julia's type\nsystem, strict version control, and an exhaustive test suite. This paper\ndescribes the design and usage of Vela focusing on the narrowband paradigm.\n",
