However, many existing frameworks are often tailored to specific\ntasks and require intricate training procedures. We propose AdaSense, a novel\nAdaptive CS approach that leverages zero-shot posterior sampling with\npre-trained diffusion models. By sequentially sampling from the posterior\ndistribution, we can quantify the uncertainty of each possible future linear\nmeasurement throughout the acquisition process. AdaSense eliminates the need\nfor additional training and boasts seamless adaptation to diverse domains with\nminimal tuning requirements. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of\nAdaSense in reconstructing facial images from a small number of measurements.\nFurthermore, we apply AdaSense for active acquisition of medical images in the\ndomains of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT),\nhighlighting its potential for tangible real-world acceleration.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"JqErtTNOM-_mZ7A4lPNK0a3DdQ_LSN3z7elGHujJVMA","pdfSize":"5705768"}
