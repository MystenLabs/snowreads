It takes as inputs a point cloud of space points and\nlabels them so that space points created by the same particle have the same\nlabel. The list of space points with the same label is a track candidate. We\nargue that this pattern recognition problem can be formulated as a sorting\nproblem, of which the inputs are a list of space points sorted by their\ndistances away from the collision points and the outputs are the space points\nsorted by their labels. In this paper, we propose the TrackSorter algorithm: a\nTransformer-based algorithm for pattern recognition in particle data.\nTrackSorter uses a simple tokenization scheme to convert space points into\ndiscrete tokens. It then uses the tokenized space points as inputs and sorts\nthe input tokens into track candidates. TrackSorter is a novel end-to-end track\nfinding algorithm that leverages Transformer-based models to solve pattern\nrecognition problems. It is evaluated on the TrackML dataset and has good track\nfinding performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AmpPF3TMrLxFd-TrB9zH3Lltsf2CGj-dOSGXsVPLrHU","pdfSize":"681164"}
