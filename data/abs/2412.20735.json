  "abstract": "  We introduce HunyuanProver, an language model finetuned from the Hunyuan 7B\nfor interactive automatic theorem proving with LEAN4. To alleviate the data\nsparsity issue, we design a scalable framework to iterative synthesize data\nwith low cost. Besides, guided tree search algorithms are designed to enable\neffective ``system 2 thinking`` of the prover. HunyuanProver achieves\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performances on major benchmarks. Specifically, it\nachieves a pass of 68.4% on the miniF2F-test compared to 65.9%, the current\nSOTA results. It proves 4 IMO statements (imo_1960_p2, imo_1962_p2},\nimo_1964_p2 and imo_1983_p6) in miniF2F-test. To benefit the community, we will\nopen-source a dataset of 30k synthesized instances, where each instance\ncontains the original question in natural language, the converted statement by\nautoformalization, and the proof by HunyuanProver.\n",
