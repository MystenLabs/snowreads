For elliptic equations the solution at some distance of\nthe boundary is only affected in an effective way and the macroscopic and\nmesoscopic behaviour can be separated. A multiscale formulation in the spirit\nof the heterogeneous multiscale method is introduced on the example of the\nPoisson equation. Based on the method of matched asymptotic expansion the\nsolution is separated into a macroscopic far field defined in a domain with\nonly slowly varying boundary and a mesoscopic near field defined in scaled\ncoordinates on possibly varying infinite periodicity cells. The near field has\na polynomial behaviour that is coupled to the traces of the macroscopic\nvariable on the mid-line of the multiperforated plate. A variational\nformulation using a Beppo-Levi space in the strip is introduced and its\nwell-posedness is shown. The variational framework when truncating the infinite\nstrip is discussed and the truncation error is estimated.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GvCYvp6gxkcdLjtWm0s9EBIJ6QMT1tf_mhC3sUeWFJw","pdfSize":"580852"}
