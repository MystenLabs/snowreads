  "abstract": "  In this paper, we investigate the shadowing property for general upper\nsemicontinuous set-valued maps, inspired by Good and Meddaugh [11], we identify\nthe fundamental objects underpinning the shadowing theory for such maps.\nSpecifically, we explore the relationships among shifts of finite type, the\nsimplest set-valued maps, and the shadowing property.\n  Our main result establishes that if $X$ is a compact, totally disconnected\nHausdorff space, and $F$ is an upper semicontinuous closed-valued map on $X$\nwith the set-valued shadowing property, the following hold:\n  (1) If $F$ is expansive, the orbit system of $(X,F)$ is conjugate to a shift\nof finite type.\n  (2) Without expansiveness, $(X,F)$ is conjugate to an inverse limit of a net\nof the simplest set-valued systems satisfying the Mittag-Leffler condition.\nAdditionally, the orbit system of $(X,F)$ is conjugate to an inverse limit of a\nnet of shifts of finite type, also satisfying the Mittag-Leffler condition\n  As a consequence, if an upper semicontinuous set-valued map on a totally\ndisconnected space has the set-valued shadowing property, its orbit system also\nexhibits the single-valued shadowing property.\n",
