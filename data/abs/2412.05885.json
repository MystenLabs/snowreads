This\n  has demonstrated significant advancements in computational\n  electronic structure theory by\n  improving basis set convergence and compactifying the description of the wave\nfunction. In\n  this work, we introduce a new approach that incorporates pseudopotentials\n(PPs) into the\n  TC framework, significantly accelerating Jastrow factor optimization and\nreducing\n  computational costs. Our results for ionization potentials, atomization\nenergies, and\n  dissociation curves of first-row atoms and molecules show that PPs provide\nchemically\n  accurate descriptions across a range of systems and give guidelines for\nfuture\n  theory and applications.\n  The new pseudopotential-based TC method opens possibilities for applying TC\nto more complex\n  and larger systems, such as transition metals and solid-state systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3svkbJ9P_5E8YO5VDmaDf9QVubP7_06wVaQJKj0kc6g","pdfSize":"1493122"}
