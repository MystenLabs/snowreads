Due to\nits unquenchable nature, measurements by static compression techniques on\nphysical properties of davemaoite at lower mantle conditions are rare and\ntechnically challenging, and those are essential to constrain compositions and\nproperties of mineralogical models in the lower mantle. Here, we present\nHugoniot equation of state and sound velocity of CaSiO3 glass under shock\ncompression. The CaSiO3 glass transforms into the crystalline phase above 34\nGPa and completely transforms into davemaoite above 120 GPa. Thermal equation\nof state and Hugoniot temperature of davemaoite have been derived from the\nshock wave data. The CaSiO3 glass under shcok compression has very high shock\ntemperature. Shock wave experiments for sound velocity of CaSiO3 glass indicate\nthat no melting is observed at Hugoniot pressure up to 117.6 GPa. We propose\nthat the melting temperature of davemaoite should be higher than those reported\ntheoretically by now.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"lq1KD5EePSXiIIoq_2oDPTKjwVJxA0yJFODGoHofbF4","pdfSize":"1633516"}
