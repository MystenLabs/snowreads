This approach is inspired by\nBorel-Cantelli-type arguments from Fayad and Lema\\'nczyk (2006). The key\ninnovation of our method lies in its applicability to singularities beyond the\nlogarithmic type, whereas previous techniques were restricted to logarithmic\nsingularities. Our approach is particularly effective for proving the\nergodicity of skew products for symmetric IETs and antisymmetric cocycles.\nMoreover, its most significant advantage is its ability to study the\nequidistribution of error terms in the spectral decomposition of Birkhoff\nintegrals for locally Hamiltonian flows on compact surfaces, applicable not\nonly when all saddles are perfect (harmonic) but also in the case of some\nnon-perfect saddles.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"R-4-rEwapAM3FgnU5LjDB6ezqk2Fr6uHzuMrwfg5LIQ","pdfSize":"1104191"}
