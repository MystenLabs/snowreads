  "abstract": "  Thermal X-ray emission from rotation-powered millisecond pulsars, shaped by\ngravitational lensing and the beaming of the surface radiation, provides\ncritical insights into neutron star properties. This approach has been the\nfocus of observations with the NICER mission. Using a semi-analytic model to\ncalculate pulse profiles, we investigate the effects of adopting incorrect\nbeaming models on the inferred compactness of neutron stars. We demonstrate\nthat assuming a more centrally peaked beaming pattern when fitting data from a\nmore isotropic emitter leads to an underestimation of compactness in the case\nof two antipodal polar caps. We present a detailed analysis of this\ncounterintuitive result, offering both qualitative insights and quantitative\nestimates. If the atmospheric heating in the millisecond pulsars observed with\nNICER is shallow, the inferred radii for these sources could be significantly\noverestimated, with important implications for neutron star structure and\nequation-of-state constraints.\n",
