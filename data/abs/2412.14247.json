  "abstract": "  We propose a new strategy to obtain a high-purity sample of gluon-initiated\njets at the LHC. Our approach, inspired by the Lund jet plane picture, is to\nperform a dijet selection where the two jets are collinear to each other and\ntheir momentum fraction share is highly asymmetric, and to measure the primary\nLund plane density of emissions of the subleading jet. The subleading jet in\nthis topology is practically equivalent to a secondary Lund jet plane. We\ndemonstrate by means of fixed-order calculations that such a simple setup\nyields gluon jet fractions of around 90% for the subleading jet for both quark-\nand gluon-initiated jets. This observation is confirmed using hadron-level\nMonte Carlo generated events. We also show that the extracted gluon purities\nare highly resilient to the overall colour structure of the event, to the\nflavour of the hard-scattering process, and to the parton distribution\nfunctions. This strategy is well-suited for constraining the radiation pattern\nof gluon-initiated jets using a set of fiducial cuts that can readily be tested\nat the LHC, without relying on taggers or statistical demixing.\n",
