These integration schemes operate directly on the MBS configuration\nspace considered as a Lie group. For discrete spatial mechanical systems there\nare two Lie group that can be used as configuration space: $SE\\left( 3\\right) $\nand $SO\\left( 3\\right) \\times \\mathbb{R}^{3}$. Since the performance of the\nnumerical integration scheme clearly depends on the underlying configuration\nspace it is important to analyze the effect of using either variant. For\nconstrained MBS a crucial aspect is the constraint satisfaction. In this paper\nthe constraint violation observed for the two variants are investigated. It is\nconcluded that the $SE\\left( 3\\right) $ formulation outperforms the $SO\\left(\n3\\right) \\times \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ formulation if the absolute motions of the\nrigid bodies, as part of a constrained MBS, belong to a motion subgroup. In all\nother cases both formulations are equivalent. In the latter cases the $SO\\left(\n3\\right) \\times \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ formulation should be used since the $SE\\left(\n3\\right) $ formulation is numerically more complex, however.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aCGgG2lscaP_Eq_G-DnmshZ1liyNMF_jJ_OLhC5WF88","pdfSize":"2956259"}
