Several authors have studied statistical properties of these groups as we\nrange over all sublattices of index at most $X$. In this paper we investigate\nquotients by sublattices that have additional algebraic structure. While\nquotients $\\mathbb{Z}^n/\\Lambda$ follow the Cohen-Lenstra heuristics and are\nvery often cyclic, we show that if $\\Lambda$ is actually a subring, then once\n$n \\ge 7$ these quotients are very rarely cyclic. More generally, we show that\nonce $n$ is large enough the quotient typically has very large rank. In order\nto prove our main theorems, we combine inputs from analytic number theory and\ncombinatorics. We study certain zeta functions associated to $\\mathbb{Z}^n$ and\nalso prove several results about matrices in Hermite normal form whose columns\nspan a subring of $\\mathbb{Z}^n$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sIfqBDRyrMiOArRfEuitdGl-FhLc1-1w9lNxxWdAWOE","pdfSize":"353171"}
