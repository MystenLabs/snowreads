  "abstract": "  The formation of composite solitons produced by scalar fields without thermal\nphase transitions in the early Universe is considered. We present numerical\nsimulations of the formation and evolution of soliton structures at the\npost-inflationary stage. The realistic initial conditions are obtained through\nthe simulation of multiple quantum fluctuations during the inflation epoch. The\ninitial field distributions allow to form local soliton clusters in the early\nUniverse without the need for the thermal production of a soliton network\nthroughout the Universe. We find that in three-dimensional space, the\nnontrivial composite field structures are formed in the form of <<soliton\nfoam>>, consisting of closed domain walls, domain walls bounded by cosmic\nstrings, and scalar field radiation. The possible cosmological implications of\nthe soliton foam are discussed.\n",
