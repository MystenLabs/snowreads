Our library offers an\nindustry-standard scikit-learn interface, allowing intuitive usage and easy\nintegration with machine learning pipelines. It is also highly optimized,\nfeaturing parallel computation that enables efficient processing of large\nmolecular datasets. Currently, \\skfp~stands as the most feature-rich library in\nthe open source Python ecosystem, offering over 30 molecular fingerprints. Our\nlibrary simplifies chemoinformatics tasks based on molecular fingerprints,\nincluding molecular property prediction and virtual screening. It is also\nflexible, highly efficient, and fully open source.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"D-Org4t-X6yod8EgJSz7tkPwbp-jwbCvW4JE8budElw","pdfSize":"545101"}
