Existing methods typically aggregate lower-level data into higher-level\nvariables and then estimate correlations based on the aggregated data. However,\ndifferent data aggregation methods can yield varying correlation estimates as\nthey target different higher-level quantities. Our solution is a latent factor\nmodel that directly estimates these higher-level correlations from lower-level\ndata without the need for data aggregation. We further introduce a shrinkage\nestimator to ensure the positive definiteness and improve the accuracy of the\nestimated correlation matrix. Furthermore, we establish the asymptotic\nnormality of our estimator, enabling efficient computation of p-values for the\nidentification of significant correlations. The effectiveness of our approach\nis demonstrated through comprehensive simulations and the analysis of\nproteomics and gene expression datasets. We develop the R package highcor for\nimplementing our method.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dc7f39P9Pns4h7FtC8G8FNjt2GNSp7KlVzJaI_filRU","pdfSize":"1020680"}
