Using, the\nexperimentally inferred conformal dynamic susceptibility, we compute the\nresultant quantum Fisher information (QFI), a witness to multi-partite\nentanglement. In contrast to a Fermi liquid in which the QFI is approximately\ntemperature independent much below the Fermi energy scale, we find that the QFI\nincreases as a power law at low temperatures but ultimately extrapolates to a\nconstant at $T=0$. The constant is of the form, $\\omega_g^{2\\Delta}$, where\n$\\Delta$ is the conformal dimension and $\\omega_g$ is the UV cutoff which is on\nthe order of the pseudogap. As this constant {depends on both UV and IR\nproperties}, it illustrates that multipartite entanglement in a strange metal\nexhibits UV-IR mixing, a benchmark feature of doped Mott insulators as\nexemplified by dynamical spectral weight transfer. We conclude with a\ndiscussion of the implication of our results for low-energy reductions of the\nHubbard model.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KzVGUxibFQhVil2Dtyb4X_o1LkOWuurnBWD3hP1likE","pdfSize":"477045"}
