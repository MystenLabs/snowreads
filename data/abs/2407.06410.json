We\nanalyze distinct models representing varying depths of quark-hadron phase\ntransitions. Our findings reveal that, while cross stars rotating at their\nKepler frequencies typically exhibit a significantly higher mass and larger\ncircumferential radius as anticipated, interestingly, there is a significant\nincrease in potential twin configurations in the case of rapid rotations. We\nfurther study sequences of constant baryonic mass, representing potential paths\nof rotational evolution. Our results indicate that not all stars in these\nsequences are viable due to the onset of phase transitions during spin-down,\nleading to possible mini-collapses. We also investigate the phenomenon of\n``back-bending\" during spin-down sequences, which is manifested in a rather\ndifferent shape for cross stars due to their inverted structure and the large\ndensity discontinuity caused by the strong phase transition, in contrast to\ntraditional hybrid stars. Our research enriches existing studies by introducing\nthe significant aspect of rotation, unveiling intr\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4TTeXwCxG7mzEP30x9u29OL5hof4th8mn73sV7YvGlM","pdfSize":"1698186"}
