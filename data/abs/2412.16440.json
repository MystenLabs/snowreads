  "abstract": "  Dwarf galaxies are thought of as the building blocks of large galaxies such\nas our Milky Way. This paper presents new high-resolution hydrodynamical\nsimulations of dwarf galaxies and their intergalactic medium with the\n\\texttt{GIZMO} code. Our simulations consider the key physical processes of\ngalaxy evolution, such as gas cooling, chemistry, and stellar and black hole\nfeedback. Unlike the previous work, the initial conditions of our simulations\ntaking the dwarf galaxies of $2-5 \\times 10^{10} \\, M_\\odot$ from the realistic\ncosmology simulations, \\texttt{IllustrisTNG}. We further increase the original\nresolution of \\texttt{IllustrisTNG} by a factor of $\\sim 100$ via a particle\nsplitting scheme. Our results show that the evolution of complex multiphase CGM\nand its metal content is sensitive to the redshift of dwarf galaxies. The\naccretion of CGM into dwarf galaxies plays a key role in providing $20 \\% - 50\n\\%$ of the star-forming gas and replenishing $40 \\% - 70 \\%$ of the total mass\nin the galactic disk. Furthermore, the accretion history of supermassive black\nholes in the centers of high-$z$ dwarf galaxies shows episodic patterns with\nhigh-accreting states close to $\\sim 10 \\%$ of the Eddington mass accretion\nrate, implying the rapid growth of supermassive black holes in the early\nuniverse, which may be revealed by the coming observations from the James Webb\nSpace Telescope (JWST).\n",
