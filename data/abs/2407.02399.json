Here we consider stabilisation by adding $n_{Q} \\leq 3$\nVector-Like Quarks (VLQs) of mass $m_{Q}$: $T$ vector quarks transforming as\n$({\\bf 3}, {\\bf 1}, 2/3)$ and $B$ vector quarks transforming as $({\\bf 3}, {\\bf\n1}, -1/3)$. Requiring stability of the finite-temperature effective potential,\nand assuming $m_{t}$ equals its mean value, we find that the upper bounds on\n$m_{Q}$ for $T$ quarks are 5.8 TeV (for $n_{Q} = 2$) and 55 TeV (for $n_{Q} =\n3$). The corresponding absolute stability upper bounds are 4.4 TeV and 29 TeV.\nSmall upper bounds are obtained for $B$ quarks. For renormalisation in the\nEinstein frame (Prescription I) the predictions are almost indistinguishable\nfrom the classical values: $n_s = 0.966$ and $r = 3.3 \\times 10^{-3}$.\nRenormalisation in the Jordan frame (Prescription II) predicts larger values of\n$n_{s}$ and $r$, with $n_{s}$ generally in the range 0.980 to 0.990 and $r$ of\nthe order of 0.01. The predicted range of $n_{s}$ is consistent with the CMB\nrange obtained in Hubble tension solutions which modify the sound horizon at\ndecoupling, whilst the predicted values of $r$ will be easily observable by\nforthcoming CMB experiments. The observational upper bound on $r$ generally\nimposes a stronger constraint on $m_{Q}$, with the $T$ quark upper bound equal\nto 2.4 TeV for $n_{Q} = 2$ and 13 TeV for $n_{Q} = 3$. We conclude that\nVLQ-stabilised Higgs Inflation with Prescription II renormalisation favours\n1-10 TeV vector-like quarks that will be accessible to future colliders, and\npredicts a tensor-to-scalar ratio that will be observable in forthcoming CMB\nexperiments and values of $n_{s}$ that favour an early-time solution to the\nHubble tension.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xJRrC8wtpCiLIaUpQIeDT3x2HlUwCdPGZHfyGcvJe9s","pdfSize":"622679"}
