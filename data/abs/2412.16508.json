  "abstract": "  Water entry problem has extensive applications in numerous areas of nature,\nindustry, and science. Here, we investigate the Worthington jets generated\nduring the water entry of solid spheres with no cavity formed experimentally\nand theoretically. Three different pinch-off modes are identified in\nexperiments, which depend solely on the release height H and the diameter of\nthe sphere D, regardless of the material of the sphere. A brief dimensional\nanalysis of the experimental data indicates that the dimensionless maximum\nheight of the jet h/D is proportional to the Froude number, defined as Fr=2H/D.\nBased on the basic solution of flow past a sphere and the application of a\nreasonable potential function near the free surface, a theoretical model is\ndeveloped diverging from the Rayleigh-Besant problem. Predictions regarding the\nshape and maximum height of the jet show good agreement with experimental\nresults.\n",
