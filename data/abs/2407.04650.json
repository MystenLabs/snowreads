{"id":"2407.04650","title":"Action Research with Industrial Software Engineering -- An Educational\n  Perspective","authors":"Yvonne Dittrich, Johan Bolmsten and Catherine Seidelin","authorsParsed":[["Dittrich","Yvonne",""],["Bolmsten","Johan",""],["Seidelin","Catherine",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2024 17:05:06 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-08","timestamp":1720199106000,"abstract":"  Action research provides the opportunity to explore the usefulness and\nusability of software engineering methods in industrial settings, and makes it\npossible to develop methods, tools and techniques with software engineering\npractitioners. However, as the research moves beyond the observational\napproach, it requires a different kind of interaction with the software\ndevelopment organisation. This makes action research a challenging endeavour,\nand it makes it difficult to teach action research through a course that goes\nbeyond explaining the principles.\n  This chapter is intended to support learning and teaching action research, by\nproviding a rich set of examples, and identifying tools that we found helpful\nin our action research projects. The core of this chapter focusses on our\ninteraction with the participating developers and domain experts, and the\norganisational setting.\n  This chapter is structured around a set of challenges that reoccurred in the\naction research projects in which the authors participated. Each section is\naccompanied by a toolkit that presents related techniques and tools. The\nexercises are designed to explore the topics, and practise using the tools and\ntechniques presented. We hope the material in this chapter encourages\nresearchers who are new to action research to further explore this promising\nopportunity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RghPj7bZAXsHjb2CYEPjyUud0mdSzgS0QOBCkMWBQQY","pdfSize":"1019119"}
