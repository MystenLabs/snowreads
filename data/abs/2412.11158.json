  "abstract": "  Concept drift, characterized by unpredictable changes in data distribution\nover time, poses significant challenges to machine learning models in streaming\ndata scenarios. Although error rate-based concept drift detectors are widely\nused, they often fail to identify drift in the early stages when the data\ndistribution changes but error rates remain constant. This paper introduces the\nPrediction Uncertainty Index (PU-index), derived from the prediction\nuncertainty of the classifier, as a superior alternative to the error rate for\ndrift detection. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that: (1) The PU-index\ncan detect drift even when error rates remain stable. (2) Any change in the\nerror rate will lead to a corresponding change in the PU-index. These\nproperties make the PU-index a more sensitive and robust indicator for drift\ndetection compared to existing methods. We also propose a PU-index-based Drift\nDetector (PUDD) that employs a novel Adaptive PU-index Bucketing algorithm for\ndetecting drift. Empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world\ndatasets demonstrate PUDD's efficacy in detecting drift in structured and image\ndata.\n",
