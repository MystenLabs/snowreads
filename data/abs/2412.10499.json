  "abstract": "  We show that the conformal data of a range of large-$N$ CFTs, the melonic\nCFTs, are specified by constrained extremization of the universal part of the\nsphere free energy $F=-\\log Z_{S^d}$, called $\\tilde{F}$. This family includes\nthe generalized SYK models, the vector models (O$(N)$, Gross-Neveu, etc.), and\nthe tensor field theories. The known $F$ and $a$-maximization procedures in\nSCFTs are therefore extended to these non-supersymmetric CFTs in continuous\n$d$. We establish our result using the two-particle irreducible (2PI) effective\naction, and, equivalently, by Feynman diagram resummation. $\\tilde{F}$\ninterpolates in continuous dimension between the known $C$-functions, so we\ninterpret this result as an extremization of the number of IR degrees of\nfreedom, in the spirit of the generalized $c,F,a$-theorems. The outcome is a\ncomplete classification of the melonic CFTs: they are the conformal mean field\ntheories which extremize the universal part of the sphere free energy, subject\nto an IR marginality condition on the interaction Lagrangian.\n",
