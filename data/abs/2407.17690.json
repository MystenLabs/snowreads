More recently, the notion of\nposet-stratified space, i.e., topological space endowed with a continuous map\nto a poset with its Alexandrov topology, has been popularized. Both notions of\nstratified spaces are ubiquitous in mathematics, ranging from investigations of\nsingular structures in algebraic geometry to extensions of the homotopy\nhypothesis in higher category theory. In this article we study the precise\nmathematical relation between these different approaches to stratified spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Topology","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sUZ3nMFbr7ex7B56DNwrpnOBX6YiDOxjAzjhUX65QPc","pdfSize":"219060"}
