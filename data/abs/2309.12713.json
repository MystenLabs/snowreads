The Sui blockchain\nprotocol uses a variant of the Bullshark consensus algorithm due to its lower\nlatency, but this leader-based protocol causes performance issues when\ncandidate leaders crash. In this paper, we explore the ideas pioneered by\nCarousel on providing Leader-Utilization and present HammerHead. Unlike\nCarousel, which is built with a chained and pipelined consensus protocol in\nmind, HammerHead does not need to worry about chain quality as it is directly\nprovided by the DAG, but needs to make sure that even though validators might\ncommit blocks in different views the safety and liveness is preserved. Our\nimplementation of HammerHead shows a slight performance increase in a faultless\nsetting, and a drastic 2x latency reduction and up to 40% throughput increase\nwhen suffering faults (100 validators, 33 faults).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xnaqg6xI7PtB7R8xWzc1r0X7KIi2qTpN4z7ZKn_pa5s","pdfSize":"521930"}
