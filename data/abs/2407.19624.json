Mathematical statistics has evolved in parallel to its applications,\nwith much recent interest high-dimensional settings. In the genetics of human\ncommon disease, a number of relevant problems can be formulated as tests of\nindependence. We show how defining adequate premetric structures on the support\nspaces of the genetic data allows for novel approaches to such testing. This\nyields a solid theoretical framework, which reflects the underlying biology,\nand allows for computationally-efficient implementations. For each problem, we\nprovide mathematical results, simulations and the application to real data.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Quantitative Biology/Genomics","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"iMpre_ZilTuHrVCsmaIg54rbFmVptlZiqPc6CaxCMrc","pdfSize":"5480863"}
