Our motivation is to show Hilbert-Schmidt\nstability for various diagonal products, including the classical family of B.\nH. Neumann groups. Additionally, we initiate a quantitative study of\nHilbert-Schmidt stability for infinitely presented groups, through the notion\nof stability radius growth, and exhibit an uncountable family of\nHilbert-Schmidt stable amenable groups with arbitrarily large such growth. Some\napplications to local Hilbert-Schmidt stability are also provided.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3f9ESu_ZIto4GrMo3_j9HfDTXdb6E61azbPhgTeiBPA","pdfSize":"787749"}
