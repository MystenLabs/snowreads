In this paper. we provide an comprehensive review of common data\nprocessing techniques used in modern multimodal model training with a focus on\ndiffusion models and multimodal large language models (MLLMs). We summarized\nall techniques into four categories: data quality, data quantity, data\ndistribution and data safety. We further present our findings in the choice of\ndata process methods in different type of models. This study aims to provide\nguidance to multimodal models developers with effective data processing\ntechniques.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QpTWEsOa5yVDHatfU_AaPAkMwWRDpbSI_3wrX7jrO9o","pdfSize":"154528"}
