By examining the activations and features of neural\nnetworks for vowel classification, we gain insights into what the networks\n\"see\" in spectrograms. Through the use of class activation mapping, we identify\nthe frequencies that contribute to vowel classification and compare these\nfindings with linguistic knowledge. Experiments on a American English dataset\nof vowels showcases the explainability of neural networks and provides valuable\ninsights into the causes of misclassifications and their characteristics when\ndifferentiating them from unvoiced speech. This study not only enhances our\nunderstanding of the underlying acoustic cues in vowel classification but also\noffers opportunities for improving speech recognition by bridging the gap\nbetween abstract representations in neural networks and established linguistic\nknowledge\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VEuKcmPGYtwGrH5n_LLf4ck9RG_ILoBJJZ6lAPcQEFQ","pdfSize":"7608645"}
