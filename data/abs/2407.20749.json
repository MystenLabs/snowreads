Current research on visual localization with neural\nnetworks is limited to examining methods for enhancing the accuracy of networks\nacross various datasets. How to expedite the re-localization process within\ndeep neural network architectures still needs further investigation. In this\npaper, we present a novel approach for accelerating visual re-localization in\npractice. A tree-like search strategy, built on the keyframes extracted by a\nvisual clustering algorithm, is designed for matching acceleration. Our method\nhas been validated on two tasks across three public datasets, allowing for 50\nup to 90 percent time saving over the baseline while not reducing location\naccuracy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FEyQNp5PKoghoCCQJ8t4eFsPRKgXsT2cDBm_lRk0wLo","pdfSize":"1245064"}
