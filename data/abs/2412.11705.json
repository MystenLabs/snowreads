Evidently, the evolution towards the active control of such\nstructural colours with smart materials is in progress for real applications.\nHere we experimentally demonstrate a large colour gamut with high intensity and\npurity, as well as its switching on and off based solely on tungsten trioxide\n(WO3) cylindrical resonators. The strong resonances in the visible spectral\nrange in these WO3 metasurfaces can be reversibly switched on and off due to\nits electrochromism by applying alternating voltages of +2.0 V and -0.3 V. Our\napproach opens up possibilities for the functional diversification of\ncommercial smart windows, as well as the development of new display\ntechnologies in the future.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"oyIYGuw-yMysnn63MI_mUckQX1tG-Jyj0-GXxaRNTh0","pdfSize":"1901368"}
