In this article\nwe delve into problems related to identifying clusters across related groups,\nwhen additional covariate information is available. We formulate a novel\nBayesian nonparametric approach based on mixture models, integrating ideas from\nthe hierarchical Dirichlet process and \"single-atoms\" dependent Dirichlet\nprocess. The proposed method exhibits exceptional generality and flexibility,\naccommodating both continuous and discrete covariates through the utilization\nof appropriate kernel functions. We construct a robust and efficient Markov\nchain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm involving data augmentation to tackle the\nintractable normalized weights. The versatility of the proposed model extends\nour capability to discern the relationship between covariates and clusters.\nThrough testing on both simulated and real-world datasets, our model\ndemonstrates its capacity to identify meaningful clusters across groups,\nproviding valuable insights for a spectrum of applications.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"19pO3vFPjtEymv2F1Xv5xlbLR-XtFAKSvGX4uXz-DxA","pdfSize":"11729152"}
