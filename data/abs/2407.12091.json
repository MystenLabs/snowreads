We show that there are secular divergences in\nphysically relevant observables which arise solely from the non-Markovian part\nof the memory kernel, contrary to popular belief that secular growth typically\ncomes from local terms in evolution equations. Nevertheless, we show that these\nterms can still be non-perturbatively resummed, using the time-convolutionless\nmaster equation formalism, which improves upon previous approximations. At the\nsame time, there are other physical quantities in the same model that are\ndominated by local terms in the memory kernel. Therefore, we conclude that, for\ncosmological backgrounds, either the dissipation or the noise kernel can end up\nbeing dominated by non-local terms depending on the nature of the\nsystem-environment coupling.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5Jpxv8wDpdhf04JrPBSWnnCVnggt-F8UjkH0iS1Sqyo","pdfSize":"962852"}
