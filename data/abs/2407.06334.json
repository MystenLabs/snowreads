However, current search methods assume the sufficiency of\nreaching arbitrary building blocks, failing to address the common real-world\nconstraint where using specific molecules is desired. To this end, we present a\nformulation of synthesis planning with starting material constraints. Under\nthis formulation, we propose Double-Ended Synthesis Planning (DESP), a novel\nCASP algorithm under a bidirectional graph search scheme that interleaves\nexpansions from the target and from the goal starting materials to ensure\nconstraint satisfiability. The search algorithm is guided by a goal-conditioned\ncost network learned offline from a partially observed hypergraph of valid\nchemical reactions. We demonstrate the utility of DESP in improving solve rates\nand reducing the number of search expansions by biasing synthesis planning\ntowards expert goals on multiple new benchmarks. DESP can make use of existing\none-step retrosynthesis models, and we anticipate its performance to scale as\nthese one-step model capabilities improve.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MIy-6YDfPthMGcz8PTaHNqrUKzhEDjq7d7XApN4ydY0","pdfSize":"1023285"}
