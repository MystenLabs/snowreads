  "abstract": "  Current keyword decision-making in sponsored search advertising relies on\nlarge, static datasets, limiting the ability to automatically set up keywords\nand adapt to real-time KPI metrics and product updates that are essential for\neffective advertising. In this paper, we propose On-the-fly Keyword Generation\n(OKG), an LLM agent-based method that dynamically monitors KPI changes and\nadapts keyword generation in real time, aligning with strategies recommended by\nadvertising platforms. Additionally, we introduce the first publicly accessible\ndataset containing real keyword data along with its KPIs across diverse\ndomains, providing a valuable resource for future research. Experimental\nresults show that OKG significantly improves keyword adaptability and\nresponsiveness compared to traditional methods. The code for OKG and the\ndataset are available at https://github.com/sony/okg.\n",
