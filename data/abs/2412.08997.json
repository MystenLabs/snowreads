(This is mathematically equivalent to the study of homometric\nsubsets of $\\mathbb{Z}_n$ in X-ray crystallography.) It is a difficult open\nproblem to classify Z-related chords, even upon restriction to a given number\nof pitches (i.e., order); in fact, a classification is known only for the\nsmallest possible order, namely 4. In these notes, we introduce visualizations\nwe call ``orbital diagrams,'' in order to represent infinite two-parameter\nfamilies of Z-related chords. We then write down certain relations within and\namong certain families of order 5. The results sketched herein will be expanded\nupon in forthcoming work.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sthLcK_MiOihqtqqtfJzTvStvWAzZbgJ0AnzOMAblAI","pdfSize":"162530"}
