  "abstract": "  In this paper, stability and sensitivity properties of a class of parametric\nconstrained optimization problem, whose feasible region is defined by a\nset-valued inclusion, are investigated through the associated optimal value\nfunction. Set-valued inclusions are a kind of constraint system, which\nnaturally emerges in contexts requiring the robust fulfilment of traditional\ncone constraints, where data are affected by uncertain elements having a non\nstochastic nature, or in (MPEC) as a vector equilibrium constraint, where\nfeasible solutions are intended as equilibrium point in a strong sense. Under\nproper convexity assumptions on the objective function and the constraining\nset-valued term, combined with a global qualification condition, a class of\nparametric optimization problems is singled out, which displays a global\nLipschitz behaviour. By employing recent results of variational analysis,\nelements for a sensitivity analysis of this class of problems are provided via\nexact subgradient formulae for the optimal value function. Further consequences\nof the stability behaviour are explored in terms of problem calmness and\nviability of penalization techniques.\n",
