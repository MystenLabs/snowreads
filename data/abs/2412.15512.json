In agreement with experiment, in both PbTe and SnTe, Bi is a donor and\nAg is an acceptor with a vanishing magnetic moment. In contrast, Cr is a\nresonant donor in PbTe, and an resonant acceptor in SnTe. We also consider the\nelectronic structure of cation vacancies in PbTe and SnTe, since these abundant\nnative defects induce $p$-type conductivity in both hosts. The quantitatively\ndifferent impact of these dopants/defects on the host band structure of PbTe\nand SnTe (level energies, band splittings, band inversion, and a different\nlevel of hybridization between dopant and host states) is explained based on\nthe group-theoretical arguments.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"Z2OM1ltqO5upiVzDs58HhyGVjw1VgEbdq3mq9xMXXps","pdfSize":"654496"}
