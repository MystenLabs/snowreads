We show that\nthey are planar $k$-trees for $2 \\le k \\le 4$. We also show that higher-rank\ntrees differ from $1$-trees by giving examples of higher-rank trees having\nproperties which are impossible for $1$-trees. Finally, we collect more\nexamples of higher-rank planar trees which are not in our family.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Category Theory","Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KLjc-V9BVjY3kRMzAQF9CuG5R96QMOgu12bT62kfc1w","pdfSize":"361160"}
