However, recent sub-kpc\nobservations of nearby galaxies reveal deviations from the nearly unity slope\n(N) obtained with disk-averaged measurements. We study SF and molecular gas\n(MG) distribution in the early-stage luminous infrared galaxy merger Arp240\n(NGC5257-8). Using VLA radio continuum (RC) and ALMA CO(2-1) observations with\na uniform grid analysis, we estimate SF rates and MG surface densities\n($\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{SFR}}$ and $\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{H_2}}$, respectively). In Arp\n240, N is sub-linear at 0.52 $\\pm$ 0.17. For NGC 5257 and NGC 5258, N is 0.52\n$\\pm$ 0.16 and 0.75 $\\pm$ 0.15, respectively. We identify two SF regimes: high\nsurface brightness (HSB) regions in RC with N $\\sim$1, and low surface\nbrightness (LSB) regions with shallow N (ranging 0.15 $\\pm$ 0.09 to 0.48 $\\pm$\n0.04). Median CO(2-1) linewidth and MG turbulent pressure (P$_{\\mathrm{turb}}$)\nare 25 km s$^{-1}$ and 9 $\\times$10$^{5}$ K cm$^{-3}$. No significant\ncorrelation was found between $\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{SFR}}$ and CO(2-1) linewidth.\nHowever, $\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{SFR}}$ correlates with P$_{\\mathrm{turb}}$,\nparticularly in HSB regions ($\\rho >$0.60). In contrast, SF efficiency\nmoderately anti-correlates with P$_{\\mathrm{turb}}$ in LSB regions but shows no\ncorrelation in HSB regions. Additionally, we identify regions where peaks in SF\nand MG are decoupled, yielding a shallow N ($\\leq$ 0.28 $\\pm$ 0.18). Overall,\nthe range of N reflects distinct physical properties and distribution of both\nthe SF and MG, which can be masked by disk-averaged measurements.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ogEM90TvSw0zzs-HWBk18pK9CGi8K-Ick-x-93WWLdg","pdfSize":"10304679"}
