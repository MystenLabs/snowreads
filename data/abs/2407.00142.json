We\ninvestigate graph neural networks (GNNs) for this task, aiming to derive\nmeaningful representations of individual gut microbiomes. Unlike methods\nrelying solely on taxa abundance, we directly leverage phylogenetic\nrelationships, in order to obtain a generalized encoder for taxa networks. The\nrepresentation learnt from the encoder are then used to train a model for\nphenotype prediction such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"L06va22ihLAoXQzfhuGgOni0GLaQbF2MxTJgXx3XVwo","pdfSize":"857038"}
