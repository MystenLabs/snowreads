  "abstract": "  This article is the last of the series of articles where we reprove the\nfoundational ideas of abstract six-functor formalisms developed by Liu-Zheng.\nWe prove the theorem of partial adjoints, which is a simplicial technique of\nencoding various functors altogether by taking adjoints along specific\ndirections. Combined with the $\\infty$-categorical compactification theorem\nfrom the previous article, we can construct abstract six-functor formalisms in\nreasonable geometric setups of our interest. We also reprove the simplified\nversions of the DESCENT program due to Liu-Zheng, which allows us to extend\nsuch formalisms from smaller to larger geometric setups.\n",
