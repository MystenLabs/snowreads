  "abstract": "  We analyze the framework recently proposed by Oppenheim et al. to model\nrelativistic quantum fields coupled to relativistic, classical, stochastic\nfields (in particular, as a model of quantum matter coupled to ``classical\ngravity''). Perhaps surprisingly, we find that we can define and calculate\nscattering probabilities which are Lorentz-covariant and conserve total\nprobability, at least at tree level. As a concrete example, we analyze $2 \\to\n2$ scattering of quantum matter mediated by a classical Yukawa field. Mapping\nthis to a gravitational coupling in the non-relativistic limit, and assuming\nthat we can treat large objects as point masses, we find that the simplest\npossible ``classical-quantum'' gravity theory constructed this way gives\npredictions for $2 \\to 2$ gravitational scattering which are inconsistent with\nsimple observations of, e.g., spacecraft undergoing slingshot maneuvers. We\ncomment on lessons learned for attempts to couple quantum matter to\n``non-quantum'' gravity, or more generally, for attempts to couple relativistic\nquantum and classical systems.\n",
