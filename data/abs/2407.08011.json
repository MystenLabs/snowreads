Recently, many applications display full-body avatars to\nrepresent the user and animate the arms to follow the controllers. Embodiment\nis higher when the self-avatar movements align correctly with the user.\nHowever, having a full-body self-avatar following the user's movements can be\nchallenging due to the disparities between the virtual body and the user's\nbody. This can lead to misalignments in the hand position that can be\nnoticeable when interacting with virtual objects. In this work, we propose five\ndifferent interaction modes to allow the user to interact with virtual objects\ndespite the self-avatar and controller misalignment and study their influence\non embodiment, proprioception, preference, and task performance. We modify\naspects such as whether the virtual controllers are rendered, whether\ncontrollers are rendered in their real physical location or attached to the\nuser's hand, and whether stretching the avatar arms to always reach the real\ncontrollers. We evaluate the interaction modes both quantitatively (performance\nmetrics) and qualitatively (embodiment, proprioception, and user preference\nquestionnaires). Our results show that the stretching arms solution, which\nprovides body continuity and guarantees that the virtual hands or controllers\nare in the correct location, offers the best results in embodiment, user\npreference, proprioception, and performance. Also, rendering the controller\ndoes not have an effect on either embodiment or user preference.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"L8tmugEY6nena4BpWpBlF8kEN4SJDk4QuG78fbz02Ys","pdfSize":"4425164"}
