  "abstract": "  The integration of multi-omic data is pivotal for understanding complex\ndiseases, but its high dimensionality and noise present significant challenges.\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a robust framework for analyzing large-scale\nsignaling pathways and protein-protein interaction networks, yet they face\nlimitations in expressivity when capturing intricate biological relationships.\nTo address this, we propose Graph Sequence Language Model (GraphSeqLM), a\nframework that enhances GNNs with biological sequence embeddings generated by\nLarge Language Models (LLMs). These embeddings encode structural and biological\nproperties of DNA, RNA, and proteins, augmenting GNNs with enriched features\nfor analyzing sample-specific multi-omic data. By integrating topological,\nsequence-derived, and biological information, GraphSeqLM demonstrates superior\npredictive accuracy and outperforms existing methods, paving the way for more\neffective multi-omic data integration in precision medicine.\n",
