(2009) and Chen and Huang\n(2018). The stability condition of the VEMs is derived by establishing\nKorn-type inequalities and inverse inequalities. Some crucial commutative\nrelations for locking-free analysis as in elastic problems are derived. The\nsharp and uniform error estimates with respect to both the microscopic\nparameter and the Lam\\'e coefficient are achieved in the lowest-order case,\nwhich is also verified by numerical results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Of3knsq95Tzvpp7v3JG9kxFuX2siDf74ipqU3LD7eaA","pdfSize":"338422"}
