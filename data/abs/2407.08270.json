However,\nthe process is time-consuming and often requires extensive literature reviews\nand numerous experiments. Our study addresses these challenges by leveraging\nmachine learning to analyze material properties with greater precision and\nefficiency. By automating the data extraction process and using the extracted\ninformation to train machine learning models, our developed model, SciQu,\noptimizes material properties. As a proof of concept, we predicted the\nrefractive index of materials using data extracted from numerous research\narticles with SciQu, considering input descriptors such as space group, volume,\nand bandgap with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) 0.068 and R2 0.94. Thus, SciQu\nnot only predicts the properties of materials but also plays a key role in\nself-driving laboratories by optimizing the synthesis parameters to achieve\nprecise shape, size, and phase of the materials subjected to the input\nparameters.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dUxd0qPKr6KDs6zc_j_vHgD-62IteH2ks4LEldBJUZ8","pdfSize":"1030230","objectId":"0xd0d3741abd665115b22f8b419a64f7d62126ca057b16ec6fb401f1fcf056a26a","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
