  "abstract": "  Backwards geodesics for TASEP were introduced in [Fer18]. We consider flat\ninitial conditions and show that under proper scaling its end-point converges\nto maximizer argument of the Airy$_2$ process minus a parabola. We generalize\nits definition to generic non-integrable models including ASEP and speed\nchanged ASEP (call it quasi-geodesics). We numerically verify that its\nend-point is universal, where the scaling coefficients are analytically\ncomputed through the KPZ scaling theory.\n",
