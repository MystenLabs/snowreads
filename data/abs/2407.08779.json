Focusing on Brans-Dicke theories, those including a non-minimal\ncoupling between a scalar degree of freedom and the Ricci scalar, we study the\norigin of these screening mechanisms from a field theory perspective,\nconsidering the influence of the Standard Model on the mechanisms.\nAdditionally, we further consider the role of scale symmetries on screening,\ndemonstrating that only certain sectors, those obtaining their mass via the\nHiggs mechanism, contribute to screening the fifth forces. This has significant\nimplications for baryons, which obtain most of their mass from the gluon's\nbinding energy. Given that the Planck mass is related to the vacuum expectation\nvalue of the non-minimally coupled field, we find an extensive region of the\nparameter space where screening mechanisms create a spatially dependent\ngravitational constant. We say that the field over-screens when this effect is\nmore significant than the fifth forces suppressed by screening mechanisms, as\nwe illustrate for the chameleon and symmetron models.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xgk-_yQRgLlr18OQDtXzEQabHDYCPKOrEXpkMZkDHPE","pdfSize":"555971"}
