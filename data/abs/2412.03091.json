  "abstract": "  We consider damped wave equations with a potential and rotational inertia\nterms. We study the Cauchy problem for this model in the one dimensional\nEuclidean space and we obtain fast energy decay and L^2-decay of the solution\nitself as time goes to infinity. Since we are considering this problem in the\none dimensional space, we have no useful tools such as the Hardy and/or\nPoincar\\'e inequalities. This causes significant difficulties to derive the\ndecay property of the solution and the energy. A potential term will play a\nrole for compensating these weak points.\n",
