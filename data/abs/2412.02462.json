  "abstract": "  For $q \\in (0, 1)$, the deformed exponential function $f(x) = \\sum_{n \\geq 1}\nx^n q^{n(n-1)/2}/n!$ is known to have infinitely many simple and negative zeros\n$\\{x_k(q)\\}_{k \\geq 1}$. In this paper, we analyze the series expansions of\n$-x_k(q)/k$ and $k/x_k(q)$ in powers of $q$. We prove that the coefficients of\nthese expansions are rational functions of the form $P_n(k)/Q_n(k)$ and\n$\\widehat{P}_n(k)/Q_n(k)$, where $Q_n(k) \\in {\\mathbb Z}[k]$ is explicitly\ndefined and the polynomials $P_n(k), \\widehat{P}_n(k)\\in {\\mathbb Z}[k]$ can be\ncomputed recursively. We provide explicit formulas for the leading coefficients\nof $P_n(k)$ and $\\widehat{P}_n(k)$ and compute the coefficients of these\npolynomials for $n \\leq 300$. Numerical verification shows that $P_n(k)$ and\n$\\widehat{P}_n(k)$ take non-negative values for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and\n$n\\le 300$, offering further evidence in support of conjectures by Alan Sokal.\n",
