  "abstract": "  Liveness properties are traditionally proven using a ranking function that\nmaps system states to some well-founded set. Carrying out such proofs in\nfirst-order logic enables automation by SMT solvers. However, reasoning about\nmany natural ranking functions is beyond reach of existing solvers. To address\nthis, we introduce the notion of implicit rankings - first-order formulas that\nsoundly approximate the reduction of some ranking function without defining it\nexplicitly. We provide recursive constructors of implicit rankings that can be\ninstantiated and composed to induce a rich family of implicit rankings. Our\nconstructors use quantifiers to approximate reasoning about useful primitives\nsuch as cardinalities of sets and unbounded sums that are not directly\nexpressible in first-order logic. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nimplicit rankings by verifying liveness properties of several intricate\nexamples, including Dijkstra's k-state, 4-state and 3-state self-stabilizing\nprotocols.\n",
