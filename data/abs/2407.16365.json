This paper presents the concept of generalized\nconditional mutual information, along with a family of multiparty quantum\nmutual information measures. We provide interpretations and delineate the\nproperties of these concepts, while also pointing out certain unresolved\nissues. The generalized conditional mutual information serves to encapsulate\nthe interdependencies and correlations among various components of a multiparty\nquantum system. Additionally, various formulations of multiparty quantum mutual\ninformation contribute to a deeper comprehension of classical, quantum, and\ntotal correlations. These insights have the potential to propel fundamental\nresearch in the field of quantum information theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"-b-nf-J_6hwvlCgWvLXgD0dlR1hVcs5lAfI0mwRv8N4","pdfSize":"683216"}
