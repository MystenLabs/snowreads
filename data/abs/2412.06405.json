To address\nthis issue, we have employed a method based on the Partially Observable Markov\nDecision Processes (POMDPs) framework designed for planning under uncertainty.\nThe method utilizes the Adaptive Belief Tree (ABT) algorithm as an approximate\nsolver for the POMDPs. We outline the POMDP formulation, beginning with\ndiscretizing the intersection's topology. Additionally, we present a dynamics\nmodel for the prediction of the evolving states of vehicles, such as their\nposition and velocity. Using an observation model, we also describe the\nconnection of those states with the imperfect (noisy) available measurements.\nOur results confirmed that the method is able to plan collision-free\ntrajectories in a series of simulations utilizing real-world traffic data from\naerial footage of two distinct intersections. Furthermore, we studied the\nimpact of parameter adjustments of the ABT algorithm on the method's\nperformance. This provides guidance in determining reasonable parameter\nsettings, which is valuable for future method applications.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"QEM6fI2THT5nPSKjBP_aZa6ckeiChhGW7KP9LrCdkGU","pdfSize":"3428614"}
