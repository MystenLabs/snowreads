We derive their basic\nproperties, relations to the classical Chebyshev polynomials, and new\nfactorization formulas for $U_n(x)$. As an application, we study the quadratic\nembedding constant (QEC) of a fan graph $K_1+P_n$. By means of a new polynomial\n$\\phi_n(x)$ which is shown to be factorized by the partial Chebyshev polynomial\n$U^{\\mathrm{e}}_n(x)$, we prove that $\\mathrm{QEC}(K_1+P_n)$ coincides with the\nminimal zero of $\\phi_n(x)$, of which the values and estimates are also\nobtained.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JsnjbiidGP9afhFq-51za5GLImpmBkYRacKr4aZnUsk","pdfSize":"225895"}
