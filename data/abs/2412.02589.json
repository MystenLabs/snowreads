While existing methods can accurately reconstruct\n3D organ geometries from full 3D volumetric imaging, they cannot be used during\nsurgical interventions where usually limited observed data, such as a few 2D\nframes or 1D signals, is available in real-time. We propose a versatile\nframework for reconstructing 3D motion from such partial data. It discretizes\nthe 3D space into a deformable tetrahedral grid with signed distance values,\nproviding implicit unlimited resolution while maintaining explicit control over\nmotion dynamics. Given an initial 3D model reconstructed from pre-operative\nfull volumetric data, our system, equipped with an universal observation\nencoder, can reconstruct coherent 3D cardiac motion from full 3D volumes, a few\n2D MRI slices or even 1D signals. Extensive experiments on cardiac intervention\nscenarios demonstrate our ability to generate plausible and anatomically\nconsistent 3D motion reconstructions from various sparse real-time\nobservations, highlighting its potential for multimodal cardiac imaging.
