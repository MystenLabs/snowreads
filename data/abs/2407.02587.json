This problem remains unsolved and open yet. In\nthis paper, we employ calculus of variations method to solve this problem.\nAssuming the trajectories and envelopes are convex, the sofa's area is\nformulated as an integral functional on a set of parametric equations for\ncurves. The final shape is determined by solving the Euler-Lagrange equations.\nUtilizing numerical methods, we obtain the non-trivial area of 2.2195316,\nconsistent with the previously well-known Gerver's constant since 1992. We\nprove that both the results of Gerver's sofa and Romik's car satisfy the\nEuler-Lagrange equations for the necessary condition of maximal area. We also\nexplore additional cases and asymmetric conditions, and discuss other variant\nproblems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"ObpmD2Uv_gClZen8_2oXeU4Y-z7Te9zntIzOizU29qc","pdfSize":"1729994"}
