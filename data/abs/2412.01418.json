In the last\nseveral years our research group has computed and deposited thousands of human\nbraingraphs to the braingraph.org site, by applying public structural\n(diffusion) MRI data from young and healthy subjects. Here we describe a recent\naddition to the {\\tt braingraph.org} site, which contains connectomes from\nhealthy and demented subjects between 42 and 95 years of age, based on the\npublic release of the OASIS-3 dataset. The diffusion MRI data was processed\nwith the Connectome Mapper Toolkit v.3.1. We believe that the new addition to\nthe braingraph.org site will become a useful resource for enlightening the\naging circuitry of the human brain in healthy and diseased subjects, including\nthose with Alzheimer's disease in several stages.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"utb9zil7mTvq_BwhHvHxmxTd5hHaKETLPvxS9MTdDIo","pdfSize":"112113"}
