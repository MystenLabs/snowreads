  "abstract": "  The ITk is a new silicon tracker for the ATLAS experiment designed to\nincrease detector resolution, readout capacity, and radiation hardness, in\npreparation for the larger number of simultaneous proton-proton interactions at\nthe High Luminosity LHC. This paper presents the first direct measurement of\nthe material budget of an ATLAS ITk pixel module, performed at a testbeam at\nthe CERN Proton Synchrotron via the multiple scattering of low energy positrons\nwithin the module volume. Using a four plane telescope of thin monolithic pixel\ndetectors from the MALTA collaboration, scattering datasets were recorded at a\nbeam energy of $1.2\\,\\text{GeV}$. Kink angle distributions were extracted from\ntracks derived with and without information from the ITk pixel module, and were\nfit to extract the RMS scattering angle, which was converted to a fractional\nradiation length $x/X_0$. The average $x/X_0$ across the module was measured as\n$[0.89 \\pm 0.01 \\text{ (resolution)} \\pm 0.01 \\text{ (subtraction)} \\pm 0.08\n\\text{ (beam momentum band)}]\\%$, which agrees within uncertainties with an\nestimate of $0.88\\%$ derived from material component expectations.\n",
