In the functional renormalization group application to\nthe extended Hubbard model in two dimensions, we show that the flow of the rest\nfunction can be neglected up to moderate interaction strengths. We explore the\nphysics arising from the interplay between onsite and nearest-neighbor\ninteractions in various parameter regimes by performing a fluctuation\ndiagnostics. Differently from the magnetic and superconducting\nsusceptibilities, the charge susceptibility appears to be described by the\nrandom phase approximation (RPA). We show that this behavior can be traced back\nto cancellations in the renormalization of the density fermion-boson coupling.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kSnN8oz275JnOPMca1ECCWuoTS2Ld54DbN5spYHlT9c","pdfSize":"3352960"}
