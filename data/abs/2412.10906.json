However, open-source LLMs proficient in both finance\nand ESG domains remain scarce. To address this gap, we introduce SusGen-30K, a\ncategory-balanced dataset comprising seven financial NLP tasks and ESG report\ngeneration, and propose TCFD-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating sustainability\nreport generation. Leveraging this dataset, we developed SusGen-GPT, a suite of\nmodels achieving state-of-the-art performance across six adapted and two\noff-the-shelf tasks, trailing GPT-4 by only 2% despite using 7-8B parameters\ncompared to GPT-4's 1,700B. Based on this, we propose the SusGen system,\nintegrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), to assist in\nsustainability report generation. This work demonstrates the efficiency of our\napproach, advancing research in finance and ESG.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computer Science/Machine Learning","Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Y9GxnRqYCd50EwiMhD5XFaq9IQD-CvgNW3hBdjGpa04","pdfSize":"2265219"}
