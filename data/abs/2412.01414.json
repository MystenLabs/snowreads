Although they are\nvery useful in practice their theory is not well developed. In the paper we\nprovide a proof-theoretic formulation of the general approach to tfos provided\nindependently by several authors like Scott, Hatcher, Corcoran, and compare it\nwith an approach proposed later by Tennant. Eventually it is shown how the\ngeneral theory can be applied to specific areas like Quine's set theory NF.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tvVoJHC1CD0ggbX99lu9EC6TgO16UjXk842G3OuGhI0","pdfSize":"214744"}
