Vortex focal plane mask coupled with downstream pupil (Lyot) stop\nstands as one of the best small-angle coronagraphs, but is also sensitive to\nlow-order aberrations. Here, we revisit the behavior of the vortex phase mask,\nfrom entrance pupil down to the final detector plane, with Zernike polynomials\nas input phase aberrations. In particular we develop a second-order expansion\nthat allows us to analyze the phase retrieval properties in a more intuitive\nand accurate way than previously proposed. With this formalism, we show how the\nazimuthal vortex modulation modifies the phase retrieval properties compared to\nnormal imaging. In particular, our results suggest that images obtained with a\nscalar vortex coronagraph can be used for unambiguous focal-plane wavefront\nsensing in any practical situation. We compare our results with numerical\nsimulations and discuss practical implementation in coronagraphic instruments.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wDgAgGNiIXPJKqi5T0TRNSC42Ct5ym5w0LEy8KeLC_I","pdfSize":"2188714"}
