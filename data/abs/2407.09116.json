In\nparticular, a comparison with the eigenvalues of the continuous operators will\nbe presented that highlights deviations in the high frequency regime and\nimpacts, in a peculiar way, the accuracy of the numerical solutions of each\nformulation. A study and a proactive analysis of numerical results from\nstandard boundary element solvers and the predictions from the theoretical\nanalysis will corroborate the analytical framework employed and the validity of\nour observations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DRegcR5BXSCK_NGQ7RQC2YqnorN6I26Xi7fZVoymCpY","pdfSize":"271252"}
