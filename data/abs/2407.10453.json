To increase the\nutilization effectively, we proposed a method of enhancing medication\nrecommendation with Large Language Model (LLM) text representation. LLM\nharnesses powerful language understanding and generation capabilities, enabling\nthe extraction of information from complex and lengthy unstructured data such\nas clinical notes which contain complex terminology. This method can be applied\nto several existing base models we selected and improve medication\nrecommendation performance with the combination representation of text and\nmedical codes experiments on two different datasets. LLM text representation\nalone can even demonstrate a comparable ability to the medical code\nrepresentation alone. Overall, this is a general method that can be applied to\nother models for improved recommendations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4uSyaQthPaQ-7KqqIJRDH-caKQcT1oEBu5TOare6QIA","pdfSize":"5728429","objectId":"0x810fd1dbc4b85c799b4fc93f7e97f14bebad3d39e52fb006d104b9c380295e54","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
