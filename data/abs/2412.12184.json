  "abstract": "  During its annual conference in 2024, the French Society of Astronomy &\nAstrophysics (SF2A) hosted a special session dedicated to discussing the\nenvironmental transition within the scope of our occupation. Since 2021,\nthinking on this subject has progressed significantly, both quantitatively and\nqualitatively. This year was an opportunity to take stock of the main areas of\nreflection that we need to keep in mind in order to implement a fair,\ncollective and effective environmental transition. This proceeding summarizes\nthe key points from the plenary session related to the environmental transition\nspecial session. The purpose of the messages disseminated here is to suggest\nideas for reflection and inspiration, so as to initiate, stimulate, and foster\ndiscussions within the A&A research community, towards the implementation of\nconcrete measures to mitigate our environmental footprint.\n",
