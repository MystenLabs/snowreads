The usefulness of the formula studied was\nexamined by conducting calculations based on actual data through measurements\nmade by on-site surveys of a greening companie. A series of calculation results\nsuggest that this formula may be useful. Recognizing carbon credits for green\nbusinesses for the carbon sequestration of their projects is an important\nincentive not only as part of environmental improvement and climate change\naction, but also to improve the health and well-being of local communities and\nto generate economic benefits. This study is a pioneering exploration of the\nmethodology.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"cyCueIruO1QOZYiWB2deCCMtfgtpUujAbcMEFd1---s","pdfSize":"714107"}
