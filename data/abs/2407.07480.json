Pulsars, magnetars and strongly magnetised white dwarfs have all been\nseen to been observed to exhibit coherent, pulsed radio emission in relation to\ntheir rotational period. Recently, a new type of radio long period transient\n(LPT) has been discovered. The bright radio emission of LPTs resembles that of\nradio pulsars and magnetars. However, they pulse on timescales (minutes) much\nlonger than previously seen. While minute timescales are common rotation\nperiods for white dwarfs, LPTs are much brighter than the known pulsating white\ndwarfs, and dipolar radiation from isolated (as opposed to binary) magnetic\nwhite dwarfs has yet to be observed. Here, we report the discovery of a new\n$\\sim$421~s LPT, CHIME J0630+25, using the CHIME/FRB and CHIME/Pulsar\ninstruments. We used standard pulsar timing techniques and obtained a\nphase-coherent timing solution which yielded limits on the inferred magnetic\nfield and characteristic age. CHIME J0630+25 is remarkably nearby ($170 \\pm\n80$~pc), making it the closest LPT discovered to date.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2tI6V6exD8YuiU2QYLLiVGb7ZMm4Lh9BnjZu1iPERoY","pdfSize":"7425759","objectId":"0x84d43d189b0d6f8ddb31993d7e26a630f0484fee9a4565b9ca42ae37b6d99f6b","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
