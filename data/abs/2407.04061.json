These factors\ntogether hinder the effective transfer and application of knowledge learned\nfrom specific datasets. Since the existing evaluation metrics are initially\ndesigned for evaluation on a single domain by calculating the 2D or 3D overlap\nbetween the prediction and ground-truth bounding boxes, they often suffer from\nthe overfitting problem caused by the size differences among datasets. This\nraises a fundamental question related to the evaluation of the 3D object\ndetection models' cross-domain performance: Do we really need models to\nmaintain excellent performance in their original 3D bounding boxes after being\napplied across domains? From a practical application perspective, one of our\nmain focuses is actually on preventing collisions between vehicles and other\nobstacles, especially in cross-domain scenarios where correctly predicting the\nsize of vehicles is much more difficult. In other words, as long as a model can\naccurately identify the closest surfaces to the ego vehicle, it is sufficient\nto effectively avoid obstacles. In this paper, we propose two metrics to\nmeasure 3D object detection models' ability of detecting the closer surfaces to\nthe sensor on the ego vehicle, which can be used to evaluate their cross-domain\nperformance more comprehensively and reasonably. Furthermore, we propose a\nrefinement head, named EdgeHead, to guide models to focus more on the learnable\ncloser surfaces, which can greatly improve the cross-domain performance of\nexisting models not only under our new metrics, but even also under the\noriginal BEV/3D metrics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"U1Tfi2G_X1SlHNmPxq8zCxFOPVIs94TSDOkqsQ06j6o","pdfSize":"4500701"}
