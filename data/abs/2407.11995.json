In this context, we introduce patient monitoring as a\nspecial case of Human Activity Recognition and derive concrete requirements for\nthis application area. We then present a process architecture and discuss why\nNeSy-AI should be applied for patient monitoring. To further support our\nargumentation, we show how NeSy-AI can help to overcome certain technical\nchallenges that arise from this application area.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Hzr9BqUC7o2tuum3rL0rCZLC9oV6wacdEmnrvCwhzOg","pdfSize":"1822432"}
