This\nmodel integrates interactions at the molecular, cellular, and macro-kinetic\nlevels, accounting for inherent variations in metabolic state transitions of\nindividual cells. By incorporating both online (e.g., oxygen uptake, pH) and\noffline measurements (e.g., viable cell density, metabolite concentrations),\nthe proposed mechanistic model enables accurate long-term prediction of cell\nculture trajectories and provides reliable prediction intervals quantifying\nbatch-to-batch variations. This work can guide optimal design of experiments\nand robust process control to improve yield and production stability.\nAdditionally, the proposed multi-scale model has a modular design enables\nflexible in silico simulations and extrapolation across diverse conditions,\nproviding a robust prediction framework for scalable and flexible\nbiomanufacturing applications.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Molecular Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"R1RrO8CTk72F9ubjjk9r7Kz5zPE52yRu1HjaXWBnOPs","pdfSize":"3920832"}
