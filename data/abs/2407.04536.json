The goal is to assess the advantages and disadvantages of both\napproaches in order to determine the feasibility of employing blockchain\ntechnology for a decentralized PKI. The study will also evaluate the impact of\ncurrent legal frameworks, such as the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) and NIS-2\nDirective. The study will examine various implementations of blockchain PKIs\nbased on factors such as security, performance, and platform. The results\nindicate that blockchain-based PKIs can overcome the limitations of\nconventional PKIs by decentralizing the trust anchor, providing greater\nsecurity. Blockchain technology allows for the immutable and transparent\nmanagement of certificates, making tampering significantly more challenging.\nAdditionally, blockchain-based PKIs offer enhanced mechanisms for identifying\nand addressing certificate misconduct.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jMLuaopwb2dX67gSPmOCs_Gbx6Zkp4CGJUpVPpoj9kU","pdfSize":"102096"}
