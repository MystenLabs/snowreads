Existing\nmethods that attempt to model dynamic urban scenes without leveraging priors on\npotentially moving regions often produce suboptimal results. Meanwhile,\napproaches based on manual 3D annotations yield improved reconstruction quality\nbut are impractical due to labor-intensive labeling. In this paper, we revisit\nthe potential of 2D semantic maps for classifying dynamic and static Gaussians\nand integrating spatial and temporal dimensions for urban scene representation.\nWe introduce Urban4D, a novel framework that employs a semantic-guided\ndecomposition strategy inspired by advances in deep 2D semantic map generation.\nOur approach distinguishes potentially dynamic objects through reliable\nsemantic Gaussians. To explicitly model dynamic objects, we propose an\nintuitive and effective 4D Gaussian splatting (4DGS) representation that\naggregates temporal information through learnable time embeddings for each\nGaussian, predicting their deformations at desired timestamps using a\nmultilayer perceptron (MLP). For more accurate static reconstruction, we also\ndesign a k-nearest neighbor (KNN)-based consistency regularization to handle\nthe ground surface due to its low-texture characteristic. Extensive experiments\non real-world datasets demonstrate that Urban4D not only achieves comparable or\nbetter quality than previous state-of-the-art methods but also effectively\ncaptures dynamic objects while maintaining high visual fidelity for static\nelements.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nHAbpCKEAt_hWUbzypylBbW85GSteOn3vczCCRnFhT8","pdfSize":"39305173"}
