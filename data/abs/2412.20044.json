  "abstract": "  Precise magnetometry is vital in numerous scientific and technological\napplications. At the forefront of sensitivity, optical atomic magnetometry,\nparticularly techniques utilizing nonlinear magneto-optical rotation (NMOR),\nenables ultraprecise measurements across a broad field range. Despite their\npotential, these techniques reportedly lose sensitivity at higher magnetic\nfields, which is attributed to the alignment-to-orientation conversion (AOC)\nprocess. In our study, we utilize light with continuously rotating linear\npolarization to avoid AOC, producing robust optical signals and achieving high\nmagnetometric sensitivity over a dynamic range nearly three times greater than\nEarth's magnetic field. We demonstrate that employing rotating polarization\nsurpasses other NMOR techniques that use modulated light. Our findings also\nindicate that the previously observed signal deterioration is not due to AOC,\nsuggesting an alternative cause for this decline.\n",
