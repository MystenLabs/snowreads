However, the coupling\neffects can be unearthed by observing the system's dynamic behaviour upon\nenergy injection. One of the manifestations of this approach is the normal mode\nsplitting generated using parametric excitation. In this contribution, a\nrigorous and generic mathematical formulation for the parametric normal mode\nsplitting in any two-mode dynamical system is presented. It allows for\nestimating the coupling strength both in the weak and in the strong coupling\nregime, and irrespective of the degree of hybridization between the modes. The\nmethod is applied on the vibrations of a nanomechanical two-mode system\nimplemented in a tunable nanostring resonator. We find good agreement between\nthe experiment and the theoretical model, and are able to quantify the modal\ncoupling of the nanostring as a function of the applied bias voltage.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3921ukdm8B_hBLBHiZf1-9V755ng1Ke5L1SPCjS-8CQ","pdfSize":"5435510"}
