In\nequivariant stable homotopy theory, our techniques yield a splitting of\nhomology theories for the map from bordism to the equivariant bordism theory of\na finite group $\\Gamma$, given by assigning to a manifold its product with\n$\\Gamma$. In symplectic topology, and using recent work of\nAbouzaid-McLean-Smith and Hirshi-Swaminathan, we conclude that one can define\ncomplex cobordism-valued Gromov-Witten invariant for arbirary (closed)\nsymplectic manifolds. We apply our results to constrain the topology of the\nspace of Hamiltonian fibrations over $S^2$. The methods we develop apply to\nnormally complex orbifolds, and will hence lead to applications in symplectic\ntopology that rely on moduli spaces of holomorphic curves with Lagrangian\nboundary conditions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_9Qan4JHc-EdO9POiZt-aYOBCrYSDOC_i0Qs_tSBEPA","pdfSize":"1027166"}
