This model belongs to the larger class of Homogeneous Yang-Baxter\ndeformations, which preserve classical integrability in the sense that one can\nconstruct an explicit Lax connection. To study the scattering of bosonic\nworldsheet excitations, we fix light-cone gauge and expand around a pointlike\nclassical solution that reduces to the BMN vacuum in the undeformed limit. Our\nanalysis shows that the light-cone gauge-fixed Hamiltonian, under a\nperturbative field expansion, includes cubic terms that give rise to\nnon-trivial cubic processes for physical particles. We discuss this unexpected\nresult in relation to the property of Lax integrability of the sigma-model.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mZuvLbQPtfnOgfZYJr7xzGedoYQpAQXq1rnVHBGnMS4","pdfSize":"337507"}
