  "abstract": "  Multiple topologically distinct quantum Hall phases can occur at the same\nLandau level filling factor. It is a major challenge to distinguish between\nthese phases as they only differ by the neutral modes, which do not affect the\ncharge conductance in conventional geometries. We show that the neutral sector\ncan be determined with coherent charge conductance in a $\\pi$-shaped geometry\nthat interfaces three different filling factors. Specifically, non-Abelian\npaired states at a half-filled Landau level and the anti-Read-Rezayi state can\nbe identified. Interestingly, for interfaces between paired states and Jain\nstates, the electric current in the $\\pi$ geometry behaves as if pairs of\nneutral Majoranas edge modes were charge modes of Jain states.\n",
