  "abstract": "  We present a hybrid feedback control framework for autonomous robot\nnavigation in n-dimensional Euclidean spaces cluttered with spherical\nobstacles. The proposed approach ensures safe navigation and global asymptotic\nstability (GAS) of the target location by dynamically switching between two\noperational modes: motion-to-destination and locally optimal\nobstacle-avoidance. It produces continuous velocity inputs, ensures\ncollision-free trajectories and generates locally optimal obstacle avoidance\nmaneuvers. Unlike existing methods, the proposed framework is compatible with\nrange sensors, enabling navigation in both a priori known and unknown\nenvironments. Extensive simulations in 2D and 3D settings, complemented by\nexperimental validation on a TurtleBot 4 platform, confirm the efficacy and\nrobustness of the approach. Our results demonstrate shorter paths and smoother\ntrajectories compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency and real-world feasibility.\n",
