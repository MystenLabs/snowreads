Previous transport studies in GaN 2DHGs\nhave reported a two-fold reduction in 2DHG carrier density from room to\ncryogenic temperature. We demonstrate that this apparent drop in carrier\ndensity is an artifact of assuming one species of carriers when interpreting\nHall effect measurements. Using an appropriate two-carrier model, we resolve\nlight hole (LH) and heavy hole (HH) carrier densities congruent with\nself-consistent Poisson-k$\\cdot$p simulations and observe an LH mobility of\n$\\sim$1400 cm$^2$/Vs and HH mobility of $\\sim$300 cm$^2$/Vs at 2 K. This report\nconstitutes the first experimental signature of LH band conductivity reported\nin GaN.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bVn7lkf1S54K--ZE-XLM1W6tyxMswSJeTY3hNxQk2ws","pdfSize":"4165957"}
