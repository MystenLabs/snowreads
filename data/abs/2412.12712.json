  "abstract": "  Motivated by a vaccination coverage problem, we consider here a zero-sum\ndifferential game governed by a differential system consisting of a hyperbolic\npartial differential equation (PDE) and an ordinary differential equation\n(ODE). Two players act through their respective controls to influence the\nevolution of the system with the aim of minimizing their objective functionals\n$\\mathcal F_1$ and $\\mathcal F_2$, under the assumption that $\\mathcal F_1\n+\\mathcal F_2 = 0$. First we prove a well posedness and a stability result for\nthe differential system, once the control functions are fixed. Then we\nintroduce the concept of non-anticipating strategies for both players and we\nconsider the associated value functions, which solve two infinite-dimensional\nHamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equations in the viscosity sense.\n",
