The most common one, with which we interact almost\nevery day, is selling for a fixed price. This option is perfect for selling a\nmass product, when we have a number of sellers and many buyers, and the price\nfor the product varies depending on the conditions of the relationship between\nsupply and demand. Another situation meets us already in markets, where a\nproduct can be either mass-produced or more unique, so this option is already\ncloser to the object of our discussion.However, a one-on-one transaction is a\nmuch more unstable option, which is why it is also more difficult to model,\nsince it is determined not so much by algorithms as by psychology and the\ndifference in the bargaining ability of the two parties. An even closer example\nof an auction is price discrimination, when the price for the buyer is\ndetermined not only by supply and demand, but also by which group the buyer\nbelongs to. But in this case, the product is not unique, and the final seller\nis the only one. Thus, we have identified the main auction criteria and their\nfeatures of the \"game\".\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/General Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"za91M1oBLZqbNasLhDIEw9UYSnFcWb-qgX25mzjGFgM","pdfSize":"279515"}
