Employing\nfirst principles calculations, and symmetry mode analysis we investigated\nstructural and electronic origin of G-type OO in TlMnO$_3$. We reveal that\nJahn-Teller (JT) distortion in TlMnO$_3$ is structurally triggered,\nconsequently giving rise to G type OO. Similar mechanism is rather common in\nRNi$^{3+}$O$_3$ perovskites, where breathing of NiO$_6$ is observed. We further\nreveal that, triggering of breathing distortion is not limited to nickelates\nbut also present in TlMnO$_3$ (and LaMnO$_3$). In fact, other types of JT\ndistortion, are also show triggering mechanism, although final ground state of\nthese systems result from subtle anharmonic interactions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GincDWJoxmPVc_7c_aQsZYdriS2SLhRUhEM1LCH70Vk","pdfSize":"1437672"}
