The\ntheory incorporates the scattering geometry and polarization dependence of the\nRaman process and the small but finite wave vectors of the phonons for\ncorrectly describing the scattering with longitudinal optical (LO) modes in\noptically anisotropic solids. We implement the theory for first-order Raman\nscattering and showcase the approach for wurtzite Gallium Nitride and the\ncomplex chalcogenide perovskite BaZrS3 in comparison to experiment. We\nsubsequently discuss several common estimates for second-order Raman scattering\nin complex materials, and highlight similarities and differences to established\ntheoretical approaches and simulation protocols both from phonon theory and\nmolecular dynamics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"billfQsKN0El3BuPPbNEamIJNVrmo6hv0NZ4f6lj_yQ","pdfSize":"1311698"}
