  "abstract": "  We show how to take the first step in the conformal program for constructing\ngeneral matter couplings to Carroll gravity. In particular, we couple a single\nmassless electric/magnetic scalar to conformal Carroll gravity with isotropic\ndilatations and show how, upon gauge-fixing, we obtain a (non-conformal version\nof) electric/magnetic Carroll gravity. We determine the full Carroll\ntransformation rules paying special attention to the way the so-called\nintrinsic torsion tensors occur in these transformation rules. A noteworthy\nfeature in the magnetic case is that the Lagrange multiplier present in the\nLagrangian gets absorbed, after coupling to conformal Carroll gravity and\ngauge-fixing, into one of the independent spin-connections of magnetic Carroll\ngravity. Our results form a convenient starting point for constructing general\nmatter couplings to Carroll gravity. Surprisingly, we find that the same\nrelation between dynamical matter and gravity, which forms the basis of the\nconformal program, does not work in the usual way in the Galilei case.\n",
