Jets heating the\nsurroundings of host galaxies can also prevent gas cooling and inflows.\nSpectacular examples for these three mass displacement channels have been\nobserved, but their importance in transforming the galaxy population depends on\nthe occurrence rates of outflow triggers. We aim to investigate the absolute\nand relative importance of these three channels. In an observation-driven\napproach, we combine distribution functions and scaling relations to\nempirically compare average outflow rates across the galaxy total stellar mass\nspectrum and across cosmic time. This hinges on local outflow studies which\nshould be extended to systematic, large and diverse samples, and we do not yet\nconsider a halo heating effect by radiation-driven outflows. Our results show,\nindependent of simulations, the dominance of star formation-driven outflows in\nlow-mass galaxies. Massive galaxies today are predominately prevented from\ngrowing further by jet heating, while at $z=1-3$ all three processes are\napproximately similarly important. Over the full mass spectrum and cosmic\nhistory, outflows driven by the radiation from active galactic nuclei is never\nthe dominant process.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"ISfnae8f0cQ-2aUvus7E7OEurFZIap45RbUcKLTvlNM","pdfSize":"734376"}
