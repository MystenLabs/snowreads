Working in linearized quantum gravity, we derive\nthe variance in the area of a four-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole from\nthe renormalized graviton propagator. We find that the standard deviation of\nthe horizon area scales as the product of the Schwarzschild radius and the\nPlanck length. For macroscopic black holes, the quantum uncertainty is\ntherefore enormous in Planck units.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Zm9M8DRfhH8ElfCwQ8NZce186hbGlLkvs_uS-eEYuIg","pdfSize":"1516671"}
