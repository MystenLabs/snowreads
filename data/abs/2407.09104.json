In this work, we explore generating synthetic\ngestures from a few real user gestures with generative deep learning, with the\napplication of training a simple (i.e. non-deep-learned) authentication model.\nSpecifically, we show that utilising synthetic data alongside real data can\nreduce the number of real datapoints a user must provide to enrol into a\nbiometric system. To validate our methods, we use the publicly available\ndataset of WatchAuth, a system proposed in 2022 for authenticating smartwatch\npayments using the physical gesture of reaching towards a payment terminal. We\ndevelop a regularised autoencoder model for generating synthetic user-specific\nwrist motion data representing these physical gestures, and demonstrate the\ndiversity and fidelity of our synthetic gestures. We show that using synthetic\ngestures in training can improve classification ability for a real-world\nsystem. Through this technique we can reduce the number of gestures required to\nenrol a user into a WatchAuth-like system by more than 40% without negatively\nimpacting its error rates.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YjLWfBNlqOCyBwy7IbTvgW8szmkhMaffOwbF0eILM_8","pdfSize":"24414744"}
