We impose regularity assumptions on the drift and\ndiffusion coefficients only locally on the state-space. In particular, the\ndrift and diffusion coefficients may be non-globally Lipschitz continuous and\nsuperlinearly growing. The scheme consists of a finite difference\ndiscretisation in space and a Lie--Trotter splitting followed by exact\nsimulation and exact integration in time. We prove weak convergence of optimal\norder 1/4 for globally Lipschitz continuous test functions of the scheme by\nproving strong convergence towards a strong solution driven by a different\nnoise process. Boundary-preservation is ensured by the use of Lie--Trotter time\nsplitting followed by exact simulation and exact integration. Numerical\nexperiments confirm the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the proposed Lie--Trotter-Exact (LTE) scheme compared to existing methods\nfor SPDEs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iBkLvAKAnKfPkLO1NRPPIc7hiBZvjZfj8jJn6_yEZxU","pdfSize":"488287"}
