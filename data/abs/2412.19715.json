  "abstract": "  This study investigates the dynamics of quantum batteries (QBs), focusing on\nthe pivotal role of quantum entanglement in mediating inter-cellular energy\ntransfer within a two-cell configuration (two-qubit), wherein one cell is\ndirectly coupled to the charging source. Employing the Lindblad master equation\nto model the system's evolution, the influence of coherent state amplitudes,\ndetuning, inter-cellular coupling strength, and dissipation rates on stored\nenergy, energy fluctuations, concurrence-quantified entanglement, and their\nparametric interrelations is scrutinized. Our results indicate a direct\ncorrelation between the degree of entanglement and energy transfer efficiency\nbetween the qubits. Specifically, the stronger the entanglement between primary\ncell, which is connected to the charger, and secondary cell, the more\neffectively energy is transferred. This demonstrates that enhanced entanglement\nsignificantly facilitates energy transfer between the two qubits.\n",
