The problem is formulated as the study of the\nconnected components of a semi-algebraic set. Under first order approximation,\nwe give the general expression of the transfer matrix of a reflexive optical\nsystem. Thanks to this representation, we express the semi-algebraic set for\nfocal telescopes and afocal telescopes as the set of non-degenerate real\nsolutions of first order optical conditions. Then, in order to study the\ntopology of these sets, we address the problem of counting and describe their\nconnected components. In a same time, we introduce a topological invariant\nwhich encodes the topological features of the solutions. For systems composed\nof three mirrors, we give the semi-algebraic description of the connected\ncomponents of the set and show that the topological invariant is exact.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"5pwILAtLDRNfPQ0spPdoMS7vdlFqsFYWiZLQVp97LNU","pdfSize":"1180116"}
