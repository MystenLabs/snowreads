Few-shot learning\napproaches are cost-effective solutions to transfer pre-trained models using\nonly limited annotated data. However, such methods can be prone to overfitting\ndue to limited data diversity especially when segmenting complex, diverse, and\nsparse tubular structures like airways. Furthermore, crafting informative image\nrepresentations has played a crucial role in medical imaging, enabling\ndiscriminative enhancement of anatomical details. In this paper, we initially\ntrain a data-driven sparsification module to enhance airways efficiently in\nlung CT scans. We then incorporate these sparse representations in a standard\nsupervised segmentation pipeline as a pretraining step to enhance the\nperformance of the DL models. Results presented on the ATM public challenge\ncohort show the effectiveness of using sparse priors in pre-training, leading\nto segmentation Dice score increase by 1% to 10% in full-scale and few-shot\nlearning scenarios, respectively.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OrVaCLl4Mow_3ssSUw2slFFvQiVjjT94gpeD3KOQCrg","pdfSize":"7503724"}
