Recently, it was shown that via an infinite tower of\nhigher-curvature corrections, one can obtain different regular black hole\nsolutions in any spacetime dimension $D\\geq 5$. Utilizing the concept of\nthermodynamical topology, we examine these black holes as topological\nthermodynamic defects, classifying them into distinct topological categories\nbased on their generalized free energy. We find that the Hawking temperature of\nthe black hole has at least one zero point at the small horizon radius limit.\nUnder this fact, the regular black holes generated through the purely\ngravitational theories exhibit universal thermodynamical behaviors, strongly\nsuggesting they belong to the same topological class. We presents a\ncomprehensive analysis of these properties, providing a clearer understanding\nof the fundamental nature of regular black holes and their classification\nwithin the framework of thermodynamical topology.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ink6SvrfDLu5BOJMwFOgqNCygoPc5F4eWc58AIjs1GM","pdfSize":"1687916"}
