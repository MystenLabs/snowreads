  "abstract": "  A general solution for a coupled system of eikonal equations $u_\\mu u_\\mu\n=0$, $v_\\mu v_\\mu =0$, $u_\\mu v_\\mu =1$ is presented, where lower indices\ndesignate derivatives, $\\mu=0,1,2,3$, and summation is implied over the\nrepeated indices. This solution is of interest by itself due to wide\napplications of the eikonal equations, but the system considered also appears\nto be part of the reduction conditions for many equations of mathematical\nphysics.\n",
