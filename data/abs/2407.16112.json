Active tuning of nonlinear metasurfaces will considerably expand\ntheir prospects for integrated photonics. Here, we demonstrate a highly-tunable\nmetasurface device that combines electrical and optical switching in a\nbroadband frequency conversion process. Our device employs electrically tunable\nhybrid graphene-gold plasmons to convert mid-infrared pulses into visible light\nby optical gating. A strong electrical modulation of the generated visible\nlight is attained for a broad range of mid-infrared input frequencies, and this\nmodulation is up to 3.5x stronger for the metasurface than for plain graphene.\nAll-optical switching measurements indicate that the device can be optically\nswitched at Terahertz rates. Our results may lead to new applications of\nmetasurfaces such as ultrafast signal processing, nonlinear sensing, and\noptical transduction.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cuWT6bHSHXOteV3VOFqsiIHHpPFCb0JCkMCP6akBSX4","pdfSize":"4842870"}
