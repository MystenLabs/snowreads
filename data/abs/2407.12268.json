X-ray\ndiffraction and transmission electron microscopy show that the implementation\nof a GaAs buffer layer improves the crystal and interface quality compared to\nthe control sample grown directly on an InP substrate. Both samples exhibit the\nquantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE), but with similar thermal stability\ndespite the different structural properties. Notably, the QAHE in the sample\ngrown on a GaAs buffer layer displays a significantly larger (almost double)\ncoercive field with a much smaller resistivity peak at the magnetization\nreversal. Possible effects of the interface quality on the magnetic properties\nof VBST and the QAHE are discussed.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"aBrjNn9Cm9luZ7iJAjAxJG2n2BkliFqd07AtqUO4cuU","pdfSize":"1301561"}
