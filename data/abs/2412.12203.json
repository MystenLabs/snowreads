  "abstract": "  Here, a single field inflationary model driven by a mutated hilltop\npotential, as a subclass of the hilltop models of inflation, is investigated.\nIn order to constrain the parameter space of the model, the $r-n_{\\rm s}$\nconstraint of Planck and BICEP/Keck 2018 data as well as the reheating\nparameters such as the duration $N_{\\rm{re}}$, the temperature $T_{\\rm{re}}$,\nand the equation of state parameter $\\omega_{\\rm{re}}$, are employed. In\naddition, a model independent bound on the duration of the radiation dominated\n(RD) era $N_{\\rm{rd}}$ is applied to improve the parameter space. Furthermore,\nthe density spectra of relic gravitational waves (GWs) in light of the\nsensitivity domains of GW detectors, for specific inflationary durations $N$,\nare analyzed. Finally, by combining constraints from the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB), reheating, RD era, and relic GWs, the permissible\ninflationary duration is constrained to $46\\leq N \\leq 56$ (95\\% CL) and\n$48.1\\leq N\\leq 56$ (68\\% CL). Moreover, the model parameter $\\alpha$ is\nconfined to $0.161\\leq\\alpha \\leq 0.890$ (95\\% CL) and $0.217\\leq\\alpha \\leq\n0.815$ (68\\% CL).\n",
