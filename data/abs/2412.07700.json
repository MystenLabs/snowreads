  "abstract": "  The Hilda group is a set of asteroids whose mean motion is in a 3:2 orbital\nresonance with Jupiter. In this paper we use the planar Circular Restricted\nThree-Body Problem (CRTBP) as a dynamical model and we show that there exists a\nfamily of stable periodic orbits that are surrounded by islands of\nquasi-periodic motions. We have computed the frequencies of these\nquasi-periodic motions and we have shown how the Hilda family fits inside these\nislands. We have compared these results with the ones obtained using the\nElliptic Restricted Three-Body Problem and they are similar, showing the\nsuitability of the CRTBP model. It turns out that, to decide if a given\nasteroid belongs to the Hilda class, it is much better to look at its\nfrequencies in the planar CRTBP rather than to use two-body orbital elements as\nit is commonly done today.\n",
