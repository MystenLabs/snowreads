So far, the fixation of a\nparticular gauge has only gained physical meaning when correlated with\nadditional information such as the results of measurements carried on over the\nsystem or the environment in so-called quantum trajectories. Here, we show that\ngauge transformations can be exploited, on their own, to optimize practical\nphysical tasks. To do so, first, we describe the inherent structure of the\nunderlying symmetries in quantum Markovian dynamics and present a general\nformulation showing how they can be used to change the measurable values of\nphysical quantities. We then analyze examples of optimization in quantum\nthermodynamics and, finally, we discuss the practical implementation of the\noptimized protocols in terms of quantum trajectories.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"pBFfAYypOHe-4Ei2I6Yab1TMn85aa_S5-6fm4jHRvGw","pdfSize":"427399","objectId":"0xd3213a26b742406041e9b054c8665c5352fef391e1d8fb59555ee161eaa9fa46","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
