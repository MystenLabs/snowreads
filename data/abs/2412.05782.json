  "abstract": "  The transverse single-spin asymmetry for $\\rho^0$ production in\nsemi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering was recently reported by the COMPASS\nCollaboration. Using the Sivers functions extracted from pion and kaon\nproductions, we perform a calculation of the Sivers asymmetry within the\ntransverse momentum dependent factorization. Our results are consistent with\nthe COMPASS data, confirming the universality of the Sivers functions within\ncurrent experimental uncertainties. While various global analyses of Sivers\nfunctions can equally well describe the current data, we obtain very different\npredictions on the Sivers asymmetry of $\\rho$ and $K^*$ productions at\nelectron-ion colliders, which therefore are expected to provide further\nconstraints.\n",
