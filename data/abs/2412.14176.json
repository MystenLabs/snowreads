Within this literature, critical theorizations of big data\nvisualizations are rare, as digital positivist perspectives dominate. This\npaper offers a critical, design-informed perspective on big data visualization\nin wearable health tracking ecosystems like FitBit. I argue that such\nvisualizations are tools of individualized, neoliberal governance that operate\nlargely through experiences of seduction and addiction to facilitate\nparticipation in the corporate capture and monetization of personal\ninformation. Exploration of my personal experience of the FitBit ecosystem\nilluminates this argument and emphasizes the capacity for harm to individuals\nusing these ecosystems, leading to an exploration of the complex professional\nchallenges for user experience designers working on visualizations within the\necosystems of wearables.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction","Computer Science/Computers and Society","Computer Science/Multimedia"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"CUBfV-GojuMHSoGf9OhE6zMSOYGiItMxPyYdkeWAT54","pdfSize":"194156"}
