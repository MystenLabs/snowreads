Assimilation by nudging (from\n1964), while non-optimal, is easy to implement and its analysis is clear and\nwell-established. Nudging's uniform in time accuracy has even been established\nunder conditions on the nudging parameter $\\chi$ and the density of\nobservational locations, $H$, Larios, Rebholz, and Zerfas [1]. One remaining\nissue is that nudging requires the user to select a key parameter. The\nconditions required for this parameter, derived through \\'a priori (worst case)\nanalysis are severe (Section 2.1 herein) and far beyond those found to be\neffective in computational experience. One resolution, developed herein, is\nself-adaptive parameter selection. This report develops, analyzes, tests, and\ncompares two methods of self-adaptation of nudging parameters. One combines\nanalysis and response to local flow behavior. The other is based only on\nresponse to flow behavior. The comparison finds both are easily implemented and\nyield effective values of the nudging parameter much smaller than those of \\'a\npriori analysis.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"p8udCqtY9YfQK0HVcTchNWWjF7OVD0oQ5a3JYZkRMlE","pdfSize":"536931"}
