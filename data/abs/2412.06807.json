To mitigate these issues, Advanced Air Mobility (AAM)\nhas emerged as a promising transportation alternative. However, the effective\nimplementation of AAM requires robust demand modeling. This study delves into\nthe demand dynamics of AAM by analyzing employment based trip data across\nTennessee's census tracts, employing statistical techniques and machine\nlearning models to enhance accuracy in demand forecasting. Drawing on datasets\nfrom the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), the Internal Revenue\nService (IRS), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and additional\nsources, we perform cost, time, and risk assessments to compute the Generalized\nCost of Trip (GCT). Our findings indicate that trips are more likely to be\nviable for AAM if air transportation accounts for over 70\\% of the GCT and the\njourney spans more than 250 miles. The study not only refines the understanding\nof AAM demand but also guides strategic planning and policy formulation for\nsustainable urban mobility solutions.
