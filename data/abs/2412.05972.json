  "abstract": "  Sustained mutual coherence between two combs over extended periods is a\nprerequisite for dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS), particularly in achieving\nhigh-resolution molecular spectroscopy and precise spectral measurements.\nHowever, achieving long coherence times remains a challenge for Yb-doped\nfrequency combs. This work introduces an experimental approach for phase-stable\nDCS using Yb-doped frequency combs at 1.03 ${\\mu}$m with a novel feed-forward\nmethod, combatting the limitations of mutual coherence. Without relying on\ncomputer-based phase correction, we achieve a coherence time of 1000 seconds -\nthree orders of magnitude longer than the current state of the art for DCS.\nThis extended coherence enables time-domain averaging, resulting in a\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 2045. We demonstrate high-resolution monitoring\nof weak overtone transitions in the P and R branches of C${_2}$H${_2}$, with\ngood agreement with HITRAN. The phase-locked multiheterodyne system also\nenables phase spectrum measurements with a scatter down to 7 mrad. Furthermore,\nwe successfully extend our technique to the visible wavelength range using\nsecond harmonic generation, achieving high-resolution spectra of NO${_2}$ with\nexcellent SNR. The method offers high-frequency accuracy and demonstrates the\npotential of Yb-doped systems for multiplexed metrology, effectively extending\nthe capabilities of DCS as a powerful tool for multi-disciplinary applications.\n",
