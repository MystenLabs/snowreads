This does not assume that the conditional\ndensity itself is linear with the resonant feature, allowing RAD-OT to\nefficiently capture multimodal relationships, changes in resolution, etc. By\nsolving the optimal transport problem, RAD-OT can quickly build a template by\ninterpolating between the background distributions in two sideband regions. We\ndemonstrate the performance of RAD-OT using the LHC Olympics R\\&D dataset,\nwhere we find comparable sensitivity and improved stability with respect to\ndeep learning-based approaches.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DDtbW9iGj_ZOSqbzVpTNMgHNND-BJyoFaFzrgmmINN0","pdfSize":"4497458","objectId":"0x24954a795253e54f5d4d2fa17b9acbdfafd5f7c1dd9fffe34a86b1752c5f197a","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
