However, such approaches cannot automatically\nintegrate multiple complicated procedures to construct an intelligent agent,\nsince each functionality is enabled by a separate model learned from\nindependent climate datasets. The emergence of foundation models, especially\nmultimodal foundation models, with their ability to process heterogeneous input\ndata and execute complex tasks, offers a substantial opportunity to overcome\nthis challenge. In this report, we want to explore a central question - how the\nstate-of-the-art foundation model, i.e., GPT-4o, performs various atmospheric\nscientific tasks. Toward this end, we conduct a case study by categorizing the\ntasks into four main classes, including climate data processing, physical\ndiagnosis, forecast and prediction, and adaptation and mitigation. For each\ntask, we comprehensively evaluate the GPT-4o's performance along with a\nconcrete discussion. We hope that this report may shed new light on future AI\napplications and research in atmospheric science.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"L3kuJpwX0IIVNEQKVAEmLH2uKkePM3K5HScjVGyIVI8","pdfSize":"14776730"}
