By constructing a three-dimensional (3D) porous material model and\nemploying homogenization technique, effective properties of the hydrogel pore\nstructure were calculated. It is found that the microstructure of hyperelastic\nmaterials has considerable influence on their macroscopic mechanical\nproperties, pores with a radius of up to 65 microns at a small strain can\nsignificantly reinforce material structure and improve its fatigue resistance.\nThis work highlights the potential of engineering pore structures for the\nenhancement of mchanical properties and durability of hydrogels.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IZHNdcRCgC_xEPwEQPFnmSpSlarK6JEH5zLIZT8Ld8s","pdfSize":"695244"}
