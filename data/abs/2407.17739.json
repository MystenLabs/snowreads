In previous\nstudies, the strength of magnetic fields in these shells was estimated to be\n$B_{\\rm SED}$ $\\simeq$ 25$\\mu$G from the spectral energy distribution, where\nthe synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons accounted for radio to\nX-rays, along with the inverse Compton emission extending from the GeV to TeV\nenergy bands. However, the analysis of broadband radio data, ranging from\n1.37~GHz to 100~GHz, indicated that the radio spectrum steepened from $\\alpha_1\n= 0.52 \\pm 0.02$ to $\\alpha_2 = 1.34 \\pm 0.21$ by $\\Delta \\alpha$ = 0.85 $\\pm$\n0.21. This is naturally interpreted as a cooling break under strong magnetic\nfield of $B_{\\rm brk}$ $\\ge$ 2~mG. Moreover, the high-resolution MeerKAT image\nindicated that the width of the radio NE/SW shells was broader than that of the\nX-ray shell by a factor of only 3$-$20, as measured by Chandra. Such narrow\nradio shells can be naturally explained if the magnetic field responsible for\nthe radio emissions is $B_{\\rm R}$ $\\ge$ 2 mG. Assuming that the magnetic field\nis locally enhanced by a factor of approximately $a$ = 100 along the NE/SW\nshells, we argue that the filling factor, which is the volume ratio of such a\nmagnetically enhanced region to that of the entire shell, must be as low as\napproximately $k$ = 2.5$\\times$10$^{-5}$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"_jc9CMbITt5V1uh8_YKRZDKrL5a22cWTf0ZdMQnjTmc","pdfSize":"1583415"}
