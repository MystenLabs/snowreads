Here, we study dilepton production\nusing a partonic transport model that is based on an extended\nNambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. In this model, the in-medium quark masses\ndecrease with increasing temperature as a result of the restoration of chiral\nsymmetry. We find that the extracted temperature from dileptons of intermediate\nmasses agrees well with the temperature of the partonic matter, suggesting that\ndilepton production can be used as a thermometer for the produced partonic\nmatter. Our results also indicate that the extracted in-medium quark masses\ndecrease with increasing dilepton temperature, implying that dilepton\nproduction can further serve as a probe of chiral symmetry restoration in high\nenergy heavy-ion collisions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3pi15PE68HRzX0QfuJXDN_JfT9-e2-7kvTE1iq_aP2U","pdfSize":"1133216"}
