We theoretically and\nexperimentally study the Talbot effect for optical waves in the transverse\nangular domain using whispering-gallery modes of step-index multimode fibers,\nwhich carry a high orbital angular momentum and fulfill the required quadratic\ndispersion relation. By using the complex interference along the core-cladding\ninterface of these fibers, we experimentally demonstrate that the high-order\nfractional Talbot effect can be used to implement 9- and 30-port beamsplitters\nusing only off-the-shelf components in a compact arrangement. In addition, we\nshow that the beamsplitters can be efficiently interfaced with single-mode\nfibers, such that our work not only extends the recent developments on the\nangular Talbot effect to widely available step-index multimode fibers, but also\ndemonstrates a powerful application as a signal multiplexer, which becomes more\ncompact as the number of channels is increased.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HDJUW68pvAoKuK3MWUizJjcZj--u-u3dpoevDytM6Ek","pdfSize":"2338214"}
