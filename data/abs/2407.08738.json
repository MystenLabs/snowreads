This universal dimensionless EoS is\nconstructed by relating the turbulent cascade's scale-free spectrum amplitude\nto the energy flux of the steady state that emerges from the large-length-scale\ndriving of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Remarkably, this EoS defies the\ngeneric predictions of wave-turbulent kinetic theory, even though the cascade\nspectra are quantitatively well understood within that theory. Finally, we find\nthat the concept of quasi-static thermodynamic processes between equilibrium\nstates extends to far-from-equilibrium steady states.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WXGYYT5SZ4lXm8hUgvEfumoqdS--s2OcUCyBVqZNUpw","pdfSize":"2836394"}
