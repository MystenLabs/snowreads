  "abstract": "  The goal of this work is to investigate the capability of a neural operator\n(DeepONet) to accurately capture the complex deformation of a platelet's\nmembrane under shear flow. The surrogate model approximated by the neural\noperator predicts the deformed membrane configuration based on its initial\nconfiguration and the shear stress exerted by the blood flow. The training\ndataset is derived from particle dynamics simulations implemented in LAMMPS.\nThe neural operator captures the dynamics of the membrane particles with a mode\nerror distribution of approximately 0.5\\%. The proposed implementation serves\nas a scalable approach to integrate sub-platelet dynamics into multi-scale\ncomputational models of thrombosis.\n",
