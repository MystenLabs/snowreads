  "abstract": "  With global urbanization, the focus on sustainable cities has largely grown,\ndriving research into equity, resilience, and urban planning, which often\nrelies on mobility data. The rise of web-based apps and mobile devices has\nprovided valuable user data for mobility-related research. However, real-world\nmobility data is costly and raises privacy concerns. To protect privacy while\nretaining key features of real-world movement, the demand for synthetic data\nhas steadily increased. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown great\npotential for mobility trajectory generation due to their ability to model\nrandomness and uncertainty. However, existing approaches often directly apply\nidentically distributed (i.i.d.) noise sampling from image generation\ntechniques, which fail to account for the spatiotemporal correlations and\nsocial interactions that shape urban mobility patterns. In this paper, we\npropose CoDiffMob, a diffusion model for urban mobility generation with\ncollaborative noise priors, we emphasize the critical role of noise in\ndiffusion models for generating mobility data. By leveraging both individual\nmovement characteristics and population-wide dynamics, we construct novel\ncollaborative noise priors that provide richer and more informative guidance\nthroughout the generation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our method, with generated data accurately capturing both\nindividual preferences and collective patterns, achieving an improvement of\nover 32%. Furthermore, it can effectively replace web-derived mobility data to\nbetter support downstream applications, while safeguarding user privacy and\nfostering a more secure and ethical web. This highlights its tremendous\npotential for applications in sustainable city-related research. The code and\ndata are available at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/CoDiffMob.\n",
