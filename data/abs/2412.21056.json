However, ensuring data privacy while achieving these goals is\nchallenging, especially in the medical field, where sensitive data are often\ncommonplace. One possible solution is to use synthetic data that mimic\nreal-world datasets. This approach may help to streamline therapy evaluation\nand enable quicker access to innovative treatments. We propose using a method\nbased on sequential conditional regressions, such as in a fully conditional\nspecification (FCS) approach, along with flexible parametric survival models to\naccurately replicate covariate patterns and survival times. To make our\napproach available to a wide audience of users, we have developed user-friendly\nfunctions in R and Python to implement it. We also provide an example\napplication to registry data on patients affected by Creutzfeld-Jacob disease.\nThe results show the potentialities of the proposed method in mirroring\nobserved multivariate distributions and survival outcomes.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OZqwBfi7pr_NzpQteHMs0rSqQzNJUfDurDJSo8j4sfU","pdfSize":"3247695"}
