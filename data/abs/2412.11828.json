The\nessence of these tasks is to select and save a subset of the most useful\ncandidates (views/indexes/plans) for reuse within given space/time budget\nconstraints. In this paper, we propose a unified view on these selection\nproblems. We make a detailed analysis of the root causes of their complexity\nand summarize techniques to address them. Our survey provides a modern\nclassification of selection algorithms known in the literature, including the\nlatest ones based on Machine Learning. We provide a ground for reuse of the\nselection techniques between different optimization scenarios and highlight\nchallenges and promising directions in the field. Based on our analysis we\nderive a method to exponentially accelerate some of the state-of-the-art\nselection algorithms.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Databases","Computer Science/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"epdKBholoNQ4UJ421doibY3fqQZM0NvsrPTQSP7_R08","pdfSize":"1442329"}
