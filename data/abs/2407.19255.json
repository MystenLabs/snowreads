For\nthese types of cylinders, ratios $r_p(\\rho)$ of the $p$th coefficient of $F$\nhave been calculated for the infinitely long cylinder (${\\mathcal M}\n\\rightarrow \\infty$) and infinitely long strip (${\\mathcal N} \\rightarrow\n\\infty$) at varying aspect ratios. As in previous studies of the dimer model on\nthe rectangular lattice with free boundary conditions and for the Ising model\nwith Brascamp-Kunz boundary conditions, the limiting values $p \\to \\infty$\nexhibit abrupt anomalous behaviour of ratios $r_p(\\rho)$ at certain values of\n$\\rho$. These critical values of $\\rho$ and the limiting values of the\nfinite-size expansion coefficient ratios vary between the different models.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YZFmMphsCRbERECanEH75H68ONZGgrTCzzjt86IUk7Y","pdfSize":"565993","objectId":"0xcc89106b6810159ecfeb622889266e1d70315505bab50cc31cfc3d5726c13686","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
