The algorithm is asymptotically exact, flexible and easy to\nimplement. However, in the context of Bayesian inference for large datasets,\nevaluating the likelihood on the full data for thousands of iterations until\nconvergence can be prohibitively expensive. This paper introduces a new\nsubsample MH algorithm that satisfies detailed balance with respect to the\ntarget posterior and utilises control variates to enable exact, efficient\nBayesian inference on datasets with large numbers of observations. Through\ntheoretical results, simulation experiments and real-world applications on\ncertain generalised linear models, we demonstrate that our method requires\nsubstantially smaller subsamples and is computationally more efficient than the\nstandard MH algorithm and other exact subsample MH algorithms.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2Qrb0hBwV7OSbbTTq7wC2kxwMfC6fBzHxxnsAXU0u6s","pdfSize":"1017706"}
