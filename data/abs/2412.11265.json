  "abstract": "  There is an important difference between Hamiltonian-like vector fields in an\nalmost-symplectic manifold $(M,\\sigma)$, compared to the standard case of a\nsymplectic manifold: in the almost-symplectic case, a vector field such that\nthe contraction iX{\\sigma} is closed need not be a symmetry of $\\sigma$. We\nthus call partially-Hamiltonian those vector fields which have the former\nproperty and fully-Hamiltonian those which have both properties. We consider\n2n-dimensional almost symplectic manifolds with a fibration $\\pi : M\n\\longrightarrow B$ by Lagrangian tori. Trivially, all vertical\npartially-Hamiltonian vector fields are fully-Hamiltonian. We investigate the\nexistence and the properties of non-vertical fully-Hamiltonian vector fields.\nWe show that this class is non-empty, but under certain genericity conditions\nthat involve the Fourier spectrum of their Hamiltonian, these vector fields\nreduce, under a (possibly only semi-globally defined, if $n \\ge 4$) torus\naction, to families of standard symplectic-Hamiltonian vector fields.\n",
