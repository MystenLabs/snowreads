In such theories, dark matter\nsources an axion field extending over the entire galaxy, the gradient of which\ncan be searched for with precise spin precession experiments. A\nreinterpretation of existing co-magnetometer data already constrains theories\nthat are consistent with astrophysical bounds, and near-future experiments will\nbegin probing well-motivated models. The required interactions can arise from a\nconfining hidden sector without necessitating fine-tuning of the axion's mass.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0BvWmrrjLwjRjvAaE1qJWCFJTOeqwQfDM7EXPkdNooY","pdfSize":"1629759","objectId":"0x47470e2764f6f3ba2dab4d34f51c3c1a443fdc3c104eb326e6bb7d0b525d607d","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
