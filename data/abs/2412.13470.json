  "abstract": "  Ultracold gases of atoms from Main Group III (Group 13) of the Periodic\nTable, also known as \"triel elements,\" have great potential for a new\ngeneration of quantum matter experiments. The first magneto-optical trap of a\ntriel element (indium) was recently realized, but more progress is needed\nbefore a triel is ready for modern quantum science experiments. Cutting edge\nquantum science can be performed with atoms that are cooled to the 10 uK level\nor below, prepared in pure quantum states, and optically trapped. Here we\nreport the achievement of all three of these milestones in atomic indium.\nFirst, we perform polarization gradient cooling of an indium gas to 15 uK.\nSecond, we spin polarize the gas into a single hyperfine sublevel of either the\n$5P_{1/2}$ indium ground state or the $5P_{3/2}$ metastable state. Third, we\nconfine indium in a 1064 nm optical lattice, achieving a 3 s trap lifetime.\nWith these results, indium is now a candidate for a next generation quantum\nresearch platform.\n",
