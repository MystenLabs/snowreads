To minimize PMT-induced backgrounds, stringent requirements on PMT\nradioactivity are crucial. A novel 2-inch low-background R12699 PMT has been\ndeveloped through a collaboration between the PandaX team and Hamamatsu\nPhotonics K.K. corporation. Radioactivity measurements conducted with a\nhigh-purity germanium detector show levels of approximately 0.08 mBq/PMT for\n$\\rm^{60}Co$ and 0.06~mBq/PMT for the $\\rm^{238}U$ late chain, achieving a\n15-fold reduction compared to R11410 PMT used in PandaX-4T. The radon emanation\nrate is below 3.2 $\\rm \\mu$Bq/PMT (@90\\% confidence level), while the surface\n$\\rm^{210}Po$ activity is less than 18.4 $\\mu$Bq/cm$^2$. The electrical\nperformance of these PMTs at cryogenic temperature was evaluated. With an\noptimized readout base, the gain was enhanced by 30\\%, achieving an average\ngain of $4.23 \\times 10^6$ at -1000~V and -100~$^{\\circ}$C. The dark count rate\naveraged 2.5~Hz per channel. Compactness, low radioactivity, and robust\nelectrical performance in the cryogenic temperature make the R12699 PMT ideal\nfor next-generation liquid xenon detectors and other rare event searches.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ll37DLNeeMHv0eKWGQUkAd-u5Y4U0GPRQRtBrKCJ0NI","pdfSize":"5023148"}
