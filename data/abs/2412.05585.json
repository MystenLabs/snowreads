The utilization of ultrasound scans in the BUSI dataset for\nmedical imagery pertaining to breast cancer has exhibited commendable\nsegmentation outcomes through the application of UNet and UNet++ networks.\nNevertheless, a notable drawback of these models resides in their inattention\ntowards the temporal aspects embedded within the images. This research\nendeavors to enrich the UNet++ architecture by integrating LSTM layers and\nself-attention mechanisms to exploit temporal characteristics for segmentation\npurposes. Furthermore, the incorporation of a Multiscale Feature Extraction\nModule aims to grasp varied scale features within the UNet++. Through the\namalgamation of our proposed methodology with data augmentation on the BUSI\nwith GT dataset, an accuracy rate of 98.88%, specificity of 99.53%, precision\nof 95.34%, sensitivity of 91.20%, F1-score of 93.74, and Dice coefficient of\n92.74% are achieved. These findings demonstrate competitiveness with\ncutting-edge techniques outlined in existing literature.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Ukxda36QU1Nj6PnTKQ_5K1t2xOY-tik1AFAKEmdkJuI","pdfSize":"1206830"}
