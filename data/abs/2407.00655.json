The model allows for dynamic coefficients\nand multi-dimensional covariates that vary across equations. We assume the\ncoefficients are driven by a common hidden Markov process that addresses\nstructural breaks to enhance the model flexibility and preserve parsimony. We\nintroduce a new Soft PARAFAC hierarchical prior to achieve dimensionality\nreduction while preserving the structural information of the covariate tensor.\nThe proposed prior includes a new multi-way shrinking effect to address\nover-parametrization issues. We developed theoretical results to help\nhyperparameter choice. An efficient MCMC algorithm based on random scan Gibbs\nand back-fitting strategy is developed to achieve better computational\nscalability of the posterior sampling. The validity of the MCMC algorithm is\ndemonstrated theoretically, and its computational efficiency is studied using\nnumerical experiments in different parameter settings. The effectiveness of the\nmodel framework is illustrated using two original real data analyses. The\nproposed model exhibits superior performance when compared to the current\nbenchmark, Lasso regression.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NuKFBGn_sVIBg8fWaZk0Wi-hSyA23cfct8y6OV4DHl0","pdfSize":"12257083"}
