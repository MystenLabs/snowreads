We find an infrared (IR) excess in all systems when compared to a single\nblackbody, both when the disk should be extended and when it should be\ntruncated by the accretor's magnetic field. This suggests a dominant\ncontribution from the donor to the IR flux. When fitting two blackbodies, the\ntemperature of the hot component decreases with $P_{orb}$, as expected by\nevolutionary models. Temperatures for systems with $35<P_{orb}<45~\\text{min}$\nare consistent with models. Systems with $P_{orb}\\gtrsim45~\\text{min}$ have\nhigher temperatures than expected. The second blackbody temperature does not\ncorrelate with $P_{orb}$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bhCxiFaaMUWdUeN1bzk5O8cbB3y-Z3M5aQVT5c03ER8","pdfSize":"951991"}
