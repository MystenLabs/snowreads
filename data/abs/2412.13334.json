This black hole also features phantom global monopoles, which\nmodify the structure of the black hole space-time. We begin by deriving the\neffective potential governing the motion of test particles in this system and\ncarefully analyze the impact of quantum correction in the presence of both\nphantom and ordinary global monopoles. Furthermore, we extend our study to\ninclude the spin-dependent Regge-Wheeler (RW) potential, which characterizes\nthe dynamics of perturbations in this quantum-corrected black hole background.\nBy examining this RW potential for various spin fields, we show how quantum\ncorrections affect its form in the presence of both phantom and ordinary global\nmonopoles. Our analysis demonstrate that quantum correction significantly alter\nthe nature of the RW-potential, influencing the stability, and behavior of test\nparticles and perturbations around the black hole.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LPwqY73cqCoi8yyl7V36PxbfTbbMqsdkfqZbtvS9stg","pdfSize":"2460701"}
