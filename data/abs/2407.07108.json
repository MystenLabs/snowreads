Usually, I-V\ncurves are described employing three cardinal points: the short-circuit point\n$\\left(0,I_\\mathrm{sc}\\right)$, the open-circuit point\n$\\left(V_\\mathrm{oc},0\\right)$, and the maximum power point\n$\\left(V_\\mathrm{mp},I_\\mathrm{mp} \\right)$. In this context, to study the I-V\ncurves, the single-diode model (SDM) is often used. In this manuscript, we\npresent a practical approach for determining the parameters domain of the SDM\ngiven a set of cardinal points. An in-depth mathematical analysis showed that\nthe SDM must satisfy the following inequalities $V_\\mathrm{oc}/2\n<V_\\mathrm{mp}<V_\\mathrm{oc}$ and $I_\\mathrm{sc}/2\n<I_\\mathrm{mp}<I_\\mathrm{sc}$. Then, it is possible to implicitly represent the\nSDM by a single parameter and, consequently, to determine its domain. For this\npurpose, a fast open-source computational algorithm for the single parameter\ndomain of the SDM is presented. The algorithm has been computer-tested using\n$40\\,000$ synthetically generated maximum power points which are processed in\nabout one minute of the CPU time on a standard laptop computer. Moreover, as\npractical applications, the databases from the California Energy Commission and\nthe NREL are analyzed using the presented algorithm.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"EdfabxI8821xCn_JBBHkTUFby2om9F_HSlRc80oMFZg","pdfSize":"3587653"}
