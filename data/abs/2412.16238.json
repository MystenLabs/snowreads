  "abstract": "  Majority voting (MV) is the prototypical ``wisdom of the crowd'' algorithm.\nTheorems considering when MV is optimal for group decisions date back to\nCondorcet's 1785 jury decision theorem. The same assumption of error\nindependence used by Condorcet is used here to prove a jury evaluation theorem\nthat does purely algebraic evaluation (AE). Three or more binary jurors are\nenough to obtain the only two possible statistics of their correctness on a\njoint test they took. AE is shown to be superior to MV since it allows one to\nchoose the minority vote depending on how the jurors agree or disagree. In\naddition, AE is self-alarming about the failure of the error-independence\nassumption. Experiments labeling demographic datasets from the American\nCommunity Survey are carried out to compare MV and AE on nearly\nerror-independent ensembles. In general, using algebraic evaluation leads to\nbetter classifier evaluations and group labeling decisions.\n",
