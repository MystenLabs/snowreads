Due\nto their simple geometric characterization, character sheaves on Lie algebras\ncan be thought of as a simplified model for Lusztig's theory of character\nsheaves on algebraic groups. We extend the theory to the case of modular\ncoefficients. Along the way, we will reprove some of Mirkovi\\'c's results and\nprovide connections with the modular generalized Springer correspondence of\nAchar, Juteau, Riche, and Williamson.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yX-fOf7FVZlhUgPlEHHrMm19kl0lxOSyQjBRWhI51HY","pdfSize":"499749"}
