Symmetries, such as point-group symmetries in molecules, are\napparent in the standard second quantized form of the Hamiltonian. They are,\nhowever, masked when the Hamiltonian is translated into a Pauli matrix\nrepresentation required for its operation on qubits. To reveal these symmetries\nwe prove a general theorem that provides a straightforward method to calculate\nthe transformation of Pauli tensor strings under symmetry operations. They are\na subgroup of the Clifford group transformations and induce a corresponding\ngroup representation inside the symplectic matrices. We finally give a\nsimplified derivation of an affine qubit encoding scheme which allows for the\nremoval of qubits due to Boolean symmetries and thus reduces computational\neffort in quantum computing applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WeJkIjbSExrvalf-QCCZISf8cfIN60dOYnq79Db-Lb0","pdfSize":"638257"}
