To address these issues, we propose ContextualStory, a novel\nframework designed to generate coherent story frames and extend frames for\nstory continuation. ContextualStory utilizes Spatially-Enhanced Temporal\nAttention to capture spatial and temporal dependencies, handling significant\ncharacter movements effectively. Additionally, we introduces a Storyline\nContextualizer to enrich context in storyline embedding and a StoryFlow Adapter\nto measure scene changes between frames for guiding model. Extensive\nexperiments on PororoSV and FlintstonesSV benchmarks demonstrate that\nContextualStory significantly outperforms existing methods in both story\nvisualization and story continuation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FLq4rXc9ckWNKa3NrZMnoRo2w-v5PvfW54b4Yj9xDmo","pdfSize":"12946584","objectId":"0x4f63a3f220320333e56f0aa986f8b83a29e460b344f81952ead1d4242f4be9f1","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
