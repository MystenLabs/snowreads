In addition to considering the\nrate of convergence in the Marcinkiewicz--Zygmund strong law of large numbers,\nwe go a step further by establishing (i) the\nHsu--Robbins--Erd\\\"{o}s--Spitzer--Baum--Katz theorem, (ii) the Feller weak law\nof large numbers, and (iii) the Pyke--Root theorem on mean convergence for\ndependent random fields. These results significantly improve several particular\ncases in the literature. The proof is based on new maximal inequalities that\nhold for random fields satisfying a very general dependence structure.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DcVAUXkT6peI2PTDPpa33oWrQ293WARUeqam4cl24ZE","pdfSize":"379927"}
