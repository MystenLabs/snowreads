The system\naddresses the challenges of traditional database queries by enabling fuzzy\nsearches based on imprecise descriptions, thereby improving data searchability\nand usability. CaseGPT not only retrieves relevant case data but also generates\ninsightful suggestions and recommendations based on patterns discerned from\nexisting case data. This functionality proves especially valuable for tasks\nsuch as medical diagnostics, legal precedent research, and case strategy\nformulation. The paper includes an in-depth discussion of the system's\nmethodology, its performance in both medical and legal domains, and its\npotential for future applications. Our experiments demonstrate that CaseGPT\nsignificantly outperforms traditional keyword-based and simple LLM-based\nsystems in terms of precision, recall, and efficiency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"O8vm96vJUDayKdaSBNNGXUzWhlrCLrqo7sLUfzkAqeI","pdfSize":"277804"}
