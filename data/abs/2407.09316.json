We investigate the\nSVL annealing dynamics of classical O(2) rotors on regular graphs, identifying\nuniversal features in the nonequilibrium dynamics when changing the range of\ninteractions and the topology of the graph. Regular graphs with low connectance\nor edge density exhibit universal scaling dynamics consistent with the\nKibble-Zurek mechanism, which leads to a power-law dependence of the density of\ndefects and the residual energy as a function of the annealing time. As the\ninteraction range is increased, the power-law scaling is suppressed, and an\nexponential scaling with the annealing time sets in. Our results establish a\nuniversal breakdown of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism in classical systems\ncharacterized by long-range interactions, in sharp contrast with previous\nfindings in the quantum domain.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"95CoFJ2AOcCeKWrhxfJFteReoGr7nHYhb4JWMpvTNK4","pdfSize":"10004768"}
