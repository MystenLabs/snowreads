On the other hand, in the context of rare diseases,\nmeta-analyses are often conducted with a limited number of studies in which the\nanalysis methods are based on theoretical frameworks assuming that the\nbetween-study variance is known. That is, the estimate of between-study\nvariance is substituted for the true value, neglecting the randomness with the\nbetween-study variance estimated from the data. Consequently, excessively\nnarrow confidence intervals for the overall treatment effect for meta-analyses\nhave been constructed in only a few studies. In the present study, we propose\novercoming this problem by estimating the distribution of between-study\nvariance using the maximum likelihood-like estimator. We also suggest an\napproach for estimating the overall treatment effect via the distribution of\nthe between-study variance. Our proposed method can extend many existing\napproaches to allow more adequate estimation under a few studies. Through\nsimulation and analysis of real data, we demonstrate that our method remains\nconsistently conservative compared to existing methods, which enables\nmeta-analyses to consider the randomness of the between-study variance.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fxkPdUIH8RHVy2jov5Vl3nBMOXqI6pQmnVE_6amajQw","pdfSize":"474315"}
