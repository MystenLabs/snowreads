This signature is expected in\nextensions of the Standard Model predicting the production of dark matter\nparticles, in particular those containing a dark Higgs boson $s$ that decays\ninto $b\\bar{b}$. The highly boosted $s \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ topology is\nreconstructed using jet reclustering and a new identification algorithm. This\nsearch places stringent constraints across regions of the dark Higgs model\nparameter space that satisfy the observed relic density, excluding dark Higgs\nbosons with masses between $30$ and $150$ GeV in benchmark scenarios with $Z'$\nmediator masses up to $4.8$ TeV at 95% confidence level.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MTi7kZQ60ZCr-EPOsFD9gN-wYZnR27m8ZihfDunNn18","pdfSize":"2107259","objectId":"0x464cc4307a226544dd1020e883f80c41d8698d83476316549ab61807e4d717f0","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
