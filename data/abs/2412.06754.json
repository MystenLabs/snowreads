Our approach implements\nsemantics via distributions over multisets in order to overcome theoretical\nbarriers arising from the lack of a distributive law between the powerset and\nGiry monads. We produce a full Kleene theorem and a coalgebraic theory, as well\nas both operational and denotational semantics and equational reasoning\nprinciples.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Logic in Computer Science","Computer Science/Formal Languages and Automata Theory","Computer Science/Programming Languages"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tleWYTJ9TrA8OEJopOGgqxZEKDfckgSpJMW2JGId730","pdfSize":"480391"}
