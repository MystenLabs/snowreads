A critical exponent $\\beta$ is noticed in the spinodal drop of the order\nparameter curve at the backward ST. We find critical damping inertia $m_*(p)$\nof the oscillator mixture, where the system undergoes a characteristic change\nfrom overdamped to underdamped. When underdamped, the hysteretic area also\nbecomes multistable. This contrasts an overdamped system, which is bistable at\nhysteresis. We also notice that $\\beta(p)$ continuously varies with $p$ along\nthe critical damping line $m_*(p)$. Further, we find a single-cluster to\nmulti-cluster phase transition at $m_{**}(p)$. We also discuss the effect of\nthose features on the stability of the power grid, which is increasingly\nthreatened as more electric power is produced from inertia-free generators.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JrqUOH92Sevlne56Dae3w-qzKUynDi2t6HjOJKvDkKU","pdfSize":"4657481"}
