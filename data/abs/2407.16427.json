We relate the level of stochasticity to the\nratio of the learning rate and the mini-batch size, providing more robust\nevidence to a previously conjectured scaling relationship. We discuss universal\nand non-universal features in the resulting Coulomb gas distribution and\nidentify the Wigner surmise and Wigner semicircle explicitly in a\nteacher-student model and in the (near-)solvable case of the Gaussian\nrestricted Boltzmann machine.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_ceR4bvoc_TyxdGFUjYb6Gkfn9J3vaLnnhdVmP04AH8","pdfSize":"1642615"}
