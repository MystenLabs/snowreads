Recent experiments show that\nneural representations for a given stimulus change over time. However, the\nmechanistic origin for the observed \"representational drift\" (RD) remains\nunclear. Here, we propose a biologically-realistic computational model of the\npiriform cortex to study RD in the mammalian olfactory system by combining two\nmechanisms for the dynamics of synaptic weights at two separate timescales:\nspontaneous fluctuations on a scale of days and spike-time dependent plasticity\n(STDP) on a scale of seconds. Our study shows that, while spontaneous\nfluctuations in synaptic weights induce RD, STDP-based learning during repeated\nstimulus presentations can reduce it. Our model quantitatively explains recent\nexperiments on RD in the olfactory system and offers a mechanistic explanation\nfor the emergence of drift and its relation to learning, which may be useful to\nstudy RD in other brain regions.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Y8i0ZdylevLJ8Z7OgwEmpke1OkrEhzgdDd5MSL42ooM","pdfSize":"17533498"}
