The results of this computation will provide an estimate of the size and\nuncertainty of the three-loop virtual corrections in a comparatively much\nlarger region of phase space than the results available in the literature,\nwhich are based on an expansion in the limit of a large top quark mass.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"TAjpkBV3bHF7oR_FkRiYhiDbuPHz33uASETGf-oaP-M","pdfSize":"402909"}
