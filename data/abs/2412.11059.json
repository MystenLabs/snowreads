We develop\nalgebraic techniques to derive both complex and real solutions for the RBLSE\nproblem by utilizing the complex and real forms of reduced biquaternion\nmatrices. Additionally, we conduct a perturbation analysis for the RBLSE\nproblem and establish an upper bound for the relative forward error of these\nsolutions. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed approaches and to verify the accuracy of the established upper\nbound for the relative forward errors.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"39PBT8OJOtAVun4vqUdwEopuKWFQygiRFovvF5B_uko","pdfSize":"215103"}
