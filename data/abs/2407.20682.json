At typical photon count\nrates and detector bias current, the observed relative deviation from a\nperfectly linear response is in the order of 0.1% when the flux is doubled.\nThis arises from a balance between the counteracting nonlinearities of\ndeadtime-induced detector saturation and of multi-photon detections. The\nobserved behaviour is modelled empirically, which suffices for a correction of\nmeasured data. In addition, statistical simulations, taking into account the\nmeasured recovery of the detection efficiency, provide insight into possible\nmechanisms of multi-photon detection.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dt6hJyKVA0g-Bvmw_iVf8GTB7rJyrtxC0KIadkbvKzs","pdfSize":"1025120"}
