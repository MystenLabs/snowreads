  "abstract": "  This paper investigates the pathwise uniform convergence in probability of\nfully discrete finite-element approximations for the two-dimensional stochastic\nNavier-Stokes equations with multiplicative noise, subject to no-slip boundary\nconditions. We demonstrate that the full discretization achieves nearly $\n3/2$-order convergence in space and nearly half-order convergence in time.\n",
