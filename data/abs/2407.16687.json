We consider a poorly-annealed Cu-Zr amorphous alloy\nperiodically deformed in a wide range of strain amplitudes at room temperature.\nIt is found that low-amplitude cyclic loading leads to a logarithmic decay of\nthe potential energy, and lower energy states are attained when the strain\namplitude approaches a critical point from below. Moreover, the potential\nenergy after several thousand loading cycles is a linear function of the peak\nvalue of the stress overshoot during startup continuous shear deformation of\nthe annealed sample. We show that the process of structural relaxation involves\ncollective, irreversible rearrangements of groups of atoms whose spatial extent\nis most pronounced at the initial stage of loading and higher strain\namplitudes. At the critical amplitude, the glass becomes mechanically annealed\nfor a number of transient cycles and then yields via formation of a shear band.\nThe yielding transition is clearly marked by abrupt changes in the potential\nenergy, storage modulus, and fraction of atoms with large nonaffine\ndisplacements.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_s1t9LUvjbKhJhWMii4oXLqGkzj1WyUZQvBP0X3Clqg","pdfSize":"2927649"}
