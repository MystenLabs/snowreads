It is crafted as an extension to\nthe original DESED dataset to reflect diverse acoustic variability and complex\nnoises in home settings. We leveraged LLMs to generate eight different domestic\nscenarios based on target sound categories of the DESED dataset. Then we\nenriched the scenarios with a carefully tailored mixture of noises selected\nfrom AudioSet and ensured no overlap with target sound. We consider widely\npopular convolutional neural recurrent network to study WildDESED dataset,\nwhich depicts its challenging nature. We then apply curriculum learning by\ngradually increasing noise complexity to enhance the model's generalization\ncapabilities across various noise levels. Our results with this approach show\nimprovements within the noisy environment, validating the effectiveness on the\nWildDESED dataset promoting noise-robust SED advancements.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Sound"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UupsostbC0obAC6YUbexDP1YFnRXqoWKTPJ0Cj_qNKo","pdfSize":"2600242"}
