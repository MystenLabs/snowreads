A type Ic-BL supernova (SN),\nSN 2022xiw, was definitively detected in late-time JWST spectroscopy (t = 195\ndays, observer-frame). However, photometric studies have found SN 2022xiw to be\nless luminous (10-70%) than the canonical GRB-SN, SN 1998bw. We present\nlate-time Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/WFC3 and JWST/NIRCam imaging of the\nafterglow and host galaxy of GRB 221009A at t ~ 185, 277, and 345 days\npost-trigger. Our joint archival ground, HST, and JWST light curve fits show\nstrong support for a break in the light curve decay slope at t = 50 +/- 10 days\n(observer-frame) and a supernova at $1.4^{+0.37}_{-0.40} \\times$ the\noptical/NIR flux of SN 1998bw. This break is consistent with an interpretation\nas a jet break when requiring slow-cooling electrons in a wind medium with the\nelectron energy spectral index, p > 2, and $\\nu_m < \\nu_c$. Our light curve and\njoint HST/JWST spectral energy distribution (SED) also show evidence for the\nlate-time emergence of a bluer component in addition to the fading afterglow\nand supernova. We find consistency with the interpretations that this source is\neither a young, massive, low-metallicity star cluster or a scattered light echo\nof the afterglow with a SED shape of $f_{\\nu} \\propto \\nu^{2.0\\pm1.0}$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bOVyPvY_EwbE6q5gldoGKSlGOaejJ-_Esx-SJHIcMkw","pdfSize":"40978091"}
