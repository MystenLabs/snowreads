Our proposed approach enables\nreal-time analysis with multiple data types on a common map via the GIS,\nentails feature-extraction abilities due to the CNN, and captures long-range\ndependencies through the ViT. This hybrid approach is found to enhance\nclassification, thus helping in the monitoring and operational management of\npower plants; hence assisting energy estimation and sustainable energy planning\nin the future. It exemplifies adequate deployment of machine learning methods\nin conjunction with domain-specific approaches to enhance performance.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fpvIUoyQi-JoHlHWoI9z5GxgftB3jeMzfJjQCF1eVCQ","pdfSize":"590150"}
