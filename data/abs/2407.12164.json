Methods like DreamBooth and Subject-driven Text-to-Image (SuTI)\nhave made significant progress in this area. Yet, both approaches primarily\nfocus on enhancing similarity to reference images and require expensive setups,\noften overlooking the need for efficient training and avoiding overfitting to\nthe reference images. In this work, we present the $\\lambda$-Harmonic reward\nfunction, which provides a reliable reward signal and enables early stopping\nfor faster training and effective regularization. By combining the\nBradley-Terry preference model, the $\\lambda$-Harmonic reward function also\nprovides preference labels for subject-driven generation tasks. We propose\nReward Preference Optimization (RPO), which offers a simpler setup (requiring\nonly $3\\%$ of the negative samples used by DreamBooth) and fewer gradient steps\nfor fine-tuning. Unlike most existing methods, our approach does not require\ntraining a text encoder or optimizing text embeddings and achieves text-image\nalignment by fine-tuning only the U-Net component. Empirically,\n$\\lambda$-Harmonic proves to be a reliable approach for model selection in\nsubject-driven generation tasks. Based on preference labels and early stopping\nvalidation from the $\\lambda$-Harmonic reward function, our algorithm achieves\na state-of-the-art CLIP-I score of 0.833 and a CLIP-T score of 0.314 on\nDreamBench.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vIsiYK-D3v1yytsm93_z4kGLUajiTBIqDGOrnWjmxAI","pdfSize":"30274783"}
