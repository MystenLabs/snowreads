This follows from reconsidering McCarthy's\nclassification of BMS group UIRs through a unique, Lorentz-invariant but\nnon-linear, decomposition of supermomenta into hard and soft pieces.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4EvcYtuFyejLn47n7X0XyPtA0GiQvxl5LprNYpwa2ds","pdfSize":"196283"}
