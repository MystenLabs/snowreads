It also defines and analyzes the concept of\nidempotent row space and idempotent column space of a bicomplex matrix. Some\nexamples and counter examples have been presented to substantiate the study.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"L1Q5UTP5-MEBqVQ4XWFQI7p5GG-3CZs5ICihJeQcgWY","pdfSize":"176592"}
