Under specific conditions, these\nmartingales can be expressed using revised set-valued stochastic integrals with\nrespect to a real standard Brownian motion $W = (W_t)_{t\\in[0,T ]}$. Moreover,\nwe prove the existence of solutions to the following set-valued backward\nstochastic differential equation of the form $$\n  Y_t=\\left(\\xi+\\int_t^TH_u du+\\int_{[0,t]}^{\\mathscr{R}}{Z}\\, dW_u\\right)\n\\circleddash \\int_{[0,T]}^{\\mathscr{R}}{Z}\\, dW_u\\quad a.s.,\\quad t\\in [0,T],\n$$ where the right-hand side, of this equation, represents the Hukuhara\ndifference of two quantities containing revised set-valued stochastic\nintegrals, $\\xi$ is a terminal set-valued function condition and $H$ is a\nset-valued function satisfying some suitable conditions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"-3B-fbYrSCCpXG2J2LfWATn6Fk_31bg9zKWmUL0oGhs","pdfSize":"469018"}
