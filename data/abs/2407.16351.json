In this paper, we survey the literature on\nvisualization datasets and provide a comprehensive overview of existing\nvisualization datasets, including their data types, formats, supported tasks,\nand openness. We propose a what-why-how model for visualization datasets,\nconsidering the content of the dataset (what), the supported tasks (why), and\nthe dataset construction process (how). This model provides a clear\nunderstanding of the diversity and complexity of visualization datasets.\nAdditionally, we highlight the challenges faced by existing visualization\ndatasets, including the lack of standardization in data types and formats and\nthe limited availability of large-scale datasets. To address these challenges,\nwe suggest future research directions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hVQzklD9qJWoi1zchIXFn87tUEN7O4xUc1Rqhz_gYeI","pdfSize":"7330634"}
