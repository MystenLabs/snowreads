  "abstract": "  We investigate the interaction of spontaneous emission photons generated by a\nstrongly driven laser-cooled atom sample with that same sample after a time\ndelay, which is important for establishing long-distance entanglement between\nquantum systems. The photons are emitted into an optical nanofiber, connected\nto a length of conventional optical fiber and reflected back using a\nFiber-Bragg Grating mirror. We show that the photon count rates as a function\nof exciting laser frequency and intensity follow a simple model.\n",
