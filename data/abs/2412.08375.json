  "abstract": "  We consider the discretization of a class of nonlinear parabolic equations by\ndiscontinuous Galerkin time-stepping methods and establish a priori as well as\nconditional a posteriori error estimates. Our approach is motivated by the\nerror analysis in [9] for Runge-Kutta methods for nonlinear parabolic\nequations; in analogy to [9], the proofs are based on maximal regularity\nproperties of discontinuous Galerkin methods for non-autonomous linear\nparabolic equations.\n",
