  "abstract": "  Machine learning (ML) methods have become popular for parameter inference in\ncosmology, although their reliance on specific training data can cause\ndifficulties when applied across different data sets. By reproducing and\ntesting networks previously used in the field, and applied to 21cmFast and\nSimfast21 simulations, we show that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) often\nlearn to identify features of individual simulation boxes rather than the\nunderlying physics, limiting their applicability to real observations. We\nexamine the prediction of the neutral fraction and astrophysical parameters\nfrom 21 cm maps and find that networks typically fail to generalise to unseen\nsimulations. We explore a number of case studies to highlight factors that\nimprove or degrade network performance. These results emphasise the\nresponsibility on users to ensure ML models are applied correctly in 21 cm\ncosmology.\n",
