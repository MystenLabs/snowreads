In recent years, researchers\nhave increasingly turned to machine learning techniques to address this\nproblem. They have developed methods to learn the underlying diffusion\nprocesses in a data-driven manner, which enhances the generalizability of the\nsolution, and have designed optimization objectives to identify the optimal\nseed set. Nonetheless, two fundamental gaps remain unsolved: (1) Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) are increasingly used to learn diffusion models, but in their\ntraditional form, they often fail to capture the complex dynamics of influence\ndiffusion, (2) Designing optimization objectives is challenging due to\ncombinatorial explosion when solving this problem. To address these challenges,\nwe propose a novel framework, DeepSN. Our framework employs sheaf neural\ndiffusion to learn diverse influence patterns in a data-driven, end-to-end\nmanner, providing enhanced separability in capturing diffusion characteristics.\nWe also propose an optimization technique that accounts for overlapping\ninfluence between vertices, which helps to reduce the search space and identify\nthe optimal seed set effectively and efficiently. Finally, we conduct extensive\nexperiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our framework.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"s0i1ir6t-HHMKT_9pwzNu7WPy0J2CptnCGsJqIg7lJk","pdfSize":"379447"}
