Emerging research has highlighted\nthe potential of coupled microresonators, or photonic molecules, as a novel\navenue for spectral engineering, unlocking an extra degree of freedom for the\noptimization of four-wave mixing interactions. Here, we demonstrate DOPO within\nthe coupled modes of a silicon nitride triple-state photonic molecule. Our\ndesign introduces a distinctive mechanism for spectral engineering, using\nmicroheaters to individually tune the resonance spectral positions, thus\nenabling dynamic local dispersion control within the coupled modes. We\nsuccessfully generate a DOPO signal with active efficiency control and explore\nthe optical mode spacing in the tens of gigahertz range to use native\nphase-locked optical pumps driven by a radio-frequency source.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eGWLb9s3zOpebODZ57mGrbr72H2DJ90NYT2ux1N2Krc","pdfSize":"28451836"}
