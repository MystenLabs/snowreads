  "abstract": "  The value of the strong coupling $\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}$ is determined in a\ncomprehensive analysis at next-to-next-to-leading order accuracy in quantum\nchromodynamics. The analysis uses double-differential cross section\nmeasurements from the CMS Collaboration at the CERN LHC of inclusive jet\nproduction in proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies of 2.76, 7,\n8, and 13 TeV, combined with inclusive deep-inelastic data from HERA. The value\n$\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}(m_\\mathrm{Z})$ = 0.1176$\\,^{+0.0014}_{-0.0016}$ is obtained\nat the scale of the Z boson mass. By using the measurements in different\nintervals of jet transverse momentum, the running of $\\alpha_\\mathrm{S}$ is\nprobed for energies between 100 and 1600 GeV.\n",
