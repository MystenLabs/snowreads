Although existing approaches typically focus on\ntop-down optimization or bottom-up community planning, only some frameworks\nsuccessfully integrate both perspectives. Our methodology employs a two-tier\napproach: First, a deterministic solver optimizes basic infrastructure\nrequirements in the city region. Second, four specialized planning agents, each\nrepresenting distinct sub-regions, propose demographic-specific modifications\nto a master planner. The master planner then evaluates and integrates these\nsuggestions to ensure cohesive urban development. We validate our framework\nusing a newly created dataset comprising detailed region and sub-region maps\nfrom three developing cities in India, focusing on areas undergoing rapid\nurbanization. The results demonstrate that this hybrid approach enables more\nnuanced urban development while maintaining overall city functionality.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Multiagent Systems","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"F-n1Vfnz37c5iF80K7ncSsHopsxYfb5Uc8ZQymq0eJw","pdfSize":"10252272"}
