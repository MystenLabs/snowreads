  "abstract": "  We propose an electrolyser model for steady-state load flow analysis of\nmulti-carrier energy networks, where the electrolyser is capable of producing\nhydrogen gas and heat. We show that there are boundary conditions that lead to\na well-posed problem. We derive these conditions for two cases, namely with a\nfixed and non-fixed ratio between gas and heat output. Furthermore, the derived\nconditions are validated numerically.\n",
