  "abstract": "  In this paper, we investigate anisotropic cosmological solutions within the\nframework of Born-Infeld-f(R) gravity, a modification of general relativity\nthat incorporates higher-order curvature invariants. Specifically, we focus on\nthe analysis of Bianchi type-I solutions, which provide a valuable framework\nfor studying the evolution of spatial anisotropies in cosmology. By introducing\na reconstruction scheme for this model, we explore the behavior of these\nsolutions, analyze various cosmic evolution scenarios, including Starobinsky\ninflation, de Sitter-like expansion, power-law dynamics, and Big Rip-like\nevolution. Additionally, we examine the exponential and power-law behavior of\nthe auxiliary metric function to illustrate its impact on the dynamics of\ncosmic evolution. Our analysis elucidates how the modifications introduced by\nBorn-Infeld-f(R) gravity influence anisotropic dynamics, offering new\nperspectives on the late-time behavior of the universe and potential future\nsingularities.\n",
