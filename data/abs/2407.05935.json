The nilfibre $\\mathscr N$\nfor this action is the zero locus of the augmentation $\\mathscr I_+$ of the\nsemi-invariant algebra $\\mathscr I=\\mathbb C[\\mathfrak m]^{P'}$. For $G=SL(n)$\npractically nothing was known previously. The only result of comparable, but\nlesser complexity, is for $\\mathscr V:=\\mathscr O\\cap \\mathfrak n$, with\n$\\mathscr O$ a nilptent $G$ orbit and $\\mathfrak n$ the set of strictly upper\ntriangular matrices. Then $\\mathscr V$ is equidimensional with components known\nas orbital varieties, parameterised by standard tableaux whose shape is\ndictated by $\\mathscr O$. Here the components of $\\mathscr N$ are studied for\n$G=SL(n)$. They increase exponentially in $n$ with no a priori discernable\npattern. For each choice of numerical data $\\mathcal C$, a semi-standard\ntableau $\\mathscr T^\\mathcal C$, is constructed from $\\mathscr T$. A\n\\textit{delicate and tightly interlocking} analysis constructs a set of\nexcluded root vectors from $\\mathfrak m$ such that the complementary space\n$\\mathfrak u^\\mathcal C$ has the following properties. First it is a subalgebra\nof $\\mathfrak m$. Secondly $\\mathscr C:=\\overline{B.\\mathfrak u^\\mathcal C}$\nlies in $\\mathscr N$ to which, thirdly, a Weierstrass section can be\nassociated. Fourthly $\\dim \\mathscr C = dim \\mathfrak m-\\textbf{g}$, where\n\\textbf{g} is the number of generators of the polynomial algebra $\\mathscr I$.\nFifthly the Weierstrass section, is shown to imply that $\\mathscr C$ an\nirreducible component of $\\mathscr N$, yet $\\mathscr C$ is \\textit{ only\nsometimes} an orbital variety closure. The resulting Component Map $\\mathscr\nT^\\mathcal C\\mapsto\\mathscr C$ is shown to be injective. Evidence for its\nsurjectivity is given.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"2GTHGquBZ7fJI9SqHyUmH-OMMA4IgVVdySq8JtKn5y4","pdfSize":"683699"}
