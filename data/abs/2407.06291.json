Our approach\nutilizes production-grade models such as the Google Bird Vocalization\nClassifier, BirdNET, and EnCodec to address representation and labeling\nchallenges in the competition. We explore the distributional shift between this\nyear's edition of unlabeled soundscapes representative of the hidden test set\nand propose a pseudo multi-label classification strategy to leverage the\nunlabeled data. Our highest post-competition public leaderboard score is 0.63\nusing BirdNET embeddings with Bird Vocalization pseudo-labels.
