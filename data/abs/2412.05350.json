  "abstract": "  In treatments of electromagnetism, it is often tacitly assumed that the\nvector potentials of the field and their conjugate momenta satisfy the\ncanonical Poisson bracket relations, despite the fact that the components of\nthe vector potential are constrained by gauge conditions. Here I explicate how\nthis comes about by imposing Poisson bracket relations on the independent field\nvariables remaining after the Lorenz gauge constraint is accounted for. The\nnaively assumed Poisson brackets happens to be correct even after gauge fixing,\nowing to a conspiracy between the gauge conditions and the principle of\nrelativity.\n",
