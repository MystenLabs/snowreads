Similar to quasinormal\nmodes, these can be defined as the poles of the holographic Green's function,\nalbeit for real frequency and complex momentum. Their pseudospectra are in\nstark contrast to the pseudospectra of quasinormal modes of AdS black holes.\nContrary to the case of quasinormal mode pseudospectra, the resolvent is\nwell-defined, and the numerical approximation shows fast convergence. At zero\nfrequency, complex momentum modes are stable normal modes of a Hermitian\noperator. Even for large frequencies, they show only comparatively mild\nspectral instability. We also find that local potential perturbations cannot\ndestabilize the lowest complex momentum mode.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ua4TgFlP0oL-TToQtY0CXZWn5rsk5CFIAFiFHVGEMW8","pdfSize":"12232173"}
