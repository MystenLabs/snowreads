We prove that (i) if $v/ \\sigma(v)$ is\nsufficiently large near $v=0$, then the solution $u(t,\\cdot)$ is strictly\npositive for all $t>0$, and (ii) if $v/\\sigma(v)$ is sufficiently small near\n$v= 0$, then the solution $u(t,\\cdot)$ has compact support for all $t>0$. These\nfindings extend previous results concerning the strict positivity and the\ncompact support property, which were analyzed only for the case\n$\\sigma(u)\\approx u^\\gamma$ for $\\gamma>0$. Additionally, we establish the\nuniqueness of a solution and the weak comparison principle in case (i).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Yf2nT0AFoiU4Z5JTTF9Xv-l2Ac81t3iymzNl1GxyDVo","pdfSize":"381790"}
