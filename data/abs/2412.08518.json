In systems where the potential\nenergy exhibits conformal invariance, the conformal transformation can\nstraighten the boundary, simplifying the boundary conditions. Using the example\nof edge modes in a simple field-theoretical model, we examined scattering into\nthe bulk and identified conditions that ensure the robustness of edge modes\nagainst damping. This technique has the potential to be applied to other\nedge-mode problems in 2+1 dimensions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_1hsfchWv_E8lF1SYjWpoLcqTpXyh4Rs_SqyePR0Ib8","pdfSize":"382304"}
