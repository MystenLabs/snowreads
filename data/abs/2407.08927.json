More explicitly, we prove\nthat there exists a constant c>0 such that for every integer n>1 every n-vertex\neven-hole-free graph has a tree decomposition where each bag has stability\n(independence) number at most c log^10 n. This implies that the Maximum Weight\nIndependent Set problem, as well as several other natural algorithmic problems\nthat are known to be NP-hard in general, can be solved in quasi-polynomial time\nif the input graph is even-hole-free.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PbcxQ4dp6V_Ddw-0I23Cr2_KQmzLW0i8le6sWImEq74","pdfSize":"622887"}
