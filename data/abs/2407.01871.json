Combined with previous observations\nby Mabuchi and Nakamura in the other direction, this gives a characterization\nof the existence of Mabuchi solitons in terms of the existence of extremal\nK\\\"ahler metrics on Fano manifolds. An extension of this correspondence to\n$v$-solitons is also obtained.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8qM3mSkwj6YBN2GxEcpbyBxZuvh5ZSYU_EnxPKb6d0E","pdfSize":"401874"}
