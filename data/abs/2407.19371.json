In this work, we propose a deep latent state-space\ngenerative model to capture the interactions among different types of\ncorrelated clinical events (e.g., kidney failure, mortality) by explicitly\nmodeling the temporal dynamics of patients' latent states. Based on these\nlearned patient states, we further develop a new general discrete-time\nformulation of the hazard rate function to estimate the survival distribution\nof patients with significantly improved accuracy. Extensive evaluations over\nreal EMR data show that our proposed model compares favorably to various\nstate-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, our method also uncovers meaningful\ninsights about the latent correlations among mortality and different types of\norgan failures.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sLvEJ9qjKtCBiYUbbc5cyxMgHJDIkkZfySAsz1FrBAM","pdfSize":"909135"}
