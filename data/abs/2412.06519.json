We derive the analytic form of the helicity\namplitudes through finite-field reconstruction techniques. The analytic\nexpressions have been implemented in a public C++ library, and we demonstrate\nthat evaluations are sufficiently stable and efficient for use in\nphenomenological studies.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bcl7rGKD1Chmr56iDk2YMKszYqKUqUHGSlLUMJPwVaA","pdfSize":"1246266"}
