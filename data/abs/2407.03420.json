By comparing three approximations of the logrank test (Schoenfeld,\nFreedman, Rubinstein) to empirical simulations, we find that the RR that\nmaximizes power is the RR that balances number of events across treatment arms\nat the end of the trial. This contradicts the common misconception implied by\nSchoenfeld's approximation that 1:1 randomization maximizes power. Besides\npower, we consider other factors that might influence the choice of RR\n(accrual, trial duration, sample size, etc.). We perform simulations to better\nunderstand how unequal randomization might impact these factors in practice.\nAltogether, we derive 6 insights to guide statisticians in the design of\nsurvival trials considering unequal randomization.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Sd9JTqGy6ho0bAEQiBMl-eXLkAszMucrwwkM7KZfxwk","pdfSize":"1217040"}
