  "abstract": "  Limit order book (LOB) is a dynamic, event-driven system that records\nreal-time market demand and supply for a financial asset in a stream flow.\nEvent stream prediction in LOB refers to forecasting both the timing and the\ntype of events. The challenge lies in modeling the time-event distribution to\ncapture the interdependence between time and event type, which has\ntraditionally relied on stochastic point processes. However, modeling complex\nmarket dynamics using stochastic processes, e.g., Hawke stochastic process, can\nbe simplistic and struggle to capture the evolution of market dynamics. In this\nstudy, we present LOBDIF (LOB event stream prediction with diffusion model),\nwhich offers a new paradigm for event stream prediction within the LOB system.\nLOBDIF learns the complex time-event distribution by leveraging a diffusion\nmodel, which decomposes the time-event distribution into sequential steps, with\neach step represented by a Gaussian distribution. Additionally, we propose a\ndenoising network and a skip-step sampling strategy. The former facilitates\neffective learning of time-event interdependence, while the latter accelerates\nthe sampling process during inference. By introducing a diffusion model, our\napproach breaks away from traditional modeling paradigms, offering novel\ninsights and providing an effective and efficient solution for learning the\ntime-event distribution in order streams within the LOB system. Extensive\nexperiments using real-world data from the limit order books of three widely\ntraded assets confirm that LOBDIF significantly outperforms current\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n",
