The HDG scheme uses piecewise\npolynomials of degrees $k(k\\geq 1),k,k-1,k-1$, and $k$ respectively for the\napproximations of the velocity, the magnetic field, the pressure, the magnetic\npseudo-pressure, and the temperature in the interior of elements, and uses\npiecewise polynomials of degree $k$ for their numerical traces on the\ninterfaces of elements. The method is shown to yield globally divergence-free\napproximations of the velocity and magnetic fields. Existence and uniqueness\nresults for the discrete scheme are given and optimal a priori error estimates\nare derived. Numerical experiments are provided to verify the obtained\ntheoretical results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VZ5yMWevxgpXTy2c_BjLLVe7ZFB3iUcVT9HGF2t-_sU","pdfSize":"440671"}
