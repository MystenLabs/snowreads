In this work, we propose\nto leverage a few annotated 3D shapes or richly annotated 2D datasets to\nperform 3D object part segmentation. We present our novel approach, termed\n3-By-2 that achieves SOTA performance on different benchmarks with various\ngranularity levels. By using features from pretrained foundation models and\nexploiting semantic and geometric correspondences, we are able to overcome the\nchallenges of limited 3D annotations. Our approach leverages available 2D\nlabels, enabling effective 3D object part segmentation. Our method 3-By-2 can\naccommodate various part taxonomies and granularities, demonstrating\ninteresting part label transfer ability across different object categories.\nProject website: \\url{https://ngailapdi.github.io/projects/3by2/}.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RrXFXlg7fWAxLs8F3HF4bJDj1QZdvFmvl_xap_4Tu84","pdfSize":"6970981"}
