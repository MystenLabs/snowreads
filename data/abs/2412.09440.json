  "abstract": "  Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has revolutionised quadruped robot\nlocomotion, but existing control frameworks struggle to generalise beyond their\ntraining-induced observational scope, resulting in limited adaptability. In\ncontrast, animals achieve exceptional adaptability through gait transition\nstrategies, diverse gait utilisation, and seamless adjustment to immediate\nenvironmental demands. Inspired by these capabilities, we present a novel DRL\nframework that incorporates key attributes of animal locomotion: gait\ntransition strategies, pseudo gait procedural memory, and adaptive motion\nadjustments. This approach enables our framework to achieve unparalleled\nadaptability, demonstrated through blind zero-shot deployment on complex\nterrains and recovery from critically unstable states. Our findings offer\nvaluable insights into the biomechanics of animal locomotion, paving the way\nfor robust, adaptable robotic systems.\n",
