The\nlatter is highly influenced by the quantum fluctuations that arise at the\ninevitable metal-molecule interface in a device architecture. In this study, we\nhave systematically investigated the dynamical screening effects in\nphthalocyanine molecules hosting a series of transition-metal ions (Ti, V, Cr,\nMn, Fe, Co, and Ni) in contact with the Cu(111) surface. Using comprehensive\ndensity functional theory plus Anderson's Impurity Model calculations, we show\nthat the orbital-dependent hybridization and electron correlation together\nresult in strong charge and spin fluctuations. While the instantaneous spin\nmoments of the transition-metal ions are near atomic-like, we find that\nscreening gives rise to considerable lowering or even quenching of these. Our\nresults highlight the importance of quantum fluctuations in metal-contacted\nmolecular devices, which may influence the results obtained from theoretical or\nexperimental probes, depending on their possibly material-dependent\ncharacteristic sampling time-scales.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"crIIkPO4e9emMdWis2bg4BTrpPWwTSV8-Icb6Wuqc3w","pdfSize":"3910779"}
