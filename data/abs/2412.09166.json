The method uses the representation of a $k \\times t$\nequireplicate incomplete-block design with $t$ treatments in $t$ blocks of size\n$k$, termed an auxiliary block design, as a $t \\times t$ square array design\nwith $k$ controls, where $k<t$. This can be regarded as an extension of the\nrepresentation of a Youden square as a partial latin square for unreplicated\ntrials. Properties of the designs, in particular in relation to connectedness\nand randomization, are explored. Particular attention is given to square array\ndesigns which minimize the average variances of the estimates of paired\ncomparisons between test lines and controls and between test-line and test-line\neffects. The use of equireplicate cyclic designs as auxiliary block designs is\nhighlighted. These provide a flexible and workable family of augmented\nrow-column square array designs. Designs whose auxiliary block designs are not\ncyclic are also covered.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"t7VWm_N6I9OKru8ObaujxzyMq52u_sRP-jqeiAYT204","pdfSize":"276976"}
