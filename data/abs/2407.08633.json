We present an AI-driven framework for automated\nwarehouse layout generation. This framework employs constrained beam search to\nderive optimal layouts within given spatial parameters, adhering to all\nfunctional requirements. The feasibility of the generated layouts is verified\nbased on criteria such as item accessibility, required minimum clearances, and\naisle connectivity. A scoring function is then used to evaluate the feasible\nlayouts considering the number of storage locations, access points, and\naccessibility costs. We demonstrate our method's ability to produce feasible,\noptimal layouts for a variety of warehouse dimensions and shapes, diverse door\nplacements, and interconnections. This approach, currently being prepared for\ndeployment, will enable human designers to rapidly explore and confirm options,\nfacilitating the selection of the most appropriate layout for their use-case.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pGHNz0WQv3WN4I_WXWjkP8r02-SHjKNNrNct2Ixy0L8","pdfSize":"2835074"}
