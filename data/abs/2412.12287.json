We demonstrate that this mechanism can be\nrealized generically with low-energy new physics without supersymmetry while\nproducing detectable gravitational waves (GWs) sourced by parametric resonance\nof a light scalar field. In viable benchmark models, the scalar has a mass of\n${\\cal O}(0.1-10)$ GeV, yielding GWs with peak frequencies of ${\\cal\nO}(10-100)$ Hz. This study further reveals a new complementarity between\nupcoming LIGO-frequency GW detectors and laboratory searches across multiple\nfrontiers of particle physics.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"v0Nc8-Jzh8uW_UiRWazq2cAVDKXRi-4VXTEaA59yg7w","pdfSize":"1115139"}
