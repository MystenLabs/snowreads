  "abstract": "  This paper presents DynRank, a novel framework for enhancing passage\nretrieval in open-domain question-answering systems through dynamic zero-shot\nquestion classification. Traditional approaches rely on static prompts and\npre-defined templates, which may limit model adaptability across different\nquestions and contexts. In contrast, DynRank introduces a dynamic prompting\nmechanism, leveraging a pre-trained question classification model that\ncategorizes questions into fine-grained types. Based on these classifications,\ncontextually relevant prompts are generated, enabling more effective passage\nretrieval. We integrate DynRank into existing retrieval frameworks and conduct\nextensive experiments on multiple QA benchmark datasets.\n",
