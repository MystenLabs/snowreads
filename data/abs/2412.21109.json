We introduce a straightforward countable\nanalog of the notion of stratification by Balmer-Favi supports and conjecture\nthat it holds for the equivariant bootstrap subcategory of every finite group\nG. We prove this conjecture for groups whose nontrivial elements all have prime\norder, and we verify it rationally for arbitrary finite groups. In all these\ncases we also compute the Balmer spectrum of compact objects. In our proofs we\nuse larger versions of the equivariant Kasparov categories which admit not only\ncountable coproducts but all small ones; they are constructed in an Appendix\nusing infinity-categorical enhancements and adapting ideas of Bunke-Engel-Land.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology","Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"m84lD92veKQp4khzK8x3gIkSkVFsTfyuQj7xi7xbdj8","pdfSize":"667926"}
