The risks AI presents to society are broadly understood to be\nmanageable through general calculus, i.e., general frameworks designed to\nenable those involved in the development of AI to apprehend and manage risk,\nsuch as AI impact assessments, ethical frameworks, emerging international\nstandards, and regulations. This paper elaborates how risk is apprehended and\nmanaged by a regulator, developer and cyber-security expert. It reveals that\nrisk and risk management is dependent on mundane situated practices not\nencapsulated in general calculus. Situated practice surfaces iterable\nepistopics, revealing how those involved in the development of AI know and\nsubsequently respond to risk and uncover major challenges in their work. The\nongoing discovery and elaboration of epistopics of risk in AI a) furnishes a\npotential program of interdisciplinary inquiry, b) provides AI developers with\na means of apprehending risk, and c) informs the ongoing evolution of general\ncalculus.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Sfm88vxSn03b2LsJIv-1u-9CO364fhaLS-GAZ_7pJI8","pdfSize":"414302","objectId":"0x65c2f4cf04037f26264c88413fd96889f8d361ef5f2f20ff98763a3ab185e9aa","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
