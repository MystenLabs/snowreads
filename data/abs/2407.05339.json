Business leaders thus face the question of how\nto best reap the benefits of automation whilst managing the associated risks.\nAs a first step, many companies have committed themselves to various sets of\nethics principles aimed at guiding the design and use of AI systems. So far so\ngood. But how can well-intentioned ethical principles be translated into\neffective practice? And what challenges await companies that attempt to\noperationalize AI governance? In this article, we address these questions by\ndrawing on our first-hand experience of shaping and driving the roll-out of AI\ngovernance within AstraZeneca, a biopharmaceutical company. The examples we\ndiscuss highlight challenges that any organization attempting to operationalize\nAI governance will have to face. These include questions concerning how to\ndefine the material scope of AI governance, how to harmonize standards across\ndecentralized organizations, and how to measure the impact of specific AI\ngovernance initiatives. By showcasing how AstraZeneca managed these operational\nquestions, we hope to provide project managers, CIOs, AI practitioners, and\ndata privacy officers responsible for designing and implementing AI governance\nframeworks within other organizations with generalizable best practices. In\nessence, companies seeking to operationalize AI governance are encouraged to\nbuild on existing policies and governance structures, use pragmatic and\naction-oriented terminology, focus on risk management in development and\nprocurement, and empower employees through continuous education and change\nmanagement.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CaFVf0TUFhwYA4_BkmYS__PugQVN7VSb9EgVbEhAPN4","pdfSize":"259519"}
