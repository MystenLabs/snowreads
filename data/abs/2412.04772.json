Quantifying its\nevolution and its dependence on galaxy properties is particularly important for\nour understanding of accretion and feedback mechanisms. We select a\nvolume-selected sample of 66 {\\it isolated} star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at\n$0.4< z <1.5$ with $\\log(M_\\star/M_{\\odot})> 9$ from the MusE GAs FLOw and Wind\n(MEGAFLOW) survey. Using MgII 2796,2803 absorptions in background quasars, we\nmeasure the covering fraction $f_c$ and quantify how the cool gas profile\ndepends on galaxy properties (such as star-formation rate (SFR), stellar mass\n($M_\\star$) or azimuthal angle relative to the line of sight) and how these\ndependencies evolve with redshift. The MgII covering fraction of isolated\ngalaxies is a strong function of impact parameter, and is steeper than\npreviously reported. The impact parameter $b_{50}$ at which $f_c = $50\\% is\n$b_{50}=50\\pm7$kpc ($65\\pm7$ kpc) for $W_r^{2796}>$0.5 \\AA ($W_r^{2796}>0.1$\n\\AA), respectively. It is weakly correlated with SFR ($\\propto$\nSFR$^{0.08\\pm0.09}$) and decreases with cosmic time ($\\propto (1+z)^{0.8 \\pm\n0.7}$), contrary to the expectation of increasingly larger halos with time. The\ncovering fraction is also higher along the minor axis than along the major axis\nat the $\\approx 2 \\sigma$ level. The CGM traced by \\MgII{} is similar across\nthe isolated galaxy population. Indeed, among the isolated galaxies with an\nimpact parameter below 55 kpc, all have associated MgII absorption with\n$W_r^{2796}>$0.3\\AA, resulting in a steep covering fraction $f_c(b)$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2aOcOQ9EriXOczng6dtLBZ6-QTUl6UKPgTnWO5tfoC4","pdfSize":"2779783"}
