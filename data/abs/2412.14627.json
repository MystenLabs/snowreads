  "abstract": "  A magnetic impurity in a BCS superconductor induces the formation of a Shiba\nstate and drives a local quantum phase transition. We generalize this concept\nto a one-dimensional superconductor with fractionalized excitations, where the\ndominant instability is superconducting. In this framework, conduction\nelectrons fractionalize into gapless charge and gapped spin excitations. We\nshow that magnetic impurity interacts exclusively with the spin degrees of\nfreedom and induces a quantum phase transition. Furthermore, charge excitations\ninfluence dynamical observables, giving rise to the phenomenon we term the\nfractionalized Shiba state. At zero temperature, the tunneling spectrum\nexhibits universal power-law scaling with an exponent of $-1/2$ at half\nfilling, stemming from the gapless charge modes that form a standard Luttinger\nliquid. Extending this analysis to finite temperatures reveals that the\nspectral features retain universal behavior at the critical point.\n",
