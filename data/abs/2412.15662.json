  "abstract": "  We propose a theoretical model that incorporates both a time-varying\nstochastic field and thermal noise in a two-state system. In analyzing data\nfrom numerical simulations, we adopt a detailed microscopic approach that goes\nbeyond the standard calculation of the order parameter. Specifically, we\nmeasure the probability distribution of the magnetization as a function of\ntemperature and field strength, and compute the time required for the system to\njump from one ordered state to the other. These measurements enable us to probe\nvarious ordered states in the system and investigate the symmetry breaking and\nsymmetry restoring phenomena underlying the observed phase behavior.\n",
