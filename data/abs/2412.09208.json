The photon-number correlations and squeezing\nare studied using linearized quantum fluctuation theory. Two models of the\npulse propagation in an optical fiber are used. The first model is based on the\nManakov equations, and the second one is based on the coupled nonlinear\nSchrodinger equations with differential group delay and birefringence terms. In\nthe Manakov model the correlated pulse pairs can be generated using splitting\nof a second-order soliton and inelastic collision of two fundamental solitons.\nThe interpulse correlations depends on the modulation period of the fiber\ndispersion. In the model of the coupled nonlinear Schrodinger equations the\ncorrelated pulse pair can be produced using pulse splitting due to polarization\nmode dispersion. The pulses have orthogonal polarization states. This allows\nthe pulses to be separated into two different channels using a polarization\nbeam splitter. The interpulse correlation depends on the interplay between\npolarization mode dispersion and polarization instability.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"SILBNd8h_OlyOrrDeHvU_nC1VocEyeGi89E0iccvnjU","pdfSize":"2499456"}
