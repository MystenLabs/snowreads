While existing approaches struggle with complex scenes, we propose a\nnovel weakly-supervised framework that emphasises geometric understanding and\nleverages pre-trained vision models to enhance object discovery. Our method\nintroduces an efficient slot decoder specifically designed for object-centric\nlearning, enabling effective representation of multi-object scenes without\nrequiring explicit depth information. Results on synthetic video benchmarks\nwith increasing complexity in terms of objects and their movement, object\nocclusion and camera motion demonstrate that our approach achieves comparable\nperformance to supervised methods while maintaining computational efficiency.\nThis advances the field towards more practical applications in complex\nreal-world scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Multimedia"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"q_SE0sDD0kneHrQ0QoNrqL04_Y7XkRAMZ9FDs5A4m68","pdfSize":"4327761"}
