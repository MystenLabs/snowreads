  "abstract": "  Let $\\Sigma_b$ be a closed Riemann surface of genus $b$. We investigate\nfinite quotients $G$ of the pure braid group on two strands\n$\\mathsf{P}_2(\\Sigma_b)$ which do not factor through $\\pi_1(\\Sigma_b \\times\n\\Sigma_b)$. Building on our previous work on some special systems of generators\non finite groups that we called \\emph{diagonal double Kodaira structures}, we\nprove that, if $G$ has not order $32$, then $|G| \\geq 64$, and we completely\nclassify the cases where equality holds. In the last section, as a geometric\napplication of our algebraic results, we construct two $3$-dimensional families\nof double Kodaira fibrations having the same biregular invariants and the same\nBetti numbers but different fundamental group.\n",
