The\nnucleus was generated at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory\n(NSCL) through projectile fragmentation, utilizing a primary beam of 36Ar ions\ndirected at a 9Be target. Simultaneous measurements of proton emission and\ngamma rays were conducted using the GADGET detection system. The decay paths\nwere carefully analyzed through beta-gamma , proton-gamma , and gamma -gamma\ncoincidences, leading to the construction of a complete decay scheme for 23Al.\nThe absolute beta branching ratios were determined, and log-ft values were\ncalculated for transitions to 23Mg states. Additionally, proton branching\nratios and the most precise half-life measurement of 23Al to date were\nobtained. The findings include the identification of 19 new gamma rays and the\ndiscovery of a new beta-delayed proton transition populating the third excited\nstate of 22Na.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"02QnIdTYHQfo8E4fHawfEgwVSHLslMJgvFlyexlUliE","pdfSize":"4806173"}
