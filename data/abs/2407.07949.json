Our methodology improves upon previous analyses by\nusing a theoretical model based on cosmological simulations coupled with a\nperturbative description of the galaxy-matter connection and a phenomenological\nprescription of Fingers of God. This enables a very robust analysis down to\nmildly non-linear scales, $k\\sim 0.4\\,h\\,{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. We carried out a\nnumber of tests on mock data, different subsets of BOSS, and using model\nvariations, all of which support the robustness of our analysis. Our results\nprovide constraints on $\\sigma_8$, $\\Omega_m$, $h$, and $S_8 \\equiv \\sigma_8\n\\sqrt{\\Omega_{\\rm m}/0.3}$. Specifically, we measure $\\Omega_m=0.301\\pm 0.011$,\n$\\sigma_8=0.745^{+0.028}_{-0.035}$, $h=0.705\\pm 0.015$, and $ S_8 =\n0.747^{+0.032}_{-0.039}$ when all the nuisance parameters of our model are left\nfree. By adopting relationships among bias parameters measured in galaxy\nformation simulations, the value of $S_8$ remains consistent whereas\nuncertainties are reduced by $\\sim20\\%$. Our cosmological constraints are some\nof the strongest obtained with the BOSS power spectrum alone: they exhibit a\n$2.5-3.5\\sigma$ tension with the results of the {\\it Planck\\/} satellite,\nagreeing with the lower values of $S_8$ derived from gravitational lensing.\nHowever, the cosmological model preferred by {\\it Planck\\/} is still a good fit\nto the BOSS data, assuming small departures from physical bias priors and,\ntherefore, cannot be excluded at high significance. We conclude that, at the\npresent, the BOSS data alone does not show strong evidence for a tension\nbetween the predictions of $\\Lambda$CDM for the high- and low-redshift\nUniverse.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"J2WAnUI3HGNHFOs9xpBmhil27qHwAlkOaoddXu7OT-A","pdfSize":"3675688"}
