  "abstract": "  A brief introduction to universal algebra and the theory of topological\nalgebras, their varieties, and free topological algebras is presented. Free\ntopological Mal'tsev algebras are studied. Their properties, relationship with\ntopological groups and heaps, and the problem of direct limit decomposition are\nconsidered.\n",
