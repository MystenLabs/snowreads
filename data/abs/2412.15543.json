  "abstract": "  For a finite group $A$ with normal subgroup $G$, a subgroup $U$ of $G$ is an\n$A$-prime-power-covering subgroup if $U$ meets every $A$-conjugacy-class of\nelements of $G$ of prime power order. It is conjectured that $|G:U|$ is bounded\nby some function of $|A:G|$, and this conjecture has number theoretic\nimplications for relative Brauer groups of algebraic number fields. We prove\nthe conjecture in the case that the action of $G$ on the set of right cosets of\n$U$ in $G$ is innately transitive. This includes the case where $U$ is a\nmaximal subgroup of $G$. The proof uses a new bound on the order of a\nnonabelian finite simple group in terms of its number of classes of elements of\nprime power order, which in turn depends on the Classification of the Finite\nSimple Groups.\n",
