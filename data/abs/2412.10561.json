Due to the shallow depth of\nthis hot layer, the infrared emission and absorption spectra may deviate from\nthe black-body spectra and can be influenced by the vibrational structure of\nthe material. Real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT)\nmodeling of the thermal radiation by such hot layers allows us to calculate the\nemissivity and thus to evaluate the reliability of the measurements conducted\nwith thermal cameras at specific wavelengths.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7DcUfS6rxw9YLiPskGHJ37VuNKwkIav6KDMa9fr6uuM","pdfSize":"1076832"}
