Furthermore,\nwe assume that at a distant $\\rho$ there is a perturbation defined by the Kato\nmeasure. We show that, under certain conditions, the resolvent of the\nHamiltonian has the second sheet pole which reproduces the resonance at\n$z(\\rho)$ with the asymptotics $z(\\rho)=\\mathcal E_{\\beta ; n}+\\mathcal O\n\\Big(\\frac{ \\exp(-\\sqrt{2 |\\mathcal E_{\\beta ;n}| } \\rho )}{\\rho }\\Big)$ for\n$\\rho$ large and with the resonant energy $\\mathcal E_{\\beta ;n}$. Moreover, we\nshow that the imaginary component of $z(\\rho)$ satisfies Fermi's golden rule\nwhich we explicitly derive.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gkIlfVHvZAjZZ2bAEPNSobLcvnIH_93z7bT9bfFHqHc","pdfSize":"757564"}
