Our proof\nis inspired by [Shnirelman A., 1985], where it was obtained\n$\\alpha=\\frac{1}{64}$ in dimension $\\nu=2$, while here we get\n$\\alpha\\geq\\frac{2}{7}$. Moreover we prove that $\\alpha\\geq\\frac{1}{\\nu+1}$ for\nany dimension $\\nu\\geq 3$. We point out that, even if this does not improve the\nbound in the continuous version, where it was proved that\n$\\alpha\\geq\\frac{2}{4+\\nu}$, with $\\nu\\geq 3$, our bound is the best one\nachieved for the $2$-dimensional case. Our method uses an alternative approach\nbased on volume estimates of permutations, which count the number of maximum\ncubes that are moved by a permutation $P$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BWVf1OXGmlbybOVtoFKSjrADDSYfaOF54e5Qe5aZXvA","pdfSize":"613041","objectId":"0x45ad6aca545a368835acb203d0971ed9431def593dda50581d89c4fe2a1a4e69","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
