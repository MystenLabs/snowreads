If these\ntopics could be chosen, then the science maps could be tailored for different\nneeds. In this paper, we explore the use of document networks from diverse data\nsources as a tool to control the topic clustering bias of a science map. We\nanalyze this by evaluating the clustering effectiveness of several topic\ncategories over two traditional and six non-traditional data sources. We found\nthat the topics favored in each non-traditional data source are about: Health\nfor Facebook users, biotechnology for patent families, government and social\nissues for policy documents, food for Twitter conversations, nursing for\nTwitter users, and geographical entities for document authors (the favoring in\nthis latter source was particularly strong). Our results show that diverse data\nsources can be used to control topic bias, which opens up the possibility of\ncreating science maps tailored for different needs.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Digital Libraries"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CWPcRG6FbI3sxRRkb_4_tRBgPq67qmC0yra82QQlXQw","pdfSize":"830208"}
