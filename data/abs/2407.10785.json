For the first time, we provide a preliminary investigation with\nsimilar interpretability methods for medical imaging. Specifically, we analyze\nthe features from a ViT-Small encoder obtained from a pathology Foundation\nModel via application to two datasets: one dataset of pathology images, and one\ndataset of pathology images paired with spatial transcriptomics. We discover an\ninterpretable representation of cell and tissue morphology, along with gene\nexpression within the model embedding space. Our work paves the way for further\nexploration around interpretable feature dimensions and their utility for\nmedical and clinical applications.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"JK4nOt5ZmHp5Om8yu5lRHdp8lh9iEVFS394slUGWYwc","pdfSize":"5794825"}
