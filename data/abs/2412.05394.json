  "abstract": "  This paper presents a robust approach for object detection in aerial imagery\nusing the YOLOv5 model. We focus on identifying critical objects such as\nambulances, car crashes, police vehicles, tow trucks, fire engines, overturned\ncars, and vehicles on fire. By leveraging a custom dataset, we outline the\ncomplete pipeline from data collection and annotation to model training and\nevaluation. Our results demonstrate that YOLOv5 effectively balances speed and\naccuracy, making it suitable for real-time emergency response applications.\nThis work addresses key challenges in aerial imagery, including small object\ndetection and complex backgrounds, and provides insights for future research in\nautomated emergency response systems.\n",
