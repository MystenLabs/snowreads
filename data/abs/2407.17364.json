To fully grasp this approach, a\nbasic cryptographic context is provided, necessary for understanding\nReed-Solomon codes. The study begins by defining a code and explores key\noutcomes for codes with additional properties, such as linearity. The\ntheoretical framework is further developed with specific definitions and\nexamples of Reed-Solomon codes, presented as a particular variant of BCH codes.\nAdditionally, the structure of QR codes is analyzed, encompassing different\nversions and how data is represented in the form of black and white pixels\nwithin an image. Finally, an inherent vulnerability of Reed-Solomon Codes, and\nparticularly of QR codes, related to selective manipulation of modules is\nexamined. This vulnerability leverages the error correction mechanisms present\nin Reed-Solomon codes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"tL6YwP9ij54bbS_47tmJq_0wScikeob1KFtyeENfteE","pdfSize":"728903","objectId":"0x99c27d496363df41a5111af3e55048ab545560149b372afa998ca13f168af8ec","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
