We achieve this by employing a\nsimilarity transformation that maps the non-Hermitian quantum system to a\nscaled harmonics oscillator. To this end, we consider the unconstrained reduced\nHamiltonian which is directly expressed in terms of the Schwarzschild mass and\nimplies a periodic character for the conjugate momentum (which represents the\nasymptotic time coordinate), the period being the inverse Hawking temperature.\nThis leads to the quantization of the event-horizon area in terms of the\nharmonic oscillator levels. Next, in the framework of the Swanson oscillator\nmodel, we proceed to derive novel expressions for the corresponding Hawking\ntemperature and black hole entropy.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"kzlq_1n4jEuicmW1N8vrECyicp-kwaSyrXi7cTetuec","pdfSize":"182620","objectId":"0x8d0f1f9330e3f0b6664dc133ab546c520d4bbaf2817ed45bd88a6deb85322228","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
