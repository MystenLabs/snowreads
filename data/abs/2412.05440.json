After a brief summary of\nthe diquark concept I review various general reasons why the $Qq$ diquark (with\nsufficinetly heavy $Q$) does not exist. Then I argue (this is the focus of my\ntalk) that the most direct way to confirm non-existence of the $Qq$ diquarks is\nthe study of pre-asymptotic corrections in the inclusive decays of $Qqq$\nbaryons, e.g. $\\Lambda_b$. Since the $c$ quarks are much lighter than $b$,\nnamely, $m_b^2/m_c^2\\sim 11$, traces of the $cq$ attraction in the color\nanti-triplet spin-0 state may or may not be present in the $cqq$ baryons.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"S92_BHglh3xIGMDwVwDpt5St4xdDnc-2xNta87zC868","pdfSize":"2252078"}
