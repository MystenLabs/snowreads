Most\nrecently, foundation models are being explored for their potential as post hoc\nexplainers, providing a pathway to elucidate the decision-making mechanisms of\npredictive models. In this work, we introduce traceable question-answering,\nleveraging an external knowledge repository to inform the responses of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to user queries within a scene understanding task. This\nknowledge repository comprises contextual details regarding the model's output,\ncontaining high-level features, feature importance, and alternative\nprobabilities. We employ subtractive counterfactual reasoning to compute\nfeature importance, a method that entails analysing output variations resulting\nfrom decomposing semantic features. Furthermore, to maintain a seamless\nconversational flow, we integrate four key characteristics - social, causal,\nselective, and contrastive - drawn from social science research on human\nexplanations into a single-shot prompt, guiding the response generation\nprocess. Our evaluation demonstrates that explanations generated by the LLMs\nencompassed these elements, indicating its potential to bridge the gap between\ncomplex model outputs and natural language expressions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Pg57FmBF0iCN-D9-eWyA6f68PJcUOknk1BNlG1lfzv8","pdfSize":"1170835"}
