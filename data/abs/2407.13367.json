This is achieved under the conditions that the\noperator associated with the problem is Lipschitz continuous and strongly\nmonotone. The proposed algorithm is based on the interaction between the\nresolvent operator and the reflected resolvent operator.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1TgQ_ApH_OvfCELy3THVW_Bsil380zP7aEamaNvCboo","pdfSize":"182658"}
