We show that the coframe of sublocales coincides with the\ncollection of all sublocales remote from the Booleanization. Furthermore, the\nsupplement of the Booleanization of any locale is the largest sublocale *remote\nfrom the Booleanization. We give conditions on localic maps such that their\ninduced localic image and pre-image functions preserve sublocales that are\nremote (resp. *remote) from dense sublocales. We introduce new types of localic\nmaps called f-remote preserving maps.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"dr04fJ9QDh0PzX_0Q8oopJcrhBeXSOVx3gzka1CLNIM","pdfSize":"239762"}
