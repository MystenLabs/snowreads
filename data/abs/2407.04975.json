We impose the boundary condition that the electromagnetic fields\nare to vanish at infinity. A full set of solutions is obtained, describing\naxially symmetric magnetic fields, supplemented by axial electric fields in the\ncase of non-vanishing rotation of the gravitational background. We study the\nmotion of charged test particles in these combined gravitational and\nelectromagnetic fields, in particular considering the conditions for circular\nequatorial orbits. Such orbits always exist in odd-multipole magnetic fields,\nand they can exist for particular radii in a combination of two or more\neven-multipole magnetic fields. Combinations of several odd-multipole fields\ncan give rise to radial variation in the field orientation and the direction of\nmotion of charged particles. Deviations from circularity are described using a\nperturbative approach. This also allows to study the stability of the parent\ncircular orbits.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"ibfMCpcCxe24ZD36Z54McM8A1AAnvNVhZjVIbDXg4NM","pdfSize":"1181503"}
