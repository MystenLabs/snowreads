Such agents have already demonstrated their potential in\nsolving complex tasks in different domains. And they can further increase their\nperformance when collaborating with other agents in a multi-agent system.\nHowever, the orchestration and coordination of these agents is still\nchallenging, especially when they need to interact with humans as part of\nhuman-agentic collaborative workflows. These kinds of workflows need to be\nprecisely specified so that it is clear whose responsible for each task, what\nstrategies agents can follow to complete individual tasks or how decisions will\nbe taken when different alternatives are proposed, among others. Current\nbusiness process modeling languages fall short when it comes to specifying\nthese new mixed collaborative scenarios. In this exploratory paper, we extend a\nwell-known process modeling language (i.e., BPMN) to enable the definition of\nthis new type of workflow. Our extension covers both the formalization of the\nnew metamodeling concepts required and the proposal of a BPMN-like graphical\nnotation to facilitate the definition of these workflows. Our extension has\nbeen implemented and is available as an open-source human-agentic workflow\nmodeling editor on GitHub.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"8l9slQpMwg_yySMrxbjH_LOx6tvtVGT2z_5ZRO4qT5g","pdfSize":"1291852"}
