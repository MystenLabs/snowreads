In this paper, we introduce a\ncohomological formulation of a mod $n$ triple symbol for characters over a\nnumber field containing a primitive $n$-th root of unity. Our definition is\nmotivated by the arithmetic Chern--Simons theory and in this respect it differs\nfrom earlier approaches to triple symbols. We show that our symbol agrees with\nthat of R\\'edei when $n=2$ and of Amano--Mizusawa--Morishita when $n=3$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Po9VugEJ_cNcb2D-AzKdn_URlwPA_4pHLHgpbW6eyoY","pdfSize":"376716"}
