For any\n$f\\in C(\\mathbb{T}^m)$ we set \\[ Z_R(f):=\\sum_{\\nabla F_R(\\vec{\\theta})=0}\nf(\\vec{\\theta}) \\] We prove that if the support of $f$ is contained in a\ngeodesic ball of $\\mathbb{T}^m$, then the variance of $Z_R(f)$ is asymptotic to\n$const\\times R^{m}$ as $R\\to\\infty$. We use this to prove that if $m\\geq 2$,\nthen as $N\\to\\infty$ the random measures $N^{-m}Z_N(-)$ converge a.s. to an\nexplicit multiple of the volume measure on the flat torus.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wsDdbdQo-aBScvJQWYvFCMPIwDNVtTITbpMyF4ugEbk","pdfSize":"361032"}
