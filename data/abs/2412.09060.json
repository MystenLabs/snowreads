Efficient discriminating and sorting the two kinds\nof momentum lies at the heart of further application. Here, we propose a\nparabola-like lens that can transform the orbital angular momentum and the\nradial momentum into different positions in the parabolas. We experimentally\ncharacterize the performance of our implementation by separating individual\nangular and radial momentum as well as the multiple superposition states. The\nreported scheme can achieve two kinds of transverse momentum identification and\nthus provide a possible way to complete the characterization of the full\ntransverse momentum of an optical field. The proposed device can readily be\nused in multiplexing and demultiplexing of optical information, and in\nprinciple, achieve unit efficiency, and thus can be suitable for applications\nthat involve quantum states of light.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vnZJjbRln8Udf33EVMuBOMNJPt7C_XEIvHsICi_qRs0","pdfSize":"3810936"}
