A $h$-order invariant of $G$\nbased on the path sequence is defined from a set of real numbers\n${f(x_{0},x_{1},\\cdots,x_{h})}$ as\n$^{h}I_f(G)=\\sum\\limits_{v_{0}v_{1}v_{2}\\cdots\nv_{h}}f\\left(d_{0},d_{1},\\cdots,d_{h}\\right)$, where the sum runs over all\npaths $v_{0}v_{1}v_{2}\\cdots v_{h}$ of length $h$ and $d_{i}$ is the degree of\nvertex $v_i$ in $G$. In this paper, we first show that the $h$-order invariant\nof a starlike tree $S_{n}$ can be determined completely by its branches whose\nlength does not exceed $h$. And then we find conditions on the function $f$ for\nsome graph families $\\mathcal{G}$ such that any graph $G\\in\\mathcal{G}$ can be\ndetermined by the higher order invariants $^{h}I_f(G)$ for $0\\leqslant\nh\\leqslant \\rho$, where $\\rho$ is the length of a longest path in $G$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"g2RPf7W_omnf6P-imQQP3Sz4mGH6E-h-r4SzSQqCJvg","pdfSize":"217973"}
