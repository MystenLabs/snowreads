Through\nsemi-structured interviews with professional composers, we gathered insights on\na novel generative model for creating variations, highlighting concerns around\ntrust, transparency, and ethical design. The findings helped form a feedback\nloop, guiding improvements to the model that emphasised traceability,\ntransparency and explainability. They also revealed new areas for innovation,\nincluding novel features for controllability and research questions on the\nethical and practical implementation of GenAI models.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Sound","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction","Computer Science/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5nbw9ncwh5d1CiVVQvpL5OlHn53GpJbUDdeN2iObG28","pdfSize":"165188"}
