  "abstract": "  We extend the catalogue of \"phenomenologically preferred\" hadronic axion\nmodels to include heavy fermion representations associated with\nhigher-dimensional decay operators. The latter have recently been shown to\nself-consistently trigger a period of early matter domination, making the\nunderlying axion models cosmologically viable. After identifying all possible\nrepresentations up to decay operator dimension $d \\leq 9$, we update the\nhadronic axion band for the axion-photon coupling. The central regions of the\naxion band for axion masses viable in standard cosmology are similar to those\nfound previously and approximately independent of the axion decay constant\n$f_a$. However, with our adopted assumptions, $d = 6$ and $d = 7$ operators\nlead to two new viable \"model islands\" around $f_a \\sim 10^{12}$ GeV and $f_a\n\\sim 10^{14}$ GeV, i.e., beyond the standard post-inflationary mass region.\n",
