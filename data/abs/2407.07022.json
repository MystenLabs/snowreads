The presence of the strong e-e interaction\nconstrains each atomic site to be either empty or singly occupied. One can\ntreat this scenario by fractionalizing the electrons into spin and charge\ndegrees of freedom. We use the coherent state symbols associated with the\nlowest irreducible representation of the $su(2|1)$ superalgebra spanned by the\nHubbard operators to solve the proposed models, as they implicitly take into\naccount both the single particle occupation constraint and the\nfractionalization of the electrons. Our two example display the emergence of\ntopological superconductivity in an 1D nanowire with extended $s$-wave\nsuperconductivity, and in a 2D square lattice with $p$-wave superconductivity.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dbny6PCv3gI_1ziruWXbr4mD4CMOWPo1XxnOQ29CKvc","pdfSize":"400072"}
