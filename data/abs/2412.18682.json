Studies have\nexplored maximizing this effect, leading to softly-clamped resonator designs.\nThis paper proposes a topology optimization methodology to design\ntwo-dimensional nanomechanical resonators with high $Q$ factors by maximizing\ndissipation dilution. A formulation based on the ratio of geometrically\nnonlinear to linear modal stiffnesses of a prestressed finite element model is\nused, with its corresponding adjoint sensitivity analysis formulation.\nSystematic design in square domains yields geometries with comparable $Q$\nfactors to literature. We analyze the trade-offs between resonance frequency\nand quality factor, and how these are reflected in the geometry of resonators.\nWe further apply the methodology to optimize a resonator on a full hexagonal\ndomain. By using the entire mesh -- i.e., without assuming any symmetries -- we\nfind that the optimizer converges to a two-axis symmetric design comprised of\nfour tethers.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Computer Science/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"efin2zEOytapyzqESza2JPm1-_1VwcjN9snDq2BPXWM","pdfSize":"23448939"}
