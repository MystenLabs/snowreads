To identify the target\nposition, a guidestar is required that typically emits a frequency-shifted\nsignal. Here we present a noninvasive matrix approach operating at a single\nfrequency only, based on the variation of the field scattered by a nonlinear\ntarget illuminated at two incident powers. The local perturbation induced by\nthe nonlinearity serves as a guide for identifying optimal incident wavefronts.\nWe demonstrate maximal focusing on electronic devices embedded in chaotic\nmicrowave cavities and extend our approach to temporal signals. Finally, we\nexploit the programmability offered by reconfigurable smart surfaces to enhance\nthe intensity delivered to a nonlinear target. Our results pave the way for\ndeep imaging protocols that use any type of nonlinearity as feedback, requiring\nonly the measurement of a monochromatic scattering matrix.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9mz0FM5Y4-S56oUSdtOfajTdrnihyYUkEx8Qwa3f8kQ","pdfSize":"9945864"}
