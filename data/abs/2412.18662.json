Using the\nKramers-Kronig relations in connection to accurate experimental measurements of\nthe amplitude of the terahertz electric field, we show how the correct phase of\nthe same field can be retrieved, even in the case of partly misaligned\nmeasurements. Our technique allows to accurately estimate the optical\nproperties of in principle any material that reflects terahertz radiation. We\ndemonstrate the accuracy of our approach by extracting the complex refractive\nindex of InSb, a material with a strong plasma resonance in the low-terahertz\nrange. Our technique applies to arbitrary incidence angles and polarization\nstates.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hx1HtW4ahK8Q3DLA40joLMzXM7aErgGsudF6A1woiYQ","pdfSize":"1549688"}
