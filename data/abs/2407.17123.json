We show that the quantum operator\nassociated with a $\\log u$ late-time behavior for the asymptotic gravitational\nshear forms a logarithmic CFT pair of conformal dimension $\\Delta=1$ with an\nIR-regulated supertranslation Goldstone current. We discuss this result in\nconnection with previous encounters of log CFT structures in the IR-finite part\nof celestial OPEs.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-mssBdN99ALRlJrzDDu-GE6-PRWED5f9rjk6vVCqfSA","pdfSize":"445749"}
