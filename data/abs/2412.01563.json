  "abstract": "  Exponential small splitting of separatrices in the singular perturbation\ntheory leads generally to nonvanishing oscillations near a saddle--center point\nand to nonexistence of a true homoclinic orbit. It was conjectured long ago\nthat the oscillations may vanish at a countable set of small parameter values\nif there exist a quadruplet of singularities in the complex analytic extension\nof the limiting homoclinic orbit. The present paper gives a rigorous proof of\nthis conjecture for a particular fourth-order equation relevant to the\ntraveling wave reduction of the modified Korteweg--de Vries equation with the\nfifth-order dispersion term.\n",
