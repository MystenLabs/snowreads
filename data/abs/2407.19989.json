The method is structured into three stages.\nIn the first stage, a variational auto-encoder is trained to extract latent\nrepresentations of acoustic impulse responses represented as mel-spectrograms.\nIn the second stage, a separate speech encoder is trained to estimate\nlow-dimensional representations from short segments of reverberant speech.\nFinally, the pre-trained speech encoder is combined with a small regression\nmodel and evaluated on two parameter regression tasks. Experimentally, the\nproposed method is shown to outperform a fully end-to-end trained baseline\nmodel.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"O7HW1WzF-SOsnpp7XTUx-OooCXqBRN3J8x54g_AG6qA","pdfSize":"579515"}
