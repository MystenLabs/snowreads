  "abstract": "  We have studied irreducible real (respectively, quaternionic) Lie algebroid\nconnections and prove that the Gauge theoretic moduli space has Hausdorff\nHilbert manifold structure. This work generalises some known results about\nsimple semi-connections for complex vector bundle on compact complex manifold\nin real algebraic geometry.\n",
