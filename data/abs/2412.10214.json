  "abstract": "  We introduce some classes of increasing labeled and multilabeled trees, and\nwe show that these trees provide combinatorial interpretations for certain\nThron-type continued fractions with coefficients that are quasi-affine of\nperiod 2. Our proofs are based on bijections from trees to labeled Motzkin or\nSchr\\\"oder paths; these bijections extend the well-known bijection of\nFran\\c{c}on--Viennot (1979) interpreted in terms of increasing binary trees.\nThis work can also be viewed as a sequel to the recent work of Elvey Price and\nSokal (2020), where they provide combinatorial interpretations for Thron-type\ncontinued fractions with coefficients that are affine. Towards the end of the\npaper, we conjecture an equidistribution of vincular patterns on permutations.\n",
