Although prior work\nhave approached answering this question, their assessment methods do not\ndirectly translate to how these models are used in practical vision-language\ntasks. In this paper, we propose a direct assessment method, inspired by linear\nprobing, to assess vision-language alignment. We identify that the degree of\nalignment of the SSL vision models depends on their SSL training objective, and\nwe find that the clustering quality of SSL representations has a stronger\nimpact on alignment performance than their linear separability. Next, we\nintroduce Swift Alignment of Image and Language (SAIL), a efficient transfer\nlearning framework that aligns pretrained unimodal vision and language models\nfor downstream vision-language tasks. Since SAIL leverages the strengths of\npretrained unimodal models, it requires significantly fewer (6%) paired\nimage-text data for the multimodal alignment compared to models like CLIP which\nare trained from scratch. SAIL training only requires a single A100 GPU, 5\nhours of training and can accommodate a batch size up to 32,768. SAIL achieves\n73.4% zero-shot accuracy on ImageNet (vs. CLIP's 72.7%) and excels in zero-shot\nretrieval, complex reasoning, and semantic segmentation. Additionally, SAIL\nimproves the language-compatibility of vision encoders that in turn enhance the\nperformance of multimodal large language models.
