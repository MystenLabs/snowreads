This study addresses the need for efficient and\nobjective evaluation methods by introducing ZEAL (surgical skill assessment\nwith Zero-shot surgical tool segmentation with a unifiEd foundAtion modeL).\nZEAL uses segmentation masks of surgical instruments obtained through a unified\nfoundation model for proficiency assessment. Through zero-shot inference with\ntext prompts, ZEAL predicts segmentation masks, capturing essential features of\nboth instruments and surroundings. Utilizing sparse convolutional neural\nnetworks and segmentation masks, ZEAL extracts feature vectors for foreground\n(instruments) and background. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks encode\ntemporal dynamics, modeling sequential data and dependencies in surgical\nvideos. Combining LSTM-encoded vectors, ZEAL produces a surgical skill score,\noffering an objective measure of proficiency. Comparative analysis with\nconventional methods using open datasets demonstrates ZEAL's superiority,\naffirming its potential in advancing surgical training and evaluation. This\ninnovative approach to surgical skill assessment addresses challenges in\ntraditional supervised learning techniques, paving the way for enhanced\nsurgical care quality and patient outcomes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"5jyodwE_jThKV4ondRydvMJCU4FRzerE19m9L2oUNiI","pdfSize":"526027"}
