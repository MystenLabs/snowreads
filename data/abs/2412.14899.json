In contrast,\nsimple parallel grippers, though affordable, are restricted to basic tasks like\npick-and-place. Recently, a vibration-based mechanism was proposed to augment\nparallel grippers and enable in-hand manipulation capabilities for thin\nobjects. By utilizing the stick-slip phenomenon, a simple controller was able\nto drive a grasped object to a desired position. However, due to the\nunderactuated nature of the mechanism, direct control of the object's\norientation was not possible. In this letter, we address the challenge of\nmanipulating the entire state of the object. Hence, we present the excitation\nof a cyclic phenomenon where the object's center-of-mass rotates in a constant\nradius about the grasping point. With this cyclic motion, we propose an\nalgorithm for manipulating the object to desired states. In addition to a full\nanalytical analysis of the cyclic phenomenon, we propose the use of duty cycle\nmodulation in operating the vibration actuator to provide more accurate\nmanipulation. Finite element analysis, experiments and task demonstrations\nvalidate the proposed algorithm.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uOpdCrztbTMOiYn0_w8G8MO53hX1-gVdN7OdEQp2bZU","pdfSize":"4813304"}
