We define a\ngeneralized version of aging functions called specific interval-average\ngeometric hazard rate, specific interval-average harmonic hazard rate. We focus\non some characterization results and their inter-relationships among the\nresulting non-parametric classes of distributions. Monotonic nature of so\ndefined aging classes are exhibited by some well known probability\ndistributions. Probabilistic orders based on these functions are taken up for\nfurther study. The work is illustrated through case studies and a simulated\ndata having applications in reliability/survival analysis.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5ucNvcvxsEbHwrfi3ggnmn9ACvVK7sEyFOUMx9Gi30s","pdfSize":"870166"}
