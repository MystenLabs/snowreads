Within an\nadiabatic approximation for the dynamics of the localized spins, and in the\npresence of a phenomenological damping term, we demonstrate the occurrence of\nvarious dynamical regimes: At small bias a rigidly rotating non-coplanar\nmagnetic structure is realized which, by increasing the applied voltage,\ntransitions to a quasi-periodic and, finally, fully chaotic evolution. These\nphases can be identified by transport measurements. In particular, the rigidly\nrotating state results in an average transfer of spin polarization. We analyze\nin detail the dependence of the rotation axis and frequency on system's\nparameters and show that the spin dynamics slows down in the thermodynamic\nlimit, when a static conical state persists to arbitrarily long times. Our\nresults suggest the possibility of discovering non-trivial dynamics in other\nsymmetry-broken quantum states under bias.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9wy4b0EKCKra21Dv15YrPxsmRFeuF88-LdP-eAdtJr8","pdfSize":"17831480"}
