In this work,\nwe show that in the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) approach to\nstrongly-correlated systems, it can actually be harnessed to our advantage.\nIndeed, DMFT maps a lattice model onto an impurity model, namely a finite\nsystem coupled to a dissipative bath. While standard approaches require a large\nnumber of high-quality qubits in a unitary context, we propose a circuit that\nharvests amplitude damping to reproduce the dynamics of this model with a blend\nof noisy and noiseless qubits. We find compelling advantages with this\napproach: a substantial reduction in the number of qubits, the ability to reach\nlonger time dynamics, and no need for ground state search and preparation. This\nmethod would naturally fit in a partial quantum error correction framework.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Fa8QlBTXFnobqi6gfxnXi7tO-trb_u_QMkec3vb-8OI","pdfSize":"1103815"}
