This paper introduces linear subdivision rules\ntailored to handle noisy data. A key innovation lies in determining the rule\ncoefficients by solving an optimization problem aimed at minimizing the noise\nvariance. The study addresses the general case, allowing for noise correlation\namong data with a non-uniform distribution. In fact, we show that the\nsubdivision rules, proposed in [S. L\\'opez-Ure\\~na and D. F. Y\\'a\\~nez, J. Sci.\nComput., 100(1) (2024)], are optimal for uncorrelated noise with non-uniform\nvariance. Numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness\nof these optimal rules compared to other subdivision rules designed for noisy\ndata.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wTwXSekr1PSQy6nka1OyB3jO84fA8S-bTgKcXtMGlgs","pdfSize":"221361"}
