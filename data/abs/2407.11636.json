We first show that a\ngeneral Abelian T-duality commutes with the $T \\overline{T}$ deformation, which\ncan be engineered by a gravitational dressing. Then, by using an auxiliary\nfield formulation of stress tensor deformations of the principal chiral model\n(PCM), we prove that non-Abelian T-duality and arbitrary $T \\overline{T}$-like\nflows also commute for theories in this class. We argue that all such auxiliary\nfield deformations of both the PCM and its T-dual are classically integrable.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"P3mi11zpUHYZLEMM1wHE59onKxSxugzOYv_scLB5dX4","pdfSize":"240600","objectId":"0x20c6bae6c1826605ff93b5e619ba8282c19b70cff3d5c08b368fd7c23d660fdd","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
