The small\ncurvature expansion of this correlator, defined via a Borel transform, is given\nby the flat space Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude plus AdS curvature corrections. We\nfix curvature corrections by demanding that their resonances are consistent\nwith the superconformal block expansion of the correlator and with a worldsheet\nansatz in terms of single-valued multiple polylogarithms. The first correction\nis fully fixed in this way, and matches independent results from integrability,\nas well as the $R^4$ correction at finite AdS curvature that was previously\nfixed using supersymmetric localization. We are also able to fix the second\ncurvature correction by using a few additional assumptions, and find that it\nalso satisfies various non-trivial consistency checks. We use our results to\nfix the tree level $D^4R^4$ correction at finite AdS curvature, and to give\nmany predictions for future integrability studies.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_XQP3FNq7B26x3h1eJIvSsM2rVJ1MmgYgGTYHaUJWrg","pdfSize":"665744"}
