Here\nwe numerically study the amount of tripartite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)\nstates that can be extracted from the state generated by random Clifford\ncircuits with probabilistic single-qubit projective measurements. We find a\nGHZ-entangled phase where this amount is finite and a GHZ-trivial phase where\nno tripartite entanglement is available. The transition between them is either\nmeasurement-induced, at $p_c\\approx 0.16$, or partition-induced when a party\ncontains more than half of the qubits. We find that the GHZ entanglement can be\nenhanced by measurements in certain regimes, which could be understood from the\nperspective of quantum Internet. Effects of the measurements to the growth of\nGHZ entanglement are also studied.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5DAgu0UHJGoVuR6nW2odjZUa76snI3JXVSjLaakV9xw","pdfSize":"4336931"}
