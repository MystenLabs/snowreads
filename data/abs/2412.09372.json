In the few-body limit the\nlocalization of the bosons around the impurity, as seen in the pair\ncorrelations, is accompanied by low-lying modes that resemble finite-size\nprecursors of Higgs-Anderson and Nambu-Goldstone-like modes. Tuning the\nimpurity-boson mass ratio allows for the exploration of the transition from a\nspontaneous to an explicit breaking of the continuous rotational symmetry of\nthe Hamiltonian. We compare the minimum of the Higgs-Anderson-like mode as a\nmarker of the onset of localization in the few-body limit to mean-field\npredictions of binding. We find improved agreement between the few-body exact\ndiagonalization results and mean-field predictions of binding with increasing\nboson-boson repulsion.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8bVaICuTL7Z7xtxAWkxuwFA4eoo5q2sE_R74rKq0GgE","pdfSize":"1456308"}
