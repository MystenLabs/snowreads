It is showed in this paper that the algebra\nof nonpositive integer points also has a Hopf algebra structure for the\nextended shuffle product. By characterizing the coproducts in the Hopf algebras\nof positive integer points and nonpositive integer points, we prove that the\nRiemann dual maps gives duality between the Hopf algebras of positive integer\npoints and nonpositive integer points.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"Tp8yBstor60m9MOy5fyCFBib8-MpTFH9yG-V9jVSg1Y","pdfSize":"276489"}
