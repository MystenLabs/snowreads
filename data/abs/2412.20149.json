  "abstract": "  We propose a quantum optimal control framework based on the Pontryagin\nMaximum Principle to design energy- and time-efficient pulses for open quantum\nsystems. By formulating the Langevin equation of a dissipative LC circuit as a\nlinear control problem, we derive optimized pulses with exponential scaling in\nenergy cost, outperforming conventional shortcut-to-adiabaticity methods such\nas counter-diabatic driving. When applied to a resonator dispersively coupled\nto a qubit, these optimized pulses achieve an excellent signal-to-noise ratio\ncomparable to longitudinal coupling schemes across varying critical photon\nnumbers. Our results provide a significant step toward efficient control in\ndissipative open systems and improved qubit readout in circuit quantum\nelectrodynamics.\n",
