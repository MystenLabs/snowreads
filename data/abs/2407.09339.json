In this work, we aim to accurately calculate the IMBH\nTDE rates based on their black hole masses and the stellar profiles of their\nhost galaxies obtained from the latest observations. We find that IMBH TDEs\nfrom the center of small galaxies have an overall rate comparable to SMBH TDEs,\nwhile off-nuclei IMBH TDEs from globular clusters have a much lower rate. Very\ninterestingly, we show that the rate of IMBH TDE per galaxy generally increases\nwith the black hole mass, which is opposite to the trend seen in SMBH TDEs.\nFurthermore, we report that IMBH TDEs typically occur in the pinhole regime,\nwhich means that deeply plunging events are more likely for IMBH TDEs compared\nto SMBH TDEs. We also calculate the volumetric TDE rates for IMBH and SMBH TDEs\nand compare with observed rates.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JKHqT6gbQXYdzcJpUsJGNQWJeruSOxCGMQUYQFqxms0","pdfSize":"2145901","objectId":"0x0310766bfb5607ab83b11b5b064eee6f909294c722362dcb201f43821b67cfe0","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
