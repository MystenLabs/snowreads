  "abstract": "  Techniques that enhance inference through increased computation at test-time\nhave recently gained attention. In this survey, we investigate the current\nstate of LLM Inference-Time Self-Improvement from three different perspectives:\nIndependent Self-improvement, focusing on enhancements via decoding or sampling\nmethods; Context-Aware Self-Improvement, leveraging additional context or\ndatastore; and Model-Aided Self-Improvement, achieving improvement through\nmodel collaboration. We provide a comprehensive review of recent relevant\nstudies, contribute an in-depth taxonomy, and discuss challenges and\nlimitations, offering insights for future research.\n",
