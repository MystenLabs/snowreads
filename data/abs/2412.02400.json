  "abstract": "  Urban blight is a problem of high interest for planning and policy making.\nResearchers frequently propose theories about the relationships between urban\nblight indicators, focusing on relationships reflecting causality. In this\npaper, we improve on the integration of domain knowledge in the analysis of\nurban blight by introducing four rules for effective modeling of causal domain\nknowledge. The findings of this study reveal significant deviation from causal\nmodeling guidelines by investigating cognitive maps developed for urban blight\nanalysis. These findings provide valuable insights that will inform future work\non urban blight, ultimately enhancing our understanding of urban blight complex\ninteractions.\n",
