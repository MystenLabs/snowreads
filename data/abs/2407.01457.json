We focus on the acoustic frequency much lower\nthan the Dirac gap such that the interband transition is suppressed and these\neffects arise solely from the intrinsic valley-contrasting band topology. The\ncorresponding acoustoelectric conductivity and magnetoacoustic susceptibility\nare both proportional to the quantized valley Chern number and independent of\nthe quasiparticle lifetime. The linear and nonlinear components of the\nlongitudinal and transverse topological currents can be tuned by adjusting the\npolarization and propagation directions of the surface acoustic wave. The\nstatic magnetization generated by a circularly polarized acoustic wave scales\nlinearly with the acoustic frequency as well as the strain-induced charge\ndensity. Our results unveil a quantized nonlinear topological acoustoelectric\nresponse of gapped Dirac materials, like hBN and transition-metal\ndichalcogenide, paving the way toward room-temperature acoustoelectric devices\ndue to their large band gaps.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HWdkrFbwSeL8GJDWxRGNLq1HKarXnI_Dswb5zSB8iY4","pdfSize":"13239321"}
