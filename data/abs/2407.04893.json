However, qudits are more susceptible to decoherence than\nqubits due to increased loss channels, noise sensitivity, and crosstalk. To\naddress these challenges, we develop protocols for dynamical decoupling (DD) of\nqudit systems based on the Heisenberg-Weyl group. We implement and\nexperimentally verify these DD protocols on a superconducting transmon\nprocessor that supports qudit operation based on qutrits $(d=3)$ and ququarts\n$(d=4)$. Specifically, we demonstrate single-qudit DD sequences to decouple\nqutrits and ququarts from system-bath-induced decoherence. We also introduce\ntwo-qudit DD sequences designed to suppress the detrimental cross-Kerr\ncouplings between coupled qudits. This allows us to demonstrate a significant\nimprovement in the fidelity of time-evolved qutrit Bell states. Our results\nhighlight the utility of leveraging DD to enable scalable qudit-based quantum\ncomputing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3yWXLf4lJBRYZn2ujUENLaLsOQDnSVFsyZHnF4Jksio","pdfSize":"1953640"}
