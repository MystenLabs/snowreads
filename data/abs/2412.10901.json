  "abstract": "  In this paper we present a method for constructing directed strongly regular\ngraphs with assumed action of an automorphism group. The application of this\nmethod leads to first examples of directed strongly regular graphs with\nparameters $(22,9,6,3,4)$. We have shown that an automorphism of prime order\nacting on such a graph can only be of order two or three. Furthermore, we have\nconstructed $472$ directed strongly regular graphs with parameters\n$(22,9,6,3,4)$ and classified all these graphs with an automorphism of order\nthree.\n",
