Detecting vulnerabilities early\nin the software development process has demonstrated numerous benefits.\nConsequently, the scientific community started using machine learning for\nautomated detection of source code vulnerabilities. This work explores and\nrefines the CVEFixes dataset, which is commonly used to train models for\ncode-related tasks, specifically the C/C++ subset. To this purpose, the Source\nCode Processing Engine (SCoPE), a framework composed of strategized techniques\nthat can be used to reduce the size and normalize C/C++ functions is presented.\nThe output generated by SCoPE was used to create a new version of CVEFixes.\nThis refined dataset was then employed in a feature representation analysis to\nassess the effectiveness of the tool's code processing techniques, consisting\nof fine-tuning three pre-trained LLMs for software vulnerability detection. The\nresults show that SCoPE successfully helped to identify 905 duplicates within\nthe evaluated subset. The LLM results corroborate with the literature regarding\ntheir suitability for software vulnerability detection, with the best model\nachieving 53% F1-score.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fO0K9AFwkypx3MZAzE05GF9FLRI5Xhi34sPsAwoqNYs","pdfSize":"350715"}
