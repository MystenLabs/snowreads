While there exist some systematic reviews\naiming to consolidate the state of the art in machine ethics prior to 2020,\nthese tend to not include work that uses reinforcement learning agents as\nentities whose ethical behaviour is to be achieved. The reason for this is that\nonly in the last years we have witnessed an increase in machine ethics studies\nwithin reinforcement learning. We present here a systematic review of\nreinforcement learning for machine ethics and machine ethics within\nreinforcement learning. Additionally, we highlight trends in terms of ethics\nspecifications, components and frameworks of reinforcement learning, and\nenvironments used to result in ethical behaviour. Our systematic review aims to\nconsolidate the work in machine ethics and reinforcement learning thus\ncompleting the gap in the state of the art machine ethics landscape\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BbR5kxJNQ2u1PIsPCWUy9I1j8I0s0GZvFu05HMDTGWs","pdfSize":"299860"}
