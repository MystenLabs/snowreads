We forward-model the 21-cm forest signal using\nsemi-numerical simulations and incorporate various instrumental features to\nexplore the potential of detecting the 21-cm forest at $z=6$, both directly and\nstatistically, with the currently available (uGMRT) and forthcoming (SKA1-low)\nobservatories. We show that it is possible to detect the 1D power spectrum of\nthe 21-cm forest spectrum, especially at large scales of $k\\lesssim8.5\\,\\rm\nMHz^{-1}$ with the $500\\,\\rm hr$ of the uGMRT time and $k\\lesssim32.4\\,\\rm\nMHz^{-1}$ with the SKA1-low over $50\\,\\rm hr$ if the intergalactic medium (IGM)\nis $25\\%$ neutral and these neutral hydrogen regions have a spin temperature of\n$\\lesssim30\\,\\rm K$. On the other hand, we infer that a null-detection of the\nsignal with such observations of 10 radio-loud sources at $z\\approx6$ can be\ntranslated into constraints on the thermal and ionization state of the IGM\nwhich are tighter than the currently available measurements. Moreover, a\nnull-detection of the 1D 21-cm forest power spectrum with only $50\\,\\rm hr$ of\nthe uGMRT observations of 10 radio-loud sources can already be competitive with\nthe Ly$\\alpha$ forest and 21-cm tomographic observations in disfavouring models\nof significantly neutral and cold IGM at $z=6$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"V1J1ykjDyXJOUvWeSvX0d1WSBrdTgCtSQkHIAPidgso","pdfSize":"1885910"}
