  "abstract": "  We explore the potential for extracting the longitudinal proton structure\nfunction $F_{L}$ at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) through a Rosenbluth\nseparation method. The impacts of differing assumptions on sample sizes,\nsystematic uncertainties and beam energy scenarios are investigated. With a\nsufficiently large number of centre of mass energy configurations and\nwell-controlled systematics, the EIC will measure $F_{L}$ to an unprecedented\nprecision, even with relatively modest luminosities. The accessible kinematic\nrange complements both fixed target and HERA data. In the most optimistic\nscenarios, the EIC data will be a highly competitive direct probe of the proton\ngluon density.\n",
