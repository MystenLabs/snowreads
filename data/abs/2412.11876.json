  "abstract": "  Capacitary measures form a class of measures that vanish on sets of capacity\nzero. These measures are compact with respect to so-called\n$\\gamma$-convergence, which relates a sequence of measures to the sequence of\nsolutions of relaxed Dirichlet problems. This compactness result is already\nknown for the classical $H^1(\\Omega)$-capacity. This paper extends it to the\nfractional capacity defined for fractional order Sobolev spaces $H^s(\\Omega)$\nfor $s\\in (0,1)$. The compactness result is applied to obtain a finer\noptimality condition for a class of minimization problems in $H^s(\\Omega)$.\n",
