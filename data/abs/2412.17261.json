  "abstract": "  In this article, we study the multiparameter second quantum Weyl algebra at\nroots of unity. In this setting, the algebra is a polynomial identity (PI)\nalgebra, and the dimension of its simple modules is bounded above by its PI\ndegree. We explicitly determine the PI degree and provide a complete\nclassification of simple modules. This classification offers a comprehensive\nsolution to $\\href{https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-19486-4_23}{\\text{Problem\n2: C, Walton (2019)- An Invitation to Noncommutative Algebra}}$ for the second\nquantum Weyl algebra.\n",
