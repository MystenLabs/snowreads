Academic institutes\noffer a variety of computing majors, such as Computer Engineering, Computer\nScience, Information Systems, Information Technology, Software Engineering,\nCybersecurity, and Data Science. Since a major objective of earning a\nbachelor's degree is to improve career opportunities, it is crucial to\nunderstand how the job market perceives these computing majors. This study\nanalyzed the relationships between various computing majors and the job market\nin Saudi Arabia, using LinkedIn public profile data, discovering insights into\nthe strong relationship between the focus of certain computing majors and the\nemployment of relevant job positions. Moreover, job category trends were\nanalyzed over the past ten years, observing that demands for System Admin and\nTechnical Support positions declined while demands for Business Analysis and\nArtificial Intelligence and Data Science inclined. This study also compared\nearned professional certifications between different computing major graduates\nthat correspond to job position findings.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vd86gOhQwAhU1fzJ9Trc4Jx648QmvdBEvTcqNUSNKak","pdfSize":"441987"}
