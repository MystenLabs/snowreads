  "abstract": "  Social media usage is often cited as a potential driver behind the rising\nsuicide rates. However, distinguishing the causal effect - whether social media\nincreases the risk of suicide - from reverse causality, where individuals\nalready at higher risk of suicide are more likely to use social media, remains\na significant challenge. In this paper, we use an instrumental variable\napproach to study the quasi-exogenous geographical adoption of Twitter and its\ncausal relationship with suicide rates. Our analysis first demonstrates that\nTwitter's geographical adoption was driven by the presence of certain users at\nthe 2007 SXSW festival, which led to long-term disparities in adoption rates\nacross counties in the United States. Then, using a two-stage least squares\n(2SLS) regression and controlling for a wide range of geographic, socioeconomic\nand demographic factors, we find no significant relationship between Twitter\nadoption and suicide rates.\n",
