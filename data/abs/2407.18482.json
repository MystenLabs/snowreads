The Rashomon effect in the context of Explainable AI (XAI) has been\nrecognized as a critical factor. Although the Rashomon set has been introduced\nand studied in various contexts, its practical application is at its infancy\nstage and lacks adequate guidance and evaluation. We study the problem of the\nRashomon set sampling from a practical viewpoint and identify two fundamental\naxioms - generalizability and implementation sparsity that exploring methods\nought to satisfy in practical usage. These two axioms are not satisfied by most\nknown attribution methods, which we consider to be a fundamental weakness. We\nuse the norms to guide the design of an $\\epsilon$-subgradient-based sampling\nmethod. We apply this method to a fundamental mathematical problem as a proof\nof concept and to a set of practical datasets to demonstrate its ability\ncompared with existing sampling methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-O2Tl4GxBZqUyY6d2P1IJauAS3Qwcwi4-rdWsaRx0Yg","pdfSize":"19051824","objectId":"0xcc0d841288d43e27b291de22f8916be35f4a76d35bacbf6c451820132fb717a0","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
