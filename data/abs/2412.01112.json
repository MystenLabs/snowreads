  "abstract": "  Oceanic wave propagation through Earth's sea ice covers is a critical\ncomponent of accurate ice and climate modeling. Continuum models of the polar\nocean surface layer are characterized rheologically by the effective complex\nviscoelasticity of the composite of ice floes and sea water. Here we present\nthe first rigorous theory of this parameter, and distill its dependence on\nmixture geometry into the spectral properties of a self-adjoint operator\nanalogous to the Hamiltonian in quantum physics. Bounds for the complex\nviscoelasticity are obtained from the sea ice concentration and the contrast\nbetween the elastic and viscous properties of the ice and water/slush\nconstituents. We find that several published wave attenuation datasets in both\nlaboratory and field settings fall well within the bounds for specific contrast\nvalues of the ice/ocean composite.\n",
