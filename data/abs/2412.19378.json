We present a theoretical description\nfor first-order nondipole corrections ($O(c^{-1})$ where $c$ is the speed of\nlight) to the nonrelativistic description of the laser-atom interaction for a\nstrong circularly polarized infrared (IR) laser field combined with a train of\nextreme-ultraviolet (XUV) laser pulses. We investigate the photoelectron\nmomentum distribution (PMD) as the product of two main contributions: the\nintra- and interpulse factors. Whereas the interpulse factor gives rise to a\nsideband pattern with a shift opposite to the IR beam propagation direction,\nthe intrapulse factor forms an angular streaking pattern following the IR\ntime-dependent polarization direction. We explore the transition of the PMD\nfrom the dipole to the nondipole framework, showing the gradual break of the\nforward-backward symmetry as the laser parameters are varied. Furthermore, we\nfind non-zero contributions in dipole forbidden directions independent of the\nIR polarization state, wherein Cooper-\\textit{like} minima are observed. Our\nwork lays a theoretical foundation for understanding time-resolved nondipole\nLAPE in cutting-edge ultrafast experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"USoVrltCWQK2a2H7K2m0eKR7orAptncHGNEnSVHT9ak","pdfSize":"5598669"}
