The algebra\n$\\mathbb{C}\\ell(8)$ is the multiplication algebra of the complexification of\nthe Cayley-Dickson algebra of sedenions, $\\mathbb{S}$. Previous work\nrepresented three generations of fermions with $SU(3)_C$ colour symmetry,\npermuted by an $S_3$ symmetry of order-three. However, it proved difficult to\nfind a $U(1)$ generator that assigns the correct electric charge to all states.\nBy generalising the embedding of the order-three $S_3$ automorphism of\n$\\mathbb{S}$ into $\\mathbb{C}\\ell(8)$, we include an $S_3$-invariant $U(1)$\nthat correctly assigns electric charge. First generation states are represented\nin terms of two even $\\mathbb{C}\\ell(8)$ semi-spinors, obtained from two\nminimal left ideals, related to each other via the order-two $S_3$ symmetry.\nThe remaining two generations are obtained by applying the $S_3$ symmetry of\norder-three to the first generation. In this model, the gauge symmetries,\n$SU(3)_C\\times U(1)_{em}$, are $S_3$-invariant and preserve the semi-spinors.\nAs a result of the generalised embedding of the $S_3$ automorphisms of\n$\\mathbb{S}$ into $\\mathbb{C}\\ell(8)$, the three generations are linearly\nindependent, in contrast to earlier work.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"018W5vFFLMUuTCoFroVgI83pcLyOAINJjqcfeoyvwVs","pdfSize":"241054"}
