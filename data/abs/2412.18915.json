A distribution function of the class $\\boldsymbol{Q}$ is\nquasi-infinitely divisible in the sense that its characteristic function admits\nthe L\\'evy--Khinchine type representation with a ``signed spectral measure''.\nThe class $\\boldsymbol{Q}$, being a natural extension of the class\n$\\boldsymbol{I}$ of infinitely divisible distribution functions, is actively\nstudied now and it finds various applications. In 2018, Lindner, Pan and Sato\nformulated the open question: is it true that if $F\\in\\boldsymbol{Q}$ and\n$F=F_1*F_2$ with some distribution functions $F_1$ and $F_2$, then\n$F_1\\in\\boldsymbol{Q}$ and $F_2\\in\\boldsymbol{Q}$? There are some positive\nresults under special assumptions on the type of $F$. In this paper, we answer\nthe question in a general setting without any additional assumptions. We also\nconsider the same question but with the stronger assumption that\n$F\\in\\boldsymbol{I}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fn45rAJMb0I69IZ5JewllzROp0PyiDS768QF1-8pkUA","pdfSize":"161862"}
