  "abstract": "  Chv\\'atal showed that for any tree $T$ with $k$ edges the Ramsey number\n$R(T,n)=k(n-1)+1$ (\"Tree-complete graph Ramsey numbers.\" Journal of Graph\nTheory 1.1 (1977): 93-93). For $r=3$ or $4$, we show that, if $T$ is an\n$r$-uniform non-trivial tight tree, then the hypergraph Ramsey number\n$R(T,n)=\\Theta(n^{r-1})$. The 3-uniform result comes from observing a\nconstruction of Cooper and Mubayi. The main contribution of this paper is the\n4-uniform construction, which is inspired by the Cooper-Mubayi 3-uniform\nconstruction.\n",
