  "abstract": "  Quantum computing has the potential to accelerate various domains: scientific\ncomputation, machine learning, and optimization. Recently, Rydberg atom quantum\ncomputing has emerged as a promising quantum computing technology, especially\nwith the demonstration of the zonal addressing architecture. However, this\ndemonstration is only compatible with one type of quantum algorithm, and\nextending it to compile and execute general quantum algorithms is a challenge.\nTo address it, we propose PachinQo, a framework to co-design the architecture\nand compilation for zonal addressing systems for any given quantum algorithm.\nPachinQo's evaluation demonstrates its ability to improve a quantum algorithm's\nestimated probability of success by 45% on average in error-prone quantum\nenvironments.\n",
