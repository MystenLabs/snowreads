In this paper we generalize the method for\nsystems of partial differential equations with quadratic nonlinearities, while\nmaintaining the original structure of Carleman linearization. Furthermore, we\napply our approach to Burger's equation and to the Vlasov equation as examples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"d1gbf8iv3Q8eaEYU7bZ6hhQDqw2-H75VLMAFPnuFMBM","pdfSize":"169662"}
