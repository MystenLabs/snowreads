  "abstract": "  Matrix valued orthogonal polynomials (MVOP) appear in the study of doubly\nperiodic tiling models. Of particular interest is their limiting behavior as\nthe degree tends to infinity. In recent years, MVOP associated with doubly\nperiodic domino tilings of the Aztec diamond have been successfully analyzed.\nThe MVOP related to doubly periodic lozenge tilings of a hexagon are more\ncomplicated. In this paper we focus on a special subclass of hexagon tilings\nwith 3x3 periodicity. The special subclass leads to a genus one spectral curve\nwith additional symmetries that allow us to find an equilibrium measure in an\nexternal field explicitly. The equilibrium measure gives the asymptotic\ndistribution for the zeros of the determinant of the MVOP. The associated\ng-functions appear in the strong asymptotic formula for the MVOP that we obtain\nfrom a steepest descent analysis of the Riemann-Hilbert problem for MVOP.\n",
