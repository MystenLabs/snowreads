Consequently, we determine the\nrepresentation number of a word-representable graph in terms of the\npermutation-representation numbers of the modules and the representation number\nof the associated quotient graph. In this connection, we also obtain a complete\nanswer to the open problem posed by Kitaev and Lozin on the\nword-representability of the lexicographical product of graphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computer Science/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"F_ui33VcF_riuF91iFcS0xj-LCchKy_nuGwn4VwpbmQ","pdfSize":"132812"}
