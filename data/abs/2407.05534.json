Since there are\n$\\Theta(q^{n-3})$orbits of $\\operatorname{PGL}_2(k)$ acting on the set of\ndegree-$n$ places, the algorithm is quasilinear in the size of its output. The\nalgorithm is probabilistic unless we assume the extended Riemann hypothesis,\nbecause its complexity depends on that of polynomial factorization: for odd\n$n$, it involves factoring $\\Theta(q^{n-3})$ polynomials over $k$ of degree up\nto ${1 + ((n-1)/2)^n}$.\n  For composite degrees $n$, earlier work of the author gives an algorithm for\nenumerating $\\operatorname{PGL}_2(k)$ orbit representatives for degree-$n$\nplaces of $\\mathbf{P}^1$ over $k$ that runs in time $\\widetilde{O}(q^{n-3})$\nindependent of the extended Riemann hypothesis, but that uses $O(q^{n-3})$\nspace.\n  We also present an algorithm for enumerating orbit representatives for the\naction of $\\operatorname{PGL}_2(k)$ on the degree-$n$ effective divisors of\n$\\mathbf{P}^1$ over finite fields $k$. The two algorithms depend on one\nanother; our method of enumerating orbits of places of odd degree $n$ depends\non enumerating orbits of effective divisors of degree $(n+1)/2$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1fjotgxPRq-VbBpvQNTefbArjF87CcERhWxmnsUdbI0","pdfSize":"524770"}
