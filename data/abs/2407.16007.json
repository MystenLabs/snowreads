As step toward such capabilities, we\nintroduce a novel language modeling framework that enables automatic annotation\nof roles that social media entities play in their embedded web context. Using\nrelated communication theory, we liken social media embeddings to quotes,\nformalize the page context as structured natural language signals, and identify\na taxonomy of roles for quotes within the page context. We release\nSocialQuotes, a new data set built from the Common Crawl of over 32 million\nsocial quotes, 8.3k of them with crowdsourced quote annotations. Using\nSocialQuotes and the accompanying annotations, we provide a role classification\ncase study, showing reasonable performance with modern-day LLMs, and exposing\nexplainable aspects of our framework via page content ablations. We also\nclassify a large batch of un-annotated quotes, revealing interesting\ncross-domain, cross-platform role distributions on the web.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZPUNyWwoneqJ9Pc7PzHkIyjYLtmQT0eIStiP0BuK2hI","pdfSize":"732842"}
