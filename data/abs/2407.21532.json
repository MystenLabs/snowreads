The kappa distribution provides a replacement for the\nMaxwell-Boltzmann distribution which can be considered as a generalization for\ndescribing systems characterized by local correlations among their particles as\nfound in space and astrophysical plasmas. This paper presents all special cases\nof kappa distributions as members of a general pathway family of densities\nintroduced by Mathai.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yAvo1oJJc2WJV-s9R_JWlgd77jJL5RnzGuOEU_kh_xQ","pdfSize":"106144"}
