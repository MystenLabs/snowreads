Its solution\ncould offer a novel framework for describing and analyzing non-equilibrium\nsystems. In this work, we address this issue within the context of scalar\nactive matter, focusing on the continuum field theory of Active Model B+. We\nshow that the Wavelet Conditional Renormalization Group method allows us to\nestimate the effective energy of active model B+ from samples obtained by\nnumerical simulations. We investigate the qualitative changes of $E_\\text{eff}$\nas the activity level increases. Our key finding is that in the regimes\ncorresponding to low activity and to standard phase separation the interactions\nin $E_\\text{eff}$ are short-ranged, whereas for strong activity the\ninteractions become long-ranged and lead to micro-phase separation. By\nanalyzing the violation of Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem and entropy\nproduction patterns, which are directly accessible within the WCRG framework,\nwe connect the emergence of these long-range interactions to the\nnon-equilibrium nature of the steady state. This connection highlights the\ninterplay between activity, range of the interactions and the fundamental\nproperties of non-equilibrium systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"imDr8Lxo_-m-UrOgNw-BhHk2C0miq8JhIr_piEjKPiY","pdfSize":"1694229"}
