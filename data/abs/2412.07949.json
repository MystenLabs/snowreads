  "abstract": "  We present a transformation between the Schwarzschild coordinates and local\ninertial coordinates, and demonstrate the effect of gravitational bending of\nlight near a massive body in a small region. When a photon is emitted from a\npoint near the Earth's surface with an initial horizontal direction, its\nparabolic trajectory would have a vertical deflection that is about three times\nthat of a non-relativistic Newtonian particle would trace.\n",
