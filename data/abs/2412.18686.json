To this end we used radiative transfer models to\ndecode the spatial and spectral distribution of the nearby face-on galaxies\nM101 and NGC 3938. In both cases we provide excellent fits to the\nsurface-brightness distributions derived from GALEX, SDSS, 2MASS, Spitzer and\nHerschel imaging observations. Together with previous results from M33, NGC\n628, M51 and the Milky Way, we obtain a small statistical sample of modelled\nnearby galaxies that we analyse in this work. We find that in all cases Milky\nWay-type dust with Draine-like optical properties provide consistent and\nsuccessful solutions. We do not find any \"submm excess\", and no need for\nmodified dust-grain properties. Intrinsic fundamental quantities like\nstar-formation rates (SFR), specific SFR (sSFR), dust opacities and\nattenuations are derived as a function of position in the galaxy and overall\ntrends are discussed. In the SFR surface density versus stellar mass surface\ndensity space we find a structurally resolved relation (SRR) for the\nmorphological components of our galaxies, that is steeper than the main\nsequence (MS). Exception to this is for NGC 628, where the SRR is parallel to\nthe MS.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5l4NhP8nG1n5_x5Jw1CA8JsxRAT4Hb92PR4wvC_OHvc","pdfSize":"1516344"}
