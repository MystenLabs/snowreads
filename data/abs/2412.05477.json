Numerical\nsimulations reveal that this temperature exhibits contrasting behavior\ndepending on the system configuration: a negative shift occurs for fixed trap\npotentials due to the expansion of the condensate, while a positive shift is\nobserved for fixed volumes, where vortex lattice rigidity suppresses thermal\nfluctuations. We introduce a vortex-energy model that captures the role of\nvortex interactions, the positional energy of the vortex lattice, as well as\nthe phase transition and how the vortex lattice disappears. The findings\nprovide insights into the thermodynamic properties of rotating condensates and\nthe dynamics of vortex lattice melting, offering potential parallels with other\nquantum systems such as type-II superconductors.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Atomic and Molecular Clusters"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ABVjMMxgwGGuPk-rO1KFFj-ctU1TIrZ3bmuelnfNK3s","pdfSize":"1630052"}
