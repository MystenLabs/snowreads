  "abstract": "  For a complex manifold $\\Sigma $ with $\\mathbb{C}^{\\ast }$-action, we define\nthe $m$-th $\\mathbb{C}^{\\ast }$ Fourier-Dolbeault cohomology group and consider\nthe $m$-index on $\\Sigma $. By applying the method of transversal heat kernel\nasymptotics, we obtain a local index formula for the $m$-index. We can\nreinterpret Kawasaki's Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch formula for a compact complex\norbifold with an orbifold holomorphic line bundle by our integral formulas over\na (smooth) complex manifold and finitely many complex submanifolds arising from\nsingular strata. We generalize $\\mathbb{C}^{\\ast }$-action to complex reductive\nLie group $G$-action on a compact or noncompact complex manifold. Among others,\nwe study the nonextendability of open group action and the space of all\n$G$-invariant holomorphic $p$-forms. Finally, in the case of two compatible\nholomorphic $\\mathbb{C}^{\\ast }$-actions, a mirror-type isomorphism is found\nbetween two linear spaces of holomorphic forms, and the Euler characteristic\nassociated with these spaces can be computed by our $\\mathbb{C}^{\\ast }$ local\nindex formula on the total space. In the perspective of the equivariant\nalgebraic cobordism theory $\\Omega _{\\ast }^{\\mathbb{C}^{\\ast }}(\\Sigma ),$ a\nspeculative connection is remarked. Possible relevance to the recent\ndevelopment in physics and number theory is briefly mentioned.\n",
