  "abstract": "  Many of the existing TTS systems cannot accurately synthesize text containing\na variety of numerical formats, resulting in reduced intelligibility of the\nsynthesized speech. This research aims to develop a numerical format classifier\nthat can classify six types of numeric contexts. Experiments were carried out\nusing the proposed context-based feature extraction technique, which is focused\non extracting keywords, punctuation marks, and symbols as the features of the\nnumbers. Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors Linear Discriminant\nAnalysis, and Decision Tree were used as classifiers. We have used the 10-fold\ncross-validation technique to determine the classification accuracy in terms of\nrecall and precision. It can be found that the proposed solution is better than\nthe existing feature extraction technique with improvement to the\nclassification accuracy by 30% to 37%. The use of the number format\nclassification can increase the intelligibility of the TTS systems.\n",
