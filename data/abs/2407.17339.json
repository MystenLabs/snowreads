However, this approach may not fully exploit the\npotential of deep learning algorithms to directly extract features and patterns\nfrom raw packets. Moreover, it impedes real-time monitoring due to the\nnecessity of waiting for the processing pipeline to complete and introduces\ndependencies on additional software components.\n  In this paper, we investigate deep learning methodologies capable of\ndetecting attacks in real-time directly from raw packet data within network\ntraffic. We propose a novel approach where packets are stacked into windows and\nseparately recognised, with a 2D image representation suitable for processing\nwith computer vision models. Our investigation utilizes the CIC IDS-2017\ndataset, which includes both benign traffic and prevalent real-world attacks,\nproviding a comprehensive foundation for our research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"6y4aaqi1UOKa7pAinyWuqbgt4MSd-IuJInLal_agseI","pdfSize":"10965331"}
