The answer to this\nquestion is hindered by the absence of a quantitative and efficient model for\nelectron-phonon coupling (EPC). In this work, we develop a\nfirst-principles-based microscopic theory to calculate EPC in twisted bilayer\ngraphene for arbitrary twist angles without needing a periodic moir\\'e\nsupercell. We adopt a momentum-space model for the electronic and phonon\nstructures and quantify the EPC using generalized Eliashberg-McMillan theory\nfor superconductivity without an adiabatic approximation. Using this framework,\nwe find that the EPC is significantly enhanced near the magic angle, and drops\nabruptly for larger twist angles. We show that the EPC strength of a phonon\ncorresponds to the modification of the moir\\'e potential. In particular, we\nidentify several $\\Gamma$-phonon branches that contribute most significantly to\nthe EPC, including one layer breathing mode, three layer shearing modes, and\none chiral mode. These phonons should be experimentally detectable via Raman\nspectroscopy.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vYaxY5Fd0hq1goqHhgt_9YolpyVSkyptbxZS1OtcHNw","pdfSize":"50652507"}
