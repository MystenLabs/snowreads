We\nfind that for the majority of states the effective quantum-mechanical problem\nbecomes semiclassical with $\\hbar=1/J$. The classical system at $J=\\infty$ has\n$N-2$ degrees of freedom, and the classical phase space is identified with the\npositive Grassmanian $\\mathrm{Gr}_{+}(2,N)$. The quantum problem is recovered\nvia a Berezin-Toeplitz quantization of a classical Hamiltonian, which we\ndescribe explicitly. For $N=3$ the classical system has one degree of freedom\nand a detailed structure of the spectrum can be obtained from Bohr-Sommerfeld\nconditions. For all $N$, we show that the lowest excited states are\napproximated by a harmonic oscillator and find explicit expressions for their\nenergies.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iZ9QajhMUYkdubQylC4usTIhcqucFpHXuhTiNmSNFnM","pdfSize":"5030618"}
