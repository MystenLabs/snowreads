  "abstract": "  Signatures of superconductivity under pressure have recently been reported in\nthe bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$\nRuddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates with general chemical formula\nLa$_{n+1}$Ni$_n$O$_{3n+1}$ ($n=$ number of perovskite layers along the\n$c$-axis). The emergence of superconductivity is always concomitant with a\nstructural transition in which the octahedral tilts are suppressed causing an\nincrease in the out-of-plane $d_{z^2}$ orbital overlap. Here, using\nfirst-principles calculations, we explore biaxial strain (both compressive and\ntensile) as a means to mimic the electronic structure characteristics of RP\nnickelates (up to $n=5$) under hydrostatic pressure. Our findings highlight\nthat strain allows to decouple the structural and electronic structure effects\nobtained under hydrostatic pressure, with tensile strain reproducing the known\nelectronic structure characteristics of the pressurized bilayer and trilayer\ncompounds. Overall, strain represents a promising way to tune the electronic\nstructure of RP nickelates and could be an alternative route to achieve\nsuperconductivity in this family of materials.\n",
