  "abstract": "  After decades of experimental efforts, the DAMA/LIBRA(DL) annual modulation\n(AM) analysis on the ${\\chi}$N (WIMP Dark Matter interactions on nucleus)\nchannel remains the only one which can be interpreted as positive signatures.\nThis has been refuted by numerous time-integrated (TI) and AM analysis. It has\nbeen shown that ${\\chi}$e (WIMP interactions with electrons) alone is not\ncompatible with the DL AM data. We expand the investigations by performing an\nAM analysis with the addition of ${\\chi}$e long-range and short-range\ninteractions to ${\\chi}$N, derived using the frozen-core approximation method.\nTwo scenarios are considered, where the ${\\chi}$N and ${\\chi}$e processes are\ndue to a single ${\\chi}$ (${\\Gamma}^{1\\chi}_{tot}$) or two different ${\\chi}$s\n(${\\Gamma}^{2\\chi}_{tot}$). The combined fits with ${\\chi}$N and ${\\chi}$e\nprovide stronger significance to the DL AM data which are compatible with the\npresence of additional physical effects beyond \\c{hi}N alone. This is the first\nanalysis which explores how ${\\chi}$e AM can play a role in DL AM. The revised\nallowed regions as well as the exclusion contours from the other null AM\nexperiments are presented. All DL AM allowed parameter spaces in ${\\chi}$N and\n${\\chi}$e channels under both ${\\Gamma}^{1\\chi}_{tot}$ and\n${\\Gamma}^{2\\chi}_{tot}$ are excluded at the 90\\% confidence level by the\ncombined null AM results. It can be projected that DL-allowed parameter spaces\nfrom generic models with interactions induced by two-WIMPs are ruled out.\n",
