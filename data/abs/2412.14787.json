Further, we propose a method of constructing directed strongly\nregular graphs with prescribed automorphism group using genetic algorithm. In\nthe construction, we use orbit matrices, i.e. quotient matrices related to\nequitable partitions of adjacency matrices of putative directed strongly\nregular graphs induced by an action of a prescribed automorphism group.\nFurther, we apply this method to construct directed strongly regular graphs\nwith parameters $(36,10,5,2,3)$, $(52,12,3,2,3)$, $(52,15,6,5,6)$,\n$(55,20,8,6,8)$ and $(55,24,12,11,10)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aBA_lpl4En3yMAJweyBgnSx6KpaOeZFKM24oPOMjnaw","pdfSize":"164413"}
