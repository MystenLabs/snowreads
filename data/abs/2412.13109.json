A\ndesirable property is that they are rapidly mixing, which is equivalent to\nhaving a spectral gap $\\gamma$ (asymptotically) bounded away from $0$. Our work\nhas two main strands.\n  First, we establish a dichotomy for the robustness of mixing times on\nedge-weighted $d$-regular graphs (i.e., reversible Markov chains) subject to a\nLipschitz condition, which bounds the ratio of adjacent weights by $\\beta \\geq\n1$. If $\\beta \\ge 1$ is sufficiently small, then $\\gamma \\asymp 1$ and the\nmixing time is logarithmic in $n$. On the other hand, if $\\beta \\geq 2d$, there\nis an edge-weighting such that $\\gamma$ is polynomially small in $1/n$.\n  Second, we apply our robustness result to a time-dependent version of the\nso-called $\\varepsilon$-biased random walk, as introduced in Azar et al.\n[Combinatorica 1996]. We show that, for any constant $\\varepsilon>0$, a bias\nstrategy can be chosen adaptively so that the $\\varepsilon$-biased random walk\ncovers any bounded-degree regular expander in $\\Theta(n)$ expected time,\nimproving the previous-best bound of $O(n \\log \\log n)$. We prove the first\nnon-trivial lower bound on the cover time of the $\\varepsilon$-biased random\nwalk, showing that, on bounded-degree regular expanders, it is $\\omega(n)$\nwhenever $\\varepsilon = o(1)$. We establish this by controlling how much the\nprobability of arbitrary events can be ``boosted'' by using a time-dependent\nbias strategy.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Computer Science/Discrete Mathematics","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Xkw2sl-oJMcJrOQGKXxDkJOeBdPKhkEoGRA_daxuB_0","pdfSize":"410272"}
