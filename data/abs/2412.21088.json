Moreover, the presence of agents\nwith constraints (e.g., limited battery life, restricted mobility) or distinct\nroles further exacerbates these challenges. This document provides an overview\nof recent advances in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) conducted at\nthe Persistent Autonomy and Robot Learning (PeARL) lab at the University of\nMassachusetts Lowell. We briefly discuss various research directions and\npresent a selection of approaches proposed in our most recent publications. For\neach proposed approach, we also highlight potential future directions to\nfurther advance the field.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"N22vUyjzJF9BQnn1jvmMgweC6Bjjx2U9SEE0MuLk8cM","pdfSize":"3070896"}
