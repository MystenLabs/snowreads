The new schemes\nare vectorial median filters: The level set values at the next time step are\ndetermined by a sorting procedure performed on the most recent level set\nvalues. Detailed numerical convergence studies are presented, showing that the\ncorrect angle conditions at triple junctions (which include torque terms due to\nanisotropy) are indeed indirectly and automatically attained. Other standard\nbenefits of level set methods, such as subgrid accuracy on uniform grids via\ninterpolation and seamless treatment of topological changes, remain intact.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"AGWgDcnL4PyNdT83RHvFPYcAERstwbhOx2OsQYqHVmw","pdfSize":"1709113"}
