The high-tunability of the conducting channels electrically\nconnecting two islands to the leads allows us to treat the setup as a\nrealization of a multi-channel two-site charge Kondo (2SCK) model. It is shown\nthat the leading temperature dependence of the conductance in the 2SCK circuit\nsatisfies the conductance scaling of a single-impurity problem in a Luttinger\nliquid, whose interaction parameter is fully determined by the number of\nconducting channels in the device. We demonstrate that the finite weak\nbackscattering in all conducting channels features the appearance of the\nsubleading temperature dependencies in linear conductance. At the special\ncritical point, we predict an equivalency between the 2SCK nanodevice and a\nsingle-site two-channel charge Kondo problem, where one Kondo channel is\nimplemented by a non-interacting electron gas and the second Kondo channel is\nattributed to the Luttinger liquid.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Q18v0Cp1WM2FUKSknGoKnviemgMLRgeTSCW2sx1feq4","pdfSize":"740988"}
