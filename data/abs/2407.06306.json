The high performance of our codes and ease at which they\ncan be used, either independently or within a larger numerical scheme, are\nillustrated through several numerical examples with applications to matrix\ncompletion and image compression. Well-documented MATLAB and R codes are\nprovided for public use.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wgBs7FDUBIKGvyT7pB7vRhAqWpzGWRkSStBvjspuxxA","pdfSize":"274983"}
