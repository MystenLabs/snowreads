A general theory of diversities has been developed which exhibits many\ndeep analogies to metric space theory but also veers off in new directions.\nJust as many of the most important aspects of metric space theory involve\nmetrics defined on $\\Re^k$, many applications of diversity theory require a\nspecialized theory for diversities defined on $\\Re^k$, as we develop here. We\nfocus on two fundamental classes of diversities defined on $\\Re^k$: those that\nare Minkowski linear and those that are Minkowski sublinear. Many well-known\nfunctions in convex analysis belong to these classes, including diameter,\ncircumradius and mean width. We derive surprising characterizations of these\nclasses, and establish elegant connections between them. Motivated by classical\nresults in metric geometry, and connections with combinatorial optimization, we\nthen examine embeddability of finite diversities into $\\Re^k$. We prove that a\nfinite diversity can be embedded into a linear diversity exactly when it has\nnegative type and that it can be embedded into a sublinear diversity exactly\nwhen it corresponds to a generalized circumradius.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_s27lijvz1LxsETg5ACy0Z7OTMfi7fU-emSRGVu22Vw","pdfSize":"210885"}
