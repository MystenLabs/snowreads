Neural operators generalize neural networks to maps between function\nspaces instead of finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces. They can be trained and\ninferenced on input and output functions given at various discretizations,\nsatisfying a discretization convergence properties. Built on top of PyTorch,\nNeuralOperator provides all the tools for training and deploying neural\noperator models, as well as developing new ones, in a high-quality, tested,\nopen-source package. It combines cutting-edge models and customizability with a\ngentle learning curve and simple user interface for newcomers.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aeXZIdoBiy1DdIpnChMdZxBz7Gr74-gT4R7rLJ1e228","pdfSize":"262254"}
