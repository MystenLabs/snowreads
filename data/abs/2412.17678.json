The objective of this work is to\ngeneralize existent models of semiclassical dust collapse and examine the role\nof pressure in the formation of shell-crossing singularities in a semiclassical\ncontext. Numerical investigations show that the shell-focusing singularity\ncharacterizing the end state of any classical stellar collapse is here resolved\nby quantum gravitational effects and replaced by a bounce of the star. However,\nthey also show that shell-crossing singularities remain a general feature of\nthese models and that the inclusion of pressure does not alter the qualitative\npicture emerging from semiclassical models of inhomogeneous dust collapse.\nGiven the absence of a shell-focusing singularity and the possibility of\nextending spacetime in the future of the trapped region formed by gravitational\ncollapse, the investigation of the causal structure of the spacetime describing\nthe semiclassical collapse of a star is inevitably tied to a better\nunderstanding of the physics of these shell-crossing singularities.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Y-fPBp0kL1TX0jz6UTBuIIWf2ESNGJmwQ9VjLZ1cC9U","pdfSize":"2029092"}
