{"id":"2412.13833","title":"Multiple reflections on Huygens' principle","authors":"Kees Wapenaar","authorsParsed":[["Wapenaar","Kees",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2024 13:23:53 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-19","timestamp":1734528233000,"abstract":"  According to Huygens' principle, all points on a wave front act as secondary\nsources emitting spherical waves, and the superposition of these spherical\nwaves forms a new wave front. In the mathematical formulation of Huygens'\nprinciple, the waves emitted by the secondary sources are represented by\nGreen's functions. In many present-day applications of Huygens' principle,\nthese Green's functions are replaced by their time-reversed versions, thus\nforming a basis for backpropagation, imaging, inversion, seismic\ninterferometry, etc. However, when the input wave field is available only on a\nsingle open boundary, this approach has its limitations. In particular, it does\nnot properly account for multiple reflections. This is remedied by a modified\nform of Huygens' principle, in which the Green's functions are replaced by\nfocusing functions. The modified Huygens' principle forms a basis for imaging,\ninverse scattering, monitoring of induced sources, etc., thereby properly\ntaking multiple reflections into account.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ucpDtMDYp23UUAsUirK_NnRBZp_s892EKgmj0HvaTGA","pdfSize":"15788313"}
