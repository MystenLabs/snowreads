We examine rulings from the Italian Constitutional\nCourt on bioethics issues that involve trade-offs between competing values and\ncompare model-generated legal arguments on these issues to those presented by\nthe State, the Court, and the applicants. Our results indicate that GPT-4\nconsistently aligns more closely with progressive interpretations of the\nConstitution, often overlooking competing values and mirroring the applicants'\nviews rather than the more conservative perspectives of the State or the\nCourt's moderate positions. Our experiments reveal a distinct tendency of GPT-4\nto favor progressive legal interpretations, underscoring the influence of\nunderlying data biases. We thus underscore the importance of testing alignment\nin real-world scenarios and considering the implications of deploying LLMs in\ndecision-making processes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XxwynHUHC1NXpgzoJHxVqtwngLV2T87ROfcx3U5BQLs","pdfSize":"1095209","objectId":"0xa46ff74c5d400b069ddc4d6e2d47f91ca7906c8dce424fadd222da59c2e94fec","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
