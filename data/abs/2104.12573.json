This practice ignores model ambiguity, exposes the decision\nproblem to misspecification, and ultimately leads to post-decision\ndisappointment. Using statistical decision theory, we develop a framework to\nexplore, evaluate, and optimize robust decision rules that explicitly account\nfor estimation uncertainty. We show how to operationalize our analysis by\nstudying robust decisions in a stochastic dynamic investment model in which a\ndecision-maker directly accounts for uncertainty in the model's transition\ndynamics.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics","Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","pdfSize":"1552501","blobId":"1i6IKhJ9_3bk858ohBRGx81otwk3mHtT39K4xjka654","objectId":"0xf0aa4a008a7f789c0659637a98214af90c623a1be9b1fae6360e88381ff45a45","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
