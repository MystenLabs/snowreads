Current computational\nmodels face two critical limitations, namely the challenge of cross-modal\nintegration between partial neural recordings and complex visual stimuli, and\nthe inherent variability in neural characteristics across individuals,\nincluding differences in neuron populations and firing patterns. To address\nthese challenges, we present a multi-modal identifiable variational autoencoder\n(miVAE) that employs a two-level disentanglement strategy to map neural\nactivity and visual stimuli into a unified latent space. This framework enables\nrobust identification of cross-modal correlations through refined latent space\nmodeling. We complement this with a novel score-based attribution analysis that\ntraces latent variables back to their origins in the source data space.\nEvaluation on a large-scale mouse V1 dataset demonstrates that our method\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-individual latent representation\nand alignment, without requiring subject-specific fine-tuning, and exhibits\nimproved performance with increasing data size. Significantly, our attribution\nalgorithm successfully identifies distinct neuronal subpopulations\ncharacterized by unique temporal patterns and stimulus discrimination\nproperties, while simultaneously revealing stimulus regions that show specific\nsensitivity to edge features and luminance variations. This scalable framework\noffers promising applications not only for advancing V1 research but also for\nbroader investigations in neuroscience.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5SyQf2J7Lg8VzDlnDirY4qVEm3tHBW35JhZ7eEsv_44","pdfSize":"4653363"}
