No restriction on $b$\nis required, which implies that $f(x,s)s^{-1}$ may interfere with the essential\nspectrum of $ -\\Delta+V$ for $s\\to +\\infty$. Using the truncation method and\nthe Morse theory, we can compute critical groups of the corresponding\nfunctional at zero and infinity, then prove the existence of one negative\nsolution.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"iP_AtZzFQlEspo6K6pcgljVZsjEPSdfJ5bHe8JrCiTY","pdfSize":"222383"}
