To the best of\nour knowledge, data valuation has not yet been applied to Dataset Retrieval. By\nleveraging metadata and a user's preferences, we estimate the personal value of\neach dataset to facilitate dataset retrieval and filtering. We then validated\nthe data value-based ranking against the stakeholders' ranking of the datasets.\nThe proposed data valuation method and use case demonstrated that data\nvaluation is promising for dataset retrieval. For instance, the outperforming\ndataset retrieval based on our approach obtained 0.8207 in terms of NDCG@5 (the\ntruncated Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at 5). This study is unique in\nits exploration of a data valuation-based approach to dataset retrieval and\nstands out because, unlike most existing methods, our approach is validated\nusing the stakeholders ranking of the datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BKqqdn6vlnWAae6BhAcnGE8-FBTV-EdU2Vu3zPlpzE8","pdfSize":"501934"}
