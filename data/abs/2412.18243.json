In this paper, we present a large-scale measurement study of the\nStarlink network, the largest LEO satellite constellation to date. We begin by\nproposing an efficient method for discovering active Starlink user routers,\nidentifying approximately 3.2 million IPv6 addresses across 102 countries and\n123 regions-representing, to the best of our knowledge, the most complete list\nof Starlink user routers' active IPv6 addresses. Based on the discovered user\nrouters, we map the Starlink backbone network, which consists of 33 Points of\nPresence (PoPs) and 70 connections between them. Furthermore, we conduct a\ndetailed statistical analysis of active Starlink users and PoPs. Finally, we\nsummarize the IPv6 address assignment strategy adopted by the Starlink network.\nThe dataset of the backbone network is publicly available at\nhttps://ki3.org.cn/#/starlink-network.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"k2EmNdCoullPz_Ohs53DIq5EhGJ5bjtY8JpKGedHxAM","pdfSize":"415419"}
