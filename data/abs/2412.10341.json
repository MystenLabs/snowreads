  "abstract": "  This paper presents an innovative method for predicting shape errors in\n5-axis machining using graph neural networks. The graph structure is defined\nwith nodes representing workpiece surface points and edges denoting the\nneighboring relationships. The dataset encompasses data from a material removal\nsimulation, process data, and post-machining quality information. Experimental\nresults show that the presented approach can generalize the shape error\nprediction for the investigated workpiece geometry. Moreover, by modelling\nspatial and temporal connections within the workpiece, the approach handles a\nlow number of labels compared to non-graphical methods such as Support Vector\nMachines.\n",
