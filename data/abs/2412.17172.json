However, the space of potential dark matter models is\nvast, which raises the question: how can we search for dark matter without\nmaking strong assumptions about unknown physics. We present a model-independent\napproach for measuring dark matter annihilation ratios and branching fractions\nwith $\\gamma$-ray event data. By parameterizing the annihilation ratios for\nseven different channels, we obviate the need to search for a specific dark\nmatter candidate. To demonstrate our approach, we analyse simulated data using\nthe \\texttt{GammaBayes} pipeline. Given a 5$\\sigma$ signal, we reconstruct the\nannihilation ratios for five dominant channels to within 95% credibility. This\nallows us to reconstruct dark matter annihilation/decay channels without\npresuming any particular model, thus offering a model-independent approach to\nindirect dark matter searches in $\\gamma$-ray astronomy. This approach shows\nthat for masses between 0.3-5 TeV we can probe values below the thermal relic\nvelocity annihilation weighted cross-section allowing a 2$\\sigma$ detection for\n525 hours of simulated observation data by the Cherenkov Telescope Array\nObservatory of the Galactic Centre.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QreksCSa1c0VyxTo2HXClNWF1s7Vggbd7Z6dM5OnA1U","pdfSize":"12179391"}
