This notion is defined purely in terms of\nthe combinatorics of P. Denoting by X the Gorenstein toric Fano 3-fold whose\nfan is the spanning fan (a.k.a. face fan) of P, our first result states that\namd for P determine a smoothing of X. Our second result amounts to an effective\nrecipe for computing the Betti numbers of the smoothing.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MxuF2itYjILNZdIxPh8_ZzDyuB62NB683HsHxQzax_g","pdfSize":"717415"}
