The model is based on\na learnable Markov transition kernel to recover the data distribution from the\nGaussian distribution. The Markov process is conditioned on the obstacle\ngeometry, estimating the noise to be removed at each step, implemented via a\nU-Net. A cross-attention mechanism incorporates the geometry as a prompt. We\ntrain the geometry-to-flow diffusion model using a dataset of flows past simple\nobstacles, including the circle, ellipse, rectangle, and triangle. For\ncomparison, the CNN model is trained using the same dataset. Tests are carried\nout on flows past obstacles with simple and complex geometries, representing\ninterpolation and extrapolation on the geometry condition, respectively. In the\ntest set, challenging scenarios include a cross and characters `PKU'. Generated\nflow fields show that the geometry-to-flow diffusion model is superior to the\nCNN model in predicting instantaneous flow fields and handling complex\ngeometries. Quantitative analysis of the model accuracy and divergence in the\nfields demonstrate the high robustness of the diffusion model, indicating that\nthe diffusion model learns physical laws implicitly.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UIshfCww9m_OvTXTbI5He8ddhVBFT34XPgLz5LEznZI","pdfSize":"2921448"}
