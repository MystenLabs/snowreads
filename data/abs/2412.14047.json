  "abstract": "  Selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM), also known as light sheet\nfluorescence microscopy, provides high specificity through fluorescence\nlabeling. However, it lacks complementary structural information from the\nsurrounding context, which is essential for the comprehensive analysis of\nbiological samples. Here, we present a high-resolution, multimodal imaging\nsystem that integrates SPIM with full-field optical coherence tomography\n(FF-OCT), without requiring modifications to the existing SPIM setup. Both SPIM\nand FF-OCT offer low phototoxicity and intrinsic optical sectioning, making\nthem well-suited for in vivo imaging. Their shared detection path enables\nseamless and efficient co-registration of fluorescence and structural data. We\ndemonstrate the functionality of this combined system by performing in vivo\nimaging of zebrafish larvae.\n",
