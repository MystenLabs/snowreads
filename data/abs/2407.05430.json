In this problem, the task is to preprocess two strings $S$ and $T$ of\nlengths $n$ and $m$, respectively, to obtain a data-structure that is able to\nanswer queries regarding the Hamming distance between a substring of $S$ and a\nsubstring of $T$.\n  For a constant size alphabet strings, we show that for every $x\\le nm$ there\nis a data structure with $\\tilde{O}(nm/x)$ preprocess time and $O(x)$ query\ntime. We also provide a combinatorial conditional lower bound, showing that for\nevery $\\varepsilon > 0$ and $x \\le nm$ there is no data structure with query\ntime $O(x)$ and preprocess time $O((\\frac{nm}{x})^{1-\\varepsilon})$ unless\ncombinatorial fast matrix multiplication is possible.\n  For strings over general alphabet, we present a data structure with\n$\\tilde{O}(nm/\\sqrt{x})$ preprocess time and $O(x)$ query time for every $x \\le\nnm$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ekccXgcrfKlopqML76fpijUKx0VukQrFvL57T-2QdnY","pdfSize":"650297"}
