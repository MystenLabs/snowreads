A disc-like or penny-shaped fracture grows radially from a point\nsource during the injection of a viscous fluid at a constant flow rate. We\nreport an experimental study on the dynamics of fractures propagating in the\nviscous regime. We measure the fracture aperture and radius over time for\nvarying mechanical properties of the medium and fluid and different injection\nparameters. Our experiments show that the fracture continues to expand in an\nimpermeable brittle matrix, even after the injection stops. {In the viscous\nregime, the fracture radius scales as $t^{4/9}$ during the injection. Post\nshut-in, the crack continues to propagate at a slower rate, which agrees well\nwith the predictions of the scaling arguments, as the radius scales as\n$t^{1/9}$. The fracture finally reaches an equilibrium set by the toughness of\nthe material.} The results provide insights into the propagation of hydraulic\nfractures in rocks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"v-pTrMb3G9LwtT68tE4-DtQ5Sp0BacGnsKRiKyMdcig","pdfSize":"2850270"}
