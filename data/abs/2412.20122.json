This\nhierarchy is an extended version of the one introduced by Ueno and Takasaki.\nOur version contains N discrete variables rather than one. We start from the\nLax formalism, deduce the bilinear relation for the wave functions from it and\nthen, based on the latter, prove existence of the tau-function. We also show\nhow the multi-component Toda lattice hierarchy is embedded into the universal\nhierarchy which is basically the multi-component KP hierarchy. At last, we show\nhow the bilinear integral equation for the tau-function can be obtained using\nthe free fermion technique. An example of exact solutions (a multi-component\nanalogue of one-soliton solutions) is given.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EKtI0EeTinnlq7YKGHm0Ug94C1aVq9UveWx1UnXLNZ0","pdfSize":"501020"}
