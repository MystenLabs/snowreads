I argue\nthat this formalism is fundamentally inapplicable to the problem, except in\nsynthetic limits. One such limit is the small-$N$ limit, which was already\ndiscussed in early studies of the problem; a similar but slightly less\nunphysical large-$N$ limit is proposed. I show that it is at least formally\npossible to construct perturbative expansions around these synthetic limits.\nHowever, I argue that nonperturbative effects become important when $N\\sim1$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0FDTEQ9oZQhLhhRiXXCXuzALmAvBzdrm5O_UjX7w2nY","pdfSize":"986784"}
