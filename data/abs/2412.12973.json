The Grassmann-valued constraint we\nencounter is handled using its large-volume expansion, corresponding to a\nsaddle-point approximation. We test the method in the chiral Gross-Neveu model\nand demonstrate its consistency with the standard approach. The machinery we\ndeveloped opens up a new avenue to investigate the spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking and restoration in field theories, in particular for the chiral\nsymmetry breaking in the strong interactions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"I3xxBA0EH4QWiPca-c71xWaa_-VuEPYy-EVkOHBK-ls","pdfSize":"2479554"}
