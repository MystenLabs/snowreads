  "abstract": "  We study spontaneous symmetry breaking in quantum field theories with\nfermionic order parameters and construct, for the first time in the literature,\nthe constraint effective potential for it. The Grassmann-valued constraint we\nencounter is handled using its large-volume expansion, corresponding to a\nsaddle-point approximation. We test the method in the chiral Gross-Neveu model\nand demonstrate its consistency with the standard approach. The machinery we\ndeveloped opens up a new avenue to investigate the spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking and restoration in field theories, in particular for the chiral\nsymmetry breaking in the strong interactions.\n",
