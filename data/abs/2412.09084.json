These models convert text into images that are\ndivided into patches, enabling a continuous vocabulary representation that\nproves especially useful for out-of-vocabulary words common in dialectal data.\nUsing German as a case study, we compare the performance of pixel-based models\nto token-based models across various syntactic and semantic tasks. Our results\nshow that pixel-based models outperform token-based models in part-of-speech\ntagging, dependency parsing and intent detection for zero-shot dialect\nevaluation by up to 26 percentage points in some scenarios, though not in\nStandard German. However, pixel-based models fall short in topic\nclassification. These findings emphasize the potential of pixel-based models\nfor handling dialectal data, though further research should be conducted to\nassess their effectiveness in various linguistic contexts.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8gKEIIMzW4OO1asjJNI60i1IhdsiEdYF2TlQ3teuUec","pdfSize":"252407"}
