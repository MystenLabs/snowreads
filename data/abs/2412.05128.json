{"id":"2412.05128","title":"How permanent are metadata for research data? Understanding changes in\n  DataCite DOI metadata","authors":"Dorothea Strecker","authorsParsed":[["Strecker","Dorothea",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2024 15:35:19 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-09","timestamp":1733499319000,"abstract":"  With the move towards open research information, the DOI registration agency\nDataCite is increasingly used as a source for metadata describing research\ndata, for example to perform scientometric analyses. However, there is a lack\nof research on how DOI metadata describing research data are created and\nmaintained. This paper adresses this gap by using DataCite metadata provenance\ninformation to analyze the overall prevalence and patterns of change to\nDataCite DOI metadata records. The results show that change of DataCite DOI\nmetadata records is common, but it tends to be incremental and not extensive.\nDataCite DOI metadata records offer reliable descriptions of datasets and are\nstable enough to be used in scientometric research. The findings mirror\ninsights from previous studies of metadata change in other contexts, suggesting\nthat there are similarities in metadata practices between research data\nrepositories and more traditional cataloging environments. However, the\nobserved changes don't seem to fully align with idealized conceptualizations of\nmetadata creation and maintenance for research data. In particular, the data\ndoes not show that metadata records are maintained continuously, and metadata\nchange has a limited effect on metadata completeness.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Digital Libraries"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xehuwftMJnuFhHVI3WecX5-7_QVZCk9u7H_D9qpvXy8","pdfSize":"1216545"}
