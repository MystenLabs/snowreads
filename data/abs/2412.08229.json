  "abstract": "  Integrating machine learning techniques in established numerical solvers\nrepresents a modern approach to enhancing computational fluid dynamics\nsimulations. Within the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), the collision operator\nserves as an ideal entry point to incorporate machine learning techniques to\nenhance its accuracy and stability. In this work, an invariant neural network\nis constructed, acting on an equivariant collision operator, optimizing the\nrelaxation rates of non-physical moments. This optimization enhances robustness\nto symmetry transformations and ensures consistent behavior across geometric\noperations. The proposed neural collision operator (NCO) is trained using\nforced isotropic turbulence simulations driven by spectral forcing, ensuring\nstable turbulence statistics. The desired performance is achieved by minimizing\nthe energy spectrum discrepancy between direct numerical simulations and\nunderresolved simulations over a specified wave number range. The loss function\nis further extended to tailor numerical dissipation at high wave numbers,\nensuring robustness without compromising accuracy at low and intermediate wave\nnumbers. The NCO's performance is demonstrated using three-dimensional\nTaylor-Green vortex (TGV) flows, where it accurately predicts the dynamics even\nin highly underresolved simulations. Compared to other LBM models, such as the\nBGK and KBC operators, the NCO exhibits superior accuracy while maintaining\nstability. In addition, the operator shows robust performance in alternative\nconfigurations, including turbulent three-dimensional cylinder flow. Finally,\nan alternative training procedure using time-dependent quantities is\nintroduced. It is based on a reduced TGV model along with newly proposed\nsymmetry boundary conditions. The reduction in memory consumption enables\ntraining at higher Reynolds numbers, successfully leading to stable yet\naccurate simulations.\n",
