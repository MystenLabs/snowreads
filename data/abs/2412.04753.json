It is a\ngeneralisation of the magnetohydrodynamical equations and takes into account\nthe dynamics of the magnetisation of a fluid. First proposed by Lingam (Lingam,\n`Dissipative effects in magnetohydrodynamical models with intrinsic\nmagnetisation', Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation\nVol 28, pp 223-231, 2015), the usual equations of magnetohydrodynamics, namely\nthe Navier-Stokes equation and the induction equation, are coupled with the\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. In this paper, the local existence,\nuniqueness and regularity of weak solutions to this system are discussed.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QUVFeW926RTg0UaF1DEzvPRJ0Xy0dt8pv1-o8fCzLj0","pdfSize":"380288"}
