In a fluid intelligence task, the subject is required to\ndiscover regularities from relatively short-term memory of the first-seen task.\nSome fluid intelligence tasks require discovering regularities in event\nsequences. Thus, a neural network model was constructed to explain fluid\nintelligence or regularity discovery in event sequences with relatively\nshort-term memory. The model was implemented and tested with delayed\nmatch-to-sample tasks.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"2VJ2hewmYUS-OkaKOmxxFpPMLZWvpvXlx6si02zS8_Q","pdfSize":"574032"}
