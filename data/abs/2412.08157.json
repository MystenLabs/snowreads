  "abstract": "  Topological spin superconductors are $p$-wave spin-triplet exciton insulators\nwhose topological edge modes have been shown to obey non-Abelian braiding\nstatistics. Based on a toy model as the spin counterpart of the Kitaev's chain,\nwe study the spin Josephson effect adopting the $S$-matrix as well as the\nGreen's function method. The on-site energies of these topological edge modes\nlead to a transition between the fractional and integer spin Josephson effects.\nMoreover, non-vanishing on-site energies will also induce a charge pump through\nthe spin Josephson junction. These two effects, distinct features of\ntopological spin superconductors and absent in Majorana systems, can be\nutilized for spin transport detection of topological spin superconductors.\n",
