Research in the field of HCI on immigration and aging has primarily\nfocused on their practical needs but has paid less attention to the\nadaptability issues of older internal migrants moving with their families. In\nthis study, we investigate the challenges older internal migrants face in\nadapting socially, using metadata surveys and semi-structured interviews to\ndelve into their life struggles and resilience sources. Our findings highlight\nthe older internal migrants' remarkable resilience, particularly evident in\ntheir reminiscences. We explore the integration of reminiscences with the\nmetaverse, identifying the necessary conditions to create a \"Metamemory\". We\nintroduce a novel design for a metaverse scene that bridges past and present\nexperiences. This aims to encourage discussions on enhancing older internal\nmigrants' reminiscence, leveraging the metaverse's positive potential, and\ndevising strategies to more effectively address older internal migrants'\nconcerns in the future.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction","Computer Science/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Octvw5HF8G-ZW6laPYdGhf02-Qqf0htN-ybUEvciz7Q","pdfSize":"354452"}
