Rev. A 95,\n053608 (2017)]. In the low-energy regime, this system is governed by a unique\n$\\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory, where field theory arguments have suggested that\nit may exhibit two exotic gapless deconfined phases, namely a dipolar liquid\nphase and a Bose liquid phase, along with two gapped (confined and deconfined)\nphases. We address these predictions numerically by using large-scale density\nmatrix renormalization group simulations. Our findings provide conclusive\nevidence for the existence of a gapless Bose liquid phase for $N \\geq 7$. We\ndemonstrate that this gapless phase shares the same critical properties as\none-dimensional critical phases, resembling weakly coupled chains of Luttinger\nliquids. In the range of geometries and $N$ considered, the gapless dipolar\nphase predicted theoretically is still elusive and its characterization will\nprobably require a full two-dimensional treatment.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tSVXywuVxbFQ1YnrYSw2X9lqAM0DKY6mYKuNM0HC8GM","pdfSize":"1107013"}
