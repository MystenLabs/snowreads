  "abstract": "  Long-range electrostatic interactions critically affect polar materials.\nHowever, state-of-the-art atomistic potentials, such as neural networks or\nGaussian approximation potentials employed in large-scale simulations, often\nneglect the role of these long-range electrostatic interactions.\n  This study introduces a novel model derived from first principles to evaluate\nthe contribution of long-range electrostatic interactions to total energies,\nforces, and stresses. The model is designed to integrate seamlessly with\nexisting short-range force fields without further first-principles calculations\nor retraining. The approach relies solely on physical observables, like the\ndielectric tensor and Born effective charges, that can be consistently\ncalculated from first principles. We demonstrate that the model reproduces\ncritical features, such as the LO-TO splitting and the long-wavelength phonon\ndispersions of polar materials, with benchmark results on the cubic phase of\nbarium titanate (BaTiO$_3$).\n",
