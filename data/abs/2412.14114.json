Our findings\nhave practical implications as we discover that adding a time-dependent\nperiodic modulation to the transition frequency of the qubit can significantly\nenhance quantum synchronization. We first discovered the phase preference and,\nconsequently, the phase locking conditions in our system using the Husimi\nQ-function. It is revealed that combining frequency modulation and\nnon-Markovian effects enables us to achieve a stable phase-locking for the\nsystem. We show that tuning the amplitude-tofrequency ratio of the modulation\nprocess on the zeros of the zeroth-order Bessel function led to phase locking\nand, thus, surprisingly enhances quantum synchronization in the system. These\nresults provide new insights into efficiently understanding phase dynamics in\nquantum environments.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zr2lrdDEcbnka7CJ5by1qk29AU_FHQc_M3PcMPaVWVg","pdfSize":"1060759"}
