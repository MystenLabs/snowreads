The model uses a time-fractional stochastic\nhyperbolic diffusion equation, which describes the evolution of spherical\nrandom fields on $\\bS^2$ in time. The diffusion operator incorporates a\ntime-fractional derivative in the Caputo sense. In the first stage of the\nmodel, a homogeneous problem is considered, with an isotropic Gaussian random\nfield on $\\bS^2$ serving as the initial condition. In the second stage, the\nmodel transitions to an inhomogeneous problem driven by a time-delayed Brownian\nmotion on $\\bS^2$. The solution to the model is expressed through a series of\nreal spherical harmonics. To obtain an approximation, the expansion of the\nsolution is truncated at a certain degree $L\\geq1$. The analysis of truncation\nerrors reveals their convergence behavior, showing that convergence rates are\naffected by the decay of the angular power spectra of the driving noise and the\ninitial condition. In addition, we investigate the sample properties of the\nstochastic solution, demonstrating that, under some conditions, there exists a\nlocal H\\\"{o}lder continuous modification of the solution. To illustrate the\ntheoretical findings, numerical examples and simulations inspired by the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) are presented.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Spectral Theory","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"l77QzS8JLTGywtysh4OHiYa4JspWWMC5DB3rEyPhxnA","pdfSize":"5661279"}
