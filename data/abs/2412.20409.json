Computational methods to tackle this issue are based on\nvarious forms of a pseudoinverse (PI) solution to the velocity IK problem. The\ndamped least squares (DLS) method provides a robust solution with controllable\nconvergence rate. However, at singularities, it may not even be possible to\nsolve the IK problem using any PI solution when certain end-effector motions\nare prescribed. To overcome this problem, an analytically informed inverse\nkinematics (AI-IK) method is proposed. The key step of the method is an\nexplicit description of the tangent aspect of singular motions (the analytic\npart) to deduce a perturbation that yields a regular configuration. The latter\nserves as start configuration for the iterative solution (the numeric part).\nNumerical results are reported for a 7-DOF Kuka iiwa.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Robotics","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"P6ABPtAf18ymILyiPJw4ODWLFFPsqHwH99hfplVRU-w","pdfSize":"10112084"}
