Observation\nof this angular pattern is crucial evidence that GWs are present, so PTAs\n\"reconstruct the HD curve\" by estimating the correlation using pulsar pairs\nseparated by similar angles. The angular pattern may be also expressed as a\n\"harmonic sum\" of Legendre polynomials ${\\rm P}_l(\\cos \\gamma)$, with\ncoefficients $c_l$. Here, assuming that the GWs and pulsar noise are described\nby a Gaussian ensemble, we derive optimal estimators for the $c_l$ and compute\ntheir variance. We consider two choices for \"optimal\". The first minimizes the\nvariance of each $c_l$, independent of the values of the others. The second\nfinds the set of $c_l$ which minimizes the (squared) deviation of the\nreconstructed correlation curve from its mean. These are analogous to the\nso-called \"dirty\" and \"clean\" maps of the electromagnetic and (audio-band) GW\nbackgrounds.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lbw3tcaWYjK4qWEWjIq88o12pBToGZVTgV4oXZnE4t8","pdfSize":"554207"}
