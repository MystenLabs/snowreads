  "abstract": "  In this work we present the results of calculation of the electric field\ndistribution in the inhomogeneous media based on the generalized WKB method. In\nthis approach the field is represented as the sum of two components, one of\nwhich is associated with the right-travelling WKB solution and the other with\nthe left-travelling WKB solution. It has been shown that the second component\nis not a left-travelling nonuniform wave. Calculation results showed that the\nphase distribution of this component has an increasing character, similar to\nthe phase distribution of the right-travelling wave component. Obtained results\ncan be useful during the development of dielectric accelerating waveguides. The\nobtained results may also indicate the location where a semiclassical particle\nwith energy greater than the barrier height can reflect from a smooth potential\nbarrier.\n",
