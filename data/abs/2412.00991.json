  "abstract": "  Letting $L_{n}(N, u)$ denote a polylogarithm ladder of weight $n$ and index\n$N$ with $u$ as an algebraic number, there is a rich history surrounding how\nmathematical objects of this form can be constructed for a given weight or\nindex. This raises questions as to what minimal polynomials for $u$ are\npermissible in such constructions. Classical relations for the dilogarithm\n$\\text{Li}_{2}$ provide families of weight-2 ladders in such a way so that the\nbase equations for $u$ consist of a fixed number of terms, and subsequent\nconstructions for dilogarithm ladders rely on sporadic cases whereby $u$ is\ndefined via a cyclotomic equation, as in the supernumary ladders due to\nAbouzahra and Lewin. This motivates our construction of an infinite family of\ndilogarithm ladders so as to obtain arbitrarily many terms with nonzero\ncoefficients for the minimal polynomials for $u$. Our construction relies on a\nderivation of a dilogarithm identity introduced by Khoi in 2014 via the Seifert\nvolumes of manifolds obtained from the use of Dehn surgery.\n",
