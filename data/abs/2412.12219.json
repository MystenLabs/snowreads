This study investigates\nwhether LLMs are effective for time series data analysis by comparing their\nperformance with non-LLM-based approaches across three tasks: classification,\nanomaly detection, and forecasting.\n  Through a series of experiments using GPT4TS and autoregressive models, we\nevaluate their performance on benchmark datasets and assess their accuracy,\nprecision, and ability to generalize. Our findings indicate that while\nLLM-based methods excel in specific tasks like anomaly detection, their\nbenefits are less pronounced in others, such as forecasting, where simpler\nmodels sometimes perform comparably or better. This research highlights the\nrole of LLMs in time series analysis and lays the groundwork for future studies\nto systematically explore their applications and limitations in handling\ntemporal data.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vt1WBWMnrYOQwrfskS1iR8R2NFJiAXjKgxun2Qyabxk","pdfSize":"220831"}
