  "abstract": "  We consider soliton gas solutions of the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV)\nequation, where the point spectrum of the condensate is located within a\nbounded domain in the upper half-plane. We first demonstrate that when the\ndomain is a quadrature and the soliton density is an analytic function, the\ncorresponding deterministic soliton gas coincides with a finite number of\nsolitons, which we call this effect soliton shielding. When the domain is an\nellipse and the soliton density is analytic, the corresponding deterministic\nsoliton gas reduces the spectral data to the segment joining the foci. The\ninitial datum of this Cauchy problem is asymptotically step-like oscillatory,\ndescribed by a periodic elliptic function as \\( x \\to +\\infty \\), and it\nvanishes exponentially fast as \\( x \\to -\\infty \\).\n",
