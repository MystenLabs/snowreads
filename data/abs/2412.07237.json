Troubled by flexibility-quality tradeoffs, existing\nmethods are often limited to using predefined structures or retrieving shapes\nfrom static datasets. To address these challenges, we parameterize an\narticulated object as a tree of tokens and employ a transformer to generate\nboth the object's high-level geometry code and its kinematic relations.\nSubsequently, each sub-part's geometry is further decoded using a\nsigned-distance-function (SDF) shape prior, facilitating the synthesis of\nhigh-quality 3D shapes. Our approach enables the generation of diverse objects\nwith high-quality geometry and varying number of parts. Comprehensive\nexperiments on conditional generation from text descriptions demonstrate the\neffectiveness and flexibility of our method.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"i90QJZcFpjogptiJoz1xNw1RCf5Ueo962j6hDF0flBM","pdfSize":"35836183"}
