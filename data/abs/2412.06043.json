The resulting space of metric theories of gravity may\naddress open conceptual and observational puzzles through a wealth of effects\nbeyond general relativity, whose traces can be searched for within today's and\ntomorrow's gravitational testing grounds. Above all, we offer a generic metric\ntheory generalization of Isaacson's approach to the leading-order field\nequations of physical perturbations with a well-defined notion of\nenergy-momentum carried by the gravitational waves. Within this framework, we\nidentify the backreaction of the Isaacson energy-momentum flux onto the\nbackground spacetime with the displacement memory effect that induces a\npermanent distortion of space after the passage of a gravitational wave. This\neffect is a well-known prediction of GR whose dominant contribution captures\nits inherent non-linear nature, manifest in the ability of gravity to\ngravitate. However, the novel interpretation of memory as naturally arising\nwithin the Isaacson approach to gravitational waves comes with two main\nadvantages. Firstly, it allows for a unified understanding of both the null and\nthe ordinary memory effect, which are respectively sourced by unbound energy\nfluxes that do and do not reach asymptotic null infinity. Secondly, and most\nimportantly, this approach allows for a consistent derivation of the memory\nformula for a large class of metric theories with considerable lessons to be\nlearned for upcoming future measurements of the memory effect.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"1Ncm11E51VsmHMVEL50r0_piPMwU7o4uPM2HQxeh16E","pdfSize":"8134202"}
