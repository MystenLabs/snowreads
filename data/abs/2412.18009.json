For a Noetherian scheme $X$ admitting a dualizing\ncomplex, Bezrukavnikov-Deligne, and then independently Gabber and Kashiwara\nhave shown that given a monotone comonotone perversity function on $X$ one can\nconstruct a t-structure on $\\mathbf{D}^b (X)$. We show that such t-structures\nare tensor t-structures and conversely every tensor t-structure on\n$\\mathbf{D}^b (X)$ arises in this way. We achieve this by first characterising\ntensor t-structures in terms of Thomason-Cousin filtrations which generalises\nearlier results of Alonso, Jerem\\'ias and Saor\\'in, from Noetherian rings to\nschemes. We also show that for a smooth projective curve $C$, the derived\ncategory $\\mathbf{D}^b (C)$ has no non-trivial tensor weight structures, this\nextends our earlier result on the projective line to higher genus curves.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6gMTmnkYF5gd1mczvzI35Tu7hrLfIDOXm9Zj-OrSGg4","pdfSize":"256579"}
