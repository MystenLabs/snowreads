In this work, we use the recently introduced time-dependent GGE\n(t-GGE) approach to describe the open dynamics of a gas of bosons subject to\natom losses and gains. We employ tensor network methods to provide numerical\nevidence of the exactness of the t-GGE in the limit of adiabatic dissipation,\nand of its accuracy in the regime of weak but finite dissipation. That accuracy\nis tested for two-point functions via the rapidity distribution, and for more\ncomplicated correlations through a non-Gaussianity measure. We combine this\ndescription with Generalized Hydrodynamics and we show that it correctly\ncaptures transport at the Euler scale. Our results demonstrate that the t-GGE\napproach is robust in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous settings.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fBbUD6b1vbgpIi3ygUY0NaOwsM3xyRDL7ikvLwZNr8o","pdfSize":"2719389"}
