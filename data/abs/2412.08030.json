{"id":"2412.08030","title":"Testing linear-quadratic GUP modified Kerr Black hole using EHT results","authors":"Sohan Kumar Jha","authorsParsed":[["Jha","Sohan Kumar",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2024 02:18:23 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-12","timestamp":1733883503000,"abstract":"  The linear-quadratic Generalized uncertainty principle (LQG) is consistent\nwith predictions of a minimum measurable length and a maximum measurable\nmomentum put forth by various theories of quantum gravity. The quantum gravity\neffect is incorporated into a black hole (BH) by modifying its ADM mass. In\nthis article, we explore the impact of GUP on the optical properties of an LQG\nmodified \\k BH (LQKBH). We analyze the horizon structure of the BH, which\nreveals a critical spin value of $7M/8$. BHs with spin $(a)$ less than the\ncritical value are possible for any real GUP parameter $\\a$ value. However, as\nthe spin increases beyond the critical value, a forbidden region in $\\a$ values\npops up that disallows the existence of BHs. This forbidden region widens as we\nincrease the spin. We then examine the impact of $\\a$ on the shape and size of\nthe BH shadow for inclination angles $17^o$ and $90^o$, providing a deeper\ninsight into the unified effect of spin and GUP on the shadow. The size of the\nshadow has a minimum at $\\a=1.0M$, whereas, for the exact value of $\\a$, the\ndeviation of the shadow from circularity becomes maximum when the spin is less\nthan the critical value. No extrema is observed for $a\\,>\\, 7M/8$. The shadow's\nsize and deviation are adversely affected by a decrease in the inclination\nangle. Finally, we confront theoretical predictions with observational results\nfor supermassive BHs $M87^*$ and $SgrA^*$ provided by the EHT collaboration to\nextract bounds on the spin $a$ and GUP parameter $\\a$. We explore bounds on the\nangular diameter $\\th_d$, axial ratio $D_x$, and the deviation from \\s radius\n$\\d$ for constructing constraints on $a$ and $\\a$. Our work makes LQKBHs\nplausible candidates for astrophysical BHs.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SBA-WCvSrdnt6J0nRphtikqMascVJDKgw3z6sCrC9lM","pdfSize":"2583752"}
