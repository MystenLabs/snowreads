  "abstract": "  Social media platforms, particularly Reddit's r/Epilepsy community, offer a\nunique perspective into the experiences of individuals with epilepsy (PWE) and\ntheir caregivers. This study analyzes 57k posts and 533k comments to explore\nkey themes across demographics such as age, gender, and relationships. Our\nfindings highlight significant discussions on epilepsy-related challenges,\nincluding depression (with 39.75\\% of posts indicating severe symptoms),\ndriving restrictions, workplace concerns, and pregnancy-related issues in women\nwith epilepsy. We introduce a novel engagement metric, F(P), which incorporates\npost length, sentiment scores, and readability to quantify community\ninteraction. This analysis underscores the importance of integrated care\naddressing both neurological and mental health challenges faced by PWE. The\ninsights from this study inform strategies for targeted support and awareness\ninterventions.\n",
