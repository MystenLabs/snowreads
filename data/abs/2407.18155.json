A key trend is the rise of custom VA embedding, which enables\nusers to perform the customized tasks of their favorite app through voice\ncontrol. However, with such a great demand, little effort has been made to\nsupport app developers in VA development. Moreover, many user-oriented VA\ncontrol approaches even increase the programming burden on developers. To\nreduce the workload and improve code efficiency, in this paper, we propose a\nnovel approach, Test2VA, that reuses the test code of an application to support\nits VA development. Specifically, Test2VA extracts the task completion pattern\nfrom the GUI test code and then generates an execution method to perform the\nsame task in general. To identify the pattern, Test2VA uses a mutation-based\nexploration to detect the mutable GUI event in the test case and later\nparameterize it in the VA method. We conducted an evaluation on 48 test cases\nfrom eight real-world applications. The results show that Test2VA correctly\ndetects 75.68% of the mutable events from 48 original test cases and then\ngenerates 33 methods and have them successfully executed and manually examined.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"8IWxJqnrllF7WIamIPuLZIxZz8pqICU_8eGIxL3wGwg","pdfSize":"1811095"}
