We consider Line of Sight (LoS) cone\nconstraints, thrust limits, thrust direction limits, and approach velocity\nconstraints during RVD missions in a near rectilinear halo orbit (NRHO) in the\nSun-Earth-Moon system. To enforce the constraints, the Time Shift Governor\n(TSG), which uses a time-shifted Chief spacecraft trajectory as a target\nreference for the Deputy spacecraft, is employed. The time shift is gradually\nreduced to zero so that the virtual target gradually evolves towards the Chief\nspacecraft as time goes by, and the RVD mission objective can be achieved.\nNumerical simulation results are reported to validate the proposed control\nmethod.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"E4g0aV-pTVZ--6j46iehSnthGjxW1QFUSc-z9xPbbFY","pdfSize":"1097470","objectId":"0xf24acafe34755fb8c8be8a9aa9da68d03ade29b1e267ab0cd6129a0b8150d6fb","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
