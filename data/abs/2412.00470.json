The captured dark matter\nforms a dark halo that eventually evaporates or annihilates. Theoretical\npulsation modes and observations of pulsating white dwarfs provide predictions\nabout their evolution. This motivates us to study the impact of sub-MeV\ninterstellar dark matter on the cooling processes of white dwarfs. In this\nwork, we consider the collisions between dark matter and relativistic\ndegenerate electrons inside white dwarfs, numerically calculating the energy\ninput and output results from scattering, capture, evaporation, and\nannihilation processes. Based on observational data from G117-B15, we conclude\nthat the maximum cooling luminosity of the interstellar sub-MeV dark matter is\napproximately $10^{22} \\, \\text{erg}/\\text{s}$, which is insufficient to\nprovide an effective cooling mechanism for white dwarfs. Finally, if future\nobservations detect a pulsating white dwarf in the Galactic center, the\npotential sensitivity of this scenario could extend to the\nregion$10^{-3}\\,\\text{MeV} < m_\\chi < 10 \\, \\text{MeV}$ and $6.02 \\times\n10^{-38}\\,\\text{cm}^2 > \\sigma_0 \\geq 1.5 \\times 10^{40} \\, \\text{cm}^2$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"u9aN_mnoaOeCunbjkSJAqDO07etrZZBsiJ4ShBU3v7I","pdfSize":"350753"}
