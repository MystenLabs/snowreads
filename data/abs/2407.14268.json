Given the resource-intensive nature of\ngathering evaluations on urban visual appeal through surveys or inquiries from\nresidents, there is a constant quest for automated solutions to streamline this\nprocess and support spatial planning. In this study, we applied an\noff-the-shelf AI model to automate the analysis of urban visual appeal, using\nover 1,800 Google Street View images of Helsinki, Finland. By incorporating the\nGPT-4 model with specified criteria, we assessed these images. Simultaneously,\n24 participants were asked to rate the images. Our results demonstrated a\nstrong alignment between GPT-4 and participant ratings, although geographic\ndisparities were noted. Specifically, GPT-4 showed a preference for suburban\nareas with significant greenery, contrasting with participants who found these\nareas less appealing. Conversely, in the city centre and densely populated\nurban regions of Helsinki, GPT-4 assigned lower visual appeal scores than\nparticipant ratings. While there was general agreement between AI and human\nassessments across various locations, GPT-4 struggled to incorporate contextual\nnuances into its ratings, unlike participants, who considered both context and\nfeatures of the urban environment. The study suggests that leveraging AI models\nlike GPT-4 allows spatial planners to gather insights into the visual appeal of\ndifferent areas efficiently, aiding decisions that enhance residents' and\ntravellers' satisfaction and mental health. Although AI models provide valuable\ninsights, human perspectives are essential for a comprehensive understanding of\nurban visual appeal. This will ensure that planning and design decisions\npromote healthy living environments effectively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"043GRs4ye2y2z1SKPU10ndWwztWLJohHpGVhgX0Dib0","pdfSize":"1754194"}
