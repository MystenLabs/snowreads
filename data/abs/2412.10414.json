We report initial results on\npredicting, explaining, and systematizing the explanations of predicted reports\non mental health concerns in people reporting Lyme disease concerns. We report\ninitial results on predicting future ADHD concerns for people reporting anxiety\ndisorder concerns, and demonstrate preliminary results on visualizing the\nexplanations for predicting that a person with anxiety concerns will in the\nfuture have ADHD concerns.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nXnalM0fuswYGsDUcueEzkDM25t9bsg7HKqlrfTRzC8","pdfSize":"125692"}
