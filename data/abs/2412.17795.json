They possess a natural geometric definition in contrast\nwith rather nontrivial structure. On the other hand, they are well-studied from\nthe perspective of number theory. Furthermore, there is a well-developed and\npowerful analytic technique available. We will use the square of the modular\ncurve as the experimental object to investigate the arithmetic properties of\nthe periods of mixed Hodge structures. There is an additional reason for this\nstudy: this square is naturally associated with a family of (Hecke) curves.\nThese curves form components of the Neron-Severi locus, allowing for the\ninterpretation of the square of the moduli curve as the moduli space of split\n(i.e., the product of two elliptic curves) abelian surfaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wTqnrQHwur2As-KorZuDqer0VwKBSMVjG227Vdxt3F0","pdfSize":"179492"}
