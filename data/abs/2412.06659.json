For a local ring\n$R$ and finitely generated $R$-modules $M$ and $N$, we provide conditions\ninvolving quasi-homological dimensions where the equality $\\sup \\lbrace i\\geq\n0: \\operatorname{Ext}_R^i(M,N)\\not=0 \\rbrace =\\operatorname{depth}\nR-\\operatorname{depth} M$, which we call Ischebeck's formula, holds. One of the\nresults in this direction generalizes a well-known result of Ischebeck\nconcerning modules of finite injective dimension, considering the\nquasi-injective dimension. On the other hand, we establish an inequality\nrelating the quasi-projective dimension of a finitely generated module to its\ngrade and introduce the concept of a quasi-perfect module as a natural\ngeneralization of a perfect module. We prove several results for this new\nconcept similar to the classical results. Additionally, we provide a formula\nfor the grade of finitely generated modules with finite quasi-injective\ndimension over a local ring, as well as grade inequalities for modules of\nfinite quasi-projective dimension. In our study, Cohen-Macaulayness criteria\nare also obtained.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"oEwsITQ3_-5eX75lMnai9A2Kfy9Q3flrlqk2xfTjzA0","pdfSize":"232264"}
