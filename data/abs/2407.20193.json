Such polydispersity is a welcome,\nbecause simple to perform, generalization of many theoretical approaches\ndeployed to predict percolation thresholds. These theoretical studies\nindependently found very similar conceptual results for vastly different\nsystems, namely, that the percolation threshold is insensitive to the\nparticular distribution controlling the polydispersity and rather depends only\non the first few moments of the distribution. In this article we explain this\nfrequently observed pattern using branching processes. The key observation is\nthat a reasonable degree of polydispersity does effectively not alter the\nstructure of the network that forms at the percolation threshold. As a\nconsequence, the critical parameters of the monodisperse system can be\nanalytically continued to account for polydispersity.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"d2xrxPbPTh356kpyJk51nfSrd7_RJ-UqzSv23vy7tMU","pdfSize":"1605079","objectId":"0x4d784703f8e0567cdc9bee9e04e998029c8a0901b94fa73c85f8672a8c779b7e","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
