However, current approaches that heavily rely on repeated\nLLM-driven HTML parsing are computationally expensive and error-prone,\nparticularly when handling dynamic web interfaces and multi-step tasks. To\novercome these challenges, we introduce PAFFA (Premeditated Actions For Fast\nAgents), a framework designed to enhance web interaction capabilities through\nan Action API Library of reusable, verified browser interaction functions. By\npre-computing interaction patterns and employing two core methodologies -\n\"Dist-Map\" for task-agnostic element distillation and \"Unravel\" for incremental\npage-wise exploration - PAFFA reduces inference calls by 87% while maintaining\nrobust performance even as website structures evolve. This framework\naccelerates multi-page task execution and offers a scalable solution to advance\nautonomous web agent research.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"TMIcOqPUF3NgDWWqELnqRg8U3UQv1IUuq-5pYQKsabE","pdfSize":"766010"}
