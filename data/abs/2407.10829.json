We describe BiasScanner, an application that aims\nto strengthen democracy by supporting news consumers with scrutinizing news\narticles they are reading online. BiasScanner contains a server-side\npre-trained large language model to identify biased sentences of news articles\nand a front-end Web browser plug-in. At the time of writing, BiasScanner can\nidentify and classify more than two dozen types of media bias at the sentence\nlevel, making it the most fine-grained model and only deployed application\n(automatic system in use) of its kind. It was implemented in a light-weight and\nprivacy-respecting manner, and in addition to highlighting likely biased\nsentence it also provides explanations for each classification decision as well\nas a summary analysis for each news article. While prior research has addressed\nnews bias detection, we are not aware of any work that resulted in a deployed\nbrowser plug-in (c.f. also biasscanner.org for a Web demo).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"_mXXUDk8X9uAucrn38MAbyUHtI_swaE3KblNvdnCuS0","pdfSize":"970153","objectId":"0x2c78a699894bb3d369cb76b087f48692964ebca43c72357974fb649936897c11","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
