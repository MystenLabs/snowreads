  "abstract": "  The primary objective of this paper is to derive sharp bounds for the norms\nof the Schwarzian and pre-Schwarzian derivatives in the Ozaki close-to-convex\nfunctions $f$, expressed in terms of their value $f^{\\prime\\prime}(0)$, in\nparticular, when the quantity is equal to zero. Additionally, we obtain sharp\nbounds for distortion and growth theorems. We will also derive the sharp bound\nof pre-Schwarzian norm for a certain class of harmonic mappings whose analytic\npart is fixed.\n",
