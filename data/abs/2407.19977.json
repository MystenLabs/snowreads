Path tracing\ninherently addresses these limitations but at the cost of increased rendering\ntime. Our work focuses on industrial applications where highly customizable\nproducts are common and real-time performance is not critical. We leverage\nWebGPU to implement path tracing on the web, integrating the OpenPBR standard\nfor physically-based material representation. The result is a near real-time\npath tracer capable of rendering high-fidelity 3D scenes directly in web\nbrowsers, eliminating the need for pregenerated assets. Our implementation\ndemonstrates the potential of WebGPU for advanced rendering techniques and\nopens new possibilities for web-based 3D visualization in industrial\napplications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"feSl6micMOQbma4HGu0C-f__s6pUvrYCR1VyIi7GxfU","pdfSize":"9950356","objectId":"0x69ac5a9fa9306716f73a5f10eb06af33887ecf5c8d92abfa5aa74225d0742468","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
