  "abstract": "  Correlations between event-by-event fluctuations of anisotropic flow\nharmonics are measured in Pb-Pb collisions at a center-of-mass energy per\nnucleon pair of 5.02 TeV, as recorded by the ALICE detector at the LHC. This\nstudy presents correlations up to the hexagonal flow harmonic, $v_6$, which was\nmeasured for the first time. The magnitudes of these higher-order correlations\nare found to vary as a function of collision centrality and harmonic order.\nThese measurements are compared to viscous hydrodynamic model calculations with\nEKRT initial conditions and to the iEBE-VISHNU model with TRENTo initial\nconditions. The observed discrepancies between the data and the model\ncalculations vary depending on the harmonic combinations. Due to the\nsensitivity of model parameters estimated with Bayesian analyses to these\nhigher-order observables, the results presented in this work provide new and\nindependent constraints on the initial conditions and transport properties in\ntheoretical models used to describe the system created in heavy-ion collisions.\n",
