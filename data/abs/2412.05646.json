In this paper, we present the star formation history (SFH)\nwithin a field with a radius of 3 kpc, beyond the optical body of the galaxy\n(1.2 kpc). We utilized a novel method based on evolved asymptotic giant branch\n(AGB) stars. We collected the Near infrared data of 329 variable stars,\nincluding long-period and amplitude variables and Carbon-rich AGB stars. We\nused stellar evolutionary track and theoretical isochrones to obtain the birth\nmass, age, and pulsation duration of the detected stars to calculate the star\nformation rate (SFR) and trace the SFH of the galaxy. We studied the star\nformation history of the galaxy for the mean metallicity value (Z) of 0.003. We\nreconstructed the SFH for two regions. The bar region, a central rectangular\narea, and the outer region, which covers a circular field beyond the bar region\nand extends to a radius of 3 kpc. Our results show a significant burst of star\nformation around 2.6 and 2.9 Gyr ago in the bar and outer regions,\nrespectively. Additionally, we observed a notable enhancement in the SFR in the\nbar region over the past 200 Myr.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Jm6ijw6aGTOBAwRaBsJ85n20P1dG6Qy7YAhU8pP8wHo","pdfSize":"1771790"}
