The central fact of this approach is the isomorphism between\nvanishing cycles of multiplicative convolution of certain perverse sheaves and\nthe tensor product of vanishing cycles, which may be written in two different\nways. These isomorphisms depend on a choice of a functorial isomorphism\n$\\varphi$ between vanishing cycles of a perverse sheaf on $\\mathbb{C}^*$ and\ncohomology of its certain extension on $\\mathbb{P}^1$. The isomorphism chosen\nin the present paper guarantees compatibilities with the isomorphisms.\n  In the second part of the project, we will study other choices of $\\varphi$.\nWe will see that its compatibilities with convolution imply regularized double\nshuffle relations. In particular, associator relations imply them.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-mpZV2e3AhPo0oZQ5PFtuvUJ6VxM0RBexDcdR6EWDPY","pdfSize":"247910"}
