Regional, national, and local\ngovernments are taking measures to regulate and measure the impact of automated\ndecision-making systems (ADMS). This research focuses on the use and adoption\nof ADMS in European public administrations to understand how these systems have\nbeen transforming the roles, tasks, and duties of street-level bureaucrats. We\nconducted a qualitative study in which we interviewed street-level bureaucrats\nfrom three administrations who had used an ADMS for several years, which was\nembedded in their daily work routines. The outcome of our research is an\nanalysis of five dimensions of how collaborative work, the organizational\nsettings, the capacities of bureaucrats and the implementation of the ADMS\nenable or limit the capacities for offering better services towards the\ncitizens.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"xu9-yq43owLtnmKEcaAY8H5tF5fISwPfCJ2Cs5Justo","pdfSize":"544980"}
