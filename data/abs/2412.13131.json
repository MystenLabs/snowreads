We supplement the JWST analysis pipeline with additional masks to\nremove pixels with high-energy background events. For a 0.4% subcomponent of\ndark matter that interacts with an ultralight dark photon, we disfavor all\npreviously allowed parameter space at high cross sections, and constrain some\nparameter regions for subcomponent fractions as low as $\\sim$0.01%.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"V5VxwaLMZ561_oW3sHViGLqAMyFvKN0PbO0lRA2C07A","pdfSize":"3947544"}
