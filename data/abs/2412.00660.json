  "abstract": "  Understanding and quantifying entanglement entropy is crucial to characterize\nthe quantum behaviors that drive phenomena in a variety of systems. Rare-earth\nspin complexes, with their unique magnetic properties, provide fertile ground\nfor exploring these nonlocal correlations. In this work, we study Eu$^{2+}$\nions deposited on a Au(111) substrate, modeling finite clusters of large\nspin-moments using a Heisenberg Hamiltonian parameterized by first-principles\ncalculations. Our analysis reveals a one-to-one correspondence between\nstructures in the differential conductance profiles and changes in the von\nNeumann entanglement entropy of bipartite subsystems, influenced by probe-ion\nseparation and applied magnetic fields. Distinct braiding patterns in the\nconductance profiles are shown to correspond to stepwise changes in the\nentanglement entropy, providing a new avenue for investigating quantum\ncorrelations. These results establish a foundation for experimentally probing\nand controlling entanglement in lanthanide-based systems, with potential\napplications in quantum technologies.\n",
