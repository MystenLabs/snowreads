  "abstract": "  In this note, we improve some concentration inequalities for martingales with\nbounded increments. These results recover the missing factor in Freedman-style\ninequalities and are near optimal. We also provide minor refinements of\nconcentration inequalities for functions of independent random variables. These\nproofs use techniques from the works of Bentkus and Pinelis.\n",
