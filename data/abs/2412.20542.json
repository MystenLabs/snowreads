These results recover the missing factor in Freedman-style\ninequalities and are near optimal. We also provide minor refinements of\nconcentration inequalities for functions of independent random variables. These\nproofs use techniques from the works of Bentkus and Pinelis.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"4GXewvh5D4hRZkTKTjrcr3xD7PGyg2wSrVkGREMBsA8","pdfSize":"248999"}
