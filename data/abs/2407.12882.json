However, when it comes to authorship verification (AV)\ntasks, which involve determining whether two given texts share the same\nauthorship, even advanced models like ChatGPT exhibit notable limitations. This\npaper introduces a novel approach, termed InstructAV, for authorship\nverification. This approach utilizes LLMs in conjunction with a\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method to simultaneously improve\naccuracy and explainability. The distinctiveness of InstructAV lies in its\nability to align classification decisions with transparent and understandable\nexplanations, representing a significant progression in the field of authorship\nverification. Through comprehensive experiments conducted across various\ndatasets, InstructAV demonstrates its state-of-the-art performance on the AV\ntask, offering high classification accuracy coupled with enhanced explanation\nreliability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HbR2AXpbBRvFjr9HVrgtBhKKRVDnmUhFHmrRHzeOkv0","pdfSize":"353390","objectId":"0xe1051e9aa0cf985ce8728208a4fcb38da1adff0c36109479f95ce15edfbbf6ed","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
