Within repeater nodes, reliably performing entanglement\nswapping is a key component of scalable quantum communication. To tackle the\nchallenge of probabilistic Bell state measurement in linear optics, which often\nleads to information loss, various approaches have been proposed to ensure the\nloss tolerance of distributing a single ebit. We have generalized previous work\nregarding repeater graph states with elaborate connectivity, enabling the\nefficient establishment of exploitable ebits at a finite rate with high\nprobability. We demonstrate that our new scheme significantly outperforms the\nprevious work with much flexibility and discuss the generation overhead of such\nresource states. These findings offer new insights into the scalability and\nreliability of loss-tolerant quantum networks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xA2mzXCcqyHP--v7eAAnhCLzehdpnC7P7I8lGLPqEHY","pdfSize":"1940847"}
