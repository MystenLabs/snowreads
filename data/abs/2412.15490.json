  "abstract": "  We are motivated by studying a boundary-value problem for a class of\nsemilinear degenerate elliptic equations\n  \\begin{align}\\tag{P}\\label{P}\n  \\begin{cases}\n  - \\Delta_x u - |x|^{2\\alpha} \\dfrac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} = f(x,y,u), &\n\\textrm{in } \\Omega,\n  u = 0, & \\textrm{on } \\partial \\Omega,\n  \\end{cases}\n  \\end{align}\n  where $x = (x_1, x_2) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, $\\Omega$ is a bounded smooth domain\nin $\\mathbb{R}^3$, $(0,0,0) \\in \\Omega $, and $\\alpha > 0$.\n  In this paper, we will study this problem by establishing embedding theorems\nfor weighted Sobolev spaces. To this end, we need a new P\\'olya-Szeg\\\"o type\ninequality, which can be obtained by studying an isoperimetric problem for the\ncorresponding weighted area. Our results then extend the existing ones in\n\\cite{nga, Luyen2} to the three-dimensional context.\n",
