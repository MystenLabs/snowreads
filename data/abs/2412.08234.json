Given a set of\nsystems,one participant per system is chosen to play the role of an interface.\nWhen systems are composed, the interface participants are replaced by gateways\nwhich communicate to each other by forwarding messages. The PaI-approach for\nsystems of asynchronous communicating finite state machines (CFSMs) has been\nexploited in the literature for binary composition only, with a (necessarily)\nunique forwarding policy. In this paper we consider the case of multiple system\ncomposition when forwarding gateways are not uniquely determined and their\ninteractions depend on specific connection policies complying with a connection\nmodel. We represent connection policies as CFSM systems and prove that a bunch\nof relevant communication properties (deadlock-freeness,\nreception-error-freeness, etc.) are preserved by PaI multicomposition, with the\nproviso that also the used connection policy does enjoy the communication\nproperty taken into account.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WDsA-BDEVttNsMaGKL7nWI259QyOa2R4KdgFVq9uVYQ","pdfSize":"293065"}
