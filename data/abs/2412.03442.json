These works typically learn a model from unlabeled\ndata and compute anomaly scores for arbitrary traces based on their likelihood\nof occurrence or how well they fit within the model. However, these methods do\nnot dynamically adapt their scores based on the traces seen at test time. This\nbecomes a problem when an adversary produces seemingly common traces in their\nattack, causing the model to miss the detection by assigning low anomaly\nscores. We propose SEQUENT, a new approach that uses the state visit frequency\nto adapt its scoring for anomaly detection dynamically. SEQUENT subsequently\nuses the scores to generate root causes for anomalies. These allow the grouping\nof alarms and simplify the analysis of anomalies. Our evaluation of SEQUENT on\nthree NetFlow datasets indicates that our approach outperforms existing\nmethods, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting anomalies.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"S6KkAQqUxHavijvOF4jSkN06jpS-Eupmr8-hQk3OeOM","pdfSize":"3600936"}
