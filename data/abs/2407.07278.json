We introduce a method to identify time-parameterised\nfamilies of almost-invariant sets in time-dependent dynamical systems, as well\nas the families' emergence and disappearance. In contrast to coherent sets,\nwhich may freely move about in phase space over time, our technique focuses on\nfamilies of metastable sets that are quasi-stationary in space. Our\nstraightforward approach extends successful transfer operator methods for\nalmost-invariant sets to time-dependent dynamics and utilises the Ulam scheme\nfor the generator of the transfer operator on a time-expanded domain. The new\nmethodology is illustrated with an idealised fluid flow and with atmospheric\nvelocity data. We identify atmospheric blocking events in the 2003 European\nheatwave and compare our technique to existing geophysical methods of blocking\ndiagnosis.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"sr4lsfeLBUVT52QBWo6eYwa3mHjehXwgKaFKCP7R8Rw","pdfSize":"37105733"}
