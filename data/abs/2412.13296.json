  "abstract": "  Computing internships are the most common way for students to gain practical\nreal-world experience. Internships have become a major part of most computing\ncurricula because they help match student abilities or expectations with the\ndemand of the workforce. The internship experience for students vary due to\ndiverse factors such misconceptions about industrial realities, level of\npreparation, networking opportunities and so on. This papers attempts to\nprovide insights into students discussions and opinions related to internship.\nWe extracted 143,912 online Reddit posts related to computing internships out\nof 921,845 posts containing the rootword \"intern\", and then used topic\nmodelling to unravel the common themes in the discussions. Next, we applied\nsentiment analysis techniques to understand the feelings expressed by the\nstudents in the Reddit posts. The results show that computing interns generally\nexpress a positive sentiment and the discussions were mostly related to\nacademics, school admissions, professional career, entertainment activities,\nand social interactions.\n",
