Recently, it has been argued that the features of the medium's\nback-reaction to the jet could be cleanly imprinted in the correlations of\nasymptotic energy flows, in principle allowing to isolate this signal from\nother uncorrelated physical processes. Nonetheless, the current limited\ntheoretical understanding of these jet observables in heavy-ion collisions\nconstrains their applicability as probes of the medium (hydro)dynamics. In this\nwork, we provide an analytic picture for the medium back-reaction's effect on\nthe energy flux and two point energy correlator. We show that the medium\nresponse leads to the emergence of an universal classical scaling law,\ncompeting with the perturbative QCD contribution at large angles. Comparing the\nassociated correlator to recent experimental measurements, we find that the\nobserved large angle features can be qualitatively described by a purely\nhydrodynamically driven response and its interplay with the hard jet component.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XZOekkwftL-m6-bugD0Ht96V_yGbdOiidBNgp0Y02ik","pdfSize":"1617656"}
