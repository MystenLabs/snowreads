These values are known as the Chv\\'{a}tal-Sankoff constants, and\ndetermining their exact values is a well-known open problem. Upper and lower\nbounds are known for some combinations of $\\sigma$ and $d$, with the best lower\nand upper bounds for the most studied case, $\\sigma=2, d=2$, at $0.788071$ and\n$0.826280$, respectively. Building off previous algorithms for lower-bounding\nthe constants, we implement runtime optimizations, parallelization, and an\nefficient memory reading and writing scheme to obtain an improved lower bound\nof $0.792665992$ for $\\sigma=2, d=2$. We additionally improve upon almost all\npreviously reported lower bounds for the Chv\\'{a}tal-Sankoff constants when\neither the size of alphabet, the number of strings, or both are larger than 2.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"etfoYonzGnnqE69TF4Wqa_-FZqF2U_ENdZJ25vwv5XY","pdfSize":"265902"}
