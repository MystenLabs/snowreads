These are code states of\nGottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes. We show that for an n-mode system, the\nset of all GKP states forms a rigged continuous-variable state 2-design. We use\nthese lattice state designs to construct a continuous variable shadow\ntomography protocol, derive sample complexity bounds for both global- and local\nGKP shadows under reasonable physical assumptions, and provide the physical\ngadgets needed to implement this protocol.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computer Science/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory","Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Rn3pwLNbukViHZiwXGgSneWG8DC6tgchGT1z5HwZOtk","pdfSize":"1108181"}
