In\nthis work we leverage PersonaHub, a collection of synthetic persona\ndescriptions, to map the political distribution of persona-based prompted LLMs\nusing the Political Compass Test (PCT). We then examine whether these initial\ncompass distributions can be manipulated through explicit ideological prompting\ntowards diametrically opposed political orientations: right-authoritarian and\nleft-libertarian. Our experiments reveal that synthetic personas predominantly\ncluster in the left-libertarian quadrant, with models demonstrating varying\ndegrees of responsiveness when prompted with explicit ideological descriptors.\nWhile all models demonstrate significant shifts towards right-authoritarian\npositions, they exhibit more limited shifts towards left-libertarian positions,\nsuggesting an asymmetric response to ideological manipulation that may reflect\ninherent biases in model training.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fJwLqOm_n8AWqHPPsTD6IEGd37pSlASgLlxrPVTNmMQ","pdfSize":"1513184"}
