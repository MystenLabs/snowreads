One of the core competitive advantages of fresh food e-commerce\nplatforms lies in selecting an appropriate logistics distribution model. This\nstudy focuses on the front warehouse model, aiming to minimize distribution\ncosts. Considering the perishable nature and short shelf life of fresh food, a\ndistribution route optimization model is constructed, and the saving mileage\nmethod is designed to determine the optimal distribution scheme. The results\nindicate that under certain conditions, different distribution schemes\nsignificantly impact the performance of fresh food e-commerce platforms. Based\non a review of domestic and international research, this paper takes Dingdong\nMaicai as an example to systematically introduce the basic concepts of\ndistribution route optimization in fresh food e-commerce platforms under the\nfront warehouse model, analyze the advantages of logistics distribution, and\nthoroughly examine the importance of distribution routes for fresh products.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"BmD5BTPSKMYEzAP4SzNR05AYy6dfLm_ZrTic8hPc2uw","pdfSize":"402676"}
