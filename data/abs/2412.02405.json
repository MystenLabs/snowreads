Conventionally, it is\nbelieved that the matter generated in relativistic heavy-ion collisions starts\nto behave as a fluid all at once at some initial time. However, it is by no\nmeans trivial how soon after the first contact of two high-energy nuclei the\nfluid picture can be applied. It is demonstrated that one-dimensional expanding\nviscous fluids violate the necessary and the sufficient conditions of nonlinear\ncausality at large departures from local equilibrium. We therefore quantify the\ninverse Reynolds number to justify the hydrodynamic description to be valid.\nThe initial conditions are strictly constrained not to violate the causality\nconditions during the time evolution. With the help of the transverse energies\nper rapidity measured at RHIC and LHC, we obtain the minimum initial proper\ntime and the maximum energy density allowed by nonlinear causality. This\nanalysis strongly suggests that the initial stage of relativistic heavy-ion\ncollisions needs to be described by a non-equilibrium description other than\nthe framework of relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EVMKjhoI0dYpcjMD78s91digoOGt4vn8GMluPR97iGI","pdfSize":"1777994"}
