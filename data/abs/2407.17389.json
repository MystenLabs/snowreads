The\nqubits are modeled as Unruh-DeWitt detectors coupled to a massless scalar\nfield. We introduce a Heisenberg $XY$-interaction between the qubits that\nenhances the generation of quantum correlations. It is supposed that the qubits\nbegin at a general mixed state described by a density operator with no\nentanglement while the field stays at its vacuum state. In this way, we find\nthe general properties and conditions to create entanglement between the qubits\nby exploiting the field vacuum fluctuations. We quantify the qubits\nentanglement using the Negativity measure based on the Peres-Horodecki positive\npartial transpose criterion. We find that the Cosmic String would increase the\nentanglement harvesting when both qubits are near the Cosmic String. When the\nqubits locations are far from the Cosmic String we recover the usual results\nfor Minkowski space. The Heisenberg $XY$-interaction enhance the entanglement\nharvesting irrespective of the coupling nature (ferromagnetic or\nanti-ferromagnetic). When the qubits are far apart from each other we find a\nmaximum entanglement harvesting at the resonance points between the Heisenberg\ncoupling constant and the qubits energy gap.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rIbnSzbxbYVthm9KBH26Vta1NcW1-VOy4xkag4O7o9w","pdfSize":"20405969"}
