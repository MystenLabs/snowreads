  "abstract": "  Photocurrent-induced harmonics appear in gases and solids due to tunnel\nionization of electrons in strong fields and subsequent acceleration. In\ncontrast to three-step harmonic emission, no return to the parent ions is\nnecessary. Here we show that the same mechanism produces harmonics in metallic\nnanostructures in strong fields. Furthermore, we demonstrate how strong local\nfield gradient, appearing as a consequence of the field enhancement, affects\nphotocurrent-induced harmonics. This influence can shed light at the state of\nelectron as it appears in the continuum, in particular, to its initial\nvelocity.\n",
