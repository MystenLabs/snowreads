However,\nthis trend is broken at the end of solar cycle 24. In this paper, we analyze\nthe shift of the HCS by using information obtained from coronal model and\ninsitu data provide by the near-Earth OMNI database and the Parker Solar Probe\n(PSP). Coronal potential field source surface (PFSS) modeling results show that\nthe northward shift is established at the beginning of 2018 and remains stable\nfor about two years. Interplanetary magnetic field data obtained from and\nwithin 1 au also support the northward shift, as the southern polarity T\nappears more frequently than the northern polarity A between 2018-2020. Both\nmodel results and insitu observation obtained by PSP imply that the HCS shift\nis established in the corona, and then propagates into the heliosphere. The\nquadrupole term still has a significant influence on the formation of the HCS\nshift.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"2o-Ia_lgrNwrbynPsAQFd-jD8IDfG90rOIsNXB4mNfA","pdfSize":"1023865"}
