  "abstract": "  Entanglement of bipartite squeezed states generated by holomorphic Hermite\nfunctions of two complex variables is investigated using phase-space approach\nbased on the Wigner distribution function. Orthogonality of the holomorphic\nHermite functions implies the relationship between certain real parameter\nassociated with the non-rotational measure in the Bargmann space and the\nsqueezing parameter. The mutual relation between squeezing and entanglement is\nelucidated with the help of Peres-Horodecki positive partial transpose\ncriterion formulated in the phase-space version for continuous-variable\nsystems. The quantitative characteristics of the entanglement is determined\nusing the log-negativity criterion. The oscillator-like model of a two-particle\nquantum-mechanical system is developed to illustrate the presented findings.\n",
