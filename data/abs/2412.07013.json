One consequence is the\nprecise incorporation of canonical linear spin wave theory within the\ntime-dependent Hartree-Fock framework, as pure localization emerges from\nitinerant dynamics. This embedding method generalizes to all spin-1/2 models\nand is expected to extend to multi-orbital systems. Away from half-filling,\ndifferential tuning of doublon and holon motion imparts asymmetry to ordering\nand fluctuations. This suggests that, in effective electronic theories, kinetic\ninteraction couplings are as significant as underlying band parameters when\nmodeling asymmetric phenomena near the Mott insulator.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VcOLeY9Ns_tSwqohVGUpq_sRI5xfdj0vzDhz7s332HE","pdfSize":"1041554"}
