The class lies in equivariant rational homology and its\nrestriction to the trivial group is the Goresky-MacPherson L-class. For a\nsmooth action on a manifold, the class is equivariantly Poincar\\'e dual to the\nHirzebruch L-class of the Borel homotopy quotient of the tangent bundle. We\nalso provide a product formula under the equivariant K\\\"unneth isomorphism. If\nthe group acts freely, then the equivariant L-class identifies with the\nGoresky-MacPherson L-class of the orbit space. The construction method rests on\nestablishing Whitney (B)-regularity for finite-dimensional compact\npseudomanifold approximations to the Borel construction, and on the author's\nVerdier-Riemann-Roch type formulae for the Goresky-MacPherson L-class.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RgJvI1yBHLnChNJaPho-5SBuy6piLDRbJlN7BM767WM","pdfSize":"565146"}
