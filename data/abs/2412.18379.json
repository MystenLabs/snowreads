Relying on the successive neighbor search (SNS) method for particle\ntracking, the L-E approaches face increasing computational and parallel\noverhead as simulations grow in scale. This issue arises primarily because the\nSNS method requires lengthy tracking paths, which incur intensive\ninter-processor communications. The proposed method, termed the CNN-SNS method,\naddresses this issue by approximating the spatial mapping between reference\nframes through the CNN. Initiating the SNS method from CNN predictions shortens\nthe tracking paths without compromising accuracy and consequently achieves\nsuperior parallel scalability. Numerical tests demonstrate that the CNN-SNS\nmethod exhibits increasing computational advantages over the SNS method in\nlarge-scale, high-velocity flow fields. As the resolution and parallelization\nscale up, the CNN-SNS method achieves reductions of 95.8% in tracking path\nlength and 97.0% in computational time.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"H44e9e2Uz5HNvqEPcYJ_cn1a3H7o3CW0lbhqQj4xlfw","pdfSize":"12490219"}
