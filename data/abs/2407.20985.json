By\nanalyzing local magnetizations, we estimate the size of the thermalized sector\nof the chain and find that it increases logarithmically slowly in time. This\nlogarithmically slow propagation of the thermalization front allows us to lower\nbound the slowest thermalization time, and find a broad parameter range where\nit scales fast enough with the system size that MBL is robust against\nthermalization induced by avalanches. The further finding that the imbalance --\na global quantity measuring localization -- thermalizes over a time scale\nexponential both in disorder strength and system size is in agreement with\nthese results.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MiFNK4x-mBEmZBZO52wK373NzUyBRsSnO-3haAr-YWA","pdfSize":"4214228"}
