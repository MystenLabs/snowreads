Additionally, we prove\nthat weak metric spaces, those without symmetry, also have this property if we\nfix the direction in which we take their distances from the centers of the\nballs. We use this to prove that the minimum radius ball problem is LP type in\nthe Hilbert and Thompson metrics and Funk weak metric. In doing so, we\ncontribute a proof that the topology induced by the Thompson metric coincides\nwith the Hilbert. We provide explicit primitives for computing the minimum\nradius ball in the Hilbert metric.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computational Geometry","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1CEp4mOibN_B_tzt0u-Cnph7C_hX7VVqOEvWagPDbBM","pdfSize":"612236"}
