The\nwell-known state-of-the-art methods and tools do not support seamless\nmonitoring of bare-metal, low-cost infrastructures, neither hosted nor\nvirtualized services with fine-grained details. This work proposes VIrtualized\nNEtwork VIsion architecture (VINEVI), an intelligent method for seamless\nmonitoring heterogeneous infrastructures and applications. The VINEVI\narchitecture advances state of the art with a node-embedded traffic\nclassification agent placing physical and virtualized infrastructures enabling\nreal-time traffic classification. VINEVI combines this real-time traffic\nclassification with well-known tools such as Prometheus and Victoria Metrics to\nmonitor the entire stack from the hardware to the virtualized applications.\nExperimental results showcased that VINEVI architecture allowed seamless\nheterogeneous infrastructure monitoring with a higher level of detail beyond\nliterature. Also, our node-embedded real-time Internet traffic classifier\nevolved with flexibility the methods with monitoring heterogeneous\ninfrastructures seamlessly.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"B21CbN58Y_CKWbzzqzgd2__FW_MIUEvtQKs9Rtypvsc","pdfSize":"2237272"}
