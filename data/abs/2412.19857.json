MBE is widely used in the manufacture of semiconductor\ndevices, including transistors, and it is considered one of the fundamental\ntools for the development of the nanotechnologies. We have used Kinetic Monte\nCarlo (KMC) simulation technique to study the crystal growth during Molecular\nBeam Epitaxy (MBE). KMC is used to simulate the physical phenomena in which the\nprobable events are selected by using pseudo random numbers. In this work, we\nhave studied the effect of strain at various fixed coverage values, with the\nmodel which includes varying strain-driven detachment on average island\nmorphology, average island density, relative width distribution and island size\ndistributions. Our simulation results demonstrate that growth on a patterned\nimpurity surface with inclusion of varying strain-driven detachment resulted in\nimprovement the spatial ordering on island morphologies and the size\ndistribution of the islands.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JhTCC2LIChZQq0E5p5_P1yulXR6H_GgVy-hLvWL2n5U","pdfSize":"2891851"}
