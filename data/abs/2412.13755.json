The ALICE O$^2$ Event Processing Nodes (EPN) project performs online\ndata reconstruction using GPUs (Graphic Processing Units) instead of CPUs and\napplies an efficient, entropy-based, online data compression to cope with PbPb\ncollision data at a 50 kHz hadronic interaction rate. Also, the O$^2$ EPN farm\ninfrastructure features an energy efficient, environmentally friendly,\nadiabatic cooling system which allows for operational and capital cost savings.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"m6ActbS7_X1E1HDn9hzSNtFaCrQAHfCYuYsGNDR41cY","pdfSize":"3598280"}
