To achieve this, we\ndescribe the transition probabilities that underlie the system's stochastic\nnature. We also derive the Fokker-Planck equations for the density distribution\nof the number of agents in the system and solve these equations for specific\ncases.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Multiagent Systems","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0gYePGe9tzifmV7fmyCwG5jGMNNtB-746ffQVig9MJM","pdfSize":"782720"}
