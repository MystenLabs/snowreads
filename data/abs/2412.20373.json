Most\nexisting drug repurposing studies using real-world patient data often treat the\nentire population as homogeneous, ignoring the heterogeneity of treatment\nresponses across patient subgroups. This approach may overlook promising drugs\nthat benefit specific subgroups but lack notable treatment effects across the\nentire population, potentially limiting the number of repurposable candidates\nidentified. To address this, we introduce STEDR, a novel drug repurposing\nframework that integrates subgroup analysis with treatment effect estimation.\nOur approach first identifies repurposing candidates by emulating multiple\nclinical trials on real-world patient data and then characterizes patient\nsubgroups by learning subgroup-specific treatment effects. We deploy \\model to\nAlzheimer's Disease (AD), a condition with few approved drugs and known\nheterogeneity in treatment responses. We emulate trials for over one thousand\nmedications on a large-scale real-world database covering over 8 million\npatients, identifying 14 drug candidates with beneficial effects to AD in\ncharacterized subgroups. Experiments demonstrate STEDR's superior capability in\nidentifying repurposing candidates compared to existing approaches.\nAdditionally, our method can characterize clinically relevant patient subgroups\nassociated with important AD-related risk factors, paving the way for precision\ndrug repurposing.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"ijUg5lwwhbY1-1CBZT9OV5bv-HfVqvT_GHQ4GgXqw2k","pdfSize":"4949117"}
