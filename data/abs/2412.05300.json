This tool aims to have\nthe following features: -Calculation of user specified derivatives of arbitrary\norder -To be able to run with similar speeds as handwritten code -All\nderivatives calculations are computed in a single backpropagation tree pass -No\nsource code generation is used, relying heavily on the C++ compiler to\nstatically build the computation tree before runtime -A simple interface -The\nability to be used \\textit{in conjunction} with other established,\ngeneral-purpose dynamic AD tools -Header-only library, with no external\ndependencies -Open source, with a business-friendly license\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Mathematical Software","Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Ls7N2HfzJ9J8nJMUM6kcNzj9AfLFIuVMvpCyQnnjETc","pdfSize":"219807"}
