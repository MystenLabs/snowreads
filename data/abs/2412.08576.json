Even in\nthe case of recurrences with constant coefficients, it is known to be decidable\nonly for order up to~5. We consider a large class of linear recurrences of\narbitrary order, with polynomial coefficients, for which an algorithm decides\npositivity for initial conditions outside of a hyperplane. The underlying\nalgorithm constructs a cone, contracted by the recurrence operator, that allows\na proof of positivity by induction. The existence and construction of such\ncones relies on the extension of the classical Perron-Frobenius theory to\nmatrices leaving a cone invariant.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Symbolic Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yQmkboWN_MIhcU9RG0iADoAYKgP2cLzPriFNK2kP5no","pdfSize":"993663"}
