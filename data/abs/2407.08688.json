A celebrated\ncompleteness result by Kozen introduced Kleene algebra (with tests) as a\nubiquitous tool for lightweight reasoning about program equivalence, and yet,\nnumerous variants of it came along afterwards to answer the demand for more\nrefined flavors of semantics, such as stateful, concurrent, exceptional,\nhybrid, branching time, etc. We detach Kleene iteration from Kleene algebra and\nanalyze it from the categorical perspective. The notion, we arrive at is that\nof Kleene-iteration category (with coproducts and tests), which we show to be\ngeneral and robust in the sense of compatibility with programming language\nfeatures, such as exceptions, store, concurrent behavior, etc. We attest the\nproposed notion w.r.t. various yardsticks, most importantly, by characterizing\nthe free model as a certain category of (nondeterministic) rational trees.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"OrX7CrOXqu5pvaE642u4Z0cljj1pA5BJI-y0XbdDe4Y","pdfSize":"873819"}
