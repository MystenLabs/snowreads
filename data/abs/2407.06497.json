Typically, Bayesian designs in such settings are obtained by maximising\nthe expected value of a utility function that is derived from the joint\nprobability distribution of the parameters and the response, given prior\ninformation about an appropriate ODE. However, in practice, appropriately\ndefining such information \\textit{a priori} can be difficult due to incomplete\nknowledge about the mechanisms that govern how the process evolves over time.\nIn this paper, we propose a method for finding Bayesian designs based on a\nflexible class of ODEs. Specifically, we consider the inclusion of spline terms\ninto ODEs to provide flexibility in modelling how the process changes over\ntime. We then propose to leverage this flexibility to form designs that are\nefficient even when the prior information is misspecified. Our approach is\nmotivated by a sampling problem in agriculture where the goal is to provide a\nbetter understanding of fruit growth where prior information is based on\nstudies conducted overseas, and therefore is potentially misspecified.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"O37by1lW62tqFhcUny_dldP9Em1R4QF-m6prtwoANtg","pdfSize":"2921026"}
