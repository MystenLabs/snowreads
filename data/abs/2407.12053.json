AlphaFlow stands out as a\nsequence-conditioned generative model that introduces flexibility into\nstructure prediction models by fine-tuning AlphaFold under the flow-matching\nframework. Despite the advantages of efficient sampling afforded by\nflow-matching, AlphaFlow still requires multiple runs of AlphaFold to finally\ngenerate one single conformation. Due to the heavy consumption of AlphaFold,\nits applicability is limited in sampling larger set of protein ensembles or the\nlonger chains within a constrained timeframe. In this work, we propose a\nfeature-conditioned generative model called AlphaFlow-Lit to realize efficient\nprotein ensembles generation. In contrast to the full fine-tuning on the entire\nstructure, we focus solely on the light-weight structure module to reconstruct\nthe conformation. AlphaFlow-Lit performs on-par with AlphaFlow and surpasses\nits distilled version without pretraining, all while achieving a significant\nsampling acceleration of around 47 times. The advancement in efficiency\nshowcases the potential of AlphaFlow-Lit in enabling faster and more scalable\ngeneration of protein ensembles.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1JuQ_U-ticsEzjE6apFf1mwPg7WBgieSxBss8vi178g","pdfSize":"4506296"}
