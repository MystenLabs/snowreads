  "abstract": "  Quantum battery concerns about population redistribution and energy dispatch\nover controllable quantum systems. Under unitary transformation, ergotropy\nrather than energy plays an essential role in describing the accumulated useful\nwork. Thus, the charging and recharging of quantum batteries are distinct from\nthe electric-energy input and reuse of classical batteries. In this work, we\nfocus on recharging a three-level quantum battery that has been exhausted under\nself-discharging and work extraction. We find that the quantum battery cannot\nbe fully refreshed with the maximum ergotropy only by the driving pulses for\nunitary charging. For an efficient refreshment of the quantum battery, we\npropose a fast and stable recharging protocol based on postselection and\nshortcut to adiabaticity. More than accelerating the adiabatic passage for\ncharging, the protocol can eliminate unextractable energy and is robust against\ndriving errors and environmental decoherence. Our protocol is energy-saving and\nexperimental-feasible, even in systems with the forbidden transition.\n",
