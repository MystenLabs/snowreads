  "abstract": "  A non-uniqueness phase for infinite clusters is proven for a class of marked\nrandom connection models on the $d$-dimensional hyperbolic space,\n${\\mathbb{H}^d}$, in a high volume-scaling regime. The approach taken in this\npaper utilizes the spherical transform on ${\\mathbb{H}^d}$ to diagonalize\nconvolution by the adjacency function and the two-point function and bound\ntheir $L^2\\to L^2$ operator norms. Under some circumstances, this spherical\ntransform approach also provides bounds on the triangle diagram that allows for\na derivation of certain mean-field critical exponents. In particular, the\nresults are applied to some Boolean and weight-dependent hyperbolic random\nconnection models. While most of the paper is concerned with the high\nvolume-scaling regime, the existence of the non-uniqueness phase is also proven\nwithout this scaling for some random connection models whose resulting graphs\nare almost surely not locally finite.\n",
