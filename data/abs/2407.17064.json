This requires not\nonly object recognition but also the assignment of certain properties to them.\nWith the help of this information, causally related actions can be adapted to\ndifferent circumstances. Such logical interactions can be optimized by\nrecognizing object-assigned properties. Density as a physical property offers\nthe possibility to recognize how heavy an object is, which material it is made\nof, which forces are at work, and consequently which influence it has on its\nenvironment. Our approach introduces an AI-based concept for assigning physical\nproperties to objects through the use of associated images. Based on\nsynthesized data, we derive specific patterns from 2D images using a neural\nnetwork to extract further information such as volume, material, or density.\nAccordingly, we discuss the possibilities of property-based feature extraction\nto improve causally related logics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ivFU6r-psEVzRc5LXu1jGxdvfJTvRk40mpmZgUs2J5M","pdfSize":"2039374"}
