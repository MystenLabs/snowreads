The\ngravitational influence of the four giant planets was taken into account. For\nidentical initial values of the semimajor axes, eccentricities, and\ninclinations, but for different initial orbital orientations and initial\npositions in orbits, we obtained different types of variations in the\ndifference {\\Delta}{\\Omega}={\\Omega}-{\\Omega}_N in the ascending-node\nlongitudes of the body and Neptune, and in the perihelion argument {\\omega}.\nWhen {\\Delta}{\\Omega} decreases and {\\omega} increases during evolution, then\nmost of the bodies leave the resonance in 20 Myr. In the case of an increase in\n{\\Delta}{\\Omega} and a decrease in {\\omega}, the bodies stay in the resonance\nfor a much longer time. Regions of eccentricities and inclinations, for which\nsome bodies were in the {\\eta}_18 secular resonance ({\\Delta}{\\Omega} is almost\nconstant) and in the Kozai resonance ({\\omega} is almost constant), were\nobtained to be larger than those predicted for small variations in the critical\nangle. Some bodies can at the same time be in both these resonances.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"gZqsj2C70ddcaIzh0He61WphhEJ2ZQE0WfBq0YRU0t0","pdfSize":"917031"}
