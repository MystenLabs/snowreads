Although those sensors\nhave demonstrated good performance, they fail in some complex real-world\nscenarios, especially when facing transparent or reflective surfaces (ToFs) or\nwhen lacking visual features (optical-flow sensors). Taking inspiration from\nbats, this paper proposes a novel two-way ranging-based method for ego-velocity\nestimation and obstacle avoidance based on down-and-forward facing\nultra-low-power ultrasonic sensors, which improve the performance when the\ndrone faces reflective materials or navigates in complete darkness. Our results\ndemonstrate that our new sensing system achieves a mean square error of 0.019\nm/s on ego-velocity estimation and allows exploration for a flight time of 8\nminutes while covering 136 m on average in a challenging environment with\ntransparent and reflective obstacles. We also compare ultrasonic and\nlaser-based ToF sensing techniques for obstacle avoidance, as well as optical\nflow and ultrasonic-based techniques for ego-velocity estimation, denoting how\nthese systems and methods can be complemented to enhance the robustness of\nnano-drone operations.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"G5C1QOHTr0oepOUxPWeRKrLtvRaXwDzE6_9tuFgoW2c","pdfSize":"10295671"}
