  "abstract": "  Plastic scintillators are widely used for the detection of elementary\nparticles, and 3D reconstruction of particle tracks is achieved by segmenting\nthe detector into 3D granular structures. In this study, we present a novel\nprototype fabricated by additive manufacturing, consisting of a 5 x 5 x 5 array\nof 1 cm3 plastic scintillator cubes, each optically isolated. This innovative\napproach eliminates the need to construct complex monolithic geometries in a\nsingle operation and gets rid of the traditional time-consuming manufacturing\nand assembling processes. The prototype underwent performance characterization\nduring a beam test at CERN's Proton-Synchrotron facility. Light yield, optical\ncrosstalk, and light response uniformity, were evaluated. The prototype\ndemonstrated a consistent light yield of approximately 27 photoelectrons (p.e.)\nper channel, similar to traditional cast scintillator detectors. Crosstalk\nbetween adjacent cubes averaged 4-5%, and light yield uniformity within\nindividual cubes exhibited about 7% variation, indicating stability and\nreproducibility. These results underscore the potential of the novel additive\nmanufacturing technique, for efficient and reliable production of\nhigh-granularity scintillator detectors.\n",
