In particular, we\nrefute the conjecture by Dalmau and Opr\\v{s}al that there is a fixed constant\n$k$ such that the $\\mathbb{Z}$-affine $k$-consistency algorithm solves all\ntractable finite domain CSPs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BPKa1GbPQmX7aZQ_iT50HgF7qtKo58IV_mEgHuiCZY8","pdfSize":"417571"}
