  "abstract": "  Quantum Support Vector Machine is a kernel-based approach to classification\nproblems. We study the applicability of quantum kernels to financial data,\nspecifically our self-curated Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSEx) Broad Index dataset.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the very first systematic research work\non this dataset on the application of quantum kernel. We report empirical\nquantum advantage in our work, using several quantum kernels and proposing the\nbest one for this dataset while verifying the Phase Space Terrain Ruggedness\nIndex metric. We estimate the resources needed to carry out these\ninvestigations on a larger scale for future practitioners.\n",
