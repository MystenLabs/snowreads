  "abstract": "  We measure the two-dimensional elastic modulus $E^\\text{2D}$ of atomically\nclean defect-engineered graphene with a known defect distribution and density\nin correlated ultra-high vacuum experiments. The vacancies are introduced via\nlow-energy (< 200 eV) Ar ion irradiation and the atomic structure is obtained\nvia semi-autonomous scanning transmission electron microscopy and image\nanalysis. Based on atomic force microscopy nanoindentation measurements, a\ndecrease of $E^\\text{2D}$ from 286 to 158 N/m is observed when measuring the\nsame graphene membrane before and after an ion irradiation-induced vacancy\ndensity of $1.0\\times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. This decrease is significantly\ngreater than what is predicted by most theoretical studies and in stark\ncontrast to some measurements presented in the literature. With the assistance\nof atomistic simulations, we show that this softening is mostly due to\ncorrugations caused by local strain at vacancies with two or more missing\natoms, while the influence of single vacancies is negligible. We further\ndemonstrate that the opposite effect can be measured when surface contamination\nis not removed before defect engineering\n",
