  "abstract": "  Let $\\nu_y(n)$ denote the number of distinct prime factors of $n$ that are\n  $<y$. For $k$ a positive integer, and for $k+2\\leq y\\leq x$, let\n$S_{-k}(x,y)$ denote the sum \\begin{eqnarray*} S_{-k}(x,y):=\\sum_{n\\leq\nx}(-k)^{\\nu_y(n)}. \\end{eqnarray*} In this paper, we describe our recent\nresults on the asymptotic behavior of $S_{-k}(x,y)$ for $k+2\\leq y\\leq x$, and\n$x$ sufficiently large. There is a crucial difference in the asymptotic\nbehavior of $S_{-k}(x,y)$ when $k+1$ is a prime and $k+1$ is composite, and\nthis makes the problem particularly interesting. The results are derived\nutilizing a combination of the Buchstab-de Bruijn recurrence, the Perron\ncontour integral method, and certain difference-differential equations. We\npresent a summary of our results against the background of earlier work of the\nfirst author on sums of the M\\\"{o}bius function over integers with restricted\nprime factors and on a multiplicative generalization of the sieve.\n",
