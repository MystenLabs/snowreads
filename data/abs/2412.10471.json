Recent works address this task by\nsampling numerous frames or incorporating auxiliary tools using LLMs, both of\nwhich result in high computational costs. In this work, we introduce a\ncuriosity-driven video agent with self-exploration capability, dubbed as VCA.\nBuilt upon VLMs, VCA autonomously navigates video segments and efficiently\nbuilds a comprehensive understanding of complex video sequences. Instead of\ndirectly sampling frames, VCA employs a tree-search structure to explore video\nsegments and collect frames. Rather than relying on external feedback or\nreward, VCA leverages VLM's self-generated intrinsic reward to guide its\nexploration, enabling it to capture the most crucial information for reasoning.\nExperimental results on multiple long video benchmarks demonstrate our\napproach's superior effectiveness and efficiency.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qfKjYwUmX8HbYgf2gM1otXZsad2hC69OA8_KFFONPr4","pdfSize":"18718660"}
