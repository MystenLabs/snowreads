Risk management and portfolio optimization rely on\nrealistic multivariate price generation models. Accordingly, there is a strong\nmodelling literature dating back to Bachelier's Theory of Speculation in 1901.\nGenerating FTS using deep generative models (DGMs) is still in its infancy. In\nthis work, we systematically compare DGMs against state-of-the-art parametric\nalternatives for multivariate FTS generation. We initially compare both DGMs\nand parametric models over increasingly complex synthetic datasets. The models\nare evaluated through distance measures for varying distribution moments of\nboth the full and rolling FTS. We then apply the best performing DGM models to\nempirical data, demonstrating the benefit of DGMs through a implied volatility\ntrading task.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance","Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Xk35fkZb2ArSVYZfYs9XTdxSKl-3iX7YLhXgewT_FJ4","pdfSize":"821658"}
