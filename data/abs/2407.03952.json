Moreover, they play a multifaceted role in\ncommunication, making their understanding and generation a challenging task for\nlanguage models (LMs). While there has been extensive work in the literature\nlinking metaphor to the fulfilment of individual intentions, no comprehensive\ntaxonomy of such intentions, suitable for natural language processing (NLP)\napplications, is available to present day. In this paper, we propose a novel\ntaxonomy of intentions commonly attributed to metaphor, which comprises 9\ncategories. We also release the first dataset annotated for intentions behind\nmetaphor use. Finally, we use this dataset to test the capability of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) in inferring the intentions behind metaphor use, in\nzero- and in-context few-shot settings. Our experiments show that this is still\na challenge for LLMs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ISdXCHZ4NpPHziKk-s3Gt5zaiMZV1SIKRScy5IZuXU4","pdfSize":"1508080"}
