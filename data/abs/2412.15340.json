The analytical study is based on Lorentz force, continuity and\nelectromagnetic wave equations. Amplitude of second harmonic radiation is\nderived with the help of current density and dispersion relation obtained at\ntwice the fundamental frequency of the laser field. Perturbation technique is\nused for evaluation of current density. The variation of amplitude and\nefficiency of radially polarized second harmonic radiation with propagation\ndistance is graphically depicted. It is seen that radially polarized laser\npropagating in plasma gives efficient second harmonic radiation generation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"YlSuiXdmuPD5aldWtgc11_69xZvwslUMlJAXXQwfCR4","pdfSize":"572849"}
