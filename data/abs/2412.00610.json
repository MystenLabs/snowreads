In this paper, we study the joint\ndistribution of monochromatic hyperedges for hypergraphs with multiple layers\n(multiplex hypergraphs). Specifically, we consider the joint distribution of\n${\\bf T} _n:= (T(H_n^{(1)}), T(H_n^{(2)}))$, for two sequences of hypergraphs\n$H_n^{(1)}$ and $H_n^{(2)}$ on the same set of vertices. We will show that the\njoint distribution of ${\\bf T}_n$ converges to (possibly dependent) Poisson\ndistributions whenever the mean vector and the covariance matrix of ${\\bf T}_n$\nconverge. In other words, the joint Poisson approximation of ${\\bf T}_n$ is\ndetermined only by the convergence of its first two moments. This generalizes\nrecent results on the second moment phenomenon for Poisson approximation from\ngraph coloring to hypergraph coloring and from marginal convergence to joint\nconvergence. Applications include generalizations of the birthday problem,\ncounting monochromatic subgraphs in randomly colored graphs, and counting\nmonochromatic arithmetic progressions in randomly colored integers. Extensions\nto random hypergraphs and weighted hypergraphs are also discussed.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0hETw6LBvjWfmCfQsL9RP5RcrqLoDwcBDgSLxufUtIw","pdfSize":"408861"}
