Interdependencies and varying importance between action\ndimensions are further known key characteristics of DAC problems. We argue that\nthese Coupled Action Dimensions with Importance Differences (CANDID) represent\naspects of the DAC problem that are not yet fully explored. To address this\ngap, we introduce a new white-box benchmark within the DACBench suite that\nsimulates the properties of CANDID. Further, we propose sequential policies as\nan effective strategy for managing these properties. Such policies factorize\nthe action space and mitigate exponential growth by learning a policy per\naction dimension. At the same time, these policies accommodate the\ninterdependence of action dimensions by fostering implicit coordination. We\nshow this in an experimental study of value-based policies on our new\nbenchmark. This study demonstrates that sequential policies significantly\noutperform independent learning of factorized policies in CANDID action spaces.\nIn addition, they overcome the scalability limitations associated with learning\na single policy across all action dimensions.
