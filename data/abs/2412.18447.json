  "abstract": "  The importance of the development of IoT and LoRaWAN in military applications\nhas been widely established. Since security is one of its important challenges,\nin this paper we study two attacks scenarios: replay and sniff attacks on\nmilitary LoRaWAN network. The aim is to highlight cybersecurity threats that\nmust be taken into consideration when using such technology in critical\ncontext.\n",
