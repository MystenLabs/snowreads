An image-classifier is considered \"reliable\" if its accuracy on\ndistorted images is above a user-specified threshold. For a quality control\npurpose, it is important to predict if the image-classifier is\nunreliable/reliable under a distortion level. In other words, we want to\npredict whether a distortion level makes the image-classifier \"non-reliable\" or\n\"reliable\". Our solution is to construct a training set consisting of\ndistortion levels along with their \"non-reliable\" or \"reliable\" labels, and\ntrain a machine learning predictive model (called distortion-classifier) to\nclassify unseen distortion levels. However, learning an effective\ndistortion-classifier is a challenging problem as the training set is highly\nimbalanced. To address this problem, we propose two Gaussian process based\nmethods to rebalance the training set. We conduct extensive experiments to show\nthat our method significantly outperforms several baselines on six popular\nimage datasets.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1r2biGu8DHZYY219nTqry3j1Se9dvz0FrivpGZeECWs","pdfSize":"5301557"}
