We first examine the simpler\ncase of the 1-dimensional minisuperspace model and derive the inner product\nmeasure that renders the Hamiltonian hermitian. Based on this, we establish\nthat the Hilbert space inner products and quantum probabilities are universal,\nfree of any ambiguities, at the semiclassical level. Recasting the\nWheeler-DeWitt equation in a form invariant under field redefinitions of the\nminisuperspace variable, we show that all ambiguity functions are contained in\na higher order scalar function, which can be used to define classes of models\nwith universal predictions to all orders in $\\hbar$. We then generalize to\nminisuperspace models of arbitrary dimension, upon the inclusion of an\narbitrary number of scalar matter fields. We show that the hermiticity of the\nHamiltonian in these cases provides a set of constraints, which can be used to\ncast the WDW equation in a covariant form and establish the universality of the\ninner products at the semiclassical level. In these cases as well, all\nambiguity functions appear in a higher order scalar function of the\nminisuperspace manifold, which leads to distinct universality classes.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"POQI_PcntD_dmP28fzICUR51epWZV4vpJW-GIJKdkpY","pdfSize":"337229"}
