The\nmembrane surface is endowed with a mesh whose in-plane motion need not depend\non the in-plane flow of lipids. Instead, in-plane mesh dynamics can be\nspecified arbitrarily. A new class of mesh motions is introduced, where the\nmesh velocity satisfies the dynamical equations of a user-specified\ntwo-dimensional material. A Lagrange multiplier constrains the out-of-plane\nmembrane and mesh velocities to be equal, such that the mesh and material\nalways overlap. An associated numerical inf--sup instability ensues, and is\nremoved by adapting established techniques in the finite element analysis of\nfluids. In our implementation, the aforementioned Lagrange multiplier is\nprojected onto a discontinuous space of piecewise linear functions. The new\nmesh motion is compared to established Lagrangian and Eulerian formulations by\ninvestigating a preeminent numerical benchmark of biological significance: the\npulling of a membrane tether from a flat patch, and its subsequent lateral\ntranslation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Pmjy3B6Hv5DyEmKj4KiubkkPXyZrwoff3cJGXAd_7Cc","pdfSize":"3898144"}
