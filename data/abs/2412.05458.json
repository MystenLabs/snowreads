The model is known to contain electric field solutions sourced\nby the scalar field that are distinct from embedded Maxwell electric fields. We\nexamine the perturbative stability of the solution and identify a region of\nparameter space where the solution is stable. In the regime where the scalar\nfield has a negative mass squared, the solution has two branches and we\nidentify an instability in one of the branches.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8I4DK8_mtLWv5b4sufkiayNFpeeH2VSyCqG1g_gDsaw","pdfSize":"662569"}
