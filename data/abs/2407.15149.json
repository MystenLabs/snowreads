Recent work revealed that these flows have universal features,\nindependent of the material properties and of the presence of topological\ndefects. However, the differences between defect-laden and defect-free active\nturbulence remain largely unexplored. Here, by means of large-scale numerical\nsimulations, we show that defect-free active nematic turbulence can undergo\ndynamical arrest. We find that flow alignment -- the tendency of nematics to\nreorient under shear -- enhances large-scale jets in contractile rodlike\nsystems while promoting arrested flow patterns in extensile systems. Our\nresults reveal a mechanism of labyrinthine pattern formation produced by an\nemergent topology of nematic domain walls that partially suppresses chaotic\nflows. Taken together, our findings call for the experimental realization of\ndefect-free active nematics, and suggest that topological defects enable\nturbulence by preventing dynamical arrest.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"WI0lkMQOepFkL4Ef1HJU_087zWI6DS0R5nWyxekUTKo","pdfSize":"30608650"}
