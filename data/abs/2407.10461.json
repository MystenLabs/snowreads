Upon this\nprecoding method, we put forth a satellite equipped with massive multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO), by which inter-beam interference is efficiently\nmitigated by narrowing corresponding beam width. By modeling the ground users'\nlocations via a Poisson point process, we rigorously analyze the achievable\nperformance of the presented multibeam satellite system. In particular, we\ninvestigate the asymptotic scaling laws that reveal the interplay between the\nuser density, the number of beams, and the number of antennas. Our analysis\noffers critical design insights for the multibeam satellite with massive MIMO:\ni) If the user density scales in power with the number of antennas, the\nconsidered precoding can achieve a linear fraction of the optimal rate in the\nasymptotic regime. ii) A certain additional scaling factor for the user density\nis needed as the number of beams increases to maintain the asymptotic\noptimality.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"d4AKpcyWsM8x8RbjgUoYTAAPZBBHuRLo2AlGmpz9LiA","pdfSize":"1097047"}
