  "abstract": "  Lattice QCD calculations of the $2s$ radial excitation of the nucleon place\nthe state at an energy of approximately 1.9 GeV, raising the possibility that\nit is associated with the $N1/2^+(1880)$ and $N1/2^+(1710)$ resonances through\nmixing with two-particle meson-baryon states. The discovery of the\n$N1/2^+(1880)$ resonance in pion photoproduction but not in $\\pi N$ scattering\nand the small width of the $N1/2^+(1710)$ resonance suggest that a state\nassociated with these resonances would be insensitive to the manner in which\npions are permitted to dress it. To explore this possibility, we examine the\nspectrum of nucleon radial excitations in both 2+1 flavour QCD and in\nsimulations where the coupling to meson-baryon states is significantly modified\nthrough quenching. We find the energy of the $2s$ radial excitation to be\ninsensitive to this modification for quark masses close to the physical point.\nThis invariance provides further evidence that the $2s$ radial excitation of\nthe nucleon is associated with the $N1/2^+(1880)$ and $N1/2^+(1710)$\nresonances.\n",
