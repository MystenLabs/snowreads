However, the lack of\nexpert-annotated, open-access resources has hindered the analysis of ALS data\nusing advanced deep learning techniques. We address this limitation with\nArchaeoscape (available at https://archaeoscape.ai/data/2024/), a novel\nlarge-scale archaeological ALS dataset spanning 888 km$^2$ in Cambodia with\n31,141 annotated archaeological features from the Angkorian period.\nArchaeoscape is over four times larger than comparable datasets, and the first\nALS archaeology resource with open-access data, annotations, and models.\n  We benchmark several recent segmentation models to demonstrate the benefits\nof modern vision techniques for this problem and highlight the unique\nchallenges of discovering subtle human-made structures under dense jungle\ncanopies. By making Archaeoscape available in open access, we hope to bridge\nthe gap between traditional archaeology and modern computer vision methods.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hDKfr5rmJ72TX32-q0wEqhyS5SAS_Lj0PPoKSfevuRQ","pdfSize":"8927450"}
