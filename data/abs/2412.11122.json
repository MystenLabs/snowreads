However, the potential for rent-seeking behaviors among parties\ncan undermine such collaborations. Contract theory presents a viable solution\nby rewarding participants with models of varying accuracy based on their\ncontributions. However, unlike monetary compensation, using models as rewards\nintroduces unique challenges, particularly due to the stochastic nature of\nthese rewards when contribution costs are privately held information. This\npaper formalizes the optimal contracting problem within CML and proposes a\ntransformation that simplifies the non-convex optimization problem into one\nthat can be solved through convex optimization algorithms. We conduct a\ndetailed analysis of the properties that an optimal contract must satisfy when\nmodels serve as the rewards, and we explore the potential benefits and welfare\nimplications of these contract-driven CML schemes through numerical\nexperiments.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Computer Science and Game Theory","Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"i9LaCp9-XNMt82z4c55xeD6Azl2OVgq6sK4VoaRbFOE","pdfSize":"4921949"}
