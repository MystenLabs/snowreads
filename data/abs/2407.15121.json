Their configuration spaces\nhave been studied intensively, but are yet not completely understood. In the\npaper we study them using the Morse theory of the squared distance function\nfrom the \"body\" of the spider to some fixed point in the plane. Generically, it\nis a Morse-Bott function. We list its critical manifolds, describe them as\nproducts of polygon spaces, and derive a formula for their Morse-Bott indices.\nWe apply the obtained results to Hooke energy and Voronoi distance.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6xmftD3iEAIUnX7knKHDXewp0NpVdAc7EpkXLNt0Nk8","pdfSize":"1060673"}
