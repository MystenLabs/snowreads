HOBOTAN supports both CPU and GPU, with the GPU\nversion developed based on PyTorch, offering a fast and scalable system. This\nsolver utilizes tensor networks to solve combinatorial optimization problems,\nemploying a HOBO tensor that maps the problem and performs tensor contractions\nas needed. Additionally, by combining techniques such as batch processing for\ntensor optimization and binary-based integer encoding, we significantly enhance\nthe efficiency of combinatorial optimization. In the future, the utilization of\nincreased GPU numbers is expected to harness greater computational power,\nenabling efficient collaboration between multiple GPUs for high scalability.\nMoreover, HOBOTAN is designed within the framework of quantum computing, thus\nproviding insights for future quantum computer applications. This paper details\nthe design, implementation, performance evaluation, and scalability of HOBOTAN,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Mathematical Software","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yqXogVimkmRff8GQFIbUXT7kLSth5TkjHD6AWOdINl0","pdfSize":"406893"}
