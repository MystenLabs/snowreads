As shown in arXiv:1904.01027, such vacua correspond to\ncritical loci of a real superpotential $W$. We perform a perturbative study\naround a supersymmetric vacuum of the theory, which confirms that the first\norder variation of the superpotential, $\\delta W$, reproduces the BPS\nconditions for the system, and furthermore shows that $\\delta^2 W=0$ gives the\nequations for infinitesimal moduli. This allows us to identify a nilpotent\ndifferential, and a symplectic pairing, which we use to construct a bicomplex,\nor a double complex, for the heterotic $G_2$ system. Using this complex, we\ndetermine infinitesimal moduli and their obstructions in terms of related\ncohomology groups. Finally, by interpreting $\\delta^2 W$ as an action, we\ncompute the one-loop partition function of the heterotic $G_2$ system and show\nit can be decomposed into a product of one-loop partition functions of Abelian\nand non-Abelian instanton gauge theories.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xKyKB1p4Krv56l9bhXCKEn4Z_ZyRVMR_HdSLSxIT5Pc","pdfSize":"483213"}
