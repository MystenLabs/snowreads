A coherent\nsuperposition of these energy eigenstates could dynamically relocalize the\nmolecules into chiral states, which has only been addressed theoretically.\nHere, we present a microwave six-wave mixing pump-probe study to create and\nprobe coherent chiral tunneling dynamics in a rotational state. Through a\ntime-resolved scheme, we uncover the periodic time evolution of the induced\nchiral wavepacket under field-free conditions. Moreover, we demonstrate precise\nphase control of this coherence via phase modulation during pump excitation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Fa1Sol-b46XZMxNPTRFKyyQPe1eUbgAJ_verDqgnO4Y","pdfSize":"4379394"}
