We present Watertox,\nan elegant adversarial attack framework achieving remarkable effectiveness\nthrough architectural diversity and precision-controlled perturbations. Our\ntwo-stage Fast Gradient Sign Method combines uniform baseline perturbations\n($\\epsilon_1 = 0.1$) with targeted enhancements ($\\epsilon_2 = 0.4$). The\nframework leverages an ensemble of complementary architectures, from VGG to\nConvNeXt, synthesizing diverse perspectives through an innovative voting\nmechanism. Against state-of-the-art architectures, Watertox reduces model\naccuracy from 70.6% to 16.0%, with zero-shot attacks achieving up to 98.8%\naccuracy reduction against unseen architectures. These results establish\nWatertox as a significant advancement in adversarial methodologies, with\npromising applications in visual security systems and CAPTCHA generation.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"i2XcPXcZHzg2pobRDm7v52ltbIqt3CyF61SpyZcRFPs","pdfSize":"2933713"}
