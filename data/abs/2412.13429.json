  "abstract": "  A review of scientific literature showed the relevance of the issue of\nassessing the training of an engineering specialist. Engineering includes a\nvariety of works that relate to production issues. To assess the training of an\nengineering specialist, the digital twin of the enterprise is used. The digital\ntwin of an enterprise includes all major pre-production, production and\nproduction support processes. A method for assessing the competencies received\nby an engineering specialist has been selected. The set of competencies is\nassociated with the ongoing processes of the digital twin of an industrial\nenterprise. The normal mode of execution of the enterprise production processes\nis measured. The mode of operation of the processes was measured taking into\naccount the new competencies of an engineering specialist. The study proposes a\nmethodology for assessing the competence of an engineering specialist. The\nassessment of the effectiveness of the training passed by him.\n",
