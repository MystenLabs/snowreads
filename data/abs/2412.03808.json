Useful tools for constructing such\ncodes include Clifford deformations and appropriate gauge fixings of compass\ncodes. In this work, we find Clifford deformations that can be applied to\nelongated compass codes resulting in QEC codes with improved performance under\nnoise models with errors biased towards dephasing commonly seen in quantum\ncomputing architectures. These Clifford deformations enhance decoder\nperformance by introducing symmetries, while the stabilizers of compass codes\ncan be selected to obtain more information on high-rate errors. As a result,\nthe codes exhibit thresholds that increase with bias and display lower logical\nerror rates. One of the Clifford deformations we explore yields QEC codes with\nbetter thresholds and logical error rates than those of the XZZX surface code\nat moderate biases.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mbAd8ZnfCiFY0pbZY4cjL4RttSpKAHJtqjx6mj1Pi4A","pdfSize":"2464374"}
