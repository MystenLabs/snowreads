In this paper, we prove the\nexistence of $u$ for which $|N^{++}(u)| \\ge 0.715538 |N^+(u)|$. This result\nprovides the first improvement to the best known constant factor in over two\ndecades.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7MQr-5TkZ5G-lBQckLDyozqWec8zoUEqlIjBwVODD1E","pdfSize":"149651"}
