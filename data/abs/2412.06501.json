In particular, we consider\nthe dark energy to be described by a phantom scalar field and the dark matter\n$\\rho _{m}$ as a pressureless ideal gas. We introduce the interacting function\n$Q=\\beta \\left( t\\right) \\rho_{m}$, where the function $% \\beta \\left( t\\right)\n$ is considered to be proportional to $\\dot{\\phi}, \\dot{\\phi}^{2}H^{-1},~H$, or\na constant parameter with dimensions of $\\left[H_{0}\\right] $. For the four\ninteracting models, we study in details the phase space by calculating the\nstationary points. The latter are applied to reconstruct the cosmological\nevolution. Compactified variables are essential to understand the complete\npicture of the phase space and to conclude about the cosmological viability of\nthese interacting models. The detailed analysis is performed for the\nexponential potential $V\\left( \\phi \\right) =V_{0}e^{\\lambda \\phi }$. The\neffects of other scalar field potential functions on the cosmological dynamics\nare examined.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1SAMcMt3DWw_muubRabI_VBFQL-9jGOF1kMgwEnVvug","pdfSize":"2145460"}
