However, impurity scattering caused by resultant ionized\ndopants, after donating or withdrawing carriers, hinders transport in 2D\nsemiconductor layers, limiting the carrier mobility. Here, we propose a\ndiffusion doping method for chemical vapor deposition (CVD) grown molybdenum\ndisulfide that avoids interference from charged impurities. Selectively\ninkjet-printed dopants were introduced only on the contact region, allowing\nexcessively donated electrons to diffuse to the channel layer due to the\nelectron density difference. Therefore, diffusion-doped molybdenum disulfide\nFETs do not have undesirable charged impurities on the channel, exhibiting over\ntwo-fold higher field-effect mobility compared with conventional direct-doped\nones. Our study paves the way for a new doping strategy that simultaneously\nsuppresses charged impurity scattering and facilitates the tailoring of the\nSCTD effect.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"bVjW7fMX_LDseXI9GDcQQkHwzh_mZj0kT_I82NeCE0U","pdfSize":"1644478"}
