The Dyson equation is solved\nin a fully self-consistent manner via the algorithmic inversion method based on\nthe sum-over-pole representation (AIM-SOP) of dynamical operators. We start by\nvalidating our self-consistent AIM-SOP implementation by taking as test case\nthe one-dimensional Hubbard model. We then move to the study of\nantiferromagnetic and charge density wave solutions in one-dimensional lattice\nmodels, taking into account a long-range Coulomb interaction between the\nelectrons. Complementary, by solving the Sham-Schl\\\"uter equation, we can\ncompute the non-interacting Green's function reproducing the same charge\ndensity of the interacting system. In turn, this allows for the evaluation of\nthe derivative discontinuity in the Kohn-Sham potential, which gives a measure\nof how the Kohn-Sham gap approximates the many-body fundamental gap of these\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ov5YNZ9ak9aO0QY3FpZvCbwNPKU_Jp8MKywu6rp7E7k","pdfSize":"1067682"}
