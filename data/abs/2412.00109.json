This\nstudy explores the use of a deep neural network (DNN) model to predict B-cell\nepitopes for SARS-CoVandSARS-CoV-2,leveraging a dataset that incorporates\nessential protein and peptide features. Traditional sequence-based methods\noften struggle with large, complex datasets, but deep learning offers promising\nimprovements in predictive accuracy. Our model employs regularization\ntechniques, such as dropout and early stopping, to enhance generalization,\nwhile also analyzing key features, including isoelectric point and aromaticity,\nthat influence epitope recognition. Results indicate an overall accuracy of 82%\nin predicting COVID-19 negative and positive cases, with room for improvement\nin detecting positive samples. This research demonstrates the applicability of\ndeep learning in epitope mapping, suggesting that such approaches can enhance\nthe speed and precision of vaccine design for emerging pathogens. Future work\ncould incorporate structural data and diverse viral strains to further refine\nprediction capabilities.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EXjhIGiqzC7zN8wed1kftqKgPqs35FmWzf2YgB6nQVA","pdfSize":"350625"}
