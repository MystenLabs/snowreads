Matter Phys. 23, 23502 (2020)] we introduce a discrete\nGauss-Poisson probability distribution function\n\\begin{equation}\\label{GPD}\\tag{A1} p_{GP}(n\n;z,r)=\\left[R(r;z)\\right]^{-1}\\frac{\\mbox{e}^{zn}}{n!}\\,\\mbox{e}^{-\\frac\n12\\,rn^2} \\end{equation} with support on $\\mathbb N_0$ and parameters\n$z\\in\\mathbb R$ and $r\\in\\mathbb R_+$. The probability mass function $p_{GP}(n\n;z,r)$ is normalized by the special function $R(r;z)$, given by the infinite\nsum \\begin{equation}\\label{R}\\tag{A2}\nR(r;z)=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac{\\mbox{e}^{zn}}{n!}\\,\\mbox{e}^{-\\frac 12\\,rn^2},\n\\end{equation} possessing extremely intersting mathematical properties. We\npresent an asymptotic estimate $R^{(\\rm as)}(r;z\\gg1)$ for the function\n$R(r;z)$ with large arguments $z$, along with similar formulas for its\nlogarithm and logarithmic derivative. These functions exhibit very interesting\noscillatory behavior around their asymptotics, for parameters $r$ above some\nthreshold value $r^*$. Some implications of our findings are discussed in the\ncontext of the Curie-Weiss cell model of simple fluids.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"bYuM4A-bZBygd_Nu5nDGDM8chS04dyADXtDSRnPbsa0","pdfSize":"419183"}
