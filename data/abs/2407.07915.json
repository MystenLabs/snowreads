We find that the speed of the selected wave depends\ncritically on the strength of diffusion at low density. For sufficiently large\nlow-density diffusion, the wave propagates at a speed predicted by a simple\nlinear analysis. For small or zero low-density diffusion, the linear analysis\nis not sufficient, but a variational approach yields exact or approximate\nexpressions for the speed and shape of population fronts.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"whwTm6cs0_yJ8fepDbIYQByCEjHA-_YPejuIx_P42RE","pdfSize":"306678"}
