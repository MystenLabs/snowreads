Despite their advanced visual perception, large vision-language\nmodels (LVLMs) struggle with counting tasks, especially when the number of\nobjects exceeds those commonly encountered during training. We enhance LVLMs'\ncounting abilities using a divide-and-conquer approach, breaking counting\nproblems into sub-counting tasks. Our method employs a mechanism that prevents\nbisecting and thus repetitive counting of objects, which occurs in a naive\ndivide-and-conquer approach. Unlike prior methods, which do not generalize well\nto counting datasets they have not been trained on, our method performs well on\nnew datasets without any additional training or fine-tuning. We demonstrate\nthat our approach enhances the counting capability of LVLMs across various\ndatasets and benchmarks.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vSQoqox1ixV8kNigOPmWWqhAcd4lAk1IETpRkVayuDQ","pdfSize":"10670007"}
