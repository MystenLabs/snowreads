The large binding energy of the molecules in combination with a\nrelative spectroscopic resolution of $10^{-4}$ provides a rigorous benchmark\nfor existing theoretical models. A recently developed Green's function\nframework, which circumvents the convergence issues that afflicted previous\nstudies,, is employed to theoretically reproduce the vibrational spectrum of\nthe molecule with high accuracy. The relatively large molecular binding energy\nare primarily determined by the low energy $S$-wave electron-atom scattering\nlength, thereby allowing us to extract the $^3S_1$ scattering phase shift with\nunprecedented accuracy, at low energy regimes inaccessible to free electrons.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"onnmqx3uAA1b_Y3WAUmHAbg4hw6OfZw2DFY8Ok3NM1Y","pdfSize":"2104549"}
