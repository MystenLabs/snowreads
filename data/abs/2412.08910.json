  "abstract": "  Long-term evolution characteristics of the solar transition region have been\nunclear. In this study, daily images of the solar full disk derived from the\nobservations by the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly at\n304 A wavelength from 2011 January 1 to 2022 December 31 are used to\ninvestigate long-term evolution of the solar transition region. It is found\nthat long-term variation in the transition region of the full disk is in phase\nwith the solar activity cycle, and thus the polar brightening should occur in\nthe maximum epoch of the solar cycle. Long-term variation of the background\ntransition region is found to be likely in anti-phase with the solar activity\ncycle at middle and low latitudes. The entire transition region, especially the\nactive transition region is inferred to be mainly heated by the active-region\nmagnetic fields and the ephemeral-region magnetic fields, while the quieter\ntransition region is believed to be mainly heated by network magnetic fields.\nLong-term evolution characteristics of various types of the magnetic fields at\nthe solar surface are highly consistent with these findings, and thus provide\nan explanation for them.\n",
