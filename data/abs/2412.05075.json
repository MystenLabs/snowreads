Nevertheless, there are\nstill barriers hindering their adoption. Among them, vendor lock-in is a major\nconcern, especially considering the lack of interoperability between these\nplatforms. Typically, after modeling an application in one LCP, migrating to\nanother requires starting from scratch remodeling everything (the data model,\nthe graphical user interface, workflows, etc.), in the new platform.\n  To overcome this situation, this work proposes an approach to improve the\ninteroperability of LCPs by (semi)automatically migrating models specified in\none platform to another one. The concrete migration path depends on the\ncapabilities of the source and target tools. We first analyze popular LCPs,\ncharacterize their import and export alternatives and define transformations\nbetween those data formats when available. This is then complemented with an\nLLM-based solution, where image recognition features of large language models\nare employed to migrate models based on a simple image export of the model at\nhand. The full pipelines are implemented on top of the BESSER modeling\nframework that acts as a pivot representation between the tools.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"v2YXi9z2ADEDHatfcGIquMM8MhcOP03UVO2OGmCXZfw","pdfSize":"722346"}
