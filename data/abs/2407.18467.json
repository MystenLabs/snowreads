The proposed method\ncomprises two phases: i) data reorganization in which synthetic data using the\nGAN model is introduced with inverted class labels of the forget datasets, and\nii) fine-tuning the pre-trained model. The GAN models consist of two pairs of\ngenerators and discriminators. The generator discriminator pairs generate\nsynthetic data for the retain and forget datasets. Then, a pre-trained model is\nutilized to get the class labels of the synthetic datasets. The class labels of\nsynthetic and original forget datasets are inverted. Finally, all combined\ndatasets are used to fine-tune the pre-trained model to get the unlearned\nmodel. We have performed the experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset and tested the\nunlearned models using Membership Inference Attacks (MIA). The inverted class\nlabels procedure and synthetically generated data help to acquire valuable\ninformation that enables the model to outperform state-of-the-art models and\nother standard unlearning classifiers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-c4uGHIWNAP7gigB57JZhgDgbs0XZSOfd6Z5mF_ZFtw","pdfSize":"543706"}
