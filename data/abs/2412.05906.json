Using entropy to measure the cost of exploration,\nwe prove that the optimal feedback policy for the problem must be Gaussian\ntype. Then, we apply the results of the discrete-time LQ model to solve the\ndiscrete-time mean-variance asset-liability management problem and prove our RL\nalgorithm's policy improvement and convergence. Finally, a numerical example\nsheds light on the theoretical results established using simulations.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YGTYitVWzqC_4CeJSAwnta7V94Ur-XBOI53atTOPnaQ","pdfSize":"842708"}
