Moreover, their computation accuracy and efficiency are heavily\nsubject to unknown errors and bad data in measurements or prediction data of\ndistributed energy resources (DERs). To address these issues, this paper\nproposes a hybrid data-aided robust power flow algorithm in unbalanced\ndistribution systems, which combines Taylor series expansion knowledge with a\ndata-driven regression technique. The proposed method initiates a linearization\npower flow model to derive an explicitly analytical solution by modified Taylor\nexpansion. To mitigate the approximation loss that surges due to the DER\nintegration and bad data, we further develop a data-aided robust support vector\nregression approach to estimate the errors efficiently. Comparative analysis in\nthe 13-bus and 123-bus IEEE unbalanced feeders shows that the proposed\nalgorithm achieves superior computational efficiency, with guaranteed accuracy\nand robustness against outliers.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"A-hOSumw55BdNv-7412t0TdsPub9lQ8BuySZK5XuXgI","pdfSize":"600288"}
