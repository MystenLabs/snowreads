For a\nbroad class of lattices, such as honeycomb ones, these points and associated\nDirac cones generally appear in non-equivalent pairs. Simultaneous breakup of\nthe time-reversal and inversion symmetry in systems based on such lattices may\nresult in the formation of the unpaired Dirac cones in bulk spectrum, but the\nexistence of topologically protected edge states in such structures remains an\nopen problem. Here photonic Floquet insulator on honeycomb lattice with\nunpaired Dirac cones in its spectrum is introduced that can support\nunidirectional edge states appearing at the edge between two regions with\nopposite sublattice detuning. Topological properties of this system are\ncharacterized by the nonzero valley Chern number. Remarkably, edge states in\nthis system can circumvent sharp corners without inter-valley scattering even\nthough there is no total forbidden gap in the spectrum. Our results reveal\nunusual interplay between two different physical mechanisms of creation of\ntopological edge states based on simultaneous breakup of different symmetries\nof the system.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"t23O35b8SxeUanj730OtihsWwKgzm7Yenz9Vo7R_d4M","pdfSize":"4007160"}
