The supersymmetric algebra naturally induces non-ergodic dynamics, as\nwe illustrate here by introducing a fermionic equivalent of the PXP model with\nan adjustable chemical potential. This model is closely related to the\n$\\mathcal{N} = 2$ supersymmetric $M_1$ model. Supersymmetry directly implies\nthat the dynamics exhibit periodic revivals for specific initial states,\nincluding the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-ordered (every second site occupied) product\nstate. These dynamics are reminiscent to those of the PXP model, a paradigmatic\ntoy model in the field of quantum many-body scars. We draw a further parallel\nby uncovering quantum many-body scar-like eigenstates obeying sub-thermal\nentanglement scaling at energies given by (plus or minus) square roots of\nintegers and relate these to special eigenstates of the $M_1$ model.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ToUlFB-ZHoFV8ZooB2hMT6uFabTh1Tciz_50SEryHKI","pdfSize":"377828"}
