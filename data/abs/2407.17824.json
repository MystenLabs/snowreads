Insight into this physics may be\ngained by studying the ''residual'', i.e. the late-time linear response of the\nsystem to an initial perturbation. We investigate this zonal-flow residual in\nthe limit of a small magnetic mirror ratio, where we find that the typical\nquadratic approximation to RH (Rosenbluth & Hinton, 1998) breaks down. Barely\npassing particles are in this limit central in determining the resulting level\nof the residual, which we estimate analytically. The role played by the\npopulation with large orbit width provides valuable physical insight into the\nresponse of the residual beyond this limit. Applying this result to tokamak,\nquasi-symmetric and quasi-isodynamic equilibria, using a near-axis\napproximation, we identify the effect to be more relevant (although small) in\nthe core of quasi-axisymmetric fields, where the residual is smallest. The\nanalysis in the paper also clarifies the relationship between the residual and\nthe geodesic acoustic mode, whose typical theoretical set-ups are similar.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aO9Vr9LDlOjH84hTh91Km0MFLdX1t-7jUeOYpaxqNXY","pdfSize":"3722375"}
