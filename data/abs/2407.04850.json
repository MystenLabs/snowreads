We prove\nthe associated Cauchy problem is locally (in time) well-posed in $H^s(\\R \\times\n\\T)$ for $s >1$. The new ingredient in this work is a trilinear estimate in the\ncontext of Bourgain spaces which controls the cubic non-linearity of the\nmodified Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation in the contraction argument.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yxHCzWsm12fY_A3FFacN5AhSbpiaWLCSR8E4Lyujp1U","pdfSize":"362917"}
