It develops from this a spectrum of structures, which\nappear in different contexts, in algebraic geometry, representation theory and\nthe theory of irregular meromorphic connections. It provides general tools to\nstudy these structures, and it studies sytematically the cases of rank 2 and 3.\nThe rank 3 cases lead already to a rich variety of phenomena and give an idea\nof the general landscape. The first structure associated to the matrix is a\nZ-lattice with unimodular bilinear form (called Seifert form) and a triangular\nbasis. It leads immediately to an even and an odd intersection form,\nreflections and transvections, an even and an odd monodromy group, even and odd\nvanishing cycles. Braid group actions lead to braid group orbits of\ndistinguished bases and of upper triangular matrices. Finally, complex\nmanifolds, which consist of correctly glued Stokes regions, are associated to\nthese braid group orbits. The last chapter is a report on the case of isolated\nhypersurface singularities.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"mHrAq3kDb02f8yMcfltbfhExMRuur7sXkwLcYRZ6nBY","pdfSize":"3877287"}
