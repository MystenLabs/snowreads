We harness the power of computation, both numeric and symbolic, to\ninvestigate analogs with finitely many cards. We also study finite analogs of a\nsimplified poker introduced by D.J. Newman, and conclude with a thorough\ninvestigation, fully implemented in Maple, of the three-player game, doing both\nthe finite and the infinite versions.
