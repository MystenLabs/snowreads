  "abstract": "  A theorem is proved to verify incremental stability of a feedback system via\na homotopy from a known incrementally stable system. A first corollary of that\nresult is that incremental stability may be verified by separation of Scaled\nRelative Graphs, correcting two assumptions in [1, Theorem 2]. A second\ncorollary provides an incremental version of the classical IQC stability\ntheorem.\n",
