The degreewidth of a digraph is the minimum over all\nordering of the maximum degree of the backedge graph. We answer an open\nquestion by Keeney and Lokshtanov [WG 2024], proving that it is \\NP-hard to\ndetermine whether an oriented graph has degreewidth at most $1$, which settles\nthe last open case for oriented graphs. We complement this result with a\ngeneral discussion on parameters defined using backedge graphs and their\nrelations to classical parameters.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"NVeLbiN-AFmnH2WKPMmcHdDBbuPnducrL47fQWWInqQ","pdfSize":"400572"}
