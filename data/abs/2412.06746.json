  "abstract": "  This article is concerned regarding the nonexistence of positive solutions\nfor nonlinear fractional elliptic inequalities in exterior domains of $\\mathbb\nR^n$, $n\\geq1$.\n  We would like to highlight the fact that our results are new with very weak\nassumption on the nonlinear term appearing in the inequalities.\n  The results are also novel in this generality\n  even if the whole space is considered.\n",
