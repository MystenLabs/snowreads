More precisely, we obtain the global existence\nand uniqueness of strong solutions for general large initial data. Our method\nrelies on dedicate energy estimates and a logarithmic interpolation inequality.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7kZ0CDp92cFjZ0LDh6sMo2DO2lA0pj3cQwd01hE8xR4","pdfSize":"227095"}
