Suppose also that we can at least partly test these conditions\nwith specification tests. We consider the common practice of conducting\ninference on the parameter of interest conditional on not rejecting these\ntests. We show that if the tested conditions hold, conditional inference is\nvalid but possibly conservative. This holds generally, without imposing any\nassumption on the asymptotic dependence between the estimator of the parameter\nof interest and the specification test.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"7OaCTN-2H4ZVj9M0Oux1cBKZvfOnDaDvuD8WZTbn3c4","pdfSize":"400306"}
