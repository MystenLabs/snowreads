Using contraction mapping method and\nconcentration compactness argument, we obtain the well-posedness theory in\nproper function spaces and scattering asymptotics. Moreover, we get a positive\nground state solution which is radially symmetric by using variational methods.\nThis paper extends the results of \\cite{KCEMF2006}(Invent.
