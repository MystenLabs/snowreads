We explore various information\ntheoretic measures, including Fisher information, Shannon entropy, Tsallis\nentropy and Renyi entropy. our numerical results show that the Fisher\ninformation increases with an increase in dissociation energy and decreases\nwith rinsing dipole moment, AB potential strength, and both radial and angular\nquantum numbers. In contrast, the Shannon entropy, the Tsallis entropy and the\nRenyi entropy decrease with rising dissociation energy, while they increase\nwith an increase in dipole moment, AB potential strength, as well as radial and\nangular quantum numbers. These observations collectively indicate that both\nprecision and localization of particles in space are enhanced by the increasing\nof the dissociation energy while they are reduced when we increase the dipole\nmoment, the AB potential strength, and both the radial and angular quantum\nnumbers.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KLNpVsEgQKjnKP01ryT8td9KO2bA59cYvkgfJTZa4Jg","pdfSize":"445372"}
