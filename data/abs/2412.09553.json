In a ferroelectric nematic NF with a\nspontaneous electric polarization P, the splay is suppressed since it produces\nbound electric charges. Here, we demonstrate that an alternating current (ac)\nelectric field causes three patterns of NF polarization. At low voltages, P\noscillates around the field-free orientation with no stationary deformations.\nAs the voltage increases, the polarization acquires stationary distortions,\nfirst splay and twist in a stripe pattern and then splay and bend in a square\nlattice of +1 and -1 defects. In all patterns, P oscillates around the\nstationary orientations. The stationary bound charge is reduced by a\ngeometrical splay cancellation mechanism that does not require free ions: the\ncharge created by splay in one plane is reduced by splay of an opposite sign in\nthe orthogonal plane.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RZi6DDHzg1zEmFd_Quvnr_3ajLkqwOimgjWA1pKJZxA","pdfSize":"5236077"}
