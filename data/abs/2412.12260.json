  "abstract": "  A favored scenario for axions to be dark matter is for them to form a cosmic\nstring network that subsequently decays, allowing for a tight link between the\naxion mass and relic abundance. We discuss an example in which the axion is\nprotected from quantum gravity effects that would spoil its ability to solve\nthe strong CP problem: namely a string theoretic axion arising from gauge\nsymmetry in warped extra dimensions. Axion strings arise following the\nfirst-order Randall-Sundrum compactification phase transition, forming at the\njunctions of three bubbles during percolation. Their tensions are at the low\nscale associated with the warp factor, and are parametrically smaller than the\nusual field-theory axion strings, relative to the scale of their decay\nconstant. Simulations of string network formation by this mechanism must be\ncarried out to see whether the axion mass-relic density relation depends on the\nnew parameters in the theory.\n",
