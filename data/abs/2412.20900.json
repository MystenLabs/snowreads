  "abstract": "  In the literature surrounding the theory of Banach spaces, considerable\neffort has been invested in exploring the conditions on a Banach space X that\ncharacterise X as being an inner product space or as a linearly isomorphic copy\nof a Hilbert space. On the other hand, a different theory emerges when the\nclass of Banach spaces is looked upon as a Lipschitz category where Lipschitz\nmaps are used as morphisms in the new category in place of the familiar bounded\nlinear maps in the linear theory.\n  This paper provides a short survey of recent results involving the\nappropriate Lipschitz analogues of certain well known results from the linear\ntheory characterizing Hilbert spaces. Whereas isometric description of Hilbert\nspaces has all along been a popular theme in this line of investigations, we\nshall concentrate mainly on isomorphic characterisations which entail the\nexistence of an equivalent norm on the underlying space arising from an inner\nproduct.\n",
