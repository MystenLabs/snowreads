Pre-germinative\ntreatment consists of priming the seeds with a dry atmospheric plasma (DAP)\ngenerated by a dielectric barrier device (DBD), characterized by minimal\nradiative emission, low electrical power (4 W) and high emissions of O, OH and\nNO radicals. Post-germinative treatment, known as plasma-activated water (PAW),\nuses a single-pin electrode device (SPED) to generate a DC discharge that\nfeatures a power of 126 W and produces large amounts of OH radicals. The\nresulting PAW, after 5 minutes of SPED treatment, induces a slight\nacidification and increased concentrations of nitrate ions (from 24 to 250\nmg/L), nitrite ions (from less than 0.1 to 56.1 mg/L) and hydrogen peroxide\n(from 0.3 to 18.5 mg/L). Results indicate that DAP applied on maize seeds for\n20 min boosts their germination rate up to 90% (versus only 65% for untreated\nseeds) while reducing the median germination time by 37.5%. Then, seedling\ngrowth monitoring is achieved on control, DAP, PAW and DAP+PAW groups to assess\nstem length, hypocotyl length, leaf count, collar diameter and fresh/dry mass.\nThe DAP+PAW group shows the most robust growth, demonstrating a synergistic\neffect of the combined treatments, particularly with significantly longer stem\nlengths. Additionally, physiological analyses of seedling leaves indicate a\ndecrease in chlorophyll content despite enhanced growth, while fluorescence\nmicroscopy reveals a reduction in stomatal density in leaves treated with DAP\nand PAW, especially in the combined treatment group, potentially impacting\nphotosynthetic efficiency and water regulation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lpyY0VCbgJUA_tNrtw8kmE_wYUq_YkdAqzYgDT0e85M","pdfSize":"2014061"}
