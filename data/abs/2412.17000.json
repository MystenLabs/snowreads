  "abstract": "  This paper investigates the structure of Verma modules over the N=1 BMS\nsuperalgebra. We provide a detailed classification of singular vectors,\nestablish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of subsingular\nvectors, uncover the structure of maximal submodules, present the composition\nseries of Verma modules, and derive character formulas for irreducible highest\nweight modules. As a byproduct, we also explicitly determine all singular\nvectors, subsingular vectors, and the composition series of Verma modules over\nthe algebra W(2,2).\n",
