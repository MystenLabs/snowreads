  "abstract": "  The proliferation of Internet services has led to an increasing need to\nprotect private data. User authentication serves as a crucial mechanism to\nensure data security. Although robust authentication forms the cornerstone of\nremote service security, it can still leave users vulnerable to credential\ndisclosure, device-theft attacks, session hijacking, and inadequate adaptive\nsecurity measures. Risk-based Authentication (RBA) emerges as a potential\nsolution, offering a multi-level authentication approach that enhances user\nexperience without compromising security. In this paper, we propose a Federated\nRisk-based Authentication (F-RBA) framework that leverages Federated Learning\nto ensure privacy-centric training, keeping user data local while distributing\nlearning across devices. Whereas traditional approaches rely on centralized\nstorage, F-RBA introduces a distributed architecture where risk assessment\noccurs locally on users' devices. The framework's core innovation lies in its\nsimilarity-based feature engineering approach, which addresses the\nheterogeneous data challenges inherent in federated settings, a significant\nadvancement for distributed authentication. By facilitating real-time risk\nevaluation across devices while maintaining unified user profiles, F-RBA\nachieves a balance between data protection, security, and scalability. Through\nits federated approach, F-RBA addresses the cold-start challenge in risk model\ncreation, enabling swift adaptation to new users without compromising security.\nEmpirical evaluation using a real-world multi-user dataset demonstrates the\nframework's effectiveness, achieving a superior true positive rate for\ndetecting suspicious logins compared to conventional unsupervised anomaly\ndetection models. This research introduces a new paradigm for privacy-focused\nRBA in distributed digital environments, facilitating advancements in federated\nsecurity systems.\n",
