Instead,\nthe present doctoral research approaches this debate from the perspective of\nhuman flourishing (eudaimonia). It articulates a neo-Aristotelian\ninterpretation according to which the prospect of mass AI-driven automation,\nfar from being a threat, is rather desirable insofar as it facilitates humans'\nflourishing and, subsequently, their engagement in leisure. Drawing on virtue\njurisprudence, this research further explores what this desirability may imply\nfor the current legal order.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computers and Society","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"VQ9v9y5-T9Hm7xkpJBOdSN0M3rv70g2CYqb4XCE8nqg","pdfSize":"277589"}
