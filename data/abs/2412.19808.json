  "abstract": "  The debate surrounding the 'future of work' is saturated with alarmist\nwarnings about the loss of work as an intrinsically valuable activity. Instead,\nthe present doctoral research approaches this debate from the perspective of\nhuman flourishing (eudaimonia). It articulates a neo-Aristotelian\ninterpretation according to which the prospect of mass AI-driven automation,\nfar from being a threat, is rather desirable insofar as it facilitates humans'\nflourishing and, subsequently, their engagement in leisure. Drawing on virtue\njurisprudence, this research further explores what this desirability may imply\nfor the current legal order.\n",
