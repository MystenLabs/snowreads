The analysis uses $140\\,\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of $13\\,\\mathrm{TeV}$\nproton proton collision data collected by the ATLAS detector at the Large\nHadron Collider. A particular focus is placed on the role played by transformer\nneural networks in discriminating signal and background processes via\nmulti-class discriminants and in reconstructing the Higgs boson transverse\nmomentum. These powerful multi-variate analysis techniques significantly\nimprove the analysis over a previous measurement using the same dataset.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GjIz9sojMdbgojlz7ndYQAcju1zqLOVQzDgnNG8fNMQ","pdfSize":"468623"}
