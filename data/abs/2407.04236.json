Here, similar nodes are grouped together to coarsen the\ngraph and reduce the input size in subsequent layers in deeper architectures.\nIn both settings, the underlying clustering approach can be implemented via\ngraph pooling operators, which often rely on classical tools from Graph Theory.\nIn this work, we introduce a graph pooling operator (ORC-Pool), which utilizes\na characterization of the graph's geometry via Ollivier's discrete Ricci\ncurvature and an associated geometric flow. Previous Ricci flow based\nclustering approaches have shown great promise across several domains, but are\nby construction unable to account for similarity structure encoded in the node\nattributes. However, in many ML applications, such information is vital for\ndownstream tasks. ORC-Pool extends such clustering approaches to attributed\ngraphs, allowing for the integration of geometric coarsening into Graph Neural\nNetworks as a pooling layer.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"88fGMCiirj5cQ5aqsErhbyrqoFEBYqgDEx1dHH44_lw","pdfSize":"1217578"}
