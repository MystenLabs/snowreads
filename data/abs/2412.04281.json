The Ellis\nequiuniformity on a topological transformation group $G$ from the maximal\nequiuniformity on a phase space $G/H$ in the case of its uniformly\nequicontinuous action is compared with Roelcke uniformity on $G$.\n  Proper Ellis semigroup compactifications are described for groups $S\\,(X)$\n(the permutation group of a discrete space $X$) and $Aut\\,(X)$ (automorphism\ngroup of an ultrahomogeneous chain $X$) in the permutation topology. It is\nshown that this approach can be applied to the unitary group of a Hilbert\nspace.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Topology","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Qaxp1nobBjsgH0IEGUbg22KzrlP3aEgVvMJJ-wKddzA","pdfSize":"435974"}
