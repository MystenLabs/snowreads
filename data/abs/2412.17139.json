  "abstract": "  We present a new dataset with the goal of advancing image style transfer -\nthe task of rendering one image in the style of another image. The dataset\ncovers various content and style images of different size and contains 10.000\nstylizations manually rated by three annotators in 1-10 scale. Based on\nobtained ratings, we find which factors are mostly responsible for favourable\nand poor user evaluations and show quantitative measures having statistically\nsignificant impact on user grades. A methodology for creating style transfer\ndatasets is discussed. Presented dataset can be used in automating multiple\ntasks, related to style transfer configuration and evaluation.\n",
