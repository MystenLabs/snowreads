A subfamily of $\\mathcal{OG}(4)$\nhas been identified as `basic', due to the fact that all members of\n$\\mathcal{OG}(4)$ are normal covers of at least one basic pair. We provide an\nexplicit classification of those basic pairs $(\\Gamma, G)$ which have at least\ntwo independent cyclic $G$-normal quotients (these are $G$-normal quotients\nwhich are not extendable to a common cyclic normal quotient).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tHHByPwL_R_V5wWTc_kqXlOo5J1wIM3b1hT2CWR_D1M","pdfSize":"260685"}
