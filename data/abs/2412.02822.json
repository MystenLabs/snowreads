Our first-principles findings reveal\nseveral dynamically stable phases across the doping-dependent phase diagram. We\nobserve a doping-induced increase in the superconducting transition temperature\n$T_c$, followed by a reduction in $T_c$ due to the formation of charge density\nwaves (CDWs), polaronic distortions, and structural transition from the H to\nthe 1T$'$ phase. Our work reconciles various experimental observations of CDWs\nin MoS$_2$ with its doping-dependent superconducting dome structure, which\noccurs due to the $1\\times 1$ H to $2\\times 2$ CDW phase transition.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"euSsB0ktDEfFkZJREfjy_mEDDUx9Pl9obOoUuHDG92s","pdfSize":"3770453"}
