  "abstract": "  Complex Langevin (CL) is a computational method to circumvent the numerical\nsign problem with applications in finite-density quantum chromodynamics and the\nreal-time dynamics of quantum field theories. It has long been known that,\ndepending on the simulated system, CL does not always converge correctly. In\nthis work, we provide numerical evidence that the success or failure of the\ncomplex Langevin method is deeply tied to the Lefschetz thimble structure of\nthe simulated system. This is demonstrated by constructing weight function\nregularizations that deform the thimbles of systems with compact domains. Our\nresults indicate that CL converges correctly when the regularized system\nexhibits a single relevant compact thimble. We introduce a bias correction to\nretrieve the values of the original theory for parameter sets where a direct\ncomplex Langevin approach fails. The effectiveness of this method is\nillustrated using several toy models, including the cosine model and the SU(2)\nand SU(3) Polyakov chains. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and\nlimitations of this regularization approach for lattice field theories.\n",
