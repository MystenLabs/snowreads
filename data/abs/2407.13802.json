Here we give an overview of the\nCPT system as it was operated for PI-ICR measurements at CARIBU for over half a\ndecade, along with some recently studied systematic effects.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"gMjzRcCtX_wpde5OJwqwmidNKrOcqKQk2dtfAOIPCvE","pdfSize":"1984767"}
