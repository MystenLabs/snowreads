Early\nwork has shown that intrinsic pinning generates a high pinning force and\ncritical current density in some layered oxide superconductors. Studying the\nintrinsic pinning of superconductors is crucial for both fundamental studies\nand potential applications. Herein, we use torque magnetometry to study\nangle-resolved in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic torque for a series of\nhigh-quality FeSe$_1$$_-$$_x$S$_x$ single crystals. A fourfold torque signal\nwas observed when the magnetic field was within the \\textit{ab} plane. We\ninterpret that this fourfold in-plane irreversible torque is from the intrinsic\npinning due to combined effects of gap nodes/minimum and twin domains.\nAdditionally, we attributed the observed out-of-plane torque peaks to intrinsic\npinning due to the layered structure.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"59sKnHkw-jAMThDRvVC9NSurvsbCvrnkdFuQkuV033U","pdfSize":"7193174"}
