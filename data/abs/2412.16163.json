To this\nend, a sliding manifold is introduced to achieve the sum of local gradients\napproaching zero, based on which a distributed protocol is derived to reach a\nconsensus minimizing the global cost. A novel approach for convergence analysis\nis derived in a unified settling time framework, resulting in an algorithm that\ncan precisely converge to the optimal solution at the prescribed time. The\nmethod is interesting as it simply requires the primal states to be shared over\nthe network, which implies less communication requirements. The result is\nextended to scenarios with time-varying objective function, by introducing\nlocal gradients prediction and non-smooth consensus terms. Numerical\nsimulations are provided to corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed\nalgorithms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_47YyjerH1SPpXSgXm_-iCrLPHcNHwpCvEclHjekp6E","pdfSize":"14678329"}
