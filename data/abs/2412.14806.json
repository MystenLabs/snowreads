  "abstract": "  Differential top quark pair cross sections are measured in the dilepton final\nstate as a function of kinematic variables associated to the dineutrino system.\nThe measurements are performed making use of the Run 2 dataset collected by the\nCMS experiment at the CERN LHC collider, corresponding to proton-proton\ncollisions recorded at center of mass energy of 13 TeV and an integrated\nluminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. The measured cross sections are found in agreement\nwith theory predictions and Monte Carlo simulations of standard model\nprocesses.\n",
