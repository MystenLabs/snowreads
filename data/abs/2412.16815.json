Despite its potential,\nrelated experimental studies remain limited. In this work, we systematically\nexamine the interplay between orbital selectivity and magnetism in the newly\ndiscovered anisotropic kagome TbTi3Bi4 single crystal, and report a\nunidirectional, orbital-selective band reconstruction within the\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) state. By combining soft X-ray and vacuum ultraviolet\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements with\norbital-resolved density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we identify that\nthe band reconstruction is a manifestation of the AFM order, driven by a 1/3\nnesting instability of the intercalated Tb 5dxz orbitals. Such an\norbital-selective modulation leads the unusual momentum-dependent band folding\nand the emergence of symmetry-protected Dirac cones only at the M1 point. More\nimportantly, the discovery of orbital-selective 3 x 1 AFM order offers crucial\ninsights into the underlying mechanism of the fractional magnetization plateau\nin this Kagome AFM metal. Our findings not only underscore the essential role\nof both conducting and localized electrons in determining the magnetic orders\nof LnTi3Bi4 (Ln = Lanthanide) kagome metals but also offer a pathway for\nmanipulating magnetism through selective control of anisotropic electronic\nstructures.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sMdQi6tFWSvP41sVUgVraw31wi35BnToKWNwCTOHq7k","pdfSize":"8697133"}
