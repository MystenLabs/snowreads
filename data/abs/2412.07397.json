  "abstract": "  Photon-subtracted two-mode squeezed vacuum states, a significant quantum\nresource, exhibit intricate correlations and unique quantum properties. In this\nwork, we propose a theoretical yet experimentally feasible model to engineer\nthese states using a waveguide trimer. Our study uncovers distinct\ncharacteristics of the photon-subtracted state depending on whether an even or\nodd number of photons is extracted, shedding light on the subtle relationship\nbetween quantum state manipulation and the parity of the number of subtracted\nphotons. Furthermore, our integrated device facilitates the generation of\nmultiphoton states with tunable correlations, offering significant potential\nfor applications in quantum-enhanced technologies.\n",
