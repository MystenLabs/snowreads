Viewing these marked\ntangles as endomorphisms in the cobordism category from the four-punctured\nsphere to itself, we identify the images of these endomorphisms in the\nWeinstein symplectic partial category under the partially defined\nholonomy-perturbed traceless character variety functor. We express these\nendomorphisms on immersed curves in the pillowcase in terms of doubling and\nfigure eight operations and prove they have the same image.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bxs-t5fxO8l9f_6goW3rlwyTrIEw8yGgjlmtYCBDprs","pdfSize":"6089432"}
