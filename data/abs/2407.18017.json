Harvesting this computation in a useful way has historically shown\nitself to be difficult, but if combined with reservoir computing (RC), this\nbecomes much more feasible. Furthermore, RC and ECA enable energy-efficient AI,\nmaking the combination a promising concept for Edge AI. In this work, we\ncontrast ECA to substrates of Partially-Local CA (PLCA) and Homogeneous\nHomogeneous Random Boolean Networks (HHRBN). They are, in comparison, the\ntopological heterogeneous counterparts of ECA. This represents a step from ECA\ntowards more biological-plausible substrates. We analyse these substrates by\ntesting on an RC benchmark (5-bit memory), using Temporal Derrida plots to\nestimate the sensitivity and assess the defect collapse rate. We find that,\ncounterintuitively, disordered topology does not necessarily mean disordered\ncomputation. There are countering computational \"forces\" of topology\nimperfections leading to a higher collapse rate (order) and yet, if accounted\nfor, an increased sensitivity to the initial condition. These observations\ntogether suggest a shrinking critical range.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Cellular Automata and Lattice Gases","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JVzNxGDQUeAGgWHj6YoyVI8Vqf3F_QhPrh_oUfwXj_Q","pdfSize":"4715890"}
