The current approach to wound\nassessment by therapists based on photographic documentation is subjective,\nhighlighting the need for computer-aided wound recognition from smartphone\nphotos. This offers objective and convenient therapy monitoring, while being\naccessible to patients from their home at any time. However, despite research\nin mobile image segmentation, there is a lack of focus on mobile wound\nsegmentation. To address this gap, we conduct initial research on three\nlightweight architectures to investigate their suitability for smartphone-based\nwound segmentation. Using public datasets and UNet as a baseline, our results\nare promising, with both ENet and TopFormer, as well as the larger UNeXt\nvariant, showing comparable performance to UNet. Furthermore, we deploy the\nmodels into a smartphone app for visual assessment of live segmentation, where\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of TopFormer in distinguishing wounds\nfrom wound-coloured objects. While our study highlights the potential of\ntransformer models for mobile wound segmentation, future work should aim to\nfurther improve the mask contours.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Gpmhh-Ygkw3UXhVgWPEU7eWwajMKh3ANZVId-8Iah_c","pdfSize":"5912111","objectId":"0x410ff220520b6971d08bb0c67194f71145d33634d2f95222a38d9b69f28d77f5","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
