VZLUSAT-2 followed ten months later in a\nsimilar orbit carrying as a secondary payload a pair of identical detectors as\nused on the first mission. These instruments detecting gamma-rays in the range\nof 30-900 keV consist of a 56 cm2 5 mm thin CsI(Tl) scintillator read-out by a\nrow of multi-pixel photon counters (MPPC or SiPM). The scientific motivation is\nto detect gamma-ray bursts and other HE transient events and serve as a\npathfinder for a larger constellation of nanosatellites that could localize\nthese events via triangulation.\n  At the beginning of July 2024, GRBAlpha detected 140 such transients, while\nVZLUSAT-2 had 83 positive detections, confirmed by larger GRB missions. Almost\na hundred of them are identified as gamma-ray bursts, including extremely\nbright GRB 221009A and GRB 230307A, detected by both satellites. We were able\nto characterize the degradation of SiPMs in polar orbit and optimize the duty\ncycle of the detector system also by using SatNOGS radio network for downlink.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"7QWaL28PPDgGzairDE6MVRUBDu886jyYhHoeTYx3WVg","pdfSize":"5828175","objectId":"0x34d27458ef2c73bea7a770877deca47ebf101789a6a7dd7e122a9ec934d7e8e6","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
