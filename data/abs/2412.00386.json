  "abstract": "  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly utilized in wireless\ncommunication, yet accurate channel loss prediction remains a significant\nchallenge, limiting resource optimization performance. To address this issue,\nthis paper leverages Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) for the\nefficient construction of Channel Knowledge Maps (CKM) and UAV trajectory\ndesign. Given the time-consuming nature of channel data collection, AI\ntechniques are employed in a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN)\nto extract environmental features and augment the data. Experiment results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving CKM\nconstruction accuracy. Moreover, integrating CKM into UAV trajectory planning\nreduces channel gain uncertainty, demonstrating its potential to enhance\nwireless communication efficiency.\n",
