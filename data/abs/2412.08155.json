For the purpose of diagnosing plasma properties and electron energy\ndistribution function (EEDF), an in-house electronic circuit and an\nRF-compensated Langmuir probe are devised and constructed. The second harmonic\ntechnique (SHT) has been applied to obtain the direct measurement of EEDF and\nevaluated the effect of RF electron magnetization on the bulk plasma heating\nwithin the discharge. The effect of external magnetic field on the overall rise\nin plasma properties has been verified by use of particle and energy balance\nequations derived for argon discharge.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"KTNTFl5DQlWVnHWN3Gg0mzJQrDWB66KXOis4TMXRats","pdfSize":"915167"}
