  "abstract": "  We combine experiments in a von K\\'arm\\'an flow with numerical simulations of\nTaylor-Green and homogeneous and isotropic turbulence to study the effect of\nthe local flow geometry on particle pair dispersion. To characterize particle\ndispersion we use the pair dispersion angle, defined as the angle between the\nrelative position and relative velocity of particle pairs. This angle was\nrecently introduced as a means to more effectively identify the different\ndispersion regimes in finite-Reynolds-number flows. Our results show that, at a\nglobal scale, all flows considered show similar dispersion properties in terms\nof this metric, characterized by ballistic, super-diffusive, and diffusive\nregimes. Locally, however, these systems exhibit distinct behaviors, with\nanisotropies and local geometric features significantly influencing dispersion\nin both the von K\\'arm\\'an and Taylor-Green flows.\n",
