In this paper we prove\nthe same for principal submatrices of $(\\zeta_n^{ij})_{i,j=0}^{n-1}$, when\n$n=pr$ is the product of two distinct primes, and $p$ is a large enough prime\nthat has order $r-1$ in $\\mathbf{Z}_r^*$. As an application, an uncertainty\nprinciple for cyclic groups of order $n$ is established when $n=pr$ as\ndescribed above.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"z_8R91CDYEMSUOJcWMeHpYTra1ur5woEUQ2VhQvccCk","pdfSize":"214496"}
