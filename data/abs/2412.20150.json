  "abstract": "  Motivated by the observation of the $J^P = 1^+$ resonance $X(2085)$ in the\n$p\\bar{\\Lambda}$ system by the BESIII collaboration, we studied the molecular\nstates of hexaquarks $p\\bar{\\Lambda}$ and $p\\bar{\\Sigma}$ with\nbaryon-antibaryon structures within the framework of the QCD sum rules.\nNon-perturbative contributions up to dimension 13 were considered in our\nanalysis. The results indicate the existence of six possible molecular states\n$p\\bar{\\Lambda}$ and $p\\bar{\\Sigma}$, with quantum numbers $J^{P}=0^{-}, 0^{+},\n1^{-}$. Consequently, the current sum rule results do not support the\ninterpretation of $X(2085)$ as a $p\\bar{\\Lambda}$ or $p\\bar{\\Sigma}$ molecular\nstate. On the other hand, we find that the masses of the proposed\n$p\\bar{\\Lambda}$ and $p\\bar{\\Sigma}$ structures with $J^{P} = 1^{-}$ are in the\nvicinity of observed $X(2075)$, which implies that the nature of this state\nneeds more invistigations. Moreover, the possible decay modes of the concerned\nhexaquark states are analyzed.\n",
