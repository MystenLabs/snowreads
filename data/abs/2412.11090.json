  "abstract": "  Hangeul was created as a phonetic alphabet and is known to have the best 1:1\ncorrespondence between letters and pronunciation among existing alphabets. In\nthis paper, we examine the possibility of modifying the basic form of Hangeul\nand using it as a kind of phonetic symbol. The core concept of this approach is\nto preserve the basic form of the alphabet, modifying only the shape of a\nstroke rather than the letter itself. To the best of our knowledge, no previous\nattempts in any language have been made to express pronunciations of an\nalphabet different from the original simply by changing the shape of the\nalphabet strokes, and this paper is probably the first attempt in this\ndirection.\n",
