There are two important aspects for a grid ability\nto ensure continuous and reliable electricity delivery to consumers: capacity,\nthe maximum amount the system can handle, and transmission, the infrastructure\nnecessary to deliver electricity across the network. These capacity and\ntransmission costs are then allocated to the end-users according to the cost\ncausation principle. These charges are computed based on the customer demand on\ncoincident peak (CP) events, time intervals when the system-wide electric load\nis highest. We tackle the problem of predicting CP events based on actual load\nand forecast data on the load of different jurisdictions. In particular, we\nidentify two main use cases depending on the availability of a forecast. Our\napproach generates scenarios and formulates Monte-Carlo estimators for\npredicting CP-day and exact CP-hour events. Finally, we backtest the prediction\nperformance of strategies with adaptive threshold for the prediction task. This\nanalysis enables us to derive practical implications for load curtailment\nthrough Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) solutions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"pxdHUYSVY834RdBXZOK3Guet9ou-mo7cIrEdPnwHRAo","pdfSize":"15094319"}
