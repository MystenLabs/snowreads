However, recent astronomical observations have revealed\nhydration on their surface through the detection of 3-$\\mu$m absorption\nfeatures associated with OH and potentially H2O. We present evidence of\nhydration due mainly to OH on asteroid (16) Psyche, the largest M-class\nasteroid, using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) spanning 1.1 -\n6.63 $\\mu$m. Our observations include two detections of the full 3-$\\mu$m\nfeature associated with OH and H2O resembling those found in CY-, CH-, and\nCB-type carbonaceous chondrites, and no 6-$\\mu$m feature uniquely associated\nwith H2O across two observations. We observe 3-$\\mu$m depths of between 4.3 and\n6% across two observations, values consistent with hydrogen abundance estimates\non other airless bodies of 250 - 400 ppm. We place an upper limit of 39 ppm on\nthe water abundance from the standard deviation around the 6-$\\mu$m feature\nregion. The presence of hydrated minerals suggests a complex history for\nPsyche. Exogenous sources of OH-bearing minerals could come from hydrated\nimpactors. Endogenous OH-bearing minerals would indicate a composition more\nsimilar to E-or P-class asteroids. If the hydration is endogenous, it supports\nthe theory that Psyche originated beyond the snow line and later migrated to\nthe outer main belt.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-DsWAgg1bD_UmF8iYGUzviOET59iQPAUPskWcGeS--w","pdfSize":"3752965"}
