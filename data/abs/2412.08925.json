In particular, we\nconjecture that Krylov complexity equals the volume of the Fubini-Study metric\nin the information geometry. In order to test our conjecture, we study the\ngeneral Hermitian two-mode Hamiltonian according to the Weyl algebra both in\nthe closed and open systems. By employing the displacement operator, we find\nthat the wave function for a closed system corresponds to the well-known\ntwo-mode squeezed state. For an open system, we can create a wave function\nknown as the open two-mode squeezed state by using the second kind of Meixner\npolynomials. Remarkably, in both cases, the resulting volume of the\ncorresponding Fubini-Study metric provides strong evidence for the generalized\nCV conjecture.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zHpVyBnmWWjNTtl5qHrGqztTBdYCttb3QpfDm2sRfG8","pdfSize":"184012"}
