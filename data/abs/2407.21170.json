Our system uses a large language model (LLM) to classify questions into\none of four types: conceptual, homework, logistics, and not answerable. This\nenables us to employ a different strategy for answering questions that fall\nunder different types. Using a variant of GPT-3, we achieve $81\\%$\nclassification accuracy. We discuss our system's performance on answering\nconceptual questions from a machine learning course and various failure modes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bXlWhR--kmSLnlx4nsWQ0tDPmWWGfrwUY5xodVsoQ8c","pdfSize":"113171"}
