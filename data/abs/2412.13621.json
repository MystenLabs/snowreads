  "abstract": "  Various pipes are extensively used in both industrial settings and daily\nlife, but the pipe inspection especially those with narrow sizes are still very\nchallenging with tremendous time and manufacturing consumed. Quadrupedal\nrobots, inspired from patrol dogs, can be a substitution of traditional\nsolutions but always suffer from navigation and locomotion difficulties. In\nthis paper, we introduce a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based method to train a\npolicy enabling the quadrupedal robots to cross narrow pipes adaptively. A new\nprivileged visual information and a new reward function are defined to tackle\nthe problems. Experiments on both simulation and real world scenarios were\ncompleted, demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve the pipe-crossing\ntask even with unexpected obstacles inside.\n",
