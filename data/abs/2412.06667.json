For\ncompactness the monopole antenna is mounted on top of a FR4 substrate and is\ndesigned as a planar structure which can be wrapped into a box like structure.\nThe performance characteristics of the wrapped dual band monopole antenna are\nsimulated on Ansoft HFSS before fabrication and testing on a Network Analyzer.\nThe simulated HFSS return loss of the antenna shows broad agreement with\nexperiment over the frequency range from 500MHz to 4GHz. Radiation patterns are\ngenerated in each band of operation of the antenna. The effect of feedline\nimpedance matching on the performance of the monopole antenna is discussed.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Gk4NQNl64Vry2f__iPYdg3mNBx2HuYXnRxesH0qpMHM","pdfSize":"1401594"}
