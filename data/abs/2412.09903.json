By employing Fourier pseudo-spectral\ndiscretization in space and the inner product technique, we derive a rigorous\nFourier eigenvalue analysis, which provides a detailed optimal convergence rate\nand error estimate. The primary challenge is addressing the complex nonlinear\nterms in the NSS equation. Fortunately, this challenge could be resolved\nthrough careful eigenvalue bound estimates for various operators.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YXPnYBMAI8m00mCLHGLYndFYFcRsDuSk5YmhUf1sbqM","pdfSize":"564155"}
