  "abstract": "  The \\emph{Swift} Burst Alert Telescope (BAT), operating in the 15--150 keV\nenergy band, struggles to detect the peak energy ($E_{\\rm p}$) of gamma-ray\nbursts (GRBs), as most GRBs have $E_{\\rm p}$ values typically distributed\nbetween 200-300 keV, exceeding BAT's upper limit. To address this, we develop\nan innovative method to robustly estimate the lower limit of $E_{\\rm p}$ for\nGRBs with $E_{\\rm p}>150$ keV. This approach relies on the intrinsic curvature\nof GRB spectra, which is already evident within the BAT energy range for such\nGRBs. By fitting BAT spectra with a cutoff power-law model and extrapolating\nthe spectral curvature beyond BAT's range, we, therefore, can estimate the\ncutoff energy ($E^{'}_{\\rm c}$) beyond 150 keV and the corresponding peak\nenergy ($E^{'}_{\\rm p}$). We applied this method to 17 GRBs, categorizing them\ninto two main groups. Group I (10 bursts) maintains $\\alpha$ within a typical\nrange (from $\\sim$ -0.8 to $\\sim$ -1.20) with increasing $E_{\\rm c}$; Group II\n(2 bursts) maintains $E_{\\rm c}$ within a typical range (300-500 keV) but with\nvarying $\\alpha$. Our results show that for $E_{\\rm c}\\lesssim $1000 keV, the\nestimated $E^{'}_{\\rm c}$ aligns well with observed values. Moreover, the\nreliability of $E^{'}_{\\rm c}$ also depends on $\\alpha$: bursts with harder\n$\\alpha$ (e.g., $\\alpha \\gtrsim -2/3$) show reduced accuracy, while bursts with\nsofter $\\alpha$ (e.g., $\\alpha \\lesssim -2/3$) yield more precise estimates. In\nconclusion, this method is well-suited for GRB spectra with moderately observed\n$E_{\\rm c}$ ($E_{\\rm p}$) values and $\\alpha$ indices that are not too hard.\n",
