A significant contributor to this growth was the installation of\ndifferent kinds of engines used to power factories. We use newly digitized data\non engines and their energy source by industry sector, and combine this with\nmunicipality-level data of workers per industry sector to construct a new\nvariable reflecting economic output using dirty engines. In turn, we assess the\naverage externality of dirty output on mortality in the short-run, as defined\nby deaths over the population in the baseline year. Our results show\nsubstantial increases of up to 17% higher mortality in cities where large\nincreases to dirty engine installations occurred, which is largely driven by\nthe elderly. We also run a placebo test using clean powered industry and find\nno effect on mortality.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"riGP6nf6x9WuL1caPdd1M7ApVyeHcuy3cJn32Srx7TQ","pdfSize":"1242651"}
