  "abstract": "  Rendering photorealistic head avatars from arbitrary viewpoints is crucial\nfor various applications like virtual reality. Although previous methods based\non Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) can achieve impressive results, they lack\nfidelity and efficiency. Recent methods using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have\nimproved rendering quality and real-time performance but still require\nsignificant storage overhead. In this paper, we introduce a method called\nGraphAvatar that utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to generate 3D Gaussians\nfor the head avatar. Specifically, GraphAvatar trains a geometric GNN and an\nappearance GNN to generate the attributes of the 3D Gaussians from the tracked\nmesh. Therefore, our method can store the GNN models instead of the 3D\nGaussians, significantly reducing the storage overhead to just 10MB. To reduce\nthe impact of face-tracking errors, we also present a novel graph-guided\noptimization module to refine face-tracking parameters during training.\nFinally, we introduce a 3D-aware enhancer for post-processing to enhance the\nrendering quality. We conduct comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the\nadvantages of GraphAvatar, surpassing existing methods in visual fidelity and\nstorage consumption. The ablation study sheds light on the trade-offs between\nrendering quality and model size. The code will be released at:\nhttps://github.com/ucwxb/GraphAvatar\n",
