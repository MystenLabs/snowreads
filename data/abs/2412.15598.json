Unfortunately, classification-based\nmethods lack a sound mechanism to detect the onset of seizure events. In this\nwork, we propose a two-stage framework, \\method, that explicitly models seizure\nonset through a novel task formulation of subsequence clustering. Given an EEG\nsequence, the framework first learns a set of second-level embeddings with\nlabel supervision. It then employs model-based clustering to explicitly capture\nlong-term temporal dependencies in EEG sequences and identify meaningful\nsubsequences. Epochs within a subsequence share a common cluster assignment\n(normal or seizure), with cluster or state transitions representing successful\nonset detections. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our\nmethod can correct misclassifications, achieving 5%-11% classification\nimprovements over other baselines and accurately detecting seizure onsets.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"r7DHWKOEnUSFMepaz7blsBMt2tTu_6FDQcjWIFwxOEA","pdfSize":"2589543"}
