We show how such models can be converted\ninto (probabilistic) axioms (or rules) thus ensuring more interpretability.\nMoreover they may be also initialized exploiting expert knowledge. We present\nand discuss the outcomes of an empirical evaluation which aimed at testing the\neffectiveness of the models on a number of random classification problems with\ndifferent ontologies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"t77odc9qnKmwuYW8LntrfUmWQUS5VGfgvSJuyXof_MQ","pdfSize":"232278"}
