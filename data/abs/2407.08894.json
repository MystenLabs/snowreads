The problem is further compounded by the\nneed to periodically synchronize network devices to a common time reference to\naddress clock drifts. Existing solutions often simplify the problem by assuming\neither perfect synchronization or a worst-case error. Additionally, these\napproaches delay the scheduling process in network devices until the scheduled\nframe is guaranteed to have arrived in the device queue, inducing additional\ndelays to the stream. A novel approach that completely avoids queuing delays is\nproposed, enabling it to meet even the strictest deadline requirement.\nFurthermore, both approaches can be enhanced by incorporating network-derived\ntime-synchronization information. This is not only convenient for meeting\ndeadline requirements but also improves bandwidth efficiency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"J0DvCHI4jCBzgBZ0YQ7_H3wsoUBtgZEJZ_s5bozglK0","pdfSize":"1508090","objectId":"0x2b8a85885793dfede1bb766baa8caee06bf28c4684fcec101d036124481c6eea","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
