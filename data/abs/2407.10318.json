Traditional methods that remove caustic patterns from\nimages often rely on 2D filtering or pre-training on an annotated dataset,\nhindering the performance when generalizing to real-world seafloor data with 3D\nstructures. In this paper, we present a novel method Recurrent Gaussian\nSplatting (RecGS), which takes advantage of today's photorealistic 3D\nreconstruction technology, 3DGS, to separate caustics from seafloor imagery.\nWith a sequence of images taken by an underwater robot, we build 3DGS\nrecurrently and decompose the caustic with low-pass filtering in each\niteration. In the experiments, we analyze and compare with different methods,\nincluding joint optimization, 2D filtering, and deep learning approaches. The\nresults show that our method can effectively separate the caustic from the\nseafloor, improving the visual appearance, and can be potentially applied on\nmore problems with inconsistent illumination.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8_D5jOOWZNv7bGOTz3Q0GvFZCx_cMt75Y4aVBWNcEvE","pdfSize":"19161059","objectId":"0x33674bd87ae129e5db168c5f2e225ef24f0836907c48154fdb17a2d9521c7e1a","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
