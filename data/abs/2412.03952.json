  "abstract": "  Two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectrics and multiferroics have attracted\nconsiderable scientific and technological interest in recent years due to the\nincreasing demands for miniaturization and low energy consumption of electronic\ndevices. At present, the research on 2D ferroelectrics and multiferroics is\nstill focused on van der Waals materials, while the known bulk ferroelectric\nand multiferroic materials are mostly found in perovskite systems. The ability\nto prepare and transfer 2D perovskite oxides has provided unprecedented\nopportunities for developing ferroelectrics and multiferroics based on 2D\nperovskites. In this Perspective, we review the research progress on 2D\nferroelectrics and multiferroics in inorganic perovskites in terms of different\nferroelectric and magnetoelectric coupling mechanisms. The improper\nferroelectricity and novel magnetoelectric coupling mechanisms discovered in 2D\nperovskites are emphasized, and then, the main challenges and future\ndevelopment direction are put forward.\n",
