  "abstract": "  My paper \"Talking About Large Language Models\" has more than once been\ninterpreted as advocating a reductionist stance towards large language models.\nBut the paper was not intended that way, and I do not endorse such positions.\nThis short note situates the paper in the context of a larger philosophical\nproject that is concerned with the (mis)use of words rather than metaphysics,\nin the spirit of Wittgenstein's later writing.\n",
