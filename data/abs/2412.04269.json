The structures in the\nPQ charges\n  of all fermions and scalar fields in the model are investigated by applying\nthe invariant condition under\n  the symmetry group on all Yukawa interaction terms. All defined PQ charges\njust depend on PQ charge of the only complex singlet scalar in the model. The\nmixing and mass hierachy in the scalar sector of the model are studied in\ndetail. As the result, the physical state of axion is a linear combination\n  of all imaginary parts of scalar multiplets as general form. Explicit\nexpressions for axion and light Standard Model like Higgs boson are shown. Mass\nof the axion and its coupling to photon are derived.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PUmibxQY2-fIo8HHwQDAk5d32LZhMAVHR3Z_qflYzl4","pdfSize":"271658"}
