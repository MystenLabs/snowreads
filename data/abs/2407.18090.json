On the other hand, we establish\nthat the minimisation problem for both deterministic and history-deterministic\ngeneralised B\\\"uchi automata is NP-complete, as well as the problem of\nminimising at the same time the number of states and colours of\nhistory-deterministic generalised coB\\\"uchi automata.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"HIGaMP5PZZrU-d9ymnaG-6lbzZLaWlLaWqrxUnwdsKw","pdfSize":"1295145"}
