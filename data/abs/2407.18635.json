This leads to considering a family of controlled\nBrownian diffusion processes with dynamics depending on the whole collection of\nmarginal probability laws. We prove the well-posedness of such systems and\ndefine the control problem together with its related value function. We next\nprove a law invariance property for the value function which allows us to work\non the set of collections of probability laws. We show that the value function\nsatisfies a dynamic programming principle (DPP) on the flow of collections of\nprobability measures. We also derive a chain rule for a class of regular\nfunctions along the flows of collections of marginal laws of diffusion\nprocesses. Combining the DPP and the chain rule, we prove that the value\nfunction is a viscosity solution of a Bellman dynamic programming equation in a\n$L^2$-set of Wasserstein space-valued functions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"X76QcNQnXYs6OIoRw9Nb8Oi3w-WKdJke8hOTLQDpNyg","pdfSize":"488948"}
