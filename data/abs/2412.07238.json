This review\nexplores speaker effects, focusing on how speaker information impacts language\nprocessing. We propose an integrative model featuring the interplay between\nbottom-up perception-based processes driven by acoustic details and top-down\nexpectation-based processes driven by a speaker model. The acoustic details\ninfluence lower-level perception, while the speaker model modulates both\nlower-level and higher-level processes such as meaning interpretation and\npragmatic inferences. We define speaker-idiosyncrasy and speaker-demographics\neffects and demonstrate how bottom-up and top-down processes interact at\nvarious levels in different scenarios. This framework contributes to\npsycholinguistic theory by offering a comprehensive account of how speaker\ninformation interacts with linguistic content to shape message construction. We\nsuggest that speaker effects can serve as indices of a language learner's\nproficiency and an individual's characteristics of social cognition. We\nencourage future research to extend these findings to AI speakers, probing the\nuniversality of speaker effects across humans and artificial agents.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language","Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DQyF9sfhK5w-l2dXMP_p-ZUj8y89EMCu6oPnEvIUu1o","pdfSize":"603824"}
