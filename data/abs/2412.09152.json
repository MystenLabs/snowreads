  "abstract": "  Recent research is revealing data-sonification as a promising complementary\napproach to vision, benefiting both data perception and interpretation. We\npresent herakoi, a novel open-source software that uses machine learning to\nallow real-time image sonification, with a focus on astronomical data. By\ntracking hand movements via a webcam and mapping them to image coordinates,\nherakoi translates visual properties into sound, enabling users to \"hear\"\nimages. Its swift responsiveness allows users to access information in\nastronomical images with short training, demonstrating high reliability and\neffectiveness. The software has shown promise in educational and outreach\nsettings, making complex astronomical concepts more engaging and accessible to\ndiverse audiences, including blind and visually impaired individuals. We also\ndiscuss future developments, such as the integration of large language and\nvision models to create a more interactive experience in interpreting\nastronomical data.\n",
