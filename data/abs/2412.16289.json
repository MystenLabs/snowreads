The\ndynamical bosonic fields are single-particle distribution functions defined on\nthe phase space. We show that when projecting to a single band, Berry curvature\neffects naturally emerge. In particular, we consider the de Haas-van Alphen\neffect of a 2d Fermi surface, and show that the oscillation of orbital\nmagnetization in an external field is offset by the Berry phase accumulated by\nthe cyclotron around the Fermi surface. Beyond previously known results, we\nshow that this phase shift holds even for interacting systems, in which the\nsingle-particle Berry phase is replaced by the static anomalous Hall\nconductance. Furthermore, we obtain the correction to the amplitudes of de\nHaas-van Alphen oscillations due to Berry curvature effects.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BuT_f_tg4t9vaIjbWaXV0DM82uS6KW9yKdg81dO9HqY","pdfSize":"924061"}
