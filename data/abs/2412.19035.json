Course catalogs may therefore be an effective place to\nencourage reflection on academic choices and interests. To test this, we\nembedded a psychological intervention in an online course catalog to encourage\nstudents to reflect on their purpose during course exploration. Results of a\nrandomized field experiment with over 4,000 students at a large U.S. university\nshow that a purpose intervention increased students' cognitive engagement in\ndescribing their interests, but reduced search activities. Students became more\ninterested in courses related to creative arts and social change, but less in\ncomputer and data science. The findings demonstrate the malleability of\nstudents' interests during course exploration and suggest practical strategies\nto support purpose reflection and guide students toward deliberate exploration\nof their interests in higher education.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computers and Society","Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WF8OTPBcfFF7Q7B90mji9lQc-4GveL6KpG-MlnqzDqc","pdfSize":"725343"}
