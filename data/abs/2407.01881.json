The\ncomplexity of NiPS3 itself, however, has also led to ongoing debates regarding\nits characteristics such as the existence of self-doped ligand holes. In this\nstudy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering\nhave been applied to investigate the electronic structure of NiPS3. With the\naid of theoretical calculations using the charge-transfer multiplet model, we\nprovide experimental evidence for NiPS3 being a Mott-Hubbard insulator rather\nthan a charge-transfer insulator. Moreover, we explain why some previous XAS\nstudies have concluded that NiPS3 is a charge-transfer insulator by comparing\nsurface and bulk sensitive spectra.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FDbXk4yaWKVPkDNw_vQG9tkD4eNL_QgNYLP7_xVJoe4","pdfSize":"701909"}
