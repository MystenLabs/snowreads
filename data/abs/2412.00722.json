  "abstract": "  Language Agent could be endowed with different mechanisms for autonomous task\naccomplishment. Current agents typically rely on fixed mechanisms or a set of\nmechanisms activated in a predefined order, limiting their adaptation to varied\npotential task solution structures. To this end, this paper proposes\n\\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{L}anguage \\textbf{A}gent \\textbf{M}echanism\n\\textbf{A}ctivation Learning with Self-Exploration (\\textbf{ALAMA}), which\nfocuses on optimizing mechanism activation adaptability without reliance on\nexpert models. Initially, it builds a harmonized agent framework\n(\\textbf{UniAct}) to \\textbf{Uni}fy different mechanisms via \\textbf{Act}ions.\nThen it leverages a training-efficient optimization method based on\nself-exploration to enable the UniAct to adaptively activate the appropriate\nmechanisms according to the potential characteristics of the task. Experimental\nresults demonstrate significant improvements in downstream agent tasks,\naffirming the effectiveness of our approach in facilitating more dynamic and\ncontext-sensitive mechanism activation.\n",
