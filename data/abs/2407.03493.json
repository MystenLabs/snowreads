In this study, we conducted a\ncomprehensive analysis of the catalytic effects of an amorphous solid water\n(ASW) surface on the reaction between ammonia (NH$_3$) and formaldehyde\n(H$_2$CO) to form aminomethanol (NH$_2$CH$_2$OH) using density functional\ntheory. We identified potential catalytic sites based on the binding energy\ndistribution of NH$_3$ and H$_2$CO reactants, on a set-of-clusters surface\nmodel composed of 22 water molecules and found a total of 14 reaction paths.\nOur results indicate that the catalytic sites can be categorized into four\ngroups, depending on the interactions of the carbonyl oxygen and the amino\ngroup with the ice surface in the reactant complex. A detailed analysis of the\nreaction mechanism using Intrinsic Reaction Coordinate and reaction force\nanalysis revealed three distinct chemical events for this reaction: formation\nof the C--N bond, breaking of the N--H bond, and formation of the O--H hydroxyl\nbond. Depending on the type of catalytic site, these events can occur within a\nsingle, concerted, albeit asynchronous, step, or can be isolated in a step-wise\nmechanism, with the lowest overall transition state energy observed at 1.3 kcal\nmol$^{-1}$. A key requirement for the low-energy mechanism is the presence of a\npair of dangling OH bonds on the surface, found at 5\\% of the potential\ncatalytic sites on an ASW porous surface.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"yQd8EFYmxPes315CHbzFqb_sql5RE_me61z6HpE5AnI","pdfSize":"4912628"}
