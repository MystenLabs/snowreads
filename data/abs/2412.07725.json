  "abstract": "  In this paper, we present a generalised Hamiltonian formulation to model the\ncollision rate, energy loss, entropy evolution, and the transition from\nMaxwellian to non-Maxwellian distributions in a plasma. By incorporating\ngyrokinetic turbulence and the effects of collisions, we derive a Hamiltonian\nthat captures both the collisionless and collisional dynamics of a plasma. The\nformulation accounts for entropy production, energy transport, and the\nresulting changes in plasma confinability. We show how entropy increase during\nthe transition from Maxwellian to non-Maxwellian states impacts fusion\nefficiency and plasma stability. Finally, we provide a mathematical proof that\nlinks entropy evolution to energy loss and the emergent properties of\nconfinement.\n",
