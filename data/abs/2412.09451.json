  "abstract": "  Models of active galactic nuclei often invoke a close physical association\nbetween the broad-line region and the accretion disk. We evaluate this\ntheoretical expectation by investigating the relationship between the\ninclination angle of the BLR ($\\theta_\\mathrm{BLR}$) and the inclination angle\nof the inner accretion disk ($\\theta_\\mathrm{disk}$). For a sample of eight\nactive galactic nuclei that have published values of $\\theta_\\mathrm{BLR}$\nestimated from dynamical modeling of the BLR based on velocity-resolved\nreverberation mapping experiments, we analyze high-quality, joint XMM-Newton\nand NuSTAR X-ray observations to derive new, robust measurements of\n$\\theta_\\mathrm{disk}$ through broadband (0.3--78\\,keV) reflection\nspectroscopy. We find a strong, positive correlation between\n$\\theta_\\mathrm{BLR}$ and $\\theta_\\mathrm{disk}$ (Pearson correlation\ncoefficient 0.856, $p$-value 0.007), although Monte Carlo simulations indicate\nthat the level of significance is only marginal ($<3\\,\\sigma$). Nevertheless,\nthe nearly linear relation between $\\theta_\\mathrm{BLR}$ and\n$\\theta_\\mathrm{disk}$ suggests of a possible physical alignment between the\naccretion disk and the BLR. Future studies with a larger and more homogeneous\nsample are needed to confirm the correlation and refine our understanding of\nthe structure and dynamics of the central regions of active galaxies.\n",
