In\nthis work, we demonstrate the emergence of two-photon beats from the\ninterference of a single reference photon and a photon coming from one of two\ntransversally displaced incoherent sources. We also show that, apart from a\nfactor of two, the ultimate quantum precision in the estimation of any value of\nthe distance between two thermal sources is achievable independently of the\nwavepacket spatial structure, by performing a relatively low number of sampling\nmeasurements of the transverse momenta of the interfering photons, without the\nneed of any additional optics. The feasibility of this technique makes it an\noptimal candidate to important applications in microscopy, astronomy and remote\nsensing\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MV78xkNtdZzj740MBrF6VhD4mmmKd7r-famq2amjPUw","pdfSize":"542454"}
