Hybridization of the ferromagnetic-metal\nsurface d orbitals with the molecular-semiconductor p orbitals induces profound\nmodifications not only in the interfacial molecular layer, but also in the\nsurface ferromagnetic-metal atomic layer. These effects are particularly\npronounced at low temperatures, manifesting as substantial modifications in the\nmagnetic properties of thin-film magnetic-metal/organic heterostructures.\nDespite extensive research and interest, the magnetic-ordering and\nmagnetic-properties of the spinterface remain poorly understood. Using\nultrafast time-resolved magneto-optical spectroscopy, to investigate the\nmagnetic dynamics in such heterostructures, we unveil the unique\nspinterface-magnetism and its universality for a broad variety of\ncobalt/molecular-semiconductor interfaces. In particular, our findings\ndemonstrate the presence of highly anisotropic low-temperature\nsuperparamagnetism at the cobalt/molecular-semiconductor spinterface. This\nanisotropic interfacial superparamagnetism is likely driven by strong chemical\nmodifications in the cobalt interfacial layer caused by the chemisorbed\nmolecular layer. These results highlight the pivotal role of molecular\nchemisorption in tuning the magnetic properties at spinterfaces, paving the way\nfor future spintronic applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"fRBZekTC5fbGzvDZhDI6-7gojZE3xf2Jxp4U1ClYAok","pdfSize":"2216058"}
