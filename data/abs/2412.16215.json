The proposed method utilizes\nhuman-curated textual descriptions and cross-modal text-image co-embeddings to\nenable zero-shot classification of policy violating ads images, bypassing the\nneed for extensive supervised training data and human labeling. By leveraging\nlarge language models (LLMs) and user expertise, the system generates and\nrefines a comprehensive set of textual descriptions representing policy\nguidelines. During inference, co-embedding similarity between incoming images\nand the textual descriptions serves as a reliable signal for policy violation\ndetection, enabling efficient and adaptable ads content moderation. Evaluation\nresults demonstrate the efficacy of this framework in significantly boosting\nthe detection of policy violating content.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0YVYESmWk0nyvsJQc2yGC33MmL69OmUzApUHhykg7Zg","pdfSize":"790094"}
