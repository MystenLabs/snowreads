This dataset is also\nsuitable for promoting a broader discussion on general learning problems in the\nhand-object interaction domain, such as intention recognition or motion\ngeneration with applications in the Robotics field. The dataset consists of the\nrecordings of 15 subjects performing 80 repetitions of a pick-and-place action\nunder various experimental conditions, for a total of 1200 pick-and-places. The\ndata has been collected thanks to a multimodal setup composed of multiple\ncameras, observing the actions from different perspectives, a motion capture\nsystem, and a wrist-worn inertial measurement unit. All the objects manipulated\nin the experiments are identical in shape, size, and appearance but differ in\nweight and liquid filling, which influences the carefulness required for their\nhandling.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"1jdJuAAm84QBaPL9p7o6MtdbAAoYD7a5s8yTlOXQ1hQ","pdfSize":"2872682"}
