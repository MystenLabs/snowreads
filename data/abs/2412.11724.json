  "abstract": "  Micromagnetic simulations were employed to investigate the dynamics of a\nsingle skyrmion within an antiferromagnetic nanostripe with spatially\nengineered magnetic properties. This study investigates skyrmion motion within\nan antiferromagnetic nanostripe engineered with trapezoidal regions of enhanced\nmagnetic anisotropy, enabling diode-like functionality by selectively directing\nskyrmion movement. Our findings demonstrate that skyrmions can cross these\nbarriers in one direction while being obstructed in the reverse direction,\nmimicking diode behavior. A detailed analysis is presented on how geometric\nparameters, such as the inclination angle of the trapezoidal barriers, impact\nskyrmion motion and device efficacy. Additionally, we reveal that an optimal\ncombination of current density and anisotropy is essential to facilitate\nefficient skyrmion transport through the nanostripe without reverse movement or\nannihilation. This work advances the development of skyrmion-based devices for\nspintronic applications. It provides valuable insights into designing\nstructures that harness controlled topological dynamics\n",
