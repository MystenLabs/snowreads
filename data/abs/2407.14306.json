As is typical in machine learning, it\nis difficult to acquire a large and potentially representative labeled test set\nto validate models in preparation for deployment in the wild. In this work, we\nintroduce complementary learning, where we use learned characteristics from\ndifferent training paradigms to detect model errors. We demonstrate our\napproach by learning semantic and predictive motion labels in point clouds in a\nsupervised and self-supervised manner and detect and classify model\ndiscrepancies subsequently. We perform a large-scale qualitative analysis and\npresent LidarCODA, the first dataset with labeled anomalies in lidar point\nclouds, for an extensive quantitative analysis.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"li0gzyvpYzq6y3DvFXxbQRcVbXdVlPYTT00pSMc-AQw","pdfSize":"11171987","objectId":"0xbd34f81c92ff7b169c1fce0b750aaf09e5a31fecea71e533b6770c802504c05f","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
