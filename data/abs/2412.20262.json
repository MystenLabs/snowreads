  "abstract": "  Circuit algebras originated in quantum topology and are a symmetric analogue\nof Jones's planar algebras. This paper is the second of a pair that together\nprovide detailed conceptual and technical study of circuit algebra\ncombinatorics. Extending existing results for modular operads, a graphical\ncalculus and monad for circuit algebras is established and an abstract nerve\ntheorem is proved. A nerve theorem for wheeled props follows as a\nstraightforward corollary. The machinery used to prove these results relies on\na subtle interplay between distributive laws and abstract nerve theory, and\nprovides extra insights into the underlying structures.\n",
