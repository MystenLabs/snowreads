We propose a safe and\nefficient Lyapunov-optimization algorithm (SELO) that can achieve an\n$O(\\sqrt{T})$ regret and zero cumulative constraint violation. The result also\nimplies SELO achieves $O(\\sqrt{T})$ regret when the budget is hard and not\nallowed to be violated. The proposed algorithm is computationally efficient as\nit resembles a primal-dual algorithm where the primal problem is an\nunconstrained, strongly convex and smooth problem, and the dual problem has a\nsimple gradient-type update. The algorithm and theory are further justified in\na simulated application of energy-efficient task processing in distributed data\ncenters.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ruNAik6AV3MMH_jvhc9Th8Zhra7NG35qBeLyeH9y4iU","pdfSize":"391715"}
