  "abstract": "  Physical skill acquisition, from sports techniques to surgical procedures,\nrequires instruction and feedback. In the absence of a human expert, Physical\nTask Guidance (PTG) systems can offer a promising alternative. These systems\nintegrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Mixed Reality (MR) to provide\nrealtime feedback and guidance as users practice and learn skills using\nphysical tools and objects. However, designing PTG systems presents challenges\nbeyond engineering complexities. The intricate interplay between users, AI, MR\ninterfaces, and the physical environment creates unique interaction design\nhurdles. To address these challenges, we present an interaction design toolkit\nderived from our analysis of PTG prototypes developed by eight student teams\nduring a 10-week-long graduate course. The toolkit comprises Design\nConsiderations, Design Patterns, and an Interaction Canvas. Our evaluation\nsuggests that the toolkit can serve as a valuable resource for practitioners\ndesigning PTG systems and researchers developing new tools for human-AI\ninteraction design.\n",
