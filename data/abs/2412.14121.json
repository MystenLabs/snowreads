  "abstract": "  We discuss a model of neutrino mass based on the type I seesaw mechanism\nembedded in a spontaneously broken global lepton number framework with a $Z_2$\nsymmetry. We show that the resulting Majoron is a viable freeze-in dark matter\ncandidate. Two right-handed neutrinos are assumed to have dominant off-diagonal\nmasses suggesting resonant leptogenesis as the origin of baryon asymmetry of\nthe Universe. Explicit higher dimensional lepton number violating operators,\nare shown to play a crucial role in simultaneously controlling both the Majoron\nproduction in the early Universe and the right handed neutrino mass splitting\nrelevant for resonant leptogenesis. We perform a combined analysis of Majoron\ndark matter and leptogenesis, discussing the relative importance of self energy\nand vertex contributions to CP asymmetry, and explore the parameter space,\nleading to an intricate relation between neutrino mass, dark matter and baryon\nasymmetry.\n",
