Here, multiple associated massive gauge\nbosons appear thanks to the five-dimensional $U(1)_{L_\\mu - L_\\tau}$ gauge\nsymmetry, and they contribute to the muon $(g-2)$ and also other processes. We\nfocus on the powerful probe of elastic neutrino-electron scatterings since the\nupcoming DUNE experiment will explore MeV-scale uncharted regions by previous\nexperiments (e.g., CHARM-II and Borexino) in the near future. We found that\neven with small kinetic mixing parameters, much of the parameter space,\nincluding those satisfying muon $(g-2)$, can be probed using several years of\ndata from the DUNE experiment, focusing on the near detector. In our scenario,\ninterference effects between intermediate-state gauge bosons play an important\nrole. Our results include comparisons between flat and warped extra dimensions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1nk2euiDMTymj03uKWKFs6C52svax3VOSbIdJcME1t8","pdfSize":"3103104"}
