A comprehensive characterization of the thermal profile\nin the hot zone of the filament splicer was conducted using a fiber Bragg\ngrating, providing valuable insights into its stability and overall\nperformance. Results demonstrate mechanically strong joints and suggest a very\nnarrow temperature window to achieve strong connection between the two\nmaterials. Moreover, we characterize the surface composition of the ZrF4 fiber\nusing energy dispersive spectroscopy following splicing at ideal temperatures,\nas well as at higher and lower temperatures. This work paves the way towards\nfuture implementation of silica and fluoride fibers splicing using alternative\nsplicing solutions such as CO2 laser system while raising interesting facts for\nfurther studies in the specific field.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ts_kd1VSYEkQXhERAzAebWvKf9Q6bMDZNYgvYqvKpbQ","pdfSize":"1846430"}
