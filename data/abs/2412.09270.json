  "abstract": "  Ultrafast nonlinear optical (NLO) response, fast carrier recovery, broadband\nabsorption, and resistance to radiation and heat make 2D materials promising\nfor photonic technologies. However, low electronic conductivity and carrier\nconcentration limit the performance of semiconducting or semimetallic\nmaterials. This work investigates the ultrafast NLO properties and carrier\ndynamics of Ta$_{4}$C$_{3}$T$_{x}$ and out-of-plane ordered\nMo$_{2}$Ti$_{2}$C$_{3}$T$_{x}$ MXenes using Z-scan and pump-probe optical Kerr\neffect techniques under visible and infrared femtosecond laser pulses. Their\nNLO response surpasses all previously studied MXenes and most other 2D\nnanomaterials, attaining exceptionally high third-order susceptibility\n(\\c{hi}(3)) values on the order of 10^{-13} esu. Mo$_{2}$Ti$_{2}$C$_{3}$T$_{x}$\nexhibits the strongest NLO response under both excitation regimes, attributed\nto charge transfer between Mo and Ti layers in the MXene structure. Under\nvisible excitation, the studied MXenes display pronounced saturable absorption,\nwhile under infrared excitation, they exhibit strong reverse saturable\nabsorption, resulting in efficient optical limiting. Additionally, pump-probe\nexperiments identify two distinct relaxation processes: a fast one on the\nsub-picosecond timescale and a slower one a few picoseconds after\nphotoexcitation. Our results indicate that these MXenes are among the strongest\nNLO materials. They show their great potential for advanced photonic and\noptoelectronic applications in laser technologies, optical protection,\ntelecommunications, and optical/quantum computing.\n",
