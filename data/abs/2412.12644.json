  "abstract": "  Prompt engineering has made significant contributions to the era of large\nlanguage models, yet its effectiveness depends on the skills of a prompt\nauthor. Automatic prompt optimization can support the prompt development\nprocess, but requires annotated data. This paper introduces $\\textit{iPrOp}$, a\nnovel Interactive Prompt Optimization system, to bridge manual prompt\nengineering and automatic prompt optimization. With human intervention in the\noptimization loop, $\\textit{iPrOp}$ offers users the flexibility to assess\nevolving prompts. We present users with prompt variations, selected instances,\nlarge language model predictions accompanied by corresponding explanations, and\nperformance metrics derived from a subset of the training data. This approach\nempowers users to choose and further refine the provided prompts based on their\nindividual preferences and needs. This system not only assists non-technical\ndomain experts in generating optimal prompts tailored to their specific tasks\nor domains, but also enables to study the intrinsic parameters that influence\nthe performance of prompt optimization. Our evaluation shows that our system\nhas the capability to generate improved prompts, leading to enhanced task\nperformance.\n",
