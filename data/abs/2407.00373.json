However, since the electrodes\nare attached to stiff current collectors, this expansion is constrained,\nleading to a macro-scale deformation and a residually stressed state. This\nstress state affects the electrochemistry and can also lead to mechanical\ndegradation, causing a reduction in performance. We model the mechanical state\nof stress in the battery assuming a known compositional expansion of the\nelectrodes, and use asymptotic techniques to generate reduced order models by\nexploiting the thin aspect ratio, as well as the large stiffness of the current\ncollectors. We obtain analytic expressions for the stress in the bulk of the\nelectrodes and at the interface between electrodes and current collectors, and\na reduced-order equation whose solution describes the tension in the current\ncollectors. We compare our results with full 3D finite element simulations with\nexcellent agreement, and use our results with the battery simulation package\nPyBaMM to predict a realistic stress state in a discharging battery.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"olcJ4JkVjTs7RXq29SPmQuvH3ttAq1fZEIE7_R62Uz0","pdfSize":"3844635"}
