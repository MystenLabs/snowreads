The availability of up-to-date data, coming from any part in the\nworld, and coming from natural contexts, has allowed researchers to study\nlanguage in real time. One of the fields that has made great use of social\nmedia platforms is Corpus Linguistics. There is currently a wide range of\nprojects which have been able to successfully create corpora from social media.\nIn this paper, we present the development and deployment of a linguistic corpus\nfrom Twitter posts in English, coming from 26 news agencies and 27 individuals.\nThe main goal was to create a fully annotated English corpus for linguistic\nanalysis. We include information on morphology and syntax, as well as NLP\nfeatures such as tokenization, lemmas, and n- grams. The information is\npresented through a range of powerful visualisations for users to explore\nlinguistic patterns in the corpus. With this tool, we aim to contribute to the\narea of language technologies applied to linguistic research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"e_blM5aC9wV4dNa7bDupe-17z-kI5zjdYCqiiqSXepo","pdfSize":"554748"}
