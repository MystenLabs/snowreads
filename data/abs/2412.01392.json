  "abstract": "  We use a quasilift type construction to obtain some bounds on the depth of\nthe tensor product of certain modules over a local $\\mathcal{TE}$ ring. We\nrecover a result of Celikbas, Sadeghi, and Takahashi for local complete\nintersection rings. Some general conditions for lifting hulls and\napproximations are also studied.\n",
