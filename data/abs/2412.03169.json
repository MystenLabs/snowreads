  "abstract": "  We classify the shift operators for the symmetric Askey-Wilson polynomials\nand construct shift operators for the non-symmetric Askey-Wilson polynomials\nusing two decompositions of non-symmetric Askey-Wilson polynomials in terms of\nsymmetric ones. These shift operators are difference-reflection operators, and\nwe discuss the conditions under which they restrict to shift operators for the\nsymmetric Askey-Wilson polynomials. We use them to compute the norms of the\nnon-symmetric Askey-Wilson polynomials and compute their specialisations for\n$q\\to1$. These turn out to be shift operators for the non-symmetric\nHeckman-Opdam polynomials of type $BC_1$ that have recently been found.\n",
