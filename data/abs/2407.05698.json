There are however\nexamples which are globally approximately controllable in large times, but not\nin small times. This obstruction happens e.g. in the presence of (sub)quadratic\npotentials, because Gaussian states are preserved, at least for small times.\n  In this work, we provide the first examples of small-time globally\napproximately controllable bilinear Schr\\\"odinger equations. In particular, we\nshow that a control on the frequency of a quadratic potential permits to\nconstruct approximate solutions that evolve arbitrarily fast along specific\ntransport flows, namely, space-dilations. Once we have access to\nspace-dilations, we can exploit them to generate time-contractions. In this\nway, we build on previous results of large-time control, to obtain global\napproximate controllability in small times.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"K_zEKfR7KhmftI4sY9CsQjto0mHir3xRY9hZhQqcA7U","pdfSize":"334697"}
