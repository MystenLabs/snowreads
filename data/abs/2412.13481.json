By scrutinizing the evolution of the\nirreducible mass of the black hole and the value of scalar field on the\napparent horizon across various parameters of the axionic potential, we\nelucidate the correlations between the final states of scalarized charged black\nhole and the axionic potential. We observe that the inclusion of the axionic\npotential can either decrease or increase the irreducible mass of the final\nscalarized black hole, depending on the strength of the coupling between the\ndilation and the electric invariant $F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$. Regarding the value\nof the scalar field on the apparent horizon, we find that it decreases with the\ninclusion of the axionic potential. Our results contribute to an important\nunderstanding of the dynamical scalarization of black holes and the potential\nconfigurations of scalar hair with various self-interactions.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"AfKk0Ch6mgfWeVTuDI75fkweoon61L4X9t5DCrzsAJk","pdfSize":"4881316"}
