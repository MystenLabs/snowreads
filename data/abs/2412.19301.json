I consider three possible departures\nfrom the current status quo in which selected oil companies are permitted to\nconduct transactions with Venezuela's state-owned oil sector: a return to\nmaximum pressure, characterized by intensive use of secondary sanctions, a more\nlimited tightening that would revoke only the current Chevron license, and a\ncomplete lifting of economic sanctions. I find that sanctions significantly\ninfluence migration patterns by disrupting oil revenues, which fund imports\ncritical to productivity in the non-oil sector. Reimposing maximum pressure\nsanctions would lead to an estimated one million additional Venezuelans\nemigrating over the next five years compared to a baseline scenario of no\neconomic sanctions. If the US aims to address the Venezuelan migrant crisis\neffectively, a policy of engagement and lifting economic sanctions appears more\nlikely to stabilize migration flows than a return to maximum pressure\nstrategies.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JRD1s4yobeCHVIERlN-b36lgILTL1K3wYD4hfXEDnb0","pdfSize":"896763"}
