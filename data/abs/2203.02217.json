The alternatives are evaluated in a dual manner. From one side,\nthey are characterized by rational features defining the utility of each\nalternative. From the other side, the choice is affected by emotions labeling\nthe alternatives as attractive or repulsive, pleasant or unpleasant. A decision\nmaker needs to make a choice taking into account both these features, the\nutility of alternatives and their attractiveness. The notion of utility is\nbased on rational grounds, while the notion of attractiveness is vague and\nrather is based on irrational feelings. A general method, allowing for the\nquantification of the choice combining rational and emotional features is\ndescribed. Despite that emotions seem to avoid precise quantification, their\nquantitative evaluation is possible at the aggregate level. The analysis of a\nseries of empirical data demonstrates the efficiency of the approach, including\nthe realistic behavioral problems that cannot be treated by the standard\nexpected utility theory.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jTbQRHXgdglixqiaT_iRrEpRIUjQMqnfoFgEAexNwDY","pdfSize":"250594"}
