Migration Patterns in Online Communities","authors":"Katherine Van Koevering, Meryl Ye, Jon Kleinberg","authorsParsed":[["Van Koevering","Katherine",""],["Ye","Meryl",""],["Kleinberg","Jon",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2024 14:49:42 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-17","timestamp":1721141382000,"abstract":"  Broad topics in online platforms represent a type of meso-scale between\nindividual user-defined communities and the whole platform; they typically\nconsist of related communities that address different facets of a shared topic.\nUsers often engage with the topic by moving among the communities within a\nsingle category. We find that there are strong regularities in the aggregate\npattern of user migration, in that the communities comprising a topic can be\nordered in a partial order such that there is more migration in the direction\ndefined by the partial order than against it. Ordered along this overall\ndirection, we find that communities in aggregate become smaller, less toxic,\nand more linguistically distinctive, suggesting a picture consistent with\nspecialization. We study directions defined not just in the movement of users\nbut also by the movement of URLs and by the direction of mentions from one\ncommunity to another; each of these produces a consistent direction, but the\ndirections all differ from each other.\n  We show how, collectively, these distinct trends help organize the structure\nof large online topics and compare our findings across both Reddit and\nWikipedia and in simulations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Toqq91Wt1B8QuLdJ-t2gYPCkefTTegFj33HsZLwql-w","pdfSize":"1198530"}
