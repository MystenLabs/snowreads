Central to our approach are new\nmetric groups, in which some objects in rough path theory that have been\npreviously viewed as two-parameter can be considered as path increments.\nFurthermore, we develop highly precise Lipschitz estimates for Young and rough\ndifferential equations, both in the variation and Besov scale.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OgIWbYtBJ2mUmNt1XJh1Pa1CRMm_5ySDPWBTA0SzLfQ","pdfSize":"526809"}
