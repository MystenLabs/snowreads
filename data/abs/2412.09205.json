We work\nunder two assumptions. The first one is that the family possesses an inverse\nintegrating factor that can be expanded in Laurent series centered at the\nsingularity after a weighted polar blow-up fixed by the Newton diagram of the\nfamily. The second one is that we restrict our analysis to a subset of the\nmonodromic parameter space that assures the non-existence of local curves with\nzero angular speed. The conclusions are that the asymptotic Dulac expansion of\n$\\Pi$ does not contain logarithmic terms, indeed it admits a formal power\nseries expansion with a unique independent generalized Poincar\\'e-Lyapunov\nquantity, which can be computed under some explicit conditions. Moreover we\nalso give conditions that guarantee the analyticity of $\\Pi$, in which case we\nshow that the Bautin ideal is principal and therefore the cyclicity of the\nsingularity with respect to perturbation within the family is zero.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kW1MtYQKPDTRZ3mTV5AOpx7Jn1ormZP68b4FgwP2HX4","pdfSize":"287832"}
