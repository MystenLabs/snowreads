The function\n$g(x,t)$ is indefinitely differentiable and tends to $0$ as well as all its\nderivatives when $x\\to0^+$ or $x\\to+\\infty$. Since, furthermore, for\n$t\\to+\\infty$ the function $f(x,t)$ tends to $+\\infty$ we may expect that the\nintegral depends essentially on the behavior of $g(x,t)$ at the extremes.\n  As Polya in an analogous situation we consider the substitution of $\\psi(x)$\nby a simpler similar function. A simple function with this behavior is\n\\[\\psi_0(x):=2\\pi(1+\\tfrac{1}{4}x^{-5/2})e^{-\\pi x-\\frac{\\pi}{4x}}.\\]\nTherefore, we define $J_0(t)$ replacing in the definition of $J(t)$ the\nfunction $\\psi(x)$ by the simpler $\\psi_0(x)$. \\begin{equation}\nJ_0(t)=2\\pi\\int_0^\\infty (1+\\tfrac{1}{4}x^{-\\frac52})e^{-\\pi\nx-\\frac{\\pi}{4x}}(1-ix)^{\\frac12(\\frac12+it)}\\,dx. \\end{equation} The resulting\n$Z_0(t)$ disappoints us \\[Z_0(t)\\asymp\n\\mathop{\\mathrm{Re}}\\Bigl\\{\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\exp\\Bigl\\{i\\Bigl(\\frac{t}{2}\\log\\frac{t}{2\\pi}-\\frac{t}{2}-\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\Bigr)\\Bigr\\}+\\frac{2}{(2\\pi\nt)^{1/4}}\\exp\\Bigl(\\pi i\\sqrt{\\frac{t}{2\\pi}}\\;\\Bigr)\\Bigr\\},\\quad\nt\\to+\\infty.\\] However, the integral $J_0(t)$ is interesting as a technical\nchallenge. And still we have the possibility to get a better result improving\n$\\psi_0(x)$.\n  This is a preliminary version, and we set it as a challenge: to compute and\nstudy this integral.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Nf3fX_dCNnmyYIrcnouAwsDPdKVjaQviGSj2XTGqyz8","pdfSize":"633117"}
