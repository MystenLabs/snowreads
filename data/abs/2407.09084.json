The lack of agreed-upon metrics to quantify people's discomfort\nhinders shared public space safety research. We introduce perceived Time To\nCollision (TTC) as a potential metric of user discomfort performing controlled\nexperiments using an e-scooter and a pedestrian moving in a hallway. The\nresults strongly correlate the participant's reported discomfort and the\nperceived TTC. Therefore, TTC is a potential metric for public space users'\ndiscomfort. Since the metric only uses relative velocity and position\ninformation, it is a viable candidate for neighboring people's discomfort\nestimation in advanced driver assistance systems for e-scooters and PMVs. Our\nongoing research extends the results to mobile robots.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"9vHsccJ2qzj7F0-vq-vj2Kofhhn5tBizl-uEJNOYYJs","pdfSize":"758219","objectId":"0xee366c44c90908c2a7fb0c8ae8f116eb49b4261aa30f9d3a92fb63a5c72ea7ab","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
