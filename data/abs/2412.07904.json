  "abstract": "  We derive a general change of variables formula for score functions, showing\nthat for a smooth, invertible transformation $\\mathbf{y} = \\phi(\\mathbf{x})$,\nthe transformed score function $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{y}} \\log q(\\mathbf{y})$ can be\nexpressed directly in terms of $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}} \\log p(\\mathbf{x})$. Using\nthis result, we develop two applications: First, we establish a reverse-time\nIt\\^o lemma for score-based diffusion models, allowing the use of\n$\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}} \\log p_t(\\mathbf{x})$ to reverse an SDE in the transformed\nspace without directly learning $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{y}} \\log q_t(\\mathbf{y})$.\nThis approach enables training diffusion models in one space but sampling in\nanother, effectively decoupling the forward and reverse processes. Second, we\nintroduce generalized sliced score matching, extending traditional sliced score\nmatching from linear projections to arbitrary smooth transformations. This\nprovides greater flexibility in high-dimensional density estimation. We\ndemonstrate these theoretical advances through applications to diffusion on the\nprobability simplex and empirically compare our generalized score matching\napproach against traditional sliced score matching methods.\n",
