  "abstract": "  We study the symplectic structure and dynamics of Yang-Mills theory in the\npresence of a boundary. We introduce a decomposition of the fields on a Cauchy\nslice such that the symplectic form splits cleanly into independent bulk and\nedge parts. However, we find that the dynamics inherently couples these two\nsymplectic sectors, a feature arising from the non-abelian nature of the gauge\ngroup. This is shown by extending to Yang-Mills theory the dynamical edge mode\nboundary condition recently introduced in Maxwell theory. We finish with\nanalyses of the weak-field expansion and the horizon limit, finding in the\nlatter case that the dynamical interplay between bulk and edge degrees of\nfreedom persists.\n",
