We propose\nHPHS, a fast and effective method for the autonomous exploration of unknown\nenvironments. In this work, we efficiently sample frontier points directly from\nthe LiDAR data and the local map around the robot, while exploiting a\nhierarchical planning strategy to provide the robot with a global perspective.\nThe hierarchical planning framework divides the updated environment into\nmultiple subregions and arranges the order of access to them by considering the\noverall revenue of the global path. The combination of the hybrid frontier\nsampling method and hierarchical planning strategy reduces the complexity of\nthe planning problem and mitigates the issue of region remnants during the\nexploration process. Detailed simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of our approach in various aspects. The source\ncode will be released to benefit the further research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0Pdi1Awijh2QyqL-V3DkuwBRjk3cI5tNW6c_ocEE6mo","pdfSize":"5677497"}
