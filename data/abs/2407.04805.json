It has been shown that these experiments\nare particularly sensitive to optical systematics. Near-field vector beam\nmapping, or holography, is now employed in a variety of CMB-focused\nexperimental efforts due to the technique's ability to provide full details of\nelectromagnetic field propagation through complex systems. In this proceeding,\nwe describe the development of a measurement bench for millimeter-wave\nphase-sensitive beam mapping with the goal of characterizing optical components\nfor CMB experiments. We discuss the testing of a beam scanner based on a 6-axis\nrobot arm, the related custom control software, the readout architecture, and\nthe overall validation of the system through various testing procedures.\nDynamic range of 70 dB is demonstrated for the presented setup. With the\ncurrent mechanical setup, we derive an upper limits of 45 $\\mu$m on the\nabsolute positioning error and 10 $\\mu$m on positional repeatability.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wafpLkSsVwGwKZ1jFqQXCwAdE9nz7i6OeCTIWuVC57o","pdfSize":"2776342"}
