Our method utilizes a hierarchical structure to\nbreak down complex tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. By incorporating\nspatiotemporal continuity features, we establish the sequential logic necessary\nfor causal inference and cooperative behaviour in sequential tasks, thereby\nfacilitating efficient and coordinated control strategies. Through training\nwithin this framework, we demonstrate enhanced adaptability and cooperation,\nleading to superior performance in task completion compared to the original\nmethods. Moreover, we construct a set of environments as the benchmark for\nembodied cooperation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fevB3-SK9YBs86BlHvAHPQMCQwn_HCajH-CM5HCiZnM","pdfSize":"2444494"}
