  "abstract": "  Employing the recently developed open quantum system Effective Field Theory\nframework, we investigate jet production and evolution in a dense nuclear\nmedium in electron-ion/heavy-ion collisions. We confirm that the frequent\nmonitoring of the jet by the medium leads to the emergence of a perturbative\ntransverse momentum scale, often referred to as the saturation scale that\nnecessitates further factorization to completely isolate the non-perturbative\nphysics of the medium. A part of this goal is achieved in this paper by\nproviding an operator definition for the broadening probability of a gluon in\nthe medium within the Markovian approximations. We show that this distribution\nis (semi)universal; it depends on the angular measurement on the jet and probes\nboth the large and small $x$ dynamics of the medium. We further elucidate all\nother contributions to non-perturbative physics suggesting that the\nparameterization of non-perturbative physics is more complex than previously\nassumed and outline steps required for a complete factorization of the jet\nproduction cross section.\n",
