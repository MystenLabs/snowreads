  "abstract": "  I derive a lower limit on the mass of an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO)\nbased on measurements of its speed and acceleration, as well as the infrared\nluminosity of the airglow around it. If the object's radial velocity can be\nneglected, the mass limit is independent of distance. Measuring the distance\nand angular size of the object allows to infer its minimum mass density. The\nGalileo Project will be collecting the necessary data on millions of objects in\nthe sky over the coming year.\n",
