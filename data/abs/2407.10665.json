We establish a general inequality which estimates the local\n$L^\\infty$ norm by the number of integer solutions to a certain diophantine\nproblem arising from the principal symbol of the operator. The novelty of our\nmethod lies in its complete independence from the regularity of the boundary,\nthe boundary condition or the validity of a local Weyl law. Our result applies\nto domains with fractal boundary, unbounded domains, as well as to\nnon-self-adjoint operators.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EWU5-wUxKRGoAn-JxZmXDhLOOXqVdh0Ky7UgrvEuxPU","pdfSize":"223191","objectId":"0xc6215aa2f07dfd237830985c82030334759d83edd26e6eaf95ac66d66eaadb96","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
