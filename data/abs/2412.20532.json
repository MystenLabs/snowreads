Employing the Boltzmann transport theory, we\nrigorously examined and evaluated various thermoelectric coefficients, with\nparticular emphasis on elucidating their behavior under different scattering\nmechanisms. We derived the analytical expressions for electrical conductivity,\nthermopower, and thermal conductivity at low temperatures by Sommerfeld\nexpansion of the Fermi integral. We demonstrated that our numerically obtained\nvalues are consistent with the analytical calculations at low temperatures and\nhence obeying Mott and Wiedeman Franz law. However, the deviation was observed\nat higher temperatures. Furthermore, we performed theoretical calculations of\nchemical potential at both low and high temperatures and compared them with our\nnumerically evaluated results at all temperatures. Through extensive\ncalculations and meticulous evaluation, our study contributes to a deeper\nunderstanding of the intricate thermoelectric properties inherent in monolayer\npristine graphene.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"iqKf9_cPTFwEno3r8fmeznyUuRoMn3KHNhhVqGOPLKw","pdfSize":"1792483"}
