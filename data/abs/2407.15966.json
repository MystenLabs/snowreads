Our simulations\nshow good agreement with observations in terms of the vertical profiles of\nclouds and H2SO4 vapor. H2O vapor is overestimated above the clouds due to\nefficient transport in the cloud region. The cloud top decreases as latitude\nincreases, qualitatively consistent with Venus Express observations. The\nunderlying mechanism is the combination of H2SO4 chemical production and\nmeridional circulation. The mixing ratios of H2SO4 at 50-60 km and H2O vapors\nin the main cloud deck basically exhibit maxima around the equator, due to the\neffect of temperature's control on the saturation vapor mixing ratios of the\ntwo species. The cloud mass distribution is subject to both H2SO4 chemical\nproduction and dynamical transport and shows a pattern that peaks around the\nequator in the upper cloud while peaks at mid-high latitudes in the middle\ncloud. At low latitudes, H2SO4 and H2O vapors, cloud mass loading and acidity\nshow semidiurnal variations at different altitude ranges, which can be\nvalidated against future missions. Our model emphasizes the complexity of the\nVenus climate system and the great need for more observations and simulations\nto unravel its spatial variability and underlying atmospheric and/or geological\nprocesses.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hwHYa9wZcWqCGk9nIftAMbUeU9BMtm7owOK7gSw7Mvo","pdfSize":"4021161","objectId":"0xf45bf73c771f28c9961c7de6ad0bc46232bf07c0da9199fb03c5d629fbabad8e","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
