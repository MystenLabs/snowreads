  "abstract": "  The degeneracy of chiral partners is an ideal signal for measuring the\nrestoration of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry in QCD. In this work,\nwe investigate the observability of the $\\phi$ - $f_1(1420)$ degeneracy in the\nJ-PARC E16 experiment, which measures di-electrons emitted from 30 GeV pA\ncollisions. We for this purpose make use of an effective Lagrangian approach,\nwhich naturally incorporates the broken charge-conjugation symmetry in nuclear\nmatter and the ensuing anomaly-induced mixing between vector and axial-vector\nmesons, to compute the spectral function relevant for the experimental\nmeasurement. The real-time dynamics of the pA collision is obtained from a\ntransport simulation. Including experimental background and resolution effects\non top of that, we find that a signal of the $\\phi$ - $f_1(1420)$ mixing can be\nobserved around 2.5 $\\sigma$ with the Run2 statistics planned for the J-PARC\nE16 experiment with an ideal mixing strength.\n",
