Despite demonstrating impressive rendering speed and\nquality, the rapid convergence of such models poses challenges for further\nimproving reconstruction quality. Common strategies to improve rendering\nquality involves augmenting model parameters or increasing the number of\nsampled points. However, these computationally intensive approaches encounter\nlimitations in achieving significant quality enhancements. This study\nintroduces a model-agnostic framework inspired by Sparsely-Gated Mixture of\nExperts to enhance rendering quality without escalating computational\ncomplexity. Our approach enables specialization in rendering different scene\ncomponents by employing a mixture of experts with varying resolutions. We\npresent a novel gate formulation designed to maximize expert capabilities and\npropose a resolution-based routing technique to effectively induce sparsity and\ndecompose scenes. Our work significantly improves reconstruction quality while\nmaintaining competitive performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"C_R8ZE6QLCH7T6540wtk99nP6deC3NGMqmMBNXE3XRE","pdfSize":"19889544"}
