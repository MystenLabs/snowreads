The extra-large bandwidth available in the THz spectrum\ncan facilitate high-speed communication, even for transmission through lossy\nmedia. Culminating these capabilities, this paper introduces a new paradigm:\nInternet of Paint (IoP), transforming the 40,000-year-old concept of paint with\nextensive connectivity and sensing capabilities. IoP will enable seamless,\nmassively parallel, and high-capacity communication and sensing capabilities,\nenabling innovative applications. IoP is expected to offer communication and\nsensing using nano-devices embedded in paint. In this paper, challenges towards\nthe realization of IoP are discussed. Simulations indicate that THz signals in\nthis stratified medium can form lateral waves that propagate along the\nAir-Paint interface and that relatively high channel capacity can be achieved\nby optimizing the transceiver locations, the paint thickness, and color.\nAddressing the challenges regarding nano-devices, nano-transceivers, materials,\nantennas, and power for IoP holds the potential to transform communication\ntechnologies and their seamless integration with living spaces.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"J1mjBGRC-Jn1MIOOCYVnRX3KIeIgVBePqRq5Pfs9hxU","pdfSize":"3480905"}
