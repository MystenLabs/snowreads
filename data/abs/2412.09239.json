With the increasing complexity of manufacturing required by\nmass customization, traditional computational approaches struggle to solve RALB\nproblems efficiently. To address these scalability challenges, we investigate\napplying quantum computing, particularly quantum annealing, to the real-world\nbased problem. We transform the integer programming formulation into a\nquadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem, which is then solved using\na hybrid quantum-classical algorithm on the D-Wave Advantage 4.1 quantum\ncomputer. In a case study, the quantum solution is compared to an exact\nsolution, demonstrating the potential for quantum computing to enhance\nmanufacturing productivity and reduce costs. Nevertheless, limitations of\nquantum annealing, including hardware constraints and problem-specific\nchallenges, suggest that continued advancements in quantum technology will be\nnecessary to improve its applicability to RALB manufacturing optimization.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Uo_xRrUYqaJN6m5x3DjrzFifO-a8dgAFulNEDyoQNfg","pdfSize":"439624"}
