  "abstract": "  This study investigates the nonclassical properties of the inflaton field\nwithin the framework of semiclassical gravity by analyzing Cosmological Mandels\n$Q$ parameter for Squeezed Number States (SNS) and Coherent Squeezed Number\nStates (CSNS). Mandels $Q$ parameter serves as a critical tool for identifying\nnonclassical states by differentiating between sub-Poissonian and\nsuper-Poissonian statistics. The values of Cosmological Mandels $Q$ are\npositive shows the super-Poissonian non-classical nature of inflaton for\nSqueezed Number States (SNS) and Coherent Squeezed Number States (CSNS). These\nresults provide deeper insights into the statistical properties of quantum\nstates in early-universe cosmology and emphasize the relevance of SNS and CSNS\nin understanding quantum effects on cosmic inflation and particle production.\n",
