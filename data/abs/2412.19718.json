Traditional\nvisualization tools often fail to meet individual user needs due to their\nstatic and predefined nature. To address this gap, Text2Insight is introduced\nas an innovative solution that delivers customized data analysis and\nvisualizations based on user-defined natural language requirements. Leveraging\na multi-model architecture, Text2Insight transforms user inputs into actionable\ninsights and dynamic visualizations.\n  The methodology begins with analyzing the input dataset to extract structural\ndetails such as columns and values. A pre-trained Llama3 model converts the\nuser's natural language query into an SQL query, which is further refined using\na Named Entity Recognition (NER) model for accuracy. A chart predictor\ndetermines the most suitable visualization type, while the Llama3 model\ngenerates insights based on the SQL query's results. The output is a\nuser-friendly and visually informative chart. To enhance analysis capabilities,\nthe system integrates a question-answering model and a predictive model using\nthe BERT framework. These models provide insights into historical data and\npredict future trends.\n  Performance evaluation of Text2Insight demonstrates its effectiveness,\nachieving high accuracy (99%), precision (100%), recall (99%), and F1-score\n(99%), with a BLEU score of 0.5. The question-answering model attained an\naccuracy of 89% and the predictive model achieved 70% accuracy. These results\nvalidate Text2Insight as a robust and viable solution for transforming natural\nlanguage text into dynamic, user-specific data analysis and visualizations.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"e7gndJ7oyQPzvZEl8f_DJjgh3lc3i7Gm74KszmgJFCc","pdfSize":"3380665"}
