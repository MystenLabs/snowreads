In recent years, a plethora of debloating\ntools have been developed, creating a dense and varied landscape. Several\nstudies have delved into the literature, focusing on comparative analysis of\nthese tools. To build upon these efforts, this paper presents a comprehensive\nsystematization of knowledge (SoK) of the software debloating landscape. We\nconceptualize the software debloating workflow, which serves as the basis for\ndeveloping a multilevel taxonomy. This framework classifies debloating tools\naccording to their input/output artifacts, debloating strategies, and\nevaluation criteria. Lastly, we apply the taxonomy to pinpoint open problems in\nthe field, which, together with the SoK, provide a foundational reference for\nresearchers aiming to improve software security and efficiency through\ndebloating.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ypTbrhRia-ZhxcPqoSEsnLB1SvwmoR1urfgE-7b3UoA","pdfSize":"426040"}
