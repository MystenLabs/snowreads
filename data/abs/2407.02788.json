Despite being studied separately, these\nphenomena manifest within a single beam during its propagation in magnetic\nfields, lacking a comprehensive description. We address this by utilizing exact\nsolutions of the relativistic paraxial equation in magnetic fields, termed\n\"paraxial Landau modes\". The paraxial Landau modes describe the quantum states\nof EVBs in magnetic fields. Our study of rotation angles demonstrates\nconsistency with experimental data, supporting the practical presence of these\nmodes. We provide a unified description of different regimes under generalized\nGouy rotation, linking the Gouy phase to EVB rotation angles. This connection\nenhances our understanding of the Gouy phase and can be extended to nonuniform\nmagnetic fields. Our theoretical analysis is validated through numerical\nsimulations using the Chebyshev method. This work offers new insights into the\ndynamics of EVBs in magnetic fields and suggests practical applications in beam\nmanipulation and beam optics of vortex particles.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Accelerator Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"JwALmPFA0DTw4oq0ohF2aW5h9nIYnFi7cxSSSyllJ4o","pdfSize":"3233669"}
