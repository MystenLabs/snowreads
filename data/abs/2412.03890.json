In this\nPerspective, I review $T$ symmetry breaking frameworks: \\textit{second law of\nthermodynamics, multiscale energy transfer}, and \\textit{open systems}. In\ndriven dissipative nonequilibrium systems, including turbulence, the multiscale\nenergy flux from large scales to small scales helps determine the arrow of\ntime. In addition, open systems are often irreversible due to particle and\nenergy exchanges between the system and the environment. Causality is another\nimportant factor that breaks the $T$ symmetry.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"R_2P8MVRzIq7iTGgShi07_gsW0jxNl0Skdo9R2oVq9M","pdfSize":"609424"}
