  "abstract": "  It is known that ferroelectric single crystals can be turned from a\npolydomain to a monodomain state by the application of an electric field. Here\nwe report an unexpected opposite effect: the formation of through-the-crystal\npolydomain pattern in a monodomain BaTiO3 crystal in response to the applied\nelectric field favoring the initial orientation of the polarization. The effect\nis achieved for special electric field direction which equally selects two\ndomain states, which are present in the polydomain pattern. At the formation of\nthe pattern, the new wedge domains propagate from the sides of the sample in\nthe direction transverse to the electric field. The observations are\nrationalized in terms of a simple analytical model treating energies of\ncompeting domain configurations as functions of the electric field. The results\nof the analytical treatment are supported by phase field modeling.\n",
