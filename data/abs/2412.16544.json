The first algorithm, Batch Hierarchical\nTucker - leaf to root (BHT-l2r), proposes an alternative and more efficient way\nof approximating a batch of similar tensors in hierarchical Tucker format. The\nsecond algorithm, Hierarchical Tucker - Rapid Incremental Subspace Expansion\n(HT-RISE), updates the batch hierarchical Tucker representation of an\naccumulated tensor as new batches of tensors become available. The HT-RISE\nalgorithm is suitable for the online setting and never requires full storage or\nreconstruction of all data while providing a solution to the incremental Tucker\ndecomposition problem. We provide theoretical guarantees for both algorithms\nand demonstrate their effectiveness on physical and cyber-physical data. The\nproposed BHT-l2r algorithm and the batch hierarchical Tucker format offers up\nto $6.2\\times$ compression and $3.7\\times$ reduction in time over the\nhierarchical Tucker format. The proposed HT-RISE algorithm also offers up to\n$3.1\\times$ compression and $3.2\\times$ reduction in time over a state of the\nart incremental tensor train decomposition algorithm.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qXwOkVqkD2YYC9LbGIUcQ70Ux7IGbWscXEBCe6R1eUg","pdfSize":"5353430"}
