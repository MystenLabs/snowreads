The BGS and LRG galaxies are\nextremely well characterized by DESI spectroscopy and, as a result, lens galaxy\nredshift uncertainty and photometric systematics contribute negligibly to the\nerror budget of our ``$2\\times2$-point'' analysis. On the modeling side, this\nwork represents the first application of the \\texttt{spinosaurus} code,\nimplementing an effective field theory model for galaxy intrinsic alignments,\nand we additionally introduce a new scheme (\\texttt{MAIAR}) for marginalizing\nover the large uncertainties in the redshift evolution of the intrinsic\nalignment signal. Furthermore, this is the first application of a hybrid\neffective field theory (HEFT) model for galaxy bias based on the\n$\\texttt{Aemulus}\\, \\nu$ simulations. Our main result is a measurement of the\namplitude of the lensing signal, $S_8=\\sigma_8 \\left(\\Omega_m/0.3\\right)^{0.5}\n= 0.850^{+0.042}_{-0.050}$, consistent with values of this parameter derived\nfrom the primary CMB. This constraint is artificially improved by a factor of\n$51\\%$ if we assume a more standard, but restrictive parameterization for the\nredshift evolution and sample dependence of the intrinsic alignment signal, and\n$63\\%$ if we additionally assume the nonlinear alignment model. We show that\nwhen fixing the cosmological model to the best-fit values from Planck PR4 there\nis $> 5 \\sigma$ evidence for a deviation of the evolution of the intrinsic\nalignment signal from the functional form that is usually assumed in cosmic\nshear and galaxy--galaxy lensing studies.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VLec2LDxNfLXDlrGJKP8BJ44Ei1LKzju5yRj4uSN6jE","pdfSize":"3182597"}
