This article reproduced Rowan and Jayasinghe's\nresults on these systems by estimating stellar parameters via Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo solvers. We implemented Bayesian statistical modeling through the\nsoftware ExoFit and PHysics of Eclipsing Binaries (PHOEBE). For J0946, we found\na higher inclination of i = 72 degrees and a companion mass of 2.78 solar\nmasses, lower than what Rowan estimated. V723 Mon's results aligned with recent\nestimates by El Badry et al., yielding an inclination of i = 74 degrees and a\nmass of 2.56 solar masses. We tested this method on stars from Gaia DR2 and the\nNASA Exoplanet Archive, agreeing with previous findings that these datasets do\nnot exhibit strong indications of stellar-mass black hole systems.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KMqP38kZgUPsompb4MVP92BhXsBQIyeRwqHgOfJAl4I","pdfSize":"1342366"}
