We obtain both negative and\npositive results, using unramified cohomology and birational rigidity\ntechniques, as well as concrete rationality constructions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-hSxiQoTCcUEfbIyqiZw6boYgvcMO8CC6ieZwct_ybs","pdfSize":"323824"}
