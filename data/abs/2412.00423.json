In order to consider renewable energies\nlike Wind Power (WP) for such interventions as a substitute, day-ahead\nforecasts are necessary to communicate their availability for redispatch\nplanning. In this context, automated and scalable forecasting models are\nrequired for the deployment to thousands of locally-distributed onshore WP\nturbines. Furthermore, the irregular interventions into the WP generation\ncapabilities due to redispatch shutdowns pose challenges in the design and\noperation of WP forecasting models. Since state-of-the-art forecasting methods\nconsider past WP generation values alongside day-ahead weather forecasts,\nredispatch shutdowns may impact the forecast. Therefore, the present paper\nhighlights these challenges and analyzes state-of-the-art forecasting methods\non data sets with both regular and irregular shutdowns. Specifically, we\ncompare the forecasting accuracy of three autoregressive Deep Learning (DL)\nmethods to methods based on WP curve modeling. Interestingly, the latter\nachieve lower forecasting errors, have fewer requirements for data cleaning\nduring modeling and operation while being computationally more efficient,\nsuggesting their advantages in practical applications.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"luaNL1XBV-ZQnoofADSxJf0RahuBVPZrZB3WfBxMtdQ","pdfSize":"15127824"}
