We\nprovide a characterization of the error term in arbitrary order and dimension,\nextending previously known results. This generalization is of independent\ninterest due to its applications in deriving discrete deterministic and\nstochastic Carleman estimates where the asymptotic behavior of the Carleman\nweight functions is crucial. The aforementioned asymptotic behavior holds for\nCarleman weight functions used for parabolic, hyperbolic, and elliptic\noperators, which are applied to obtain control and inverse problems results for\nthose operators.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OkRTYLoLK9-v8y1MCNMN13YExM7hcNwCBMWGkdvMJ_c","pdfSize":"243839"}
