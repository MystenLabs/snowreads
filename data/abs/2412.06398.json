Firstly, the influence of chiral imbalance on the chiral\nphase transition in the $T_{pc}-\\omega$ plane is investigated. Research\nmanifests that as $\\mu_{5}$ increases, the critical point (CEP) of the\n$T_{pc}-\\omega$ plane chiral phase transition will move closer to the $T$ axis.\nThis means that the chiral chemical potential $\\mu_{5}$ can significantly\naffect the $T_{pc}-\\omega$ phase diagram and phase transition behavior. While\ndiscussing the $T_{pc}-\\omega$ phase diagram, we also study the spin alignment\nof the $\\rho$ vector meson under rotation. In the study of the spin alignment\nof the vector meson $\\rho$, $\\rho_{00}$ is the $00$ element of the spin density\nmatrix of vector mesons. At high temperatures, $\\rho_{00}$ is close to $1/3$,\nit indicates that the spin alignment of the vector meson $\\rho$ is isotropic.\nIt is found that increasing the chiral chemical potential $\\mu_{5}$\nsignificantly enhances $\\rho_{00}$, and makes $\\rho_{00}$ approaching to $1/3$\naround the phase transition temperature. When rotational angular velocity is\nzero, $\\rho_{00}$ is close to $1/3$, but as $\\omega$ increases, $\\rho_{00}$\nsignificantly decreases, and deviates $1/3$, indicating that rotation can\nsignificantly cause polarization characteristics. The $\\rho_{00}-r$\nrelationship near the phase transition temperature is studied. It is found that\nthe farther away from the center of rotation, the lower the degree of spin\npolarization of the system. It is also found that the influence of chiral\nimbalance on the $\\rho_{00}-r$ relationship is also significant.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"xI-qttCWPpuk-o4nkYcFMiIz8w1IIsDKt_tPrhfdZI0","pdfSize":"317328"}
