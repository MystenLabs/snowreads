This paper provides a\nrigorous proof of the analog of Zamolodchikov conjecture for Liouville\nconformal blocks on a one-punctured torus, using their probabilistic\nconstruction and show the existence of a positive radius of convergence of the\nsemi-classical limit. As a consequence, we obtain a closed form expression for\nthe solution of the Lam\\'e equation, and show a relation between its accessory\nparameter and the classical action of the non-autonomous elliptic\nCalogero-Moser model evaluated at specific values of the solution.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_BVNq6lTSGvgpqfdxUm3N8h7tcuN9_t4HMbZ5YJfNTE","pdfSize":"762920"}
