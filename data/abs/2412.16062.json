Here, we propose a multipartite entanglement perspective on monitored\nphases through the lens of quantum Fisher information. Our findings reveal that\nunstructured monitored random circuits fail to exhibit divergent multipartite\nentanglement even at criticality, highlighting their departure from standard\nquantum critical behavior. However, we demonstrate that genuinely multipartite\nentangled phases can be realized through two-site measurements, provided a\nprotection mechanism is in place. This work positions multipartite entanglement\nas a valuable perspective for the study of interacting monitored circuits and\nbroader frameworks of noisy quantum dynamics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"CnV_SBaG8yrkqHsogbELq6hPPWFVbkNmKRoDKzzJQzw","pdfSize":"1330209"}
