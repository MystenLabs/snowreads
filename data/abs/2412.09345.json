The project aimed\nnot only to analyse user opinions and attitudes towards these mechanics, but\nalso to advance methodological research in text analysis. By employing\nprompting techniques and iterative prompt refinement processes, the study\nsought to test and improve the accuracy of LLM-based text analysis. The\nfindings indicate that while LLMs can effectively identify relevant patterns\nand themes on par with human coders, there are still challenges in handling\nmore complex tasks, underscoring the need for ongoing refinement in\nmethodologies. The methodological advancements achieved through this study\nsignificantly enhance the application of LLMs in real-world text analysis. The\nresearch provides valuable insights into how these models can be better\nutilized to analyze complex, user-generated content.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RSBkAJrFIfd7uMNXs-KM8YM3pw1K_SkZfdbDriUKvKE","pdfSize":"2862405"}
