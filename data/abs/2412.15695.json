  "abstract": "  In this paper, we introduce a novel method for extending Ricci flow to\nhypergraphs by defining probability measures on the edges and transporting them\non the line expansion. This approach yields a new weighting on the edges, which\nproves particularly effective for community detection. We extensively compare\nthis method with a similar notion of Ricci flow defined on the clique\nexpansion, demonstrating its enhanced sensitivity to the hypergraph structure,\nespecially in the presence of large hyperedges. The two methods are\ncomplementary and together form a powerful and highly interpretable framework\nfor community detection in hypergraphs.\n",
