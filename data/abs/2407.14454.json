Here, we propose a\nnew algorithm for constructing thermal pure states for systems with certain\nantiunitary symmetries, such as time-reversal or complex conjugation symmetry.\nOur method utilizes thermal pure states that, while exhibiting volume-law\nentanglement, can be mapped to tensor network states through simple\ntransformations. Furthermore, our approach does not rely on random sampling and\nthus avoids statistical uncertainty. Moreover, we can compute not only thermal\nexpectation values of local observables but also thermodynamic functions. We\ndemonstrate the validity and utility of our method by applying it to the\none-dimensional XY model and the two-dimensional Ising model on a triangular\nlattice. Our results suggest a new class of variational wave functions for\nvolume-law states that are not limited to thermal equilibrium states.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OOdLVe89U96QqDvMjQ0BN2RaXqyYYfnJ7RxIwWlnJpk","pdfSize":"594210","objectId":"0x9756d038b8201a4a569a41ee90f57e9324290552eb6e26aca11ab612d180919d","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
