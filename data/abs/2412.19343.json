The created array satisfies the second-order Bragg condition\n($d=\\lambda$), facilitating constructive interference of atomic radiation into\nthe nanofiber and generating coherent back reflections of guided modes. Both\nschemes use far-off resonance light to minimize light scattering and atomic\nheating. Our numerical study focuses on $^{87}$Rb atoms. The results are\ngeneralizable to different atomic species and could improve the study of\ncollective and nonlinear atomic effects.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EssaWtBe5YtGCuHOWz-kk_aMnxAVcnlS-3A0rMpV6m8","pdfSize":"1943009"}
