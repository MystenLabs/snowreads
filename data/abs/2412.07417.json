It is found that in the\ncase of complete coherence, there is a two-way relation between global\ncross-spectral purity and spatiotemporal separability. In other words, a\ncoherent scalar field that satisfies Mandel's purity condition across the whole\nwavefront is spatiotemporally separable, and vice versa. In the case of partial\ncoherence, the relation is not as clear, and completely breaks down for\nincoherent fields. We briefly discuss simple linear measurement methods that\ncan reveal cross-spectral purity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"h0YQb8KwsSTXvRk-3x1IzgUtLgy4Hk2pasO8XSoH5-M","pdfSize":"226676"}
