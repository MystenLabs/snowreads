  "abstract": "  We explore a concrete realization of a Nelson-Barr model addressing the\nstrong CP problem with suppressed unfavorable corrections. This model has a\nscalar field that spontaneously breaks discrete symmetry, and its phase\ncomponent can naturally be relatively light, which we call the Nelson-Barr\naxion. It has both a tree-level potential and the QCD instanton-induced\npotential like the QCD axion, each minimizing at the CP-conserving point. While\none potential leads to domain wall formation, the other works as a potential\nbias. This model provides a natural setup for the collapse of the axion domain\nwalls by a potential bias without spoiling a solution to the strong CP problem.\nWe discuss the cosmological implications of domain wall collapses, including\ndark matter production and gravitational wave emission.\n",
