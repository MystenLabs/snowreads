The HIAF high-intensity\nproton beam and a high event-rate spectrometer are suggested for the experiment\naimed for the discovery of new physics. Under the conservative estimation,\n$5.9\\times 10^{11}$ $\\eta$ events could be produced in one month running of the\nexperiment. The hadronic production of $\\eta$ meson ($p + ^7\\text{Li}\n\\rightarrow \\eta X$) is simulated at beam energy of 1.8 GeV using GiBUU event\ngenerator. We tend to search for the light dark scalar particle in the rare\ndecay channels $\\eta \\rightarrow S \\pi^0 \\rightarrow \\pi^+ \\pi^- \\pi^0$ and\n$\\eta \\rightarrow S \\pi^0 \\rightarrow e^+ e^- \\pi^0$. The detection\nefficiencies of the channels and the spectrometer resolutions are studied in\nthe simulation. We also present the projected upper limits of the decay\nbranching ratios of the dark scalar particle and the projected sensitivities to\nthe model parameters.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"loVdLfWYYItILOuANPLSFJdB8P8Ww-tE4_s0jAK-tw8","pdfSize":"1413584"}
