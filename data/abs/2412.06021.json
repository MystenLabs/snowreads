  "abstract": "  We study the photothermal conversion in plasmonic nanohelices, unveiling how\nhelical nanostructures made from metals with a notable interband activity, such\nas cobalt (Co) and nickel (Ni), exhibit a remarkable temperature rise $\\Delta$T\nup to $\\approx$1000 K under illumination. Such outstanding $\\Delta$T values\nexclusively occur at wavelengths close to their localised plasmon resonances\n($\\Delta$T is significantly lower off resonance), and therefore the\nphotothermal conversion of these nanoparticles is spectrally selective. The\nexceptional and spectrally selective temperature rise is demonstrated at near\ninfrared wavelengths, which prompts the use of Co and Ni helical nanoparticles\nin a wide range of photothermal applications including solar energy conversion,\nseawater desalination, catalysis, or nanomedicine.\n",
