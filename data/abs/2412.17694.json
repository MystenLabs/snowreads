On the one hand, inspired\nby Jacobs et al. [J. Comp. Phys. 2018], we introduce constraints on the size of\nclusters leading to a linear integer problem. We prove that the solution to\nthis problem is induced by a novel order statistic. This viewpoint allows us to\ndevelop exact and highly efficient algorithms to solve such constrained integer\nproblems. On the other hand, we prove an estimate of the computational\ncomplexity of our scheme, which is better than any available provable bounds\nfor the state of the art. This rigorous analysis is based on a variational\nviewpoint that connects this scheme to volume-preserving mean curvature flow in\nthe big data and small time-step limit.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oQ-nXJRRVqmnpDAWkbSxTNj1_XI8WyZd887zrO-32Uo","pdfSize":"1502024"}
