This means that these eigenstates are extremely\nsensitive to all the parameters of the Hamiltonian. In practical settings,\nthere always exists a degree of experimental uncertainty in the control\nparameters - which are approximately known quantities. Despite such\nuncertainties representing the most relevant source of noise in critical\nmetrology, their impact on the attainable precision has been largely\noverlooked. In this work we present a general framework, interpolating between\nthe single and multi-parameter estimation settings, allowing for the proper\nbookkeeping of relevant errors. We apply this framework to the paradigmatic\ntransverse field Ising and Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick models, explicitly showing how\nuncertainty in control parameters impacts the sensitivity of critical sensors.\nFor finite-size systems, we establish that there exists a trade-off between the\namount of uncertainty a many-body probe can withstand while still maintaining a\nquantum advantage in parameter estimation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"V1B6CtaMQV-5UO93oocGHWdvrD6ZP9vNWGyj9_SsmeI","pdfSize":"1251075"}
