In this paper, we tackle the problem based on sampling theory\non graphs. We convert the original graph to a line graph where its nodes and\nedges, respectively, represent the original edges and the connections between\nthe edges. We then perform node sampling of the line graph based on the edge\nsmoothness assumption: This process selects the most critical edges in the\noriginal graph. We present a general framework of edge sampling based on graph\nsampling theory and reveal a theoretical relationship between the degree of the\noriginal graph and the line graph. We also propose an acceleration method for\nedge sampling in the proposed framework by using the relationship between two\ntypes of Laplacian of the node and edge domains. Experimental results in\nsynthetic and real-world graphs validate the effectiveness of our approach\nagainst some alternative edge selection methods.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"G1RIG4eGP43xtxgsL8_glN823teugkruJ8KiPVO1Lig","pdfSize":"1573275"}
