So, researchers\nhave developed methods for detecting AIGT. However, two challenges remain.\nFirst, the performance of detecting black-box LLMs is low because existing\nmodels focus on probabilistic features. Second, most AIGT detectors have been\ntested on a single-candidate setting, which assumes that we know the origin of\nan AIGT and which may deviate from the real-world scenario. To resolve these\nchallenges, we propose DART, which consists of four steps: rephrasing, semantic\nparsing, scoring, and multiclass classification. We conducted three experiments\nto test the performance of DART. The experimental result shows that DART can\ndiscriminate multiple black-box LLMs without probabilistic features and the\norigin of AIGT.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1PQDJW-x9cNHWDL611ioFJdp-oJLJKQu4gnYkc55cfE","pdfSize":"725902"}
