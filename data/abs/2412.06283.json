It is proved that for\nevery $n$, there is a language recognized by an $n$-state 2NFA that requires a\nUFA with at least $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} (k - 1)! \\cdot k! \\cdot \\mathrm{stirling2}(n,\nk) \\cdot \\mathrm{stirling2}(n+1, k)$ = $\\Omega \\big( n^{2n+2} / e^{2n} \\big)$\nstates, where $\\mathrm{stirling2}(n, k)$ denotes Stirling's numbers of the\nsecond kind. This result is proved by estimating the rank of a certain matrix,\nwhich is constructed for the universal language for $n$-state 2NFAs, and\ndescribes every possible behaviour of these automata during their computation.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Formal Languages and Automata Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"fEThezu6kOs92nAKpnfdqwf19JanApBhMdfdXhAgXuU","pdfSize":"844339"}
