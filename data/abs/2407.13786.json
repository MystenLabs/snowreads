The elastic\nand reactive interactions are described separately by distinct relaxation terms\nand the mechanical operator is the sum of binary BGK contributions, one for\neach pair of interacting species. In this way, our model separately\nincorporates the effects of mechanical processes and chemical reactions.\nAdditionally, it retains the effects of interspecies interactions which are\nproper of the mixture. The dependence of Maxwellian attractors on the main\nmacroscopic fields is explicitly expressed by assuming that the exchange rates\nfor momentum and energy of mechanical and chemical operators coincide with the\nones of the corresponding Boltzmann terms. Under suitable hypotheses, the\nentropy dissipation is proven by means of an H-functional prescribing the\nrelaxation of the distribution functions to the equilibrium.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"GCh-XFJIDmyvw1Jf_IATicNFwcVHm5AmKhe8ZlkQgLw","pdfSize":"301308","objectId":"0xa3043d7db2bf102c4ea48829234b8acbf7ebfe6e5bd945978190c408c797c696","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
