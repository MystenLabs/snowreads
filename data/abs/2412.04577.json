  "abstract": "  In Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), the applied laser energy produces high\nthermal gradients that lead to unacceptable final part distortion. Accurate\ndistortion prediction is essential for optimizing the 3D printing process and\nmanufacturing a part that meets geometric accuracy requirements. This study\nintroduces data-driven parameterized reduced-order models (ROMs) to predict\ndistortion in LPBF across various machine process settings. We propose a ROM\nframework that combines Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) with Gaussian\nProcess Regression (GPR) and compare its performance against a deep-learning\nbased parameterized graph convolutional autoencoder (GCA). The POD-GPR model\ndemonstrates high accuracy, predicting distortions within $\\pm0.001mm$, and\ndelivers a computational speed-up of approximately 1800x.\n",
