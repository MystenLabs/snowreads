We\napply this method to the sine-Gordon and sinh-Gordon models in $1+1d$, and find\nprecise agreement with integrability results when the scaling dimension\n$\\Delta$ of the deforming cosine/cosinh potential is in the range $ \\Delta \\leq\n1$. The agreement provides additional evidence for a recent conjecture for how\nto compute the effective lightcone Hamiltonian in this class of models. In\naddition, to high precision, we provide the first direct confirmation for the\nconjectured self-duality of the sinh-Gordon model ($\\Delta < 0)$, which relates\n$\\Delta \\leftrightarrow 4/\\Delta$. As the dimension approaches the upper limit\n$\\Delta=1$ from below, we show analytically that the Hamiltonian matrix\nelements exactly reproduce those of a free Majorana fermion, demonstrating how\nbosonization is manifested in the LCT basis. We comment on the possible\nextension of the approach to $\\Delta > 1$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yDxtaV_XEV4k2DfD2xctVfOvQL_UyTEDdjNvmb_BE20","pdfSize":"1381091"}
