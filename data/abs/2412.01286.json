  "abstract": "  Silicon is a nonlinear material and optics based on silicon makes use of\nthese nonlinearities to realize various functionalities required for on-chip\ncommunications. This article describes foundations of these nonlinearities in\nsilicon at length. Particularly, self phase modulation and cross phase\nmodulation in the context of integrated on-board and on-chip communications are\npresented. Important published results and principles of working of these\nnonlinearities are presented in considerable detail for non-expert readers.\n",
