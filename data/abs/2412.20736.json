  "abstract": "  In this thesis, we are interested in the limits of quantum communication with\nand without entanglement, and with and without noise assumptions on the\ncommunication setup. When a sender and a receiver are connected by a\ncommunication line that is governed by noise which is modelled by a quantum\nchannel, they hope to design a coding scheme, i.e. messages and message\ndecoders, in such a way that they are robust to this noise. The amount of\nmessage bits per channel use is called the achievable rate of the coding\nscheme, and the maximal achievable rate for a given quantum channel is called\ncapacity of the quantum channel. Here, we are interested in coding schemes and\ncapacities under various assumptions, in particular in the case where the\nsender and the receiver share quantum entanglement, which turns out to be the\nmost natural generalization of the classical communication analogue that lies\nat the basis of many of our modern technologies.\n",
