For a simple continuum observing setup, we generated\nvisibility files and their associated PSF images for a grid of parameters\n(robust weighting, tapering, and declination). The tests were done for both the\nMID and MID+Spiral+Core configurations and their cropped versions without\nantennas in Mexico. We show that the performance of the Array, in terms of the\nbeam properties, is in general significantly better when both the MID array\nantennas are present in Northern Mexico and observations target southern\nsources. At a declination of -40 deg, there are increments in the ellipticity\nof at least ~1.3X and 1.2X for a tapering of 3.0 and 4.0 mas, if the antennas\nin Mexico are not included. For the parameter space tested, the changes in\nellipticity of the MID and MID+Spiral+Core configurations differ by ~10%.\nLarger tapering values help to reduce the ellipticity for cropped\nconfigurations at all declinations, but it will impose more constraints in\nterms of angular resolution.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1JuN5T6BAhohc1Q-KOBEtUk8ciVUu32PTJfDJefw7Yw","pdfSize":"4075521"}
