Yet, the software landscape for\nradiotherapy is fragmented into proprietary systems that do not share a common\ninterface. Further, the radiotherapy community does not have access to the vast\npossibilities offered by modern programming languages and their ecosystem of\nlibraries yet.\n  We present JulianA.jl, a novel Julia package for radiotherapy. It aims to\nprovide a modular and flexible foundation for the development and efficient\nimplementation of algorithms and workflows for radiotherapy researchers and\nclinicians. JulianA.jl can be interfaced with any scriptable treatment planning\nsystem, be it commercial, open source or in-house developed. This article\nhighlights our design choices and showcases the package's simplicity and\npowerful automatic treatment planning capabilities.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"36WoPilSTs5xrpXRhNFqMKc6kjcvJjzTzWFGMB1D3D4","pdfSize":"899845"}
