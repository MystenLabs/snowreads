  "abstract": "  We present a large-scale news recommendation system implemented at Ringier\nAxel Springer Polska, focusing on enhancing prediction models with\nreinforcement learning techniques. The system, named Aureus, integrates a\nvariety of algorithms, including multi-armed bandit methods and deep learning\nmodels based on large language models (LLMs). We detail the architecture and\nimplementation of Aureus, emphasizing the significant improvements in online\nmetrics achieved by combining ranking prediction models with reinforcement\nlearning. The paper further explores the impact of different models mixing on\nkey business performance indicators. Our approach effectively balances the need\nfor personalized recommendations with the ability to adapt to rapidly changing\nnews content, addressing common challenges such as the cold start problem and\ncontent freshness. The results of online evaluation demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed system in a real-world production environment.\n",
