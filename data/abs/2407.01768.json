Our\nunderstanding of ULXs has changed tremendously over the last 35 years, and we\nnow know that ULXs can be powered by accreting neutron stars as well as black\nholes, and can be found in a wide range of stellar environments. In this\nchapter, we introduce the observational techniques used to discover and\ncharacterize ULXs, and discuss our current understanding of their unique\naccretion physics and formation channels.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VEVyT80MiU7AoKYGqttPYEzYNMByq8K9KcmB5-8sbLI","pdfSize":"2500526"}
