This is\ninterpreted in terms of scattering diagrams in purely elastic (1+1)-dimensional\ntheories. We discuss a possible approach to factorized scattering in operadic\nterms.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"N2gfF4XpO8DgA7eahFHqIT5pGWkAKWD__9srEoayi1M","pdfSize":"585294"}
