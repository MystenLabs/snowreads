We introduce a novel approach to estimating the distance to a source\nby combining light echoes with recent three-dimensional dust maps. We identify\nlight echoes from the historical supernovae Cassiopeia A and Tycho's SN in\nnearly a decade of imaging from the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae\n(ASAS-SN). Using these light echoes, we find distances of $3.6\\pm0.1$ kpc and\n$3.2^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$ kpc to Cas A and Tycho, respectively, which are generally\nconsistent with previous estimates but are more precise. These distance\nuncertainties are primarily dominated by the low distance resolution of the 3D\ndust maps, which will likely improve in the future. The candidate single\ndegenerate explosion donor stars B and G in Tycho are clearly foreground stars.\nFinally, the inferred reddening towards each SN agrees well with the\nintervening H I column density estimates from X-ray analyses of the remnants.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"62NTivy50yZ85bp6gVWsDaS__-LrKVR2f27vAVfLC2k","pdfSize":"1332156"}
