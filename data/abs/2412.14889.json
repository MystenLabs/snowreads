We\ncalculate the density profiles in the presence of bulk quasi-holes of six\ndifferent types: one for each $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion sector. From the\ndensity profiles, we calculate the (local) spins of these quasi-holes. By\nemploying a spin-statistics relation, we obtain the exchange statistics\nparameters. Our results, which are entirely based on local properties of the\nquasi-holes, corroborate previous results obtained by explicitly braiding\nquasi-holes, showing that the exchange statistics can be read off from the\nmonodromy properties of the wave functions, i.e., that the associated Berry\nphase vanishes. We also discuss the entanglement spectrum, to show that our\nbosonic matrix product state formulation correctly captures the $\\mathbb{Z}_3$\nparafermionic structure of the $k=3$ Read-Rezayi states.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2bbjLUW8rCyoNJxzmcLH8MwBBk1x0D0h0fLCTONbJPY","pdfSize":"1914709"}
