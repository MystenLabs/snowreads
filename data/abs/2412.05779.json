During the\noutburst, detected in 2024 February by $\\textit{eROSITA}$, the broadband\npersistent spectrum was well fitted by an absorbed Comptonization model. We\ndetected 60 type I X-ray bursts in the $\\textit{Insight}$-HXMT medium energy\n(ME) data, and 37 were also detected with the low-energy (LE) telescope. By\nsuperimposing the $\\textit{Insight}$-HXMT/LE/ME/HE light curves of 37 bursts\nwith similar profiles and intensities, we measured a deficit of X-rays in the\n40$-$70 keV energy band. By analyzing the time-resolved X-ray burst spectra, we\ndetermine the mean ratio of persistent to burst flux of $\\alpha=71\\pm7$. We\nestimate the average hydrogen mass fraction in the fuel at ignition, as\n$\\bar{X} = 0.342 \\pm 0.033$, and constrain the burst fuel composition as\n$X_0\\lesssim0.4$. We found that 14 out of 60 X-ray bursts exhibited\nphotospheric expansion, and thus we estimated the distance to the source as\n$10.03\\pm 0.71$ kpc. Combined with $\\textit{IXPE}$ observations, the burst\nrecurrence time were increasing from 1.55 to 8 hr as the local mass accretion\nrate decreasing, which can be described as $\\Delta T_{\\rm rec}\\sim\n\\dot{m}^{-0.91\\pm0.02}$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rdkmIE71U4qBDBKV0fYTUqTTrDBCqvE1qN9y16ARjFw","pdfSize":"943227"}
