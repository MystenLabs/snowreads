  "abstract": "  We present a foundation model (FM) for lossy scientific data compression,\ncombining a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a hyper-prior structure and a\nsuper-resolution (SR) module. The VAE framework uses hyper-priors to model\nlatent space dependencies, enhancing compression efficiency. The SR module\nrefines low-resolution representations into high-resolution outputs, improving\nreconstruction quality. By alternating between 2D and 3D convolutions, the\nmodel efficiently captures spatiotemporal correlations in scientific data while\nmaintaining low computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nFM generalizes well to unseen domains and varying data shapes, achieving up to\n4 times higher compression ratios than state-of-the-art methods after\ndomain-specific fine-tuning. The SR module improves compression ratio by 30\npercent compared to simple upsampling techniques. This approach significantly\nreduces storage and transmission costs for large-scale scientific simulations\nwhile preserving data integrity and fidelity.\n",
