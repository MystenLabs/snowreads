Our proof\nrelies on the method of contradiction, existence of solution of a system of\nLinear Diophantine equation, and mathematical induction. For $n\\geq 1$, we\ndenote $d_n=\\text{lcm}(1,2,...,n)$. In the first part of the article, we assume\n$\\zeta(5)$ is rational, say $a/b$. We observe that for $n\\geq b$, there exists\na system of equations involving linear combination of $\\zeta(5)$ that has a\nsolution. Later using the existence of solution of the Linear Diophantine\nequation, we show that such a system of linear combination of $\\zeta(5)$ has no\nsolution, which is a contradiction. In the second part of the article, we\ngeneralise this method for all higher odd zeta values.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lUz1PYTYAbbgHZ0UYTxHXZLgxPJQF6U-CyMswxL1qjE","pdfSize":"118062"}
