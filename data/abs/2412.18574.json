Moreover, they\ndominate a system's evolution in deciding the selective outcome or shedding\nlight on the preferred mechanism on how a system explores the energy landscape.\nIt is thus crucial to develop techniques to quantify these metastabilities\nhence uncovering key details of the energy landscape. Here, we propose a\npowerful method by leveraging a many-body Arrhenius law that detects the\nmetastabilites in an escape problem, involving interacting particles with\nexcluded volume confined to a complex energy landscape. Observing transport in\ncolloidal systems or translocation of macromolecules through biological pores\ncan be an ideal test bed to verify our results.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Biological Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Rbdh7T3kTLMvwRDv4sAYh3KS1dL6mQps_NyawTJu8gw","pdfSize":"1580012"}
