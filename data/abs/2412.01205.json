As the $(n+ 1)$-dimensional thin domains collapses\nonto an n-dimensional domain, an n-dimensional limiting FitzHugh-Nagumo system\nis derived. This n-dimensional limiting system encodes the defining geometry of\nthe $(n+1)$-dimensional system. To justify this limiting process, we show that\nthe pullback measure attractors of the FitzHugh-Nagumo systems on thin domains\nare upper semi-continuous as the height of thin direction tends to zero.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"23diFTnl_MbHc5hSnwf26WM36P9z1YGnooJ28Uxm-lU","pdfSize":"339932"}
