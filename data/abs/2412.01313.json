  "abstract": "  Effective string theory describes the physics of long confining strings in\ntheories, like Yang-Mills theory, where the mass gap $M_{gap}^2$ is of the same\norder as the string tension $T$. In $2+1$ dimensions, there is a class of\nconfining theories, including massive QED$_3$ as first analyzed by Polyakov,\nfor which $M_{gap}^2\\ll T$. These theories are weakly coupled at low energies\nof order $M_{gap}$, and may be analyzed perturbatively. In this paper, we\nanalyze the physics of strings in such theories, focusing on QED$_3$, at\nenergies of order $M_{gap}$ (but still well below $\\sqrt{T}$). We argue that\nthe width of the string in these theories should be of order $1/M_{gap}$\nindependently of its length, as long as the string is not exponentially long.\nWe also compute at leading order in perturbation theory the ground state energy\nof a confining string on a circle, and the scattering of Nambu-Goldstone bosons\non the string worldsheet.\n",
