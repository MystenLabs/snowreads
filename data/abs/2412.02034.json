  "abstract": "  We study observables in the scattering of classical, spinning objects using\nthe KMOC formalism. In particular, we derive formulas to higher order in spin\nand one loop $\\mathcal{O}(G^2)$ for the spin kick and momentum impulse. Our\nderivation method is agnostic to the choice of theory or special conditions,\nsuch as the spin supplementary condition (SSC); we only rely on the generic\nstructure of long-range scattering amplitudes of non-transverse, massive\nspinning fields in the classical limit. We check these formulas for the case of\ngravity and agree with previous results from the eikonal formalism after\nimposing a SSC.\n",
