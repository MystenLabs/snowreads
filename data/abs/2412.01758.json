Two models, differing\nin the shape of the molecular cation, are considered: one with cations formed\nas charged flexible chains and the other with cations modelled as charged hard\nspherocylinders. Each model is described by a mixture of dimerized and free\nions, while the porous medium is represented as a disordered matrix of hard\nspheres. We focus on the effects of the molecular cation shape, partial ion\nassociation, and disordered confinement on the liquid-vapour-like phase\nbehaviour of the model ILs. In the approximation considered, we find that both\nthe critical temperature and critical density in the model with spherocylinder\ncations are lower than those in the model with chain cations, and the phase\ncoexistence region is narrower. This is the first theoretical attempt to\ndescribe an IL model with molecular ions shaped as spherocylinders,\nparticularly in a disordered porous medium.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2OojH3vbrHgXX29WF8rYEoed3jhB6LC3zcyPH4IG29M","pdfSize":"937887"}
