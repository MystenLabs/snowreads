We extend the\nmodelling property to continuous theories and use it to study $n$-dependence in\nhyperdefinable sets. Furthermore, we study maximal WAP and tame quotients of\n$S_X(\\mathfrak{C})$, where $\\mathfrak{C}$ is a monster model of a complete\ntheory $T$ and $X$ is an $\\emptyset$-type-definable set and show that the Ellis\ngroups of the maximal WAP quotient flow and the maximal tame quotient flow do\nnot depend on the choice of the monster model $\\mathfrak{C}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QTkuFzP2Br4H6lb9Fd4ledIzalQuFYCXW75cvyqQa-s","pdfSize":"1414180"}
