The\nparent compound Co[Co$_{0.3}$Ir$_{1.7}$]S$_4$ exhibits antiferromagnetic order\nbelow $T_\\mathrm{N} \\sim$ 292 K within the $A$-site diamond sublattice, along\nwith a narrow charge-transfer gap. Upon Ni doping, an insulator-to-metal\ncrossover occurs at $x \\sim$ 0.35, and the antiferromagnetism is gradually\nsuppressed, with $T_\\mathrm{N}$ decreasing to 23 K at $x =$ 0.7. In the\nmetallic state, a spin-glass-like transition emerges at low temperatures. The\nantiferromagnetic transition is completely suppressed at $x_\\mathrm{c} \\sim$\n0.95, around which a non-Fermi-liquid behavior emerges, evident from the\n$T^\\alpha$ temperature dependence with $\\alpha \\approx$ 1.2-1.3 in resistivity\nand divergent behavior of $C/T$ in specific heat at low temperatures.\nMeanwhile, the electronic specific heat coefficient $\\gamma$ increases\nsubstantially, signifying an enhancement of the quasiparticle effective mass.\nThe magnetic phase diagram has been established, in which an antiferromagnetic\nquantum critical point is avoided at $x_\\mathrm{c}$. Conversely, the observed\nglass-like tail above the critical concentration aligns more closely with\ntheoretical predictions for an extended region of quantum Griffiths phase in\nthe presence of strong disorder.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Y0SQwRkP_GQO-qFlZG1XJDnAFxBHeo00eDiykkDXiXI","pdfSize":"2099768"}
