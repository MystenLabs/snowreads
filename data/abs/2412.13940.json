  "abstract": "  Quasilinear (and semilinear) parabolic problems of the form $v'=A(v)v+f(v)$\nwith strict inclusion $\\mathrm{dom}(f)\\subsetneq \\mathrm{dom}(A)$ of the\ndomains of the function $v\\mapsto f(v)$ and the quasilinear part $v\\mapsto\nA(v)$ are considered in the framework of time-weighted function spaces. This\nallows one to establish the principle of linearized stability in intermediate\nspaces lying between $\\mathrm{dom}(f)$ and $\\mathrm{dom}(A)$ and yields a\ngreater flexibility with respect to the phase space for the evolution. In\napplications to differential equations such intermediate spaces may correspond\nto critical spaces exhibiting a scaling invariance. Several examples are\nprovided to demonstrate the applicability of the results.\n",
