  "abstract": "  We compute realistic 3D radiative MHD near-surface models of starspots with\nsubstantial penumbrae on cool main-sequence stars using the MURaM simulation\ncode. This work is an improvement on the the previous starspot models in a slab\ngeometry. The umbra, penumbra and the quiet star for all starspots are\ndistinct, not only in intensity and temperature, but also in thermodynamic and\nvelocity structure. These models represent a significant step towards modelling\ncontribution of starspots to stellar lightcurves.\n",
