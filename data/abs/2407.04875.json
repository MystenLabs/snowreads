For $p=\\infty$, it reduces to the\nclassical Ising Curie-Weiss model. We prove that for all $p>2$, there exists\n$\\beta_{c}(p)$ such that for $\\beta<\\beta_{c}(p)$, the magnetization is\nconcentrated at zero and satisfies an appropriate Gaussian CLT. In contrast,\nfor $\\beta>\\beta_{c}(p)$ the magnetization is concentrated at $\\pm m_\\ast$ for\nsome $m_\\ast>0$. We have $\\beta_{c}(p)>1$ for $p>2$ and\n$\\lim_{p\\to\\infty}\\beta_{c}(p)=3$. We further generalize the model for general\nsymmetric spin distributions and prove a similar phase transition. For $0<p<1$,\nthe log-partition function scales at the order of $n^{2/p-1}$. The proofs are\nbased on a generalized Hubbard-Stratonovich (GHS) transform, which is of\nindependent interest.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"h5ikO_vqswkIEQ87PcAXp5B6kkkBf7iBLv7l1qwgOcw","pdfSize":"445657"}
