It aims to leverage the benefits\nof single-country modelling over a multi-country approach. In particular,\nseveral databases provided by Spanish institutions are exploited to improve the\nestimation of solar photovoltaic (PV) and onshore wind generation hourly\nprofiles, as well as the spatio-temporal description of the electricity demand.\nPyPSA-Spain attains hourly resolution for a entire year and represents the\nSpanish energy system using a configurable number of nodes, while selecting\naround 35-50 nodes is identified as a good compromise between spatial\nresolution and model simplicity. To accommodate cross-border interactions, a\nnested model approach with PyPSA-Eur was used, wherein time-dependent\nelectricity prices from neighbouring countries were precomputed through the\noptimisation of the European energy system. As a case study, the optimal\nelectricity mix for 2030 was obtained and compared with the latest update of\nthe Spanish National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) from September 2024.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"XkJVWnwC32_nKa9Tofjt50Y2uf_3dCKU-wJTLv2rTFg","pdfSize":"28252592"}
