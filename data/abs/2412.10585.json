Once the `hybrid' notion of conceptual content was\nrejected as the semantic value of the expressions of the formal language\ndesigned to carry out the logicist project, there was no alternative between\ntruth-values and thoughts. I claim that the reconstructed argument is perfectly\nsound and convincing.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"A8LuqA7FCrubsrwGAa9nFw4JlkrnVbbbX439V4QJ4b8","pdfSize":"181387"}
