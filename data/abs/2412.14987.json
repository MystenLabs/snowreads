Similarly to the contact process without\nrecovery, an infection can spread into the system along increasing sequences of\ncontact times. In case of stationary contact times, we can identify associated\nfirst passage percolation models, which in turn establish shape theorems also\nfor first contact percolation. In case of periodic contact times that reflect\nsome reoccurring daily pattern, we also present shape theorems with limiting\nshapes that are universal with respect to the within-one-day contact\ndistribution. In this case, we also prove a Poisson approximation for\nincreasing numbers of within-one-day contacts. Finally, we present a comparison\nof the limiting speeds of three models -- all calibrated to have one expected\ncontact per day -- that suggests that less randomness is beneficial for the\nspeed of the infection. The proofs rest on coupling and subergodicity\narguments.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"VBvCZ-eHtn5h16rFE2JIkx7W4ANgp01hjhc0S-vhoG4","pdfSize":"710723"}
