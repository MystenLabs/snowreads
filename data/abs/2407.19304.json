The goal is to match a recorded noisy polygonal curve to a path\non the map, usually represented as a geometric graph. The Fr\\'echet distance is\na commonly used metric for curves, making it a natural fit. The map-matching\nproblem is well-studied, yet until recently no-one tackled the data structure\nquestion: preprocess a given graph so that one can query the minimum Fr\\'echet\ndistance between all graph paths and a polygonal curve. Recently, Gudmundsson,\nSeybold, and Wong [SODA 2023, arXiv:2211.02951] studied this problem for\narbitrary query polygonal curves and $c$-packed graphs. In this paper, we\ninstead require the graphs to be $\\lambda$-low-density $t$-spanners, which is\nsignificantly more representative of real-world networks. We also show how to\nreport a path that minimises the distance efficiently rather than only\nreturning the minimal distance, which was stated as an open problem in their\npaper.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5sYh-pNulv-A6Bo6aS-KF_4Zrjc406AdTp6Z6VefaQc","pdfSize":"1710426","objectId":"0xb8122236135cc4f04f01510b4a3ef447de55d76a591d5a0c93eaa5839bb5b582","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
