For TIC 96315731, the rotational and\npulsational frequencies are $0.1498360\\,\\mathrm{d}^{-1}$ and\n$165.2609\\,\\mathrm{d}^{-1}$, respectively. In the case of TIC 72392575, the\nrotational frequency is $0.25551\\,\\mathrm{d}^{-1}$. We detect a quintuplet of\npulsation frequencies with a center frequency of $135.9233\\,\\mathrm{d}^{-1}$,\nalong with two signals within the second pair of rotational sidelobes of the\nquintuplet separated by the rotation frequency. These two signals may\ncorrespond to the frequencies of a dipole mode. In TIC 318007796, the\nrotational and pulsational frequencies are $0.2475021\\,\\mathrm{d}^{-1}$,\n$192.73995\\,\\mathrm{d}^{-1}$, and $196.33065\\,\\mathrm{d}^{-1}$, respectively.\nBased on the oblique pulsator model, we calculate the rotation inclination\n$\\left( i \\right)$ and magnetic obliquity angle $\\left( \\beta \\right)$ for the\nstars, which provides the geometry of the pulsation modes. Combining the phases\nof the frequency quintuplets, the pulsation amplitude and phase modulation\ncurves, and the results of spherical harmonic decomposition, we conclude that\nthe pulsation modes of frequency quintuplets in TIC 96315731, TIC 72392575, and\nTIC 318007796 correspond to distorted dipole mode, distorted quadrupole mode,\nand distorted dipole mode, respectively.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-AEP7K7HkomxhX1VHcIYy4KsbDuokYWfbpY7AjthsYI","pdfSize":"2113121"}
