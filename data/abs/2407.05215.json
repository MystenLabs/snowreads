The key idea is to regard the ground state of the\nlinear problem as the translation-related Goldstone mode of the nonlinear PDE\nsought after.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fxU5iRJsFOrAvi2Elx0sIUuNDW_VXWked4qzqCY2dNk","pdfSize":"90713"}
