  "abstract": "  This study investigates the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs),\nparticularly GPT-4o, for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in low-resource\nscripts such as Urdu, Albanian, and Tajik, with English serving as a benchmark.\nUsing a meticulously curated dataset of 2,520 images incorporating controlled\nvariations in text length, font size, background color, and blur, the research\nsimulates diverse real-world challenges. Results emphasize the limitations of\nzero-shot LLM-based OCR, particularly for linguistically complex scripts,\nhighlighting the need for annotated datasets and fine-tuned models. This work\nunderscores the urgency of addressing accessibility gaps in text digitization,\npaving the way for inclusive and robust OCR solutions for underserved\nlanguages.\n",
