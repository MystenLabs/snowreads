More\nspecifically, we focus on the droplet lifetime both in quiescent air and in an\nair flow of constant velocity. We propose a model to describe the evaporation\nrate and lifetime in a purely diffusive regime, which includes the liquid\ncooling associated with evaporation and the thermal conductivity of the\natmosphere and the fiber. Our model effectively captures the primary physical\nbehaviors, demonstrating a semi-quantiative agreement with our measurements\nacross various liquids and fiber materials. Finally, the model is generalized\nto a convective air flow, which also rationalizes our experimental data.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"alxBalJFCWl6hyCB-82JW2Rqe7pjRPw1yJqa3pWROuE","pdfSize":"7665224"}
