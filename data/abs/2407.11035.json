This paper introduces surrogates of all\nthe cross-partial derivatives of functions by evaluating such functions at $N$\nrandomized points and using a set of $L$ constraints. Randomized points rely on\nindependent, central, and symmetric variables. The associated estimators, based\non $NL$ model runs, reach the optimal rates of convergence (i.e.,\n$\\mathcal{O}(N^{-1})$), and the biases of our approximations do not suffer from\nthe curse of dimensionality for a wide class of functions. Such results are\nused for i) computing the main and upper-bounds of sensitivity indices, and ii)\nderiving emulators of simulators or surrogates of functions thanks to the\nderivative-based ANOVA. Simulations are presented to show the accuracy of our\nemulators and estimators of sensitivity indices. The plug-in estimates of\nindices using the U-statistics of one sample are numerically much stable.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Computation","Statistics/Machine Learning","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"2wTMtnUr1Ce-UlOVtgf3mX3Ub5guPp62U4PhfJOAjug","pdfSize":"429747"}
