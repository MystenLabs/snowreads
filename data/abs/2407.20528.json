The\nMaxwell equations are rewritten for a cold, uniform, and collisionless fluid\nplasma model, allowing us to determine the dispersion relation, new refractive\nindices and propagating modes. We find four distinct refractive indices\nmodified by the purely timelike CFJ background that plays the magnetic\nconductivity chiral parameter role, associated with right-circularly polarized\n[RCP] and left-circularly polarized [LCP] waves. For each refractive index, the\npropagation and absorption zones are determined and illustrated for some\nspecific parameter values. Modified RCP and LCP helicons are found in the\nlow-frequency regime. The optical behavior is investigated, revealing that the\nchiral factor induces birefringence, measured in terms of the rotatory power\n(RP). The dichroism coefficient is carried out for the absorbing zones. The\nnegative refraction zones may enhance the involved rotatory power, yielding RP\nsign reversion, a feature of rotating plasmas and MCFJ chiral plasmas.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YfH3GFRCavAtMqHl5Wcd0hiN8vIi6vZfSi_TjPy804E","pdfSize":"1125743"}
