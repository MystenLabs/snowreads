The paper explores numerous properties and\ncharacterizations of polynomially hypo-EP operators and polynomially EP\noperators. In addition, we characterize polynomially hypo-EP operators applying\nthe adequate operator matrix representations. By employing these findings, we\nderive new characterizations of EP, hypo-EP, $n$-EP and $n$-hypo-EP.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Egmc0nWBG4qiL2QJFarpCCc2T_-490vg2VilE9iS7Bg","pdfSize":"163254"}
