However, these methods often\nutilize simplified tactile signals due to the gap between tactile simulation\nand the real world. We introduce a sensor model for tactile skin that enables\nzero-shot sim-to-real transfer of ternary shear and binary normal forces. Using\nthis model, we develop an RL policy that leverages sliding contact for\ndexterous in-hand translation. We conduct extensive real-world experiments to\nassess how tactile sensing facilitates policy adaptation to various unseen\nobject properties and robot hand orientations. We demonstrate that our 3-axis\ntactile policies consistently outperform baselines that use only shear forces,\nonly normal forces, or only proprioception.
