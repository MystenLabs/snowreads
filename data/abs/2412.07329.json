  "abstract": "  Cosmic strings are the most popular topological defects arising from the\nspontaneous breaking of fundamental symmetries in the early Universe. They are\nthe source of a number of interesting effects in cosmology and astrophysics. An\ninteresting effect is the polarization of the vacuum state for quantum fields\ninduced by the non-trivial topology of the spacetime around cosmic strings. In\nthe present paper we describe the combined effects of the straight cosmic\nstring and the gravitational field on the local properties of scalar, spinor\nand electromagnetic vacua. The local de Sitter spacetime is considered as the\nbackground geometry. It is shown that the influence of the spacetime curvature\nis essential at distances from the string of the order of or larger than the\ncurvature radius. A qualitatively new feature is the appearance of the vacuum\nenergy flux in the radial direction with respect to the cosmic string.\n",
