The decrease in\nluminescence efficiency under such high injection conditions could lead to an\nundesired increase in power consumption with associated degradation and\nstability concerns. Here, through detailed modeling of thermal transport and\ncarrier generation-recombination, we unravel the physical mechanisms that cause\nluminescence droop under high injection conditions. We show that self-heating\nleads to a reduction in the radiative recombination (both bimolecular and\nexcitonic). The resultant increase in non-radiative recombination and hence the\nthermal dissipation acts as a positive feedback mechanism that leads to\nefficiency droop in perovskites. Our model predictions, well supported by\nexperimental results, could be of broad interest towards the degradation-aware\nthermal design of perovskite optoelectronics and stability.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"R3TirSaxOhE92FHZU_DKb-4qhvNYd1dZ8ZmYx0t-JBs","pdfSize":"1257481"}
