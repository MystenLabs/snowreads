What at the beginning was\nthought as a source of unpredictability, the presence of many terms in the\naction, turned out to be a milestone, since it contains all possible\ncombinations of the fields compatible with the covariance under\ndiffeomorphisms. Here, we present a review of the advances in the analysis of\nthe model after ten years of its proposal, and sketch the guideline of our\nfuture perspectives.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"j2MJhizejMJVGrD2hys8HINUh-DOev5EqvlDhNgFHCE","pdfSize":"520144"}
