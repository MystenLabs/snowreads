We show here that, instead of neural networks,\nsimilar results can be obtained using a more standard variational approach that\ncombines a Cahn-Hilliard-type functional involving an appropriate non-smooth\npotential and a Willmore-type stabilization energy. We show some properties of\nthis phase field model in dimension $1$ and, for radially symmetric functions,\nin arbitrary dimension. We propose a simple numerical scheme to approximate its\n$L^2$-gradient flow. We illustrate numerically that the new flow approximates\nfairly well the mean curvature flow of codimension $1$ or $2$ interfaces in\ndimensions $2$ and $3$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sthLQXVlGE4y2sGiOqIV-BfCA2x4wNkGZ9i7EG5j2yA","pdfSize":"2867351"}
