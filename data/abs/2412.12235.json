  "abstract": "  Abstract: The rising global temperatures caused by climate change\nsignificantly impact energy consumption and electricity generation. Fluctuating\ntemperatures and frequent extreme weather events disrupt energy production and\nconsumption patterns. Addressing these challenges has become a priority,\nprompting governments, industries, and societies to pursue sustainable\ndevelopment and embrace eco-friendly economies. This strategy aims to decouple\neconomic growth from environmental harm, ensuring a sustainable future for\ngenerations. Understanding the link between climate change, energy resources,\nand sustainable development is crucial. Techno-economic analysis provides a\nframework for evaluating energy-related projects and policies, guiding\ndecision-makers toward sustainable solutions. A case study highlights the\ninteraction between hydroponic unit energy needs, electricity pricing from wind\nfarms, and product sales prices. Findings suggest that smaller 2-megawatt\ninvestments are more efficient and adaptable than larger 18-megawatt projects,\nproving economically viable and technologically flexible. However, such\ninvestments must also consider their social and environmental impacts on local\ncommunities. Sustainable development seeks to ensure that progress benefits all\nstakeholders while protecting the environment. Achieving this requires\ncollaboration among governments, businesses, researchers, and individuals. By\nfostering innovation, adopting eco-friendly practices, and creating supportive\npolicies, society can transition to a green economy, mitigating climate change\nand promoting a sustainable, resilient future.\n",
