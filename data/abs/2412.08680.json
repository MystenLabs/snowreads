  "abstract": "  Users increasingly query LLM-enabled web chatbots for help with scam defense.\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's complaints database is a rich data\nsource for evaluating LLM performance on user scam queries, but currently the\ncorpus does not distinguish between scam and non-scam fraud. We developed an\nLLM ensemble approach to distinguishing scam and fraud CFPB complaints and\ndescribe initial findings regarding the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in the\nscam defense context.\n",
