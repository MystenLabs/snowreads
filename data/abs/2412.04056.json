  "abstract": "  This document contains detailed information about the prompts used in the\nexperimental process discussed in the paper \"Toward Automating Agent-based\nModel Generation: A Benchmark for Model Extraction using Question-Answering\nTechniques\". The paper aims to utilize Question-answering (QA) models to\nextract the necessary information to implement Agent-based Modeling (ABM) from\nconceptual models. It presents the extracted information in formats that can be\nread by both humans and computers (i.e., JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)),\nenabling manual use by humans and auto-code generation by Large Language Models\n(LLM).\n",
