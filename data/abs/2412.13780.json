Silicon low gain\navalanche diodes (LGADs) are a candidate for future timing detectors in these\nsystems. A major challenge for the use of LGADs is that these detectors must be\nplaced within a few mm of the beams, resulting in a very large and highly\nnon-uniform radiation environment. We present a first measurement of the\ncurrent and capacitance vs. voltage behavior of LGAD sensors, after a highly\nnon-uniform irradiation with beams of 24 GeV/c protons at fluences up to\n$1\\times10^{16} p/cm^{2}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"ATpRhi-jXqQIE2tSoF6AU_1YNhvaDHD1Jif-4TKkfWs","pdfSize":"7086436"}
