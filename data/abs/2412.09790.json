  "abstract": "  We study log-correlated Gibbs measures on the $d$-dimensional torus with\nweakly interacting focusing quartic potentials whose coupling constants tend to\n$0$ as we remove regularization. In particular, we exhibit a phase transition\nfor this model by identifying a critical threshold, separating the weakly and\nstrongly coupling regimes; in the weakly coupling regime, we show that the\nfrequency-truncated measures converge to the base Gaussian measure (possibly\nwith a renormalized $L^2$-cutoff), whereas, in the strongly coupling regime, we\nprove non-convergence of the frequency-truncated measures, even up to a\nsubsequence. Our result answers an open question posed by Brydges and Slade\n(1996).\n",
