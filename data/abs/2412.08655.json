In (2+1)D, i.e. space 2 dimensional time 1 dimensional\nspacetime, we used quaternion bases for analyses, while in (3+1)D, we use\nbiquaternion bases.\n  The optimal weight function of the path of ultrasonic wave in (3+1)D lattice\nis obtained by using the Echo State Network (ESN) which is a Machine Learning\ntechnique. The hysteresis effect is incorporated by using the\nPreisach-Mayergoyz model.\n  We analyze the spectrum data of Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) sample\nobtained by Quaternion Excitation Symmetry Analysis Method (QESAM) using the\nconformally invariant quantum mechanical variables of de Alfaro-Fubini-Furlan\nand their supersymmetrically extended variables of Fubini-Rabinovici.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Gq4yLJiQyz3zbZLvPqqENrli3I2KaaWgMT_GhlaMUIY","pdfSize":"1564633"}
