Starting from modular architectures with machine\nlearning/deep learning and reinforcement learning to end-to-end deep neural\nnetworks. Besides my work as research associate, I also present the work I have\nsupervised in the last years.\n  I review briefly the state of the art and highlight the open research\nproblems on conversational agents. Afterwards, I present my contribution to\nTask-Oriented Dialogues (TOD), both as research associate and as the industrial\nsupervisor of CIFRE theses. I discuss conversational QA. Particularly, I\npresent the work of two PhD candidates Thibault Cordier and Sebastien Montella;\nas well as the work of the young researcher Quentin Brabant. Finally, I present\nthe scientific project, where I discuss about Large Language Models (LLMs) for\nTask-Oriented Dialogue and Multimodal Task-Oriented Dialogue.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"kiJIS0_ALZZYG1y4HYJkIxa6-llg1RytZTIQcea94Cs","pdfSize":"3695119","objectId":"0x8943d48a986b49ab6c4412d146519b49082888117e290245cb4d16df999326b3","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
