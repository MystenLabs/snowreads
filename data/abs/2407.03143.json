This study explores a novel strategy utilising commodity\npowders - Ni625, Invar36, and CoCrF75 - to tailor HEAs via metal injection\nmoulding (MIM). The objective is to achieve cost-effective manufacturing while\nmaintaining desired properties. The research involves mixing these powders in a\nspecific proportion, integrating them with a sustainable polyethylene\nglycol-cellulose acetate butyrate binder system, and characterising the\nresulting feedstocks for MIM processing. Subsequent debinding and sintering\nsteps were executed to densify and form a single face-centered cubic (FCC)\nphase HEA, followed by comprehensive analyses to evaluate the suitability of\nthe developed HEA compositions. In addition, all MIM stages were thoroughly\ncharacterised to control the porosity of the final parts and to ensure a single\nFCC solid solution with promising mechanical properties in the developed\nnon-equiatomic CoCrFeNiMox-type HEAs.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AEyJYzq5PWUZnD_Sd19Gi7h8LLxRYaKVpu_nuajKVkE","pdfSize":"9067778"}
