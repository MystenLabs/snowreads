They underpin the\ninterpretation of these collision systems in terms of QGP formation and\nclose-to-perfect fluidity. Remarkably, however, essentially all these\nsignatures of collectivity have been identified within the last decade in\ncollision systems as small as pp and p-Pb, where collective phenomena had been\nassumed to be absent traditionally. Precursor phenomena may have been found\neven in ep and $e^+e^-$ collisions. This article provides a complete review of\nall data on small system collectivity. It reviews model simulations of these\ndata where available. However, in the absence of a phenomenologically fully\nsatisfactory description of collectivity across all system sizes, we focus in\nparticular on the theoretical basis of all dynamical frameworks of collectivity\ninvoked in heavy ion collisions, and their expected scaling with system size.\nOur discussion clarifies to what extent all dynamical explanations are\nchallenged by the available data.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"G6QlP4rNJX4HErodNr6oiJHcjBnJPmidCYhcYP2y-JA","pdfSize":"1716306"}
