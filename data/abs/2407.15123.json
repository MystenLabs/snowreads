To connect these constraints with those of the\nEFT of black hole perturbations with a timelike scalar profile, it is necessary\nto perform a frame transformation on the EFT in general. In this paper, we\nstudy the conformal/disformal transformation of EFT parameters on an arbitrary\nbackground. Furthermore, we explore the effect of an EFT operator $M_6(r)\n\\bar{\\sigma}^{\\mu}_{\\nu} \\delta K^{\\nu}_{\\alpha} \\delta K^{\\alpha}_{\\mu}$,\nwhich is elusive to the LIGO/Virgo bound on gravitational-wave speed, on the\ndynamics of odd-parity black hole perturbations. Intriguingly, a deviation from\nluminal propagation shows up only in the vicinity of the black hole, and the\nspeeds of perturbations in the radial and angular directions are different in\ngeneral due to the traceless part $\\bar{\\sigma}^\\mu_\\nu$ of the background\nextrinsic curvature. This study establishes an important link between\ncosmological constraints and those obtained in the black hole regime.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LoMa2U1HaSFc1a6PPm-CtNdGtg5EYWH07NrfVQxPLEo","pdfSize":"606524"}
