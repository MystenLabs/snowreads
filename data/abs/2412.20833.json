Our Multimedia Deepfake Detection aims to\ndetect automatic image and audio-video manipulations including but not limited\nto editing, synthesis, generation, Photoshop,etc. Our challenge has attracted\n1500 teams from all over the world, with about 5000 valid result submission\ncounts. We invite the top 20 teams to present their solutions to the challenge,\nfrom which the top 3 teams are awarded prizes in the grand finale. In this\npaper, we present the solutions from the top 3 teams of the two tracks, to\nboost the research work in the field of image and audio-video forgery\ndetection. The methodologies developed through the challenge will contribute to\nthe development of next-generation deepfake detection systems and we encourage\nparticipants to open source their methods.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Multimedia"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"v3V4MQSGJ6Cec0hzjtL-UwNGvze4Z__-qVcPXoiv_74","pdfSize":"3550305"}
