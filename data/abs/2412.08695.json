  "abstract": "  We construct infinitely many new $\\frac{1}{16}$-BPS cohomologies of the 4d\nmaximal super-Yang-Mills theory and interpret them as a black hole wrapped by\ndual giant graviton hairs. Since the black hole inside a dual giant feels the\nRR 5-form flux reduced by one unit, its microstate should essentially be an\n$SU(N-1)$ cohomology. However, due to the fortuitous nature of the black hole\nmicrostates, promoting an $SU(N-1)$ black hole state to $SU(N)$ generally fails\nto yield a cohomology. We show at $N=3$ that suitable fusion products with the\ndual giants yield cohomologies. The core black hole size is probed by the\nminimal size of the dual giant which can wrap it. We also discuss two types of\nlarge black hole hairs: large conformal descendants of gravitons and large dual\ngiants. We prove that any $SU(N)$ black hole cohomology admits infinitely many\nhairs of the first type.\n",
