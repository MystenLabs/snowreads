  "abstract": "  Let $P$ be a set of points in the plane and let $m$ be an integer. The goal\nof Max Cover by Unit Disks problem is to place $m$ unit disks whose union\ncovers the maximum number of points from~$P$. We are interested in the dynamic\nversion of Max Cover by Unit Disks problem, where the points in $P$ appear and\ndisappear over time, and the algorithm must maintain a set \\cDalg of $m$ disks\nwhose union covers many points. A dynamic algorithm for this problem is a\n$k$-stable $\\alpha$-approximation algorithm when it makes at most $k$ changes\nto \\cDalg upon each update to the set $P$ and the number of covered points at\ntime $t$ is always at least $\\alpha \\cdot \\opt(t)$, where $\\opt(t)$ is the\nmaximum number of points that can be covered by m disks at time $t$. We show\nthat for any constant $\\varepsilon>0$, there is a $k_{\\varepsilon}$-stable\n$(1-\\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the dynamic Max Cover by Unit\nDisks problem, where $k_{\\varepsilon}=O(1/\\varepsilon^3)$. This improves the\nstability of $\\Theta(1/\\eps^4)$ that can be obtained by combining results of\nChaplick, De, Ravsky, and Spoerhase (ESA 2018) and De~Berg, Sadhukhan, and\nSpieksma (APPROX 2023). Our result extends to other fat similarly-sized objects\nused in the covering, such as arbitrarily-oriented unit squares, or\narbitrarily-oriented fat ellipses of fixed diameter.\n  We complement the above result by showing that the restriction to fat objects\nis necessary to obtain a SAS. To this end, we study the Max Cover by Unit\nSegments problem, where the goal is to place $m$ unit-length segments whose\nunion covers the maximum number of points from $P$. We show that there is a\nconstant $\\varepsilon^* > 0$ such that any $k$-stable $(1 +\n\\varepsilon^*)$-approximation algorithm must have $k=\\Omega(m)$, even when the\npoint set never has more than four collinear points.\n",
