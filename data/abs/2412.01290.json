  "abstract": "  In this work, we investigate the problem of learning distance functions\nwithin the query-based learning framework, where a learner is able to pose\ntriplet queries of the form: ``Is $x_i$ closer to $x_j$ or $x_k$?'' We\nestablish formal guarantees on the query complexity required to learn smooth,\nbut otherwise general, distance functions under two notions of approximation:\n$\\omega$-additive approximation and $(1 + \\omega)$-multiplicative\napproximation. For the additive approximation, we propose a global method whose\nquery complexity is quadratic in the size of a finite cover of the sample\nspace. For the (stronger) multiplicative approximation, we introduce a method\nthat combines global and local approaches, utilizing multiple Mahalanobis\ndistance functions to capture local geometry. This method has a query\ncomplexity that scales quadratically with both the size of the cover and the\nambient space dimension of the sample space.\n",
