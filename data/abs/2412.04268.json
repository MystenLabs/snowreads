The\nmain feature of FBVIEs is that the unknown $\\{(X(t,s),Y(t,s))\\}$ has two\narguments. By taking $t$ as a parameter and $s$ as a (time) variable, one can\nregard FBVIE as a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs, for short),\nwith infinite-dimensional space values\n$\\{(X(\\cdot,s),Y(\\cdot,s));\\,s\\in[0,T]\\}$. To establish the well-posedness of\nsuch an FBVIE, a new non-local monotonicity condition is introduced, by which a\nbridge in infinite-dimensional spaces is constructed. Then by generalizing the\nmethod of continuation developed by \\cite{Hu-Peng1995,Yong1997,Peng-Wu1999} for\ndifferential equations, we have established the well-posedness of FBVIEs.The\nkey is to apply the chain rule to the mapping $t\\mapsto\\big[\\int_\\cdot^T\\langle\nY(s,s),X(s,\\cdot)\\rangle ds +\\langle G(X(T,T)),X(T,\\cdot)\\rangle\\big](t)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TPPa5pv_d4FvKlFlLqYB4K5869Z5jeqPHLZ083jZ22g","pdfSize":"244298"}
