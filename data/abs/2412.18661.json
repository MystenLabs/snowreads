  "abstract": "  It has been demonstrated that systems of tightly packed inner planets with\ngiant exterior companions tend to have less regular orbital spacings than those\nwithout such companions. We investigate whether this observed increase in the\ngap complexity of the inner systems can be explained solely as the result of\nsecular dynamics caused by the disturbing potential of the exterior companions.\nAmplification of mutual orbital inclinations in the inner system due to such\nsecular dynamics may lead to the inner system attaining non-mutually transiting\ngeometries, thereby creating artificial observed gaps that result in a higher\ncalculated gap complexity. Using second-order secular theory, we compute\ntime-averaged observed gap complexities along a favorable line of sight for a\nset of hypothetical systems, both with and without an outer giant. We find that\nthese secular interactions can significantly contribute to the observed gap\ncomplexity dichotomy in tightly packed multiple-planet systems.\n",
