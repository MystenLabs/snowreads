  "abstract": "  In this article we examine a Hamiltonian constraint operator governing the\ndynamics of simple quantum states, whose graph consists of a single six-valent\nvertex, in quantum-reduced loop gravity. To this end, we first derive the\naction of the Hamiltonian constraint on generic basis states in the Hilbert\nspace of quantum-reduced loop gravity. Specializing to the example of the\nsingle-vertex states, we find that the Euclidean part of the Hamiltonian bears\na close formal similarity to the Hamiltonian constraint of Bianchi I models in\nloop quantum cosmology. Extending the formal analogy to the Lorentzian part of\nthe Hamiltonian suggests a possible modified definition of the Hamiltonian\nconstraint for loop quantum cosmology, in which the Lorentzian part,\ncorresponding to the scalar curvature of the spatial surfaces, is not assumed\nto be identically vanishing, and is represented by a non-trivial operator in\nthe quantum theory.\n",
