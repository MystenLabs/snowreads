Predicting compositions unseen during\ntraining is a challenging task. We are exploring Open World Compositional\nZero-Shot Learning (OW-CZSL) in this study, where our test space encompasses\nall potential combinations of attributes and objects. Our approach involves\nutilizing the self-attention mechanism between attributes and objects to\nachieve better generalization from seen to unseen compositions. Utilizing a\nself-attention mechanism facilitates the model's ability to identify\nrelationships between attribute and objects. The similarity between the\nself-attended textual and visual features is subsequently calculated to\ngenerate predictions during the inference phase. The potential test space may\nencompass implausible object-attribute combinations arising from unrestricted\nattribute-object pairings. To mitigate this issue, we leverage external\nknowledge from ConceptNet to restrict the test space to realistic compositions.\nOur proposed model, Attention-based Simple Primitives (ASP), demonstrates\ncompetitive performance, achieving results comparable to the state-of-the-art.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"JTPJurmt0kcqjs-Oi7JwRHlNGsTCrd-9MjAYn4Fi1EQ","pdfSize":"3183524"}
