  "abstract": "  This paper derives the stochastic homogenization for two dimensional\nNavier--Stokes equations with random coefficients. By means of weak convergence\nmethod and Stratonovich--Khasminskii averaging principle approach, the solution\nof two dimensional Navier--Stokes equations with random coefficients converges\nin distribution to the solution of two dimensional Navier--Stokes equations\nwith constant coefficients.\n",
