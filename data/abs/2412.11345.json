  "abstract": "  Detecting a pulsar associated with a supernova remnant (SNR) and/or pulsar\nwind nebula (PWN) is crucial for unraveling its formation history and pulsar\nwind dynamics, yet the association with a radio pulsar is observed only in a\nsmall fraction of known SNRs and PWNe. In this paper, we report the discovery\nof a young pulsar J1631$-$4722, associated with the Galactic SNR G336.7$+$0.5\nusing Murriyang, CSIRO's Parkes radio telescope. It is also potentially\nassociated with a PWN revealed by the Rapid ASKAP (Australian Square Kilometre\nArray Pathfinder) Continuum Survey (RACS). This 118 ms pulsar has a high\ndispersion measure of 873 $\\mathrm{pc\\,cm^{-3}}$ and a rotation measure of\n$-$1004 $\\mathrm{rad\\,m^{-2}}$. Because of such a high DM, at frequencies below\n2 GHz, the pulse profile is significantly scattered, making it effectively\nundetectable in previous pulsar surveys at $\\sim$1.4 GHz. Follow-up\nobservations yield a period derivative of $\\dot{P} = 3.6 \\times 10^{-15}$,\nimplying a characteristic age, $\\tau_{c} = 33\\,$kyr, and spin-down luminosity,\n$\\dot{E} = 1.3\\times10^{36}\\,$erg$\\,s^{-1}$. PSR$\\,$J1631$-$4722, with its high\nspin-down luminosity and potential link to a PWN, stands out as a promising\nsource of the high-energy $\\gamma$-ray emission observed in the region.\n",
