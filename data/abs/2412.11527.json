{"id":"2412.11527","title":"Cusps of primes in dense subsequences -- Bypassing the $W$-trick","authors":"Olivier Ramar\\'e","authorsParsed":[["Ramar√©","Olivier",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2024 08:05:34 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-17","timestamp":1734336334000,"abstract":"  Let the $A$-cusps of a dense subset $\\mathcal{P}^*\\in[\\sqrt{N},N]$ of primes\nbe points $\\alpha\\in\\mathbb{R}/\\mathbb{Z}$ that are such that\n$|\\sum_{\\substack{p\\in\\mathcal{P}^*}} e(\\alpha p)|\\ge |\\mathcal{P}^*|/A$. We\nestablish that any $(1/N)$-well spaced subset of $A$-cusps contains at most\n$20A^2K\\log(2A)$ points, where $K=N/(|\\mathcal{P}^*|\\log N)$. We further show\nthat any $B$-cusps~$\\xi$ is accompanied, when $B\\le \\sqrt{A}$, by a large\nproportion of $A$-cusps of the shape $\\xi+(a/q)$. We conclude this study by\nshowing that, given $A\\ge2$, the characteristic function $1_{\\mathcal{P}^*}$\nmay be decomposed in the form $1_{\\mathcal{P}^*}=(V(z_0)\\log N)^{-1}f^\\flat\n+f^\\sharp$ where the trigonometric polynomial of $f^\\sharp$ takes only values\n$\\le |\\mathcal{P}^*|/A$, and~$f^\\flat$ is a bounded non-negative function\nsupported on the integers prime to $M$; the parameters $z_0$ and $M$ are given\nin terms of~$A$, while $V(z_0)=\\prod_{p<z_0}(1-1/p)$. The function $f^\\flat$\nsatisfies more regularity properties. In particular, its density with respect\nto the integers $\\le N$ and coprime to~$M$ is again~$K$. This transfers\nquestions on~$\\mathcal{P}^*$ to problems on integers coprime to the\nmodulus~$M$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"HmsK_JHMAgZikGlRRdIxa1_Fes0lIhAQaJPO042h38A","pdfSize":"701672"}
