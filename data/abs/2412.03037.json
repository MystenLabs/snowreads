  "abstract": "  Cloud computing has become the cornerstone of modern IT infrastructure,\noffering a wide range of general-purpose instances optimized for diverse\nworkloads. This paper provides a comparative analysis of cost and performance\nfor general-purpose compute instances across four major cloud providers: AWS,\nAzure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).\nUsing standardized configurations of 4 vCPUs and 16 GiB of RAM, the study\nevaluates instances based on processor architecture (Intel, AMD, ARM), pricing\nmodels, and performance benchmarks. Key findings reveal that ARM-based\ninstances deliver superior price-performance ratios for cost-sensitive\nworkloads, while Intel-based instances excel in enterprise-grade applications\nrequiring versatility and reliability. The results aim to guide organizations\nin selecting the most cost-effective and performance-efficient cloud resources\nfor their specific needs.\n",
