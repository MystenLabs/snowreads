  "abstract": "  Quantum mechanics is a notoriously abstract subject, and therefore\nchallenging to teach at pre-college and introductory college levels. Here we\nintroduce the Bloch Cube, a hands-on educational tool which can illustrate key\nquantum concepts without equations. A series of videos have been created\nshowing how Bloch Cubes can be used to teach concepts such as quantum\nmeasurement, quantum dynamics, pure states versus mixed states, and quantum\ndecoherence. Bloch Cube states can assist in the development of more\nsophisticated concepts such as the Bloch Sphere, which plays a central role in\nthe quantum mechanics of two-state systems and quantum information science.\n",
