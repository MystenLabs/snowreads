The\nproposed hybrid scheme consists of: 1) a linear filter that simultaneously\nestimates system states and fault-induced signals from sensing and actuation\ndata; and 2) a data-driven classifier, in the form of a support vector machine\n(SVM), that detects and isolates the fault type using estimates generated by\nthe filter. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the scheme for two critical\nfault types for WH robots used in the semiconductor industry: broken-belt in\nthe lower arm of the WH robot (an abrupt fault) and tilt in the robot arms (an\nincipient fault). We derive explicit models of the robot motion dynamics\ninduced by these faults and test the diagnostics scheme in a realistic\nsimulation-based case study. These case study results demonstrate that the\nproposed hybrid FDIE scheme achieves superior performance compared to purely\ndata-driven methods.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Robotics","Computer Science/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"d4NmFDxHTkcWXW2RG1OJkKL9GKna08HDxZM6YsBw1S8","pdfSize":"1479058"}
