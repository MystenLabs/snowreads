  "abstract": "  Systems in which exchange interactions couple carrier spins to a spin texture\nwith a net chirality exhibit a spin-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effect, where the\ngeometric gauge field and pseudo-magnetic field have opposite signs for\ncarriers with opposite spins. As a result, Cooper pairs see a net zero vector\npotential and superconducting pairing is not hindered by pair-breaking effects.\nThis allows superconductivity to occur even when the geometric field induces\nquantized Landau levels. We identify the dominant pairing order as an s-wave\npair density wave of an FFLO type. Flat Landau levels can significantly enhance\nsuperconducting $T_c$, favoring superconductivity over competing orders. This\nexotic paired state features tell-tale signatures such as flat bands of\nBogoliubov-deGennes quasiparticles, manifest through Landau level-like\nresonances in the quasiparticle density of states.\n",
