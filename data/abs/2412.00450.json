  "abstract": "  In this work, we developed a rigorous procedure for mapping the exact\nnon-Markovian propagator to the generalized Lindblad form. It allows us to\nextract the negative decay rate that is the indicator of the non-Markovian\neffect. As a consequence, we can investigate the influence of the non-Markovian\nbath on the system's properties such as coherence and equilibrium state\ndistribution. The understanding of the non-Markovian contribution to the\ndynamical process points to the possibility of leveraging non-Markovianity for\nquantum control.\n",
