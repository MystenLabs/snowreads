However, CTSLAM approaches remain computationally\ndemanding and are conventionally posed as centralized Non-Linear Least Squares\n(NLLS) optimizations. Targeting these limitations, we not only present the\nfastest SymForce-based [Martiros et al., RSS 2022] B- and Z-Spline\nimplementations achieving speedups between 2.43x and 110.31x over Sommer et al.\n[CVPR 2020] but also implement a novel continuous-time Gaussian Belief\nPropagation (GBP) framework, coined Hyperion, which targets decentralized\nprobabilistic inference across agents. We demonstrate the efficacy of our\nmethod in motion tracking and localization settings, complemented by empirical\nablation studies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Symbolic Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"h78Kk3ZBm3tk53JQhBtpKX_jNbU2Zph4ZWubaEkWplU","pdfSize":"2997233"}
