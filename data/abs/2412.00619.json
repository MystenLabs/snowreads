This gauge field results in Chern\nnumbers in all spatial dimensions, collectively forming the Chern vector. This\nvector characterizes the topological phases and signifies the emergence of\nrobust surface states. Numerically, we observe these states propagating\nunidirectionally without backscattering on all open surfaces of the\nthree-dimensional system. Our work paves the way for breaking time-reversal\nsymmetry and realizing three-dimensional Chern vector topological insulators\nusing temporal-periodic Floquet techniques.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jV_SLKwrHSIf02wrjcK_JKDoQFhGs8lV_gWHzjy6LiI","pdfSize":"10062916"}
