For the stress energy tensor we describe how to\nobtain the vacuum energy density $\\rho_{\\rm vac}$, defined as $\\langle 0|\nT_{\\mu\\nu} | 0 \\rangle = \\rho_{\\rm vac} \\, g_{\\mu\\nu}$, from the form-factor\nbootstrap. Even for integrable QFT's in D=2 spacetime dimensions, this\nprescription is new, although it reproduces previously known results obtained\nin a different and more difficult thermodynamic Bethe ansatz computation. We\npropose a version of this prescription in D=4 dimensions. For these even\ndimensions, the vacuum energy density has the universal form $\\rho_{\\rm vac}\n\\propto m^D/\\mathfrak{g}$ where $\\mathfrak{g}$ is a dimensionless interaction\ncoupling constant which can be determined from the high energy behavior of the\nS-matrix. In the limit $\\mathfrak{g} \\to 0$, $\\rho_{\\rm vac} $ diverges due to\nwell understood UV divergences in free quantum field theories. If we assume the\nthe observed Cosmological Constant originates from the vacuum energy density\n$\\rho_{\\rm vac}$ computed as proposed here, then this suggests there must exist\na particle which does not obtain its mass from spontaneous symmetry breaking in\nthe electro-weak sector, which we designate as the \"zeron\". A strong candidate\nfor the zeron is a massive Majorana neutrino.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xuQte2XwQ-yqsky7O-rDcP-1pnLY4GC8eckima31mjo","pdfSize":"237823","objectId":"0x3160affb78fde4caf4f3eca714e073f3056ef875a2ceb5d5a80b6c71c18720b1","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
