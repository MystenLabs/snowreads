We also attribute a graph to them and discuss\ntheir diameters, girths, and clique numbers. Then, we proceed to investigate\ntheir algebraic properties (including ideal theory). We also characterize units\nand idempotent elements of formal power series over Indigenous semirings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Computer Science/Discrete Mathematics","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oyJxhUOlB2q5rmRHFIS1yuReopnVZMoBIWBbxx30Zk8","pdfSize":"179506"}
