We denote those bases as $\\beta$'s, which is also a real number and\n$\\beta \\in (1,2)$. This project has 3 main parts. The study of expansions of\nreal numbers in such bases and algorithms for generating them will contribute\nto the first part of the paper. In this part, firstly, we will define those\nexpansions as the sums of fractions with $1$'s or $0$'s in the nominator and\npowers of $\\beta$ in the denominator. Then we will focus on the sequences of\n$1$'s and $0$'s generated by the nominators of in the sums we mentioned above.\nSuch sequences will be called \\textit{coefficient sequences} throughout the\npaper. In the second half, we will study the results in the first chapter of\n\\cite{erdos1990characterization}, namely the greedy and lazy $\\beta\n$-expansions . The last part of the paper will be on the characterisation of\nlazy expansion of 1, which was the first open question at the end of\n\\textit{Erdos and Komornik}. I still don't know if that problem has been solved\nalready. However, the solution that was presented here is the original work of\nmine.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ecDtPqMeKbK25Ck2yLqieJIgAWZzO54ZZ884r_wdOks","pdfSize":"662041"}
