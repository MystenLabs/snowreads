  "abstract": "  As hyperbolic deep learning grows in popularity, so does the need for\nadversarial robustness in the context of such a non-Euclidean geometry. To this\nend, this paper proposes hyperbolic alternatives to the commonly used FGM and\nPGD adversarial attacks. Through interpretable synthetic benchmarks and\nexperiments on existing datasets, we show how the existing and newly proposed\nattacks differ. Moreover, we investigate the differences in adversarial\nrobustness between Euclidean and fully hyperbolic networks. We find that these\nnetworks suffer from different types of vulnerabilities and that the newly\nproposed hyperbolic attacks cannot address these differences. Therefore, we\nconclude that the shifts in adversarial robustness are due to the models\nlearning distinct patterns resulting from their different geometries.\n",
