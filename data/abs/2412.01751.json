  "abstract": "  The communication control delay between the inverters and the power plant\ncontroller can be caused by several factors related to the communication link\nbetween them. Under undesirable conditions, high delay values can produce\noscillations in the wind power plant that can affect the rest of the power\nsystem. In this work, we present a new robust methodology for wind turbines to\nestimate the value of the communication control delay using PMU data. Several\nscenarios are considered where external faults are simulated and the\nperformance of the algorithm is evaluated based on dynamic state estimation of\nthe mathematical model of the wind turbine. In this paper, we have shown that\nthe characterization of the delay can be performed offering the transmission\nsystem operator an online tool to identify the most suited communication delay\nfor the plant controller models used in dynamic studies.\n",
