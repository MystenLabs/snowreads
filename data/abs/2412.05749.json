  "abstract": "  In an era of widespread influence of Natural Language Processing (NLP), there\nhave been multiple research efforts to supplant traditional manual coding\ntechniques with automated systems capable of generating solutions autonomously.\nWith rapid research for code generation and a sole focus on large language\nmodels, there emerges a need to compare and evaluate the performance of\ntransformer architectures based on several complexities of the model. This\npaper introduces the concept of a \"A Comparative Study on Code Generation with\nTransformers,\" a model based on Transformer architecture, and NLP methodologies\nto automatically generate C++ source code for different varieties of problems.\nHere, a comparative study is performed to evaluate the robustness of\ntransformer-based models on the basis of their architecture complexities and\ntheir capability to handle diverse problem sets, from basic arithmetic to\ncomplex computations.\n",
