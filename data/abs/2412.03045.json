  "abstract": "  We calculate the steady state distribution $P_{\\text{SSD}}(\\boldsymbol{X})$\nof the position of a Brownian particle under an intermittent confining\npotential that switches on and off with a constant rate $\\gamma$. We assume the\nexternal potential $U(\\boldsymbol{x})$ to be smooth and have a unique global\nminimum at $\\boldsymbol{x} = \\boldsymbol{x}_0$, and in dimension $d>1$ we\nadditionally assume that $U(\\boldsymbol{x})$ is central. We focus on the\nrapid-switching limit $\\gamma \\to \\infty$. Typical fluctuations follow a\nBoltzmann distribution $P_{\\text{SSD}}(\\boldsymbol{X}) \\sim e^{-\nU_{\\text{eff}}(\\boldsymbol{X}) / D}$, with an effective potential\n$U_{\\text{eff}}(\\boldsymbol{X}) = U(\\boldsymbol{X})/2$, where $D$ is the\ndiffusion coefficient. However, we also calculate the tails of\n$P_{\\text{SSD}}(\\boldsymbol{X})$ which behave very differently. In the far\ntails $|\\boldsymbol{X}| \\to \\infty$, a universal behavior\n$P_{\\text{SSD}}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}\\right)\\sim e^{-\\sqrt{\\gamma/D} \\,\n\\left|\\boldsymbol{X}-\\boldsymbol{x}_{0}\\right|}$ emerges, that is independent\nof the trapping potential. The mean first-passage time to reach position\n$\\boldsymbol{X}$ is given, in the leading order, by $\\sim\n1/P_{\\text{SSD}}(\\boldsymbol{X})$. This coincides with the Arrhenius law (for\nthe effective potential $U_{\\text{eff}}$) for $\\boldsymbol{X} \\simeq\n\\boldsymbol{x}_0$, but deviates from it elsewhere. We give explicit results for\nthe harmonic potential. Finally, we extend our results to periodic\none-dimensional systems. Here we find that in the limit of $\\gamma \\to \\infty$\nand $D \\to 0$, the logarithm of $P_{\\text{SSD}}(X)$ exhibits a singularity\nwhich we interpret as a first-order dynamical phase transition (DPT). This DPT\noccurs in absence of any external drift. We also calculate the nonzero\nprobability current in the steady state that is a result of the nonequilibrium\nnature of the system.\n",
