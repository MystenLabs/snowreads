Recent works have demonstrated good performance in this task\nutilizing machine learning models. This paper explores the novel application of\na deep learning model with multi-head attention (FFNN-MHA) to make more\naccurate MV predictions and reduce false positives by learning personalized\ncontextual information of individual patients. Utilizing the publicly available\nMIMIC-IV dataset, FFNN-MHA demonstrates an improvement of 0.0379 in AUC and a\n17.8\\% decrease in false positives compared to baseline models such as\nfeed-forward neural networks. Our results highlight the potential of the\nFFNN-MHA model as an effective tool for accurate prediction of the need for\nmechanical ventilation in critical care settings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"ghobsmvV4536sJDlWUlnK6DrUj-xdS13V9pUkrsd8w0","pdfSize":"355388"}
