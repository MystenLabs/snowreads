Both models are coupled to the\nincompressible Stokes equation, which is solved numerically using a combination\nof sine and regular Fourier transforms to account for the no-slip boundary\nconditions at the boundaries. The continuum two-phase field model allows us to\nanalytically solve the equilibrium interfacial profile using a perturbative\napproach, demonstrating excellent agreement with numerical simulations.\nNotably, we show that strong coupling to particle dynamics can significantly\nalter the liquid-gas interface, thereby modifying the liquid-gas interfacial\ntension. In particular, we show that the renormalized surface tension is\nmonotonically decreasing with increasing colloidal particle concentration and\ndecreasing buoyant mass.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0UeaHKl_HNOAmKNztw4-yniNsLaoUoFWq01joubL5KI","pdfSize":"2126676","objectId":"0x22527822c49b31b703cd377b72543a2cb92ff06a4c0312e2e8f395c61499b073","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
