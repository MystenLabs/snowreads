Monte Carlo simulations of\nhard scattering and energy loss in heavy-ion collisions are performed using\nparameters tuned in a previous study of the nuclear modification factor\n($R_{AA}$) for inclusive jets and high-$p_T$ hadrons. We obtain a good\nreproduction of the experimental data for photon triggered jet $R_{AA}$, as\nmeasured by the ATLAS detector, the distribution of the ratio of jet to photon\n$p_T$ ($X_{\\rm J \\gamma}$), measured by both CMS and ATLAS, and the photon-jet\nazimuthal correlation as measured by CMS. We obtain a moderate description of\nthe photon triggered jet $I_{AA}$, as measured by STAR. A noticeable\nimprovement in the comparison is observed when one goes beyond prompt photons\nand includes bremsstrahlung and decay photons, revealing their significance in\ncertain kinematic regions, particularly at $X_{J\\gamma} > 1$. Moreover,\nazimuthal angle correlations demonstrate a notable impact of non-prompt photons\non the distribution, emphasizing their role in accurately describing\nexperimental results. This work highlights the success of the multistage model\nof jet modification to straightforwardly predict (this set of) photon triggered\njet observables. This comparison, along with the role played by non-prompt\nphotons, has important consequences on the inclusion of such observables in a\nfuture Bayesian analysis.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_9z4li2mVDBuJELwfFzUWzQw6pVkAvHm4lVLppvuc0E","pdfSize":"2868307"}
