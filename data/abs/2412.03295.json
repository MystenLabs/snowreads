  "abstract": "  A digital twin is a virtual representation that accurately replicates its\nphysical counterpart, fostering bi-directional real-time data exchange\nthroughout the entire process lifecycle. For Laser Directed Energy Deposition\nof Wire (DED-LB/w) additive manufacturing processes, digital twins may help to\ncontrol the residual stress design in build parts. This study focuses on\nproviding faster-than-real-time and highly accurate surrogate models for the\nformation of residual stresses by employing neural ordinary differential\nequations. The approach enables accurate prediction of temperatures and altered\nstructural properties like stress tensor components. The developed surrogates\ncan ultimately facilitate on-the-fly re-optimization of the ongoing\nmanufacturing process to achieve desired structural outcomes. Consequently,\nthis building block contributes significantly to realizing digital twins and\nthe first-time-right paradigm in additive manufacturing.\n",
