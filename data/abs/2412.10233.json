  "abstract": "  Time-integrated state observables, which quantify the fraction of time spent\nin a specific pool of states, are important in many fields, such as chemical\nsensing or theory of fluorescence spectroscopy. We derive exact identities,\ncalled Fluctuation-Response Relations (FRRs), that connect the fluctuations of\nsuch observables to their response to external perturbations in nonequilibrium\nsteady state of Markov jump processes. Using these results, we derive novel\nupper and lower bounds for fluctuations. We further demonstrate their\napplicability for simplifying calculations of fluctuations in large Markov\nnetworks, use them to explain the physical origin of positive and negative\ncorrelations of occupation times in a double quantum dot device, and discuss\ntheir relevance for model inference.\n",
