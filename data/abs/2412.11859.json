Assessing their\npotential requires precise characterization of magnon properties. Here, we use\na superconducting qubit to probe magnons in a ferrimagnet over a range of about\n2000 excitations. Using qubit control and parametrically induced qubit-magnon\ninteractions we demonstrate few-excitation sensitive detection of magnons and\nare able to accurately resolve their decay. These results introduce quantum\ncircuits as high-dynamic range probes for magnons and provide an avenue toward\nsensitive detection of nontrivial magnon dynamics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gTeDkaSWJwENA_lPkpbHwV7EuBBat-c__ExnAlJ-vYI","pdfSize":"11242127"}
