We prove an exponential convergence guarantee for the\nmean-field min-max Langevin dynamics to compute the equilibrium distribution of\nthe zero-sum game. We also study the finite-particle approximation of the\nmean-field min-max Langevin dynamics, both in continuous and discrete times. We\nprove biased convergence guarantees for the continuous-time finite-particle\nmin-max Langevin dynamics to the stationary mean-field equilibrium distribution\nwith an explicit bias term which does not scale with the number of particles.\nWe also prove biased convergence guarantees for the discrete-time\nfinite-particle min-max Langevin algorithm to the stationary mean-field\nequilibrium distribution with an additional bias term which scales with the\nstep size and the number of particles. This provides an explicit iteration\ncomplexity for the average particle along the finite-particle algorithm to\napproximately compute the equilibrium distribution of the zero-sum game.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computer Science/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Y2jdvAgis1QOIwVmuK_XlQtin7_wvGCs2_v23kz1MfY","pdfSize":"692243"}
