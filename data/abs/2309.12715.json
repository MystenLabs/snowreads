The key insight of Cuttlefish is that\nconsensus in blockchains is necessary due to contention, rather than multiple\nowners of an asset as suggested by prior work. Previous proposals proactively\nuse consensus to prevent contention from blocking assets, taking a pessimistic\napproach. In contrast, Cuttlefish introduces collective objects and multi-owner\ntransactions that can offer most of the functionality of classic blockchains\nwhen objects transacted on are not under contention. Additionally, in case of\ncontention, Cuttlefish proposes a novel `Unlock' protocol that significantly\nreduces the latency of unblocking contented objects. By leveraging these\nfeatures, Cuttlefish implements consensus-less protocols for a broader range of\ntransactions, including asset swaps and multi-signature transactions, which\nwere previously believed to require consensus.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nFGuaj8ugg1GZ2rM2RGosiLlyjNJBsW6Lbx43qZZ6dc","pdfSize":"451269"}
