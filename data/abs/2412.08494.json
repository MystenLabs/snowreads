  "abstract": "  Phase space engineering by RF waves plays important roles in both thermal D-T\nfusion and non-thermal advanced fuel fusion. But not all phase space\nmanipulation is allowed, certain fundamental limits exist. In addition to\nLiouville's theorem, which requires the manipulation to be volume-preserving,\nGromov's non-squeezing theorem imposes another constraint. The Gardner ground\nstate is defined as the ground state accessible by smooth volume-preserving\nmaps. However, the extra Gromov constraint should produce a higher-energy\nground state. An example of a Gardner ground state forbidden by Gromov's\nnon-squeezing theorem is given. The challenge question is: What is the Gromov\nground state, i.e., the lowest energy state accessible by smooth symplectic\nmaps? This is a difficult problem. As a simplification, we conjecture that the\nlinear Gromov ground state problem is solvable.\n",
