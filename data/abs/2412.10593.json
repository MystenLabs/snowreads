Within a series of\nvarious Al2O3 and Ho3+ concentrations, relations between fibers composition and\ntheir fluorescence and laser parameters have been studied. Al/Ho molar ratio\nequal to at least 50 was found to be the key factor for fibers with outstanding\nparameters. Fibers with slope efficiency above 80%, laser threshold below 100\nmW and fluorescence lifetime up to 1.6 ms have been prepared. Thanks to high\nAl2O3 concentrations, obtained through nanoparticle doping, we were able to\nachieve high-performance fibers in a wide range of Ho3+ concentrations. An\noutput power of 19 W with 81% slope efficiency was reached using fiber with\nalmost 4000 ppm of Ho3+ and 10 mol.% of Al2O3. This result is encouraging for\nhighly efficient high-power cladding-pumped holmium fiber lasers, and studied\nrelations between fibers composition and their laser parameters will be used in\nthe designing of such laser sources.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"QZUgO-H9o8gn2G20_U0DNNdpid1EotdAzVacMoXF9GM","pdfSize":"653130"}
