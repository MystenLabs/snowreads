  "abstract": "  We propose a greedy search-and-score algorithm for ancestral graphs, which\ninclude directed as well as bidirected edges, originating from unobserved\nlatent variables. The normalized likelihood score of ancestral graphs is\nestimated in terms of multivariate information over relevant ``ac-connected\nsubsets'' of vertices, C, that are connected through collider paths confined to\nthe ancestor set of C. For computational efficiency, the proposed two-step\nalgorithm relies on local information scores limited to the close surrounding\nvertices of each node (step 1) and edge (step 2). This computational strategy,\nalthough restricted to information contributions from ac-connected subsets\ncontaining up to two-collider paths, is shown to outperform state-of-the-art\ncausal discovery methods on challenging benchmark datasets.\n",
