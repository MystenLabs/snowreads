  "abstract": "  CONUS+ is an experiment aiming at detecting coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus\nscattering (CE$\\nu$NS) of reactor antineutrinos on germanium nuclei in the\nfully coherent regime, continuing the CONUS physics program conducted at the\nBrokdorf nuclear power plant (KBR), Germany. The CONUS+ experiment is installed\nin the Leibstadt nuclear power plant (KKL), Switzerland, at a distance of 20.7\nm from the 3.6 GW reactor core, where the antineutrino flux is $1.5\\cdot\n10^{13}$~s$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$. The CE$\\nu$NS signature will be measured with four\npoint-contact high-purity low energy threshold germanium (HPGe) detectors. A\ngood understanding of the background is crucial, especially events correlated\nwith the reactor thermal power are troublesome. A large background\ncharacterization campaign was conducted during reactor on and off times to find\nthe best location for the CONUS+ setup. On-site measurements revealed a\ncorrelated, highly thermalized neutron field with a maximum fluence rate of\n$(2.3\\pm0.1)\\cdot 10^{4}$~neutrons~d$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$ during reactor operation.\nThe $\\gamma$-ray background was studied with a HPGe detector without shield.\nThe muon flux was examined using a liquid scintillator detector measuring\n(107$\\pm$3)~muons~s$^{-1}$m$^{-2}$, which corresponds to an average overburden\nof 7.4~m of water equivalent. The new background conditions in CONUS+ are\ncompared to the previous CONUS ones, showing a 30 times higher flux of\nneutrons, but a 26 times lower component of reactor thermal power correlated\n$\\gamma$-rays over 2.7 MeV. The lower CONUS+ overburden increases the number of\nmuon-induced neutrons by 2.3 times and the flux of cosmogenic neutrons.\nFinally, all the measured rates are discussed in the context of the CONUS+\nbackground, together with the CONUS+ modifications performed to reduce the\nimpact of the new background conditions at KKL.\n",
