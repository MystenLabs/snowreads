Here we prepared ultra-thin MBT films\nwith controlled anti-site defects and observed rich doping-dependent magnetic\nbehaviors. We find in one-septuple-layer MBT films a ferrimagnetic ground state\nand in two-septuple-layer ones a kind of re-entrant ferromagnetism (FM) that\ndisappears with increased Bi-on-Mn doping in the FM Mn-layers. This re-entrant\nbehavior is attributed to a kind of symmetric exchange-bias effect that arises\nin the presence of both AFM and FM sub-systems due to the introduction of\nhigh-dense Mn-on-Bi anti-site defects. Furthermore, all MBT films display\nspin-glass-like behaviors. Our work demonstrates rich magnetic behaviors\noriginating from the competing magnetic interactions between Mn spins at\ndifferent lattice positions in MBT.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"dE7hAB_bLcH7oxjfRVAHGeSdD_-_9XMLpKt9L5fqXg8","pdfSize":"2167189"}
