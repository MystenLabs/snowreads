Our study consists of a ladder-box, a tennis-court, and two\nreducible ladder-box-like families. The results for the master integrals of\nthese families are expressed up to order six in the dimensional regulator in\nterms of real-valued multiple polylogarithms. Furthermore, a semi-numeric\nsolution is provided, employing generalized power series expansions using the\npackage DiffExp.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"s0hPgBWSn8LPXMqCvenXMGPxtqA4qItqQGuhxrrj_UE","pdfSize":"1218034"}
