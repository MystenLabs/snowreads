  "abstract": "  Nitrous oxide is a long-lived greenhouse gas. Its isotopic composition\nprovides valuable insights into sources and sinks, and about the mechanism of\nformation. A major challenge in the spectroscopic analysis of the isotopocule\ncompositions is the availability of accurate spectroscopic parameters,\nparticularly for the minor $^{15}$N isotopocules. In this work, we introduce\nhigh-resolution spectroscopic measurements of four isotopocules of nitrous\noxide: $^{14}$N$_{2}$O, $^{14}$N$^{15}$NO, $^{15}$N$^{14}$NO, and\n$^{15}$N$_{2}$O in the mid-infrared range of 3300 - 3550 cm$^{-1}$, using a\nfrequency comb-based Fourier transform spectrometer. The nitrous oxide samples\nwere obtained from a chemical synthesis involving acid-catalyzed amine-borane\nreduction of equimolar amounts of $^{15}$N isotopically enriched sodium nitrite\nand $^{14}$N sodium nitrite. The high-resolution spectra, measured in a\ntemperature-controlled single-pass absorption cell, were used to retrieve line\ncenter frequencies and relative intensities for a total of 426 rovibrational\ntransitions of the ${\\nu}$$_{1}$ + ${\\nu}$$_{3}$ band of the four isotopocules,\nand of the one order of magnitude weaker 2${\\nu}$$_{2}$ + ${\\nu}$$_{3}$ and\n${\\nu}$$_{1}$ + ${\\nu}$$_{2}$ + ${\\nu}$$_{3}$ - ${\\nu}$$_{2}$ bands in the same\nspectral region. We compare the determined line center frequencies and relative\nintensities with spectroscopic parameters available in high-resolution\nmolecular databases. For $^{14}$N$_{2}$O, $^{14}$N$^{15}$NO and\n$^{15}$N$^{14}$NO we find good agreement with the HITRAN database. The\n$^{15}$N$_{2}$O isotopocule is missing in HITRAN, and we find that its line\ncenter frequencies in the GEISA database, the Institute of Atmospheric Optics\ndatabase, as well as the Ames-1 line list deviate severely from the comb\nmeasurements.\n",
