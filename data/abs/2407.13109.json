The increase of wearables such as GPS sensors has provided analysts\nwith large fine-grained datasets detailing player performance. Traditional\nanalysis of this data focuses on individual athletes with measures of internal\nand external loading such as distance covered in speed zones or rate of\nperceived exertion. However these metrics do not provide enough information to\nunderstand team dynamics within field sports. The spatio-temporal nature of\nmatch play necessitates an investment in date-engineering to adequately\ntransform the data into a suitable format to extract features such as areas of\nactivity. In this paper we present an approach to construct Time-Window Spatial\nActivity Graphs (TWGs) for field sports. Using GPS data obtained from Gaelic\nFootball matches we demonstrate how our approach can be utilised to extract\nspatio-temporal features from GPS sensor data\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"onXVh-6U7l1RniWapGQWUklqSC7yY5nvgikOJ49sERk","pdfSize":"998840","objectId":"0xe71684abe0e8215220ea696e9099da218c2f02e1d993b68b3982e5ab2c3c53fd","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
