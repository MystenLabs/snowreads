  "abstract": "  Visual re-ranking using Nearest Neighbor graph~(NN graph) has been adapted to\nyield high retrieval accuracy, since it is beneficial to exploring an\nhigh-dimensional manifold and applicable without additional fine-tuning. The\nquality of visual re-ranking using NN graph, however, is limited to that of\nconnectivity, i.e., edges of the NN graph. Some edges can be misconnected with\nnegative images. This is known as a noisy edge problem, resulting in a\ndegradation of the retrieval quality. To address this, we propose a\ncomplementary denoising method based on Continuous Conditional Random Field\n(C-CRF) that uses a statistical distance of our similarity-based distribution.\nThis method employs the concept of cliques to make the process computationally\nfeasible. We demonstrate the complementarity of our method through its\napplication to three visual re-ranking methods, observing quality boosts in\nlandmark retrieval and person re-identification (re-ID).\n",
