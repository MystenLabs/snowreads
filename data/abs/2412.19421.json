  "abstract": "  We study an adiabatic topological passage of two Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH)\nchains mediated by a giant atom. When two finite SSH chains are in the\ntopological phase and the frequency of the giant atom is equal to the center\nfrequency of the SSH chains, the system is reduced to a subsystem that\ndescribes the coupling of a giant atom to the edge states of two SSH chains. In\nthis case, we can find dark states that act as adiabatic topological passages.\nThis allows us to adiabatically transfer excitations of the giant atom to\neither one end of two SSH chains in a fully controllable way. In addition, we\nshow good robustness of the adiabatic topological passages to both giant atom\nfrequency mismatch and the coupling disorders in two SSH chains. Our study\nprovides a method to realize quantum information processing and fabricate\nquantum optical devices based on the coupling of the giant atom to topological\nmatter.\n",
