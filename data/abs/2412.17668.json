Given a graph $G$ and $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, Alice and Bob\nalternately (starting with Alice) color an uncolored vertex with some color in\n$\\{1,\\cdots,k\\}$ such that no two adjacent vertices receive a same color. If\neventually all vertices are colored, then Alice wins and Bob wins otherwise.\nThe game chromatic number $\\chi_g(G)$ is the smallest integer $k$ such that\nAlice has a winning strategy with $k$ colors in $G$. It has been recently\n(2020) shown that, given a graph $G$ and $k\\in \\mathbb{N}$, deciding whether\n$\\chi_g(G)\\leq k$ is PSPACE-complete. Surprisingly, this parameter is not well\nunderstood even in ``simple\" graph classes. Let $P_n$ denote the path with\n$n\\geq 1$ vertices. For instance, in the case of Cartesian grids, it is easy to\nshow that $\\chi_g(P_m \\times P_n) \\leq 5$ since $\\chi_g(G)\\leq \\Delta+1$ for\nany graph $G$ with maximum degree $\\Delta$. However, the exact value is only\nknown for small values of $m$, namely $\\chi_g(P_1\\times P_n)=3$,\n$\\chi_g(P_2\\times P_n)=4$ and $\\chi_g(P_3\\times P_n) =4$ for $n\\geq 4$\n[Raspaud, Wu, 2009]. Here, we prove that, for every $n\\geq 18$,\n$\\chi_g(P_4\\times P_n) =4$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computer Science/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-9m5KyChXLMruKGPJePd8fsXvr9NA29G_4dfzpXcUkM","pdfSize":"276943"}
