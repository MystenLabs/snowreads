Often, considering a time-dependent threshold is\nessential for accurately modeling stochastic processes, as it provides a more\naccurate and adaptable framework. In this paper, we extend an existing Exact\nsimulation method developed for constant thresholds to handle time-dependent\nthresholds. Our proposed approach utilizes the FPT of Brownian motion and\naccepts it for the FPT of a given process with some probability, which is\ndetermined using Girsanov's transformation. This method eliminates the need to\nsimulate entire paths over specific time intervals, avoids time-discretization\nerrors, and directly simulates the first-passage time. We present results\ndemonstrating the method's effectiveness, including the extension to\ntime-dependent thresholds, an analysis of its time complexity, comparisons with\nexisting methods through numerical examples, and its application to predicting\nspike times in a neuron.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sTApVLC_hWDfhESgLemwtfbS8uHXVDIIdBECin4Y5qY","pdfSize":"595386"}
