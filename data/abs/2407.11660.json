Motivated by\nthe need for lightweight, open source, and multilingual dialogue evaluators,\nthis paper introduces GenResCoh (Generated Responses targeting Coherence).\nGenResCoh is a novel LLM generated dataset comprising over 130k negative and\npositive responses and accompanying explanations seeded from XDailyDialog and\nXPersona covering English, French, German, Italian, and Chinese. Leveraging\nGenResCoh, we propose ECoh (Evaluation of Coherence), a family of evaluators\ntrained to assess response coherence across multiple languages. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that ECoh achieves multilingual detection capabilities\nsuperior to the teacher model (GPT-3.5-Turbo) on GenResCoh, despite being based\non a much smaller architecture. Furthermore, the explanations provided by ECoh\nclosely align in terms of quality with those generated by the teacher model.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"yCR52gWr57nLdyeJC57NvvBo1yS0xZ_cPu4LgwlW2tU","pdfSize":"526936"}
