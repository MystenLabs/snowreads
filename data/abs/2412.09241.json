We show that the top mass and strong coupling constants are key\nobservables in order to reach or refute absolute stability. We highlight new\nphysics scenarios that lead to a decisive stabilisation of the Higgs sector.\nThese proceedings summarise findings first reported in~[1,2].\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"P6TTwOTosu33zrnPszYtrY7_ZbgCeLOZnMGnloQvOjI","pdfSize":"465561"}
