The adopted approach integrates a hyperbolic parallel damping equation\nfor pressure updating, along with a dynamic resistive relaxation for magnetic\nfield. To address the nonaxisymmetry in toroidal geometry, a pseudo flux\nmapping is employed to relate the axisymmetric computational domain to the\nphysical domain. On the computational mesh, an isoparametric C1-continuous\ntriangular element is utilized to discretize the poloidal plane, which is\ncomplemented with a Fourier decomposition in the toroidal direction. The\nversatility of the code is demonstrated through its application to several\ndifferent non-axisymmetric toroidal systems, including the inherently\nthree-dimensional equilibria in stellarators, the helical-core equilibrium\nstates in tokamak plasmas, and the quasi-single-helicity states in a\nreversed-field pinch.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DI6sYyTqeNWIo2iFluepqlqiLZ1oU3qao4grt90R3pA","pdfSize":"24323816"}
