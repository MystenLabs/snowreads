  "abstract": "  The bulk photovoltaic effect is a photocurrent generation from alternating\nelectric field, which is a promising candidate for future efficient solar cell\ntechnology. It is the second-order optical current, which is the injection\ncurrent or the shift current. We focus on the direct current generation. We\nshow the linearly (circularly) polarized light can generate injection (shift)\ncurrent in the $d$-wave altermagnet coupled with the Rashba interaction when\nthe N\\'{e}el vector points in an in-plane direction. The magnitude of the\ninjection current does not depend\\ on the frequency $% \\omega $ of the applied\nlight provided it is smaller than a certain critical frequency $\\omega\n_{\\text{c}}$ and larger than the bulk gap energy $% \\varepsilon _{\\text{gap}}$,\n$\\varepsilon _{\\text{gap}}\\leq \\hbar \\omega \\leq \\hbar \\omega _{\\text{c}}$.\nHence, the use of the injection current is quite efficient for solar cell\ntechnology because any photon whose energy is within this range can be equally\nutilized.\n",
