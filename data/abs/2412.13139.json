Time\ndelay is one way to extract information from $S$, and the transmission time\ndelay $\\tau_T$ is a complex (even for Hermitian systems with unitary scattering\nmatrices) measure of how long a wave excitation lingers before being\ntransmitted. The real part of $\\tau_T$ is a well-studied quantity, but the\nimaginary part of $\\tau_T$ has not been systematically examined experimentally,\nand theoretical predictions for its behavior have not been tested. Here we\nexperimentally test the predictions of Asano, et al. [Nat. Comm. 7, 13488\n(2016)] for the imaginary part of transmission time delay in a non-unitary\nscattering system. We utilize Gaussian time-domain pulses scattering from a\n2-port microwave graph supporting a series of well-isolated absorptive modes to\nshow that the carrier frequency of the pulses is changed in the scattering\nprocess by an amount in agreement with the imaginary part of the independently\ndetermined complex transmission time delay, $\\text{Im}[\\tau_T]$, from\nfrequency-domain measurements of the sub-unitary $S$ matrix. Our results also\ngeneralize and extend those of Asano, et al., establishing a means to predict\npulse propagation properties of non-Hermitian systems over a broad range of\nconditions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6xGj6tYGIAUOFlGpMgaZd5carE2u8Q0wPe0tow14THM","pdfSize":"1917384"}
