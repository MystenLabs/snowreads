Typically, skyrmions form in bulk\ncrystals with reduced symmetry or ultrathin film multilayers involving heavy\nmetals. Here, we demonstrate the formation of fractional Bloch skyrmion tubes\nat room temperature by 3D printing ferromagnetic double-helix nanowires with\ntwo regions of opposite chirality. Using X-ray microscopy and micromagnetic\nsimulations, we show that the coexistence of vortex and anti-parallel spin\nstates induces the formation of fractional skyrmion tubes at zero magnetic\nfields, minimising the energy cost of breaking the coupling between geometric\nand magnetic chirality. We also demonstrate control over zero-field states,\nincluding pure vortex, or mixed skyrmion-vortex states, highlighting the\nmagnetic reconfigurability of these 3D nanowires. This work shows how\ninterfacing chiral geometries at the nanoscale can enable advanced forms of\ntopological spintronics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5nv4ZNFcEQ6_xkrCfLk1z4G3VlfkjhXib_o9mVoECOQ","pdfSize":"1143864"}
