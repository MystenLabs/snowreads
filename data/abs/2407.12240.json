Existing methods on test-time training suffer from several\nlimitations: (1) Mismatch between the feature extractor and classifier; (2)\nInterference between the main and self-supervised tasks; (3) Lack of the\nability to quickly adapt to the current distribution. In light of these\nchallenges, we propose a cascading paradigm that simultaneously updates the\nfeature extractor and classifier at test time, mitigating the mismatch between\nthem and enabling long-term model adaptation. The pre-training of our model is\nstructured within a meta-learning framework, thereby minimizing the\ninterference between the main and self-supervised tasks and encouraging fast\nadaptation in the presence of limited unlabelled data. Additionally, we\nintroduce innovative evaluation metrics, average accuracy and forward transfer,\nto effectively measure the model's adaptation capabilities in dynamic,\nreal-world scenarios. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate\nthe superiority of our approach in a range of tasks including image\nclassification, text classification, and speech recognition.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0Fg4XRJml4e0vjaZBpyJckkdIxrFQwPCS5EJt3H_Xh4","pdfSize":"1181853"}
