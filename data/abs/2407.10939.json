In particular, we give a contour integral\nformula for solutions to the Teukolsky equations, and we find a recursion\noperator that generates an infinite family of solutions and leads to the\nconstruction of Cech representatives and sheaf cohomology classes on twistor\nspace. Apart from the general conformally self-dual case, examples include\nself-dual black holes, scalar-flat K\\\"ahler surfaces, and quaternionic-K\\\"ahler\nmetrics, where we map the Teukolsky equation to the conformal wave equation,\nestablish new relations to the linearised Przanowski equation, and find new\nclasses of quaternionic deformations.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2HtoPWpZ-630ilBA8EvmlZMZg-7SoDY_tA6-RpHivew","pdfSize":"338213","objectId":"0xaf3c04804b5190d65699f42c2a447352382ebbd71d7b3b0d74224b79355a1eef","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
