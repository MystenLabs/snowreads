  "abstract": "  Stanis{\\l}aw Le\\'sniewski's mereology was formulated in a specific way,\ndeviating from standard formalizations. Nowadays, Le\\'sniewski's theory is\npresented in the form of an elementary theory or translated into the language\nof the theory of relational structures. In this article, firstly, we look at\nexistentially neutral theories, in which we do not postulate the existence of\nany other collective sets than those obtained from the definition and the basic\nproperties of the relation of being a part. We also examine some existentially\ninvolved theories of parts. Among them, there is Grzegorczykian mereology and\nLe\\'sniewskian mereology. One of the main principles of mereology is the\ntransitivity of the concept of being a part of. This property is often\nquestioned in the literature on the subject. In the final part, we present\nproblems related to the transitivity of this concept.\n",
