Each landmark is a single ground truth point\nlabelled by a clinician. A machine learning model predicts the locus of a\nlandmark as a probability region represented by a heatmap. Diffusion models\nhave increased in popularity for generative modelling due to their high quality\nsampling and mode coverage, leading to their adoption in medical image\nprocessing for semantic segmentation. Diffusion modelling can be further\nadapted to learn a distribution over landmarks. The stochastic nature of\ndiffusion models captures fluctuations in the landmark prediction, which we\nleverage by blurring into meaningful probability regions. In this paper, we\nreformulate automatic Anatomical Landmark Detection as a precise generative\nmodelling task, producing a few-hot pixel heatmap. Our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art MRE and comparable SDR performance with existing work.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_t8SXQrZvChkIIDabbvkiHT66zA6KaxDaGRLAuoeHzU","pdfSize":"8388053"}
