  "abstract": "  In \\citep{Qin+}, we attempted to reconstruct the weak lensing convergence map\n$\\hat{\\kappa}$ from cosmic magnification by linearly weighting the DECaLS\ngalaxy overdensities in different magnitude bins of $grz$ photometry bands. The\n$\\hat{\\kappa}$ map is correlated with cosmic shear at 20-$\\sigma$ significance.\nHowever, the low galaxy number density in the DECaLS survey prohibits the\nmeasurement of $\\hat{\\kappa}$ auto-correlation. In this paper, we apply the\nreconstruction method to the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) galaxies from\nthe DES Data Release 2 (DR2). With greater survey depth and higher galaxy\nnumber density, convergence-shear cross-correlation signals are detected with\n$S/N\\approx 9,16,20$ at $0.4<z_\\kappa<0.6,0.6<z_\\kappa<0.8$ and\n$0.8<z_\\kappa<1.0$ respectively. More remarkably, the\n$\\hat{\\kappa}-\\hat{\\kappa}$ correlations of the $0.4<z_\\kappa<0.6$ and\n$0.6<z_\\kappa<0.8$ bins show reasonably good agreement with predictions based\non theoretical interpretation of $\\hat{\\kappa}-\\gamma$ measurement. This result\ntakes a step further towards the cosmological application of our lensing\nreconstruction method.\n",
