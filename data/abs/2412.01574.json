  "abstract": "  This paper presents a unified framework for constructing Approximate Message\nPassing (AMP) algorithms for rotationally-invariant models. By employing a\ngeneral iterative algorithm template and reducing it to long-memory Orthogonal\nAMP (OAMP), we systematically derive the correct Onsager terms of AMP\nalgorithms. This approach allows us to rederive an AMP algorithm introduced by\nFan and Opper et al., while shedding new light on the role of free cumulants of\nthe spectral law. The free cumulants arise naturally from a recursive centering\noperation, potentially of independent interest beyond the scope of AMP. To\nillustrate the flexibility of our framework, we introduce two novel AMP\nvariants and apply them to estimation in spiked models.\n",
