  "abstract": "  This work addresses an optimal control problem constrained by a degenerate\nkinetic equation of parabolic-hyperbolic type. Using a hypocoercivity framework\nwe establish the well-posedness of the problem and demonstrate that the optimal\nsolutions exhibit a hypocoercive decay property, ensuring stability and\nrobustness. Building on this framework, we develop a finite element\ndiscretisation that preserves the stability properties of the continuous\nsystem. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method are validated\nthrough a series of numerical experiments, showcasing its ability to handle\nchallenging PDE-constrained optimal control problems.\n",
