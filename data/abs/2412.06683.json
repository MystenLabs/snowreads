  "abstract": "  Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) is a new\narchitecture for RIS where elements are interconnected to provide more wave\nmanipulation flexibility than traditional single connected RIS, enhancing data\nrate and coverage. However, channel estimation for BD-RIS is challenging due to\nthe more complex multiple-connection structure involving their scattering\nelements. To address this issue, this paper proposes a decoupled channel\nestimation method for BD-RIS that yields separate estimates of the involved\nchannels to enhance the accuracy of the overall combined channel by\ncapitalizing on its Kronecker structure. Starting from a least squares estimate\nof the combined channel and by properly reshaping the resulting filtered\nsignal, the proposed algorithm resorts to a Khatri-Rao Factorization (KRF)\nmethod that teases out the individual channels based on simple rank-one matrix\napproximation steps. Numerical results show that the proposed decoupled channel\nestimation yields more accurate channel estimates than the classical least\nsquares scheme.\n",
