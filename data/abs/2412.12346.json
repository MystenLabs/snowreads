We present a feasibility study of $\\Lambda^0 \\to\nn\\pi^0$ measurements using a high-granularity Zero Degree Calorimeter to be\nlocated about 35 m from the interaction point. We introduce a method to address\nthe unprecedented challenge of identifying $\\Lambda^0$s with energy $O(100)$\nGeV that produce displaced vertices of $O(10)$ m. In addition, we present a\nreconstruction approach using graph neural networks. We find that the energy\nand angle resolution for $\\Lambda^0$ is similar to that for neutrons, both of\nwhich meet the requirements outlined in the EIC Yellow Report.Furthermore, we\nestimate performance for measuring the neutron's direction in the $\\Lambda^0$\nrest frame, which reflects the $\\Lambda^0$ spin polarization. We estimate that\nthe neutral-decay channel $\\Lambda^0 \\to n\\pi^0$ will greatly extend the\nmeasurable energy range for the charged-decay channel $\\Lambda^0 \\to p\\pi^-$,\nwhich is limited by the location of small-angle trackers and the accelerator\nmagnets. This work paves the way for EIC studies of kaon structure and spin\nphenomena.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IMJmMdlDfHRmJ9fXge8wcBFB0jbLSTEr5pe0lIHt6Xg","pdfSize":"2810024"}
