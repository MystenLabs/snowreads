Under some mild conditions on the exciting\nkernels, we develop a new way to prove that after a suitable time-spatial\nscaling, the asymptotically critical multivariate Hawkes processes converge\nweakly to the unique solution of a multidimensional stochastic Volterra\nequation with convolution kernel being the potential measure associated to a\nmatrix-valued extended Bernstein function. Also, based on the observation of\ntheir affine property and generalized branching property, we provide an\nexponential-affine representation of the Fourier-Laplace functional of scaling\nlimits in terms of the unique solutions of multidimensional Riccati-Volterra\nequations with measure kernel. The regularity of limit processes and their\nalternate representations are also investigated by using the potential theory\nof L\\'evy subordinators.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dRaANWTuZ3z1uqE67rOyV817XYOBkqYbvSFGt51qewk","pdfSize":"571662"}
