  "abstract": "  We present a joint analysis of TTVs and Doppler data for the transiting\nexoplanet system TOI-4504. TOI-4504 c is a warm Jupiter-mass planet that\nexhibits the largest known transit timing variations (TTVs), with a\npeak-to-node amplitude of $\\sim$ 2 days, the largest value ever observed, and a\nsuper-period of $\\sim$ 930 d. TOI-4504 b and c were identified in public TESS\ndata, while the TTVs observed in TOI-4504 c, together with radial velocity (RV)\ndata collected with FEROS, allowed us to uncover a third, non-transiting planet\nin this system, TOI-4504 d. We were able to detect transits of TOI-4504 b in\nthe TESS data with a period of 2.4261$\\pm 0.0001$ days and derive a radius of\n2.69$\\pm 0.19$ R$_{\\oplus}$. The RV scatter of TOI-4504 was too large to\nconstrain the mass of TOI-4504 b, but the RV signals of TOI-4504 c \\& d were\nsufficiently large to measure their masses. The TTV+RV dynamical model we apply\nconfirms TOI-4504 c as a warm Jupiter planet with an osculating period of\n82.54$\\pm 0.02$ d, mass of 3.77$\\pm 0.18$ M$_{\\rm J}$ and a radius of 0.99$\\pm\n0.05$ R$_{\\rm J}$, while the non-transiting planet TOI-4504 d, has an orbital\nperiod of 40.56$\\pm 0.04$ days and mass of 1.42$_{-0.06}^{+0.07}$ M$_{\\rm J}$.\nWe present the discovery of a system with three exoplanets: a hot sub-Neptune\nand two warm Jupiter planets. The gas giant pair is stable and likely locked in\na first-order 2:1 mean-motion resonance (MMR). The TOI-4504 system is an\nimportant addition to MMR pairs, whose increasing occurrence supports a smooth\nmigration into a resonant configuration during the protoplanetary disk phase.\n",
