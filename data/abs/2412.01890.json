  "abstract": "  If primordial black holes (PBH) are present in the early universe, their\ncontribution to the energy budget grows relative to that of radiation and\ngenerically becomes dominant unless the initial abundance is exponentially\nsmall. This black hole domination scenario is largely unconstrained for PBHs\nwith masses $\\lesssim 10^9\\,\\mathrm{g}$, which evaporate prior to Big Bang\nnucleosynthesis. However, if the era of PBH domination is sufficiently long,\nthe PBHs form clusters and can merge appreciably within these objects. We\ncalculate the population statistics of these clusters within the\nPress-Schechter formalism and find that, for a wide range of PBH masses and\nHubble rates at the onset of PBH domination, the mergers within PBH clusters\ncan exhibit runaway behavior, where the majority of the cluster will eventually\nform a single black hole with a mass much greater than the original PBH mass.\nThese mergers can dramatically alter the PBH mass distribution and leave behind\nmerged relic black holes that evaporate after Big Bang nucleosynthesis and\nyield various observational signatures, excluding parameter choices previously\nthought to be viable\n",
