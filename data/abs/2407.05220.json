Here, we demonstrate AM-like phases in a microscopic\nKondo lattice model, widely used for heavy fermion compounds. With the\nframework of fermionic parton mean-field theory, we find the $d$-wave AM state\ncan coexist with the intrinsic Kondo screening effect in such itinerant-local\nelectron system if an alternating next-nearest-neighbor-hopping (NNNH) is\nincluded. Such alternating NNNH take nonmagnetic atoms, neglected in usual\nantiferromagnetism study, into account when encountering real-life candidate AM\nmaterials. The AM-like states are characterized by their spin-splitting\nquasiparticle bands, Fermi surface, spin-resolved distribution function and\nconductivity. It is suggested that the magnetic quantum oscillation and charge\ntransport measurement can detect those AM-like phases. We hope the present work\nmay be useful for exploring AM-like phases in $f$-electron compounds.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6uoeB210H2L9e3dCQjQkNCjDo8RW1JkqpL-ohoaW62A","pdfSize":"1497419"}
