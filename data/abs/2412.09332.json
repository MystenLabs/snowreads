Effective Pauli noise models have emerged as powerful tools,\noffering detailed description of the error processes with a manageable number\nof parameters, which guarantees the scalability of the characterization\nprocedure. However, a fundamental limitation in the learnability of Pauli\nfidelities impedes full high-accuracy characterization of both general and\neffective Pauli noise, thereby restricting e.g., the performance of noise-aware\nerror mitigation techniques. We introduce Multi-Layer Cycle Benchmarking\n(MLCB), an enhanced characterization protocol that improves the learnability\nassociated with effective Pauli noise models by jointly analyzing multiple\nlayers of Clifford gates. We show a simple experimental implementation and\ndemonstrate that, in realistic scenarios, MLCB can reduce unlearnable noise\ndegrees of freedom by up to $75\\%$, improving the accuracy of sparse\nPauli-Lindblad noise models and boosting the performance of error mitigation\ntechniques like probabilistic error cancellation. Our results highlight MLCB as\na scalable, practical tool for precise noise characterization and improved\nquantum computation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CucPY96D1xUhuHEIuU8CySNno3LZTQW0sS99Jx6OiQE","pdfSize":"993626"}
