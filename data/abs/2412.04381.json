  "abstract": "  We calculate the four-graviton scattering amplitude in Type II superstring\ntheory at one-loop up to seventh order in the low-energy expansion through the\nrecently developed iterated integral formalism of Modular Graph Functions\n(MGFs). We propose a new assignment of transcendental weight to the numbers\nthat appear in the amplitude, which leads to a violation of uniform\ntranscendentality. Furthermore, the machinery of the novel method allows us to\npropose a general form of the amplitude, which suggests that the expansion is\nexpressible in terms of single-valued multiple zeta values and logarithmic\nderivatives of the Riemann zeta function at positive and negative odd integers.\n",
