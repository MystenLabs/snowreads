  "abstract": "  Modern autonomous vehicle simulators feature an ever-growing library of\nassets, including vehicles, buildings, roads, pedestrians, and more. While this\nlevel of customization proves beneficial when creating virtual urban\nenvironments, this process becomes cumbersome when intending to train within a\ndigital twin or a duplicate of a real scene. Gaussian splatting emerged as a\npowerful technique in scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis, boasting\nhigh fidelity and rendering speeds. In this paper, we introduce GSAVS, an\nautonomous vehicle simulator that supports the creation and development of\nautonomous vehicle models. Every asset within the simulator is a 3D Gaussian\nsplat, including the vehicles and the environment. However, the simulator runs\nwithin a classical 3D engine, rendering 3D Gaussian splats in real-time. This\nallows the simulator to utilize the photorealism that 3D Gaussian splatting\nboasts while providing the customization and ease of use of a classical 3D\nengine.\n",
