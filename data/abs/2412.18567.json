  "abstract": "  Very recently, the two-photon decay width of the $\\eta_b$ meson was computed\nwith lattice QCD methods. This decay has not yet been measured. The knowledge\nof this width allows for the calculation of the $\\eta_b$ production cross\nsection through photon-photon interactions in ultra-peripheral $PbPb$\ncollisions. In this work we present this calculation, which is the first\napplication of the lattice result. Since UPCs are gaining an increasing\nattention of the heavy ion community, we take the opportunity to perform a\ncomprehensive study of the different ways of defining ultra-peripheral\ncollisions and of the different ways to treat the equivalent photon flux.\n",
