Despite demonstrating\neffectiveness, existing studies still evidently struggle to evaluate, analysis,\nand reproducibility of LLM-based MAS. In this paper, to facilitate the research\non LLM-based MAS, we introduce an open, scalable, and real-time updated\nplatform for accessing and analyzing the LLM-based MAS based on the games Who\nis Spy?\" (WiS). Our platform is featured with three main worths: (1) a unified\nmodel evaluate interface that supports models available on Hugging Face; (2)\nreal-time updated leaderboard for model evaluation; (3) a comprehensive\nevaluation covering game-winning rates, attacking, defense strategies, and\nreasoning of LLMs. To rigorously test WiS, we conduct extensive experiments\ncoverage of various open- and closed-source LLMs, we find that different agents\nexhibit distinct and intriguing behaviors in the game. The experimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our platform in evaluating\nLLM-based MAS.
