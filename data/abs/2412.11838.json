  "abstract": "  It is proved that $P(\\beta X)=\\beta P(X)$ if and only if $P(X)$ is a\npseudocompact space, where $P(X)$ is the space of probability Radon measures\nwith weak topology and $\\beta X$ is a Stone-Cech extension of the space $X$. A\nlocally compact pseudocompact space $X$ is constructed such that $P(X)$ is not\npseudocompact. Conditions are obtained under which $P(X)$ is pseudocompact.\n",
