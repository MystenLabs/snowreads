We present a\nmany-objective problem class together with a theoretical runtime analysis of\nthe widely used NSGA-III to demonstrate that crossover can yield an exponential\nspeedup on the runtime. In particular, this algorithm can find the Pareto set\nin expected polynomial time when using crossover while without crossover it\nrequires exponential time to even find a single Pareto-optimal point. To our\nknowledge, this is the first rigorous runtime analysis in many-objective\noptimisation demonstrating an exponential performance gap when using crossover\nfor more than two objectives.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"ve3RuNUXt1P8CE73uzsFT5HAk2AG93-zrA8vAJJJmsw","pdfSize":"260336"}
