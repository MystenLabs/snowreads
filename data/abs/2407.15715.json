We first suggest that they can be novel\nwhen integrated; we then conduct a literature review and case study following\nconsensus-building for decentralization and token value for autonomy.\nIntegration requires simultaneous consideration of strategic behavior,\nspamming, Sybil attacks, free-riding, marginal cost, marginal utility and\nstabilizers. This survey is the first systematization of knowledge on\ncryptoeconomics and tokenomics, aiming to bridge the contexts of economics and\nblockchain.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"X5jTk-wl0MVXT3R7V-KhGC4bmj1uNusC5ujDUdny3tI","pdfSize":"2119100","objectId":"0x0e97fb00cbfd3565815077d7a80e861462ba9425884053aac525b87b6dcbb12c","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
