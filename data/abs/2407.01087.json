For judging the\nfeasibility of a vitrification experiment, the critical cooling rate of pure\nwater is a frequently cited reference quantity. However, an accurate\ndetermination has remained elusive, with estimates varying by several orders of\nmagnitude. Here, we employ in situ and time-resolved electron microscopy to\nobtain a precise measurement. We use shaped microsecond laser pulses to briefly\nmelt an amorphous ice sample before flash freezing it with a variable,\nwell-defined cooling rate. This allows us to directly measure the critical\ncooling rate of pure water, which we determine to be $6.4\\cdot10^{6}$ K/s. Our\nexperimental approach also expands the toolkit of microsecond time-resolved\ncryo-EM, an emerging technique, in which a cryo sample is similarly flash\nmelted and revitrified with a laser pulse.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Vdn9jupze5FzWLhlKdLSIl890VNqvV6Ap79pPOoYse0","pdfSize":"1944354"}
