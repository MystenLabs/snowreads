In comparison, we present\nthe Points of Interest (PoIs) to represent the scene and propose OSP, a novel\nframework for point-based 3D occupancy prediction. Owing to the inherent\nflexibility of the point-based representation, OSP achieves strong performance\ncompared with existing methods and excels in terms of training and inference\nadaptability. It extends beyond traditional perception boundaries and can be\nseamlessly integrated with volume-based methods to significantly enhance their\neffectiveness. Experiments on the Occ3D nuScenes occupancy benchmark show that\nOSP has strong performance and flexibility.
