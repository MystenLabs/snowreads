At each reproduction, a proportion of the\npopulation dies and is replaced by a not necessarily equal mass of new\nindividuals. The mass depends on the local population size and a function\nthereof. Additionally, as new individuals have a single parental type, with\ngrowing population size, events become more frequent and of smaller impact,\nmodelling the successful reproduction of a higher number of individuals. From\nthe central limit theorem we derive a Wright-Mal\\'ecot formula quantifying the\nasymptotic probability of identity by descent and thus isolation by distance.\nThe formula reflects that ancestral lineages are attracted by centres of\npopulation mass and coalesce with a rate inversely proportional to the\npopulation size. Notably, we obtain this information despite the varying\npopulation size rendering the dual process intractable.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"yUVl37WsVOOe4WRn_zttS_KuGohSO-FvbKXWPL_rKqA","pdfSize":"888547"}
