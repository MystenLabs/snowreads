  "abstract": "  With the goal of supporting scalable lexical semantic annotation, analysis,\nand theorizing, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of different methods for\ngenerating event descriptions under both syntactic constraints -- e.g. desired\nclause structure -- and semantic constraints -- e.g. desired verb sense. We\ncompare three different methods -- (i) manual generation by experts; (ii)\nsampling from a corpus annotated for syntactic and semantic information; and\n(iii) sampling from a language model (LM) conditioned on syntactic and semantic\ninformation -- along three dimensions of the generated event descriptions: (a)\nnaturalness, (b) typicality, and (c) distinctiveness. We find that all methods\nreliably produce natural, typical, and distinctive event descriptions, but that\nmanual generation continues to produce event descriptions that are more\nnatural, typical, and distinctive than the automated generation methods. We\nconclude that the automated methods we consider produce event descriptions of\nsufficient quality for use in downstream annotation and analysis insofar as the\nmethods used for this annotation and analysis are robust to a small amount of\ndegradation in the resulting event descriptions.\n",
