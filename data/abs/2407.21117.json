In this work, we are testing the model of a spherically\nsymmetric wind atmosphere of the donor star, previously identified as a B9 Ia\nsupergiant. The model spectrum has shown good agreement with the observed one\nat a relatively high mass loss rate of $\\dot{M} \\approx\n6\\times10^{-6}\\,M_{\\odot}\\,\\text{yr}^{-1}$; other parameters turned out to be\nclose to those expected for late B-supergiants. The increased mass loss rate\ncan be explained by the high rotation velocity of the star. In addition, we\nhave qualitatively demonstrated the effect of X-ray irradiation on the observed\nspectrum and discuss the fundamental possibility of wind acceleration under\nconditions of powerful irradiation.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"pxD-wc2kEs2s7CP33CBkTjLUv93GKCZAVzgFoUbtuSQ","pdfSize":"969481"}
