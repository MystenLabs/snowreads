This study investigated the evolutionary\nchannel of HD 133729 which is the first confirmed BLAP in a binary system.\nUsing the binary evolution code MESA, we explored various mass ratios and\ninitial orbital periods. Our simulations suggest that a system with a mass\nratio $q = 0.30$ undergoing non-conservative mass transfer ($\\beta=0.15$) can\nreproduce the observed characteristics through the pre-white dwarf Roche lobe\noverflow channel. Meanwhile, we predict that there are significant helium and\nnitrogen enhancements on the surface of the main sequence (MS) star. The system\nwill eventually undergo the common envelope phase, leading to a stellar merger.\nHD 133729 is a unique case as a benchmark, providing crucial insights into the\nformation mechanism and evolutionary fate of BLAPs with MS companions. This\nwork constrains the elemental abundances of the MS star and has helped our\nunderstanding of non-conservative mass transfer in binary evolution.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0ZpbHNHrPD3rYFxu0DWnDCichhmOvpce5X3-FUs7wSo","pdfSize":"709539"}
