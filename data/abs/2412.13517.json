A possible 2D structure of the metal diboride has been shown\nto be in the form of M2B2. Using density functional theory, we investigated\nphase stability and possible conventional superconductors for non-hydrogenation\nM2B2, light hydrogenation M2B2H, and heavy hydrogenation M2B2H4 of transition\nmetal borides M2B2 (M=Sc,Y,V,Nb). The light hydrogenation M2B2H show as if they\nwere a perturbed system from the non-hydrogenation in which the electronic\nstructure, the phonon property, and the possible superconducting state are\nslightly changed. However, the heavy hydrogenation of M2B2H4 give very\npromising 2D materials with a possible high Tc of up to 84K at ambient\npressure. This would fill the gaps for the study of possible conventional\nhigh-temperature superconductors at ambient pressure.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cVGVTtBNe9w8XA76ZvdfAQbdUCzYVrekDotqcCqNtVA","pdfSize":"17401691"}
