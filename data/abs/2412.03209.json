This model\nequation arises in the analysis of a shallow water flow by performing formal\nasymptotic expansions associated to the triple-deck regularisation (which is an\nextension of classical boundary layer theory). The resulting non-local operator\nis a fractional type derivative with order between $1$ and $2$. Travelling wave\nsolutions are typically analysed in relation to shock formation in the full\nshallow water problem. We show rigorously the existence of travelling waves\nthat, formally, in the limit of vanishing diffusion and dispersion would give\nrise to non-classical shocks, that is, shocks that violate the Lax entropy\ncondition. The proof is based on arguments that are typical in dynamical\nsystems. The nature of the non-local operator makes this possible, since the\nresulting travelling wave equation can be seen as a delayed\nintegro-differential equation. Thus, linearisation around critical points,\ncontinuity with respect to parameters and a shooting argument, are the main\nsteps that we have proved and adapted for solving this problem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xbgNmlLPWXx3xNfh8a7qmUyKjfyf41YlFCU6SNGhmBI","pdfSize":"650056"}
