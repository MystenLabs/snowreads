To address these\nphenomena together, we propose a two component DM scenario in an extension of\nScotogenic model, imposing $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\otimes \\mathbb{Z}_2^{\\prime}$\nsymmetry. The electroweak sphaleron process converts the $\\rm Y_{B-L}^{}$\nyield, generated through the Leptogenesis mechanism, into the baryon asymmetry\n($\\rm Y_{\\Delta B}^{}$) at $T_{\\rm sph}\\sim 131.7$ GeV, the sphalerons\ndecoupling temperature. In this framework, the CP asymmetry as well as the\nradiative neutrino mass generation explicitly involve the two DM particles,\nthus establishing a correlation between the baryon asymmetry, DM and observed\nactive neutrino masses. We study in details the allowed parameter space\navailable after considering all the constraints from the three phenomena as\nwell as from the collider search limits, and outline the region which could\npotentially be tested in future DM detection experiments through direct or\nindirect detection searches, lepton flavor-violating decays, etc.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BNrBT9nP3RpcOe0wotDM4ZWQkebmEm9ho2QmEi1G2sE","pdfSize":"12862252"}
