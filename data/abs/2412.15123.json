  "abstract": "  A search for the production of three massive vector bosons, $VVZ (V=W, Z)$,\nin proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV is performed using data with\nan integrated luminosity of $140$ fb$^{-1}$ recorded by the ATLAS detector at\nthe Large Hadron Collider. Events produced in the leptonic final states $WWZ\n\\to \\ell\\nu \\ell\\nu \\ell \\ell$ ($\\ell=e, \\mu$), $WZZ \\to \\ell\\nu \\ell\\ell\n\\ell\\ell$, $ZZZ \\to \\ell\\ell \\ell\\ell \\ell\\ell$, and the semileptonic final\nstates $WWZ \\to qq \\ell\\nu \\ell \\ell$ and $WZZ \\to \\ell\\nu qq \\ell \\ell$, are\nanalysed. The measured cross section for the $pp \\rightarrow VVZ$ process is\n$660^{+93}_{-90}(\\text{stat.})^{+88}_{-81}(\\text{syst.})$ fb, and the observed\n(expected) significance is 6.4 (4.7) standard deviations, representing the\nobservation of $VVZ$ production. In addition, the measured cross section for\nthe $pp \\rightarrow WWZ$ process is $442 \\pm 94\n(\\text{stat.})^{+60}_{-52}(\\text{syst.})$ fb, and the observed (expected)\nsignificance is 4.4 (3.6) standard deviations, representing evidence of $WWZ$\nproduction. The measured cross sections are consistent with the Standard Model\npredictions. Constraints on physics beyond the Standard Model are also derived\nin the effective field theory framework by setting limits on Wilson\ncoefficients for dimension-8 operators describing anomalous quartic gauge boson\ncouplings.\n",
