However, experimental implementations of such systems are\nmore complicated, expensive, and require complex security analysis. In this\nwork we present a proof of principle high-dimensional time-phase BB84 QKD\nexperiment using only one single-photon detector per measurement basis. We\nemploy the temporal Talbot effect to detect QKD symbols in the control basis,\nand show experimentally-obtained values for the two-dimensional and\nfour-dimensional case. We present a comparison of the secret key rates obtained\nfrom two different security proofs to display security issues stemming from\nasymmetric detection efficiencies in the two bases. Our results contribute to\nthe discussion of the benefits of high-dimensional encoding and highlight the\nimpact of security analysis on the achievable QKD performance.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"urMuUC3sF6zVTJSXWPJPAMeswZBu2fuk610y7LBQnSk","pdfSize":"3605416"}
