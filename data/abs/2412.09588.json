If this is the case,\nnumerical simulations of neutron star mergers suggest that various regions of\nthe stars may cross this line multiple times. This results in the nucleation of\nbubbles of the preferred phase, which subsequently expand and collide. The\nresulting gravitational wave spectrum is highly sensitively to the velocity of\nthe bubble walls. We use holography to perform the first microscopic simulation\nof bubble dynamics in a theory that qualitatively mirrors the expected phase\ndiagram of Quantum Chromodynamics. We determine the wall velocity in the\nmetastable regions and we compare it to theoretical estimates. We discuss\nimplications for gravitational wave production.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dB1nIVB7YSp6DI0x9bm52hzsm_U_f32crssbjN9a6qc","pdfSize":"16896205"}
