Using the Density Matrix\nRenormalization Group (DMRG) approach, we efficiently compute the spectrum of\nthe Schwinger model on a staggered lattice with up to 3000 qubits. As a result,\nwe achieve a precise computation of the critical mass of the massive Schwinger\nmodel to five digits using four different 'criticality criteria', observing\nperfect agreement among them. Additionally, we discuss the effect of a\nfour-fermion operator deformation of the Schwinger model and compute the\ncritical mass for various values of the deformation parameter.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2mVlk7qkYHTIPU_Fekfg3H0KTM_RSW9PdUvESFqXGPc","pdfSize":"772911"}
