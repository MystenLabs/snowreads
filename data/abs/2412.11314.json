  "abstract": "  The rapid advancement of natural language processing (NLP) technologies, such\nas instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs), urges the development of\nmodern evaluation protocols with human and machine feedback. We introduce\nEvalica, an open-source toolkit that facilitates the creation of reliable and\nreproducible model leaderboards. This paper presents its design, evaluates its\nperformance, and demonstrates its usability through its Web interface,\ncommand-line interface, and Python API.\n",
