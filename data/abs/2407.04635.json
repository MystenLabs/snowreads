We\nprove that this metric measure space is locally 4-Ahlfors regular and it is\nhyperbolic, meaning that it has a non-vanishing 4-capacity at infinity. This\nimplies that the affine-additive group is not quasiconformally equivalent to\nthe Heisenberg group or to the roto-translation group in contrast to the fact\nthat both of these groups are globally contactomorphic to the affine-additive\ngroup. Moreover, each quasiregular map, from the Heisenberg group to the\naffine-additive group must be constant.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fefGcYcSJJUyHU0Rd2Noj7tuPqi0eJoF5xyNX87AYJw","pdfSize":"220857"}
