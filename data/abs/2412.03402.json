Stewart's gauge is used to set up the\npast-oriented characteristic initial value problem. By a theorem of M. Mars\ncharacterising the Kerr spacetime, we provide conditions for the existence of\nan asymptotically timelike Killing vector on the development of the initial\ndata by demanding that the spacetime is endowed with a Killing spinor. The\nconditions on the characteristic initial data ensuring the existence of a\nKilling spinor are, in turn, analysed. Finally, we write the conditions on the\ninitial data in terms of the free data in the characteristic initial value\nproblem. As a result, we characterise the Kerr spacetime using only a section\nof future null infinity and its intersection with an outgoing null\nhypersurface.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"f_4YaC28rPuVYj1KHjN3_WrRayNxV9_8Zh4FqbWYPIc","pdfSize":"673054"}
