The anticipated experiment requires a sightline separation of tens of\nAU, achieved by sending radio telescopes to space. We find the signal of\narrival time difference induced by GWs depends only on the local GWs in the\nsolar system and we can correlate the measurements from different FRB sources\nor the same source with different repeaters, which leads to a better\nsensitivity with a larger number of FRB repeaters detected. The projected\nsensitivity shows this method is a competitive probe in the nHz to $\\mu$Hz\nfrequency range. It can fill the '$\\mu$Hz gap' between pulsar timing arrays and\nLaser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and is complementary to other\nproposals of GW detection in this frequency band.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vM7th27jwmfExksDYAphEPNeEjZCJ3bdMj-gyzVc0aI","pdfSize":"1027364","objectId":"0x9fcbd2c340fd715dc505f812287b057d60c852abc53f5b6c67ea3453a5f56f84","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
