  "abstract": "  We classify edge-to-edge tilings of the sphere by congruent pentagons with\nthe edge combination $a^4b$ and with any irrational angle in degree: they are\nthree $1$-parameter families of pentagonal subdivisions of the Platonic solids,\nwith $12, 24$ and $60$ tiles; and a sequence of $1$-parameter families of\npentagons admitting non-symmetric $3$-layer earth map tilings together with\ntheir various rearrangements under extra conditions. Their parameter moduli and\ngeometric data are all computed in both exact and numerical form. The total\nnumbers of different tilings for any fixed such pentagon are counted\nexplicitly. As a byproduct, the degenerate pentagons produce naturally many new\nnon-edge-to-edge quadrilateral tilings. A sequel of this paper will handle\n$a^4b$-pentagons with all angles being rational in degree by solving some\ntrigonometric Diophantine equations, to complete our full classification of\nedge-to-edge tilings of the sphere by congruent pentagons.\n",
