We present a comprehensive\napproach for leveraging these technologies to analyze genomic variants,\nspecifically in the context of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from COVID-19\npatient samples. The proposed method involves extracting variant-level genetic\ninformation, annotating the data with additional metadata using SnpEff, and\nconverting the enriched Variant Call Format (VCF) files into Resource\nDescription Framework (RDF) triples. The resulting knowledge graph is further\nenhanced with patient metadata and stored in a graph database, facilitating\nefficient querying and indexing. We utilize the Deep Graph Library (DGL) to\nperform graph machine learning tasks, including node classification with\nGraphSAGE and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). Our approach demonstrates\nsignificant utility using our proposed tool, VariantKG, in three key scenarios:\nenriching graphs with new VCF data, creating subgraphs based on user-defined\nfeatures, and conducting graph machine learning for node classification.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RQXJ9PMlKgRp1pAWTrpA55Nq9BmkxqU8AIsZZWj-MBw","pdfSize":"2556535"}
