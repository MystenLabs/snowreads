We demonstrate that moving away from an\nindependent-trajectory picture is the strategy which allows us to propose a\nrobust surface hopping scheme overcoming all these issues at once. Based on the\nexact factorization and on the idea of coupled trajectories, we consider the\nswarm of trajectories, that mimic the nuclear dynamics in nonadiabatic\nprocesses, as a unique entity. In this way, imposing energy conservation of the\nswarm and allowing the trajectories to share energy when hops occur clearly\nindicates the route towards a new surface hopping scheme. Encouraging results\nare reported, in terms of electronic and vibrational time-dependent properties\non the photodynamics of fulvene, modeled with a full-dimensional linear\nvibronic coupling Hamiltonian.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pWT17sBJIjWXWgwm9GBKtWQJ1D_xiT0gAyvOyZgcVJk","pdfSize":"9096198"}
