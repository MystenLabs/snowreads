  "abstract": "  Supersymmetric rotating 1/16-BPS black holes in $AdS_4 \\times S^7$ are\nexpected to capture the average degeneracy of BPS states in the dual ABJM\nsuperconformal theory for given fixed charges. This has been successfully\ndemonstrated for the superconformal index using complexified black hole\nmetrics, but a naive Gibbons-Hawking calculation of the actual degeneracies in\nthe low temperature limit is invalid due to large quantum fluctuations of the\nnear horizon $AdS_2$ metric. We argue that in a particular mixed\ngrand/canonical ensemble, these fluctuations of the near-BPS Kerr-Newman black\nholes are described by a version of the $\\mathcal{N}=2$ super-Schwarzian theory\nwith $SU(1,1|1)$ symmetry. Using this description as well as properties of\nABJM, we recover the large $N$ superconformal index and find a characteristic\n``mass gap'' of order $N^{-3/2}$ between the 1/16-BPS states and the lightest\nnear BPS state. We further make a prediction for the operator dimension\nspectrum above the gap in the large $N$, low $T$ limit. Our results are\nconsistent with the Bekenstein-Hawking formula at large energies, random matrix\ntheory at low energies, and the microscopic index.\n",
