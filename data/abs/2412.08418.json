Inspired by astronomical\nadaptive optics, the system uses a fiber-coupled 905 nm laser diode as a pilot\nbeam that allows for spectral separation, bypassing the constraints of pulsed\nlasers. A GPU-based controller, built on the open-source CACAO framework,\nmanages a loop comprising a bimorph deformable mirror and high-speed\nShack-Hartmann sensor. Initial tests showed excellent stability and effective\naberration correction. However, integration into the Apollon laser revealed\ncritical challenges unique to the laser environment that must be resolved to\nensure safe operation with amplified shots.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"fYuewWEq85No_PMMWK1VzD-daRdukM-BxPk7eGR1zKk","pdfSize":"4938544"}
