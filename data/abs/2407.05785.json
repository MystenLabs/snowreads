Using the\nlinear hydraulic fracture model which combines lubrication flow and linear\nelastic fracture mechanics, we demonstrate how different propagation regimes\nare related to the dominance of a given term of the power balance of a growing\nhydraulic fracture. Taking an energy point of view allows us to offer a\nphysical explanation of hydraulic fracture growth behaviours, such as, for\nexample, the transition from viscosity to toughness dominated growth for a\nradial geometry, fracture propagation after the end of the injection or\ntransition to self-buoyant elongated growth. We quantify the evolution of the\ndifferent power terms for a series of numerical examples. We also discuss the\norder of magnitudes of the different terms for a industrial-like hydraulic\nfracturing treatment accounting for the additional dissipation in the injection\nline.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"pSWUG_i6sEA3UayqyZjb1K9jCRT3u4jiAzIifnDdn1Q","pdfSize":"6309643"}
