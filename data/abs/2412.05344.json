  "abstract": "  We study a dynamic random utility model that allows for consumption\ndependence. We axiomatically analyze this model and find insights that allow us\nto distinguish between behavior that arises due to consumption dependence and\nbehavior that arises due to state dependence. As part of our analysis, we show\nthat it is impossible to distinguish between myopic and dynamically\nsophisticated agents when there are well defined marginal choices in each\nperiod. Building on our axiomatic analysis, we develop a revealed preference\ntest for consumption dependent random utility. Our test can be implemented with\nreal data, and we show that our test offers computational improvements over the\nnatural extension of Kitamura and Stoye (2018) to our environment.\n",
