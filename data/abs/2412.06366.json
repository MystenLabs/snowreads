  "abstract": "  We initiate a study of the quasisymmetric uniformization of naturally arising\nrandom fractals and show that many of them fall outside the realm of\nquasisymmetric uniformization to simple canonical spaces. We begin with the\ntrace, the graph of Brownian motion, and various variants of the\nSchramm-Loewner evolution $\\mathrm{SLE}_\\kappa$ for $\\kappa>0$, and show that\na.s. neither is a quasiarc. After that, we study the conformal loop ensemble\n$\\mathrm{CLE}_\\kappa$, $\\kappa \\in (\\frac{8}{3}, 4]$, and show that the\ncollection of all points outside the loops is a.s. homeomorphic to the standard\nSierpi\\'nski carpet, but not quasisymmetrically equivalent to a round carpet.\n",
