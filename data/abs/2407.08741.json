Consequently, smart lighting design is a rapidly\ngrowing research area. We describe a digital twin-based approach to smart\nlighting design that uses an immersive virtual reality digital twin equivalent\n(virtual environment) of the real world, physical architectural space to\nexplore the visual impact of light configurations. The CLIP neural network is\nused to obtain a similarity measure between a photo of the physical space with\nthe corresponding rendering in the virtual environment. A case study was used\nto evaluate the proposed design process. The obtained similarity value of over\n87% demonstrates the utility of the proposed approach.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Cp9LDfB4s7qI5xeGA0fPgJ9hyZmK6An-0XC_zwAygt4","pdfSize":"2806056"}
