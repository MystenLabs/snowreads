We consider\nthese issues specifically in the context of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and\nuse a more practical approach compared to mathematics literature, where the\nnumber of formulae may sometimes be overwhelming. We conducted a thorough\nliterature review both on the statistical properties of light-curve data,\nspecifically in the context of sampling effects, as well as on the methods used\nto analyse them. We simulated a wide range of data to test some of the known\nissues in AGN variability analysis as well as to investigate previously unknown\nor undocumented caveats. We discovered problems with some commonly used methods\nand confirmed how challenging it is to identify timescales from observed data.\nWe find that interpolation of a light curve with biased sampling, specifically\nwith bias towards flaring events, affects its measured power spectral density\nin a different manner than those of simulated light curves. We also find that\nan algorithm aiming to match the probability density function of a light curve\nhas often been used incorrectly. These new issues appear to have been mostly\noverlooked and not necessarily addressed before, especially in astronomy\nliterature.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VpvpVXwqt3oSuJU84TuY4rVI_gjUGWPW3O3WxDeg6us","pdfSize":"752474"}
