These contain precise\ninformation about the road network, geometry, condition, as well as traffic\nsigns. Despite their importance for the development and evaluation of driving\nfunctions, the generation of high-definition maps is still an ongoing research\ntopic. While previous work in this area has primarily focused on the accuracy\nof road geometry, we present a novel approach for automated large-scale map\ngeneration for use in industrial applications. Our proposed method leverages a\nminimal number of external information about the road to process LiDAR data in\nsegments. These segments are subsequently combined, enabling a flexible and\nscalable process that achieves high-definition accuracy. Additionally, we\nshowcase the use of the resulting OpenDRIVE in driving function simulation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xFG29TxhrAru62oZS5VPoPZa9Y40Pegbu0aw8rC4huk","pdfSize":"3949915"}
