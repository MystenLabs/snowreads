For the first time, the channel with\ndecays of the Z boson to muons or electrons in association with all-hadronic\ndecays of the $\\mathrm{t\\bar{t}}$ system is targeted. The analysis uses\nproton-proton collision data collected at the CERN LHC with the CMS experiment\nat $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, which correspond to an integrated luminosity of 138\nfb$^{-1}$. No signal is observed. Upper limits on the product of the cross\nsection and branching fractions are derived for narrow resonances A and H with\nmasses up to 2100 and 2000 GeV, respectively, assuming A boson production\nthrough gluon fusion. The results are also interpreted within two-Higgs-doublet\nmodels, complementing and substantially extending the reach of previous\nsearches.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yMpyBqUiSykZ2Bz8ys7S_ju1iS5zTs07lNvbigSrLTw","pdfSize":"6325495"}
