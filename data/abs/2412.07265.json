In particular,\nSaudi Arabia is gradually shifting its energy portfolio from an exclusive use\nof oil to a reliance on renewable energy, and, in particular, wind. Modeling\nwind for assessing potential energy output in a country as large,\ngeographically diverse and understudied as Saudi Arabia is a challenge which\nimplies highly non-linear dynamic structures in both space and time. To address\nthis, we propose a spatio-temporal model whose spatial information is first\nreduced via an energy distance-based approach and then its dynamical behavior\nis informed by a sparse and stochastic recurrent neural network (Echo State\nNetwork). Finally, the full spatial data is reconstructed by means of a\nnon-stationary stochastic partial differential equation-based approach. Our\nmodel can capture the fine scale wind structure and produce more accurate\nforecasts of both wind speed and energy in lead times of interest for energy\ngrid management and save annually as much as one million dollar against the\nclosest competitive model.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fUQCD-hLFiL19TO-zLW4pY0pvix2DwQrrAI2k05fGfg","pdfSize":"5566260"}
