In doing this, it is assumed that the $\\alpha$\nparticles interact with each other via the $S$-wave Ali-Bodmer potential\nincluding the Coulomb term, and the neutron-$\\alpha$ forces act only in the\n$P$-wave state. This wave function is constructed by trial and error method via\nsolving in this way a kind of inverse problem when the two-body $\\alpha\\alpha$\npotential is recovered from a postulated three-body wave function. As a result,\nthe wave function is an exact solution of the corresponding three-body\nSchr\\\"odinger equation for experimentally known binding energy and for the\n$\\alpha\\alpha$ potential whose difference from the Ali-Bodmer one is minimized\nby varying the adjustable parameters which the postulated wave function depends\non.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BlzxmGNZ6tdmRfkk7locrCguNfS4LnkdYmmeigSs0mQ","pdfSize":"294870"}
