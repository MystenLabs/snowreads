The proof of our main result utilizes the\nresolvent strategy and the Poisson flow strategy introduced in previous\nliteratures, where the duality relationship between the voter model and the\ncoalescing random walk plays the key role. For $d=2$ case, we give a conjecture\nabout an analogue result of our main theorem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"cFBpZjq5JojDO5aNyNUva8G7jVL2_9mXIVQkyHRMnUE","pdfSize":"479888"}
