  "abstract": "  By employing the total variation of certain functions, we give an explicit\nformula for the supremum of the set of all copulas with a given curvilinear\nsection. This supremum being a copula is characterized and the relationship\nbetween this supremum and that of the set of all quasi-copulas with the same\ncurvilinear section is considered.\n",
