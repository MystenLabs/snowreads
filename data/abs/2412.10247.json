We focus on the mechanics of a charged point-like particle\nmoving in a given gauge background. First, we derive explicit expressions for\ngauge-invariant variables representing the particle's position. Second, we\nprovide a detailed formulation of the classical action and the corresponding\nequations of motion, which recover standard relativistic dynamics in the\ncommutative limit. We illustrate our findings by exploring the exactly solvable\nKepler problem in the context of the $\\lambda$-Minkowski (or the angular)\nnon-commutativity, along with other examples.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CUJEmdYntAuwB3sDo9rQyNNi2dyQxfvNWH63BFUYISk","pdfSize":"912200"}
