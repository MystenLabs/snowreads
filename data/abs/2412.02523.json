In the rational case we extend work from $_2F_1$ to\n$_nF_{n-1}$ for an exact formula giving the density of bounded primes for the\nseries. The density is shown to be one exactly in accordance with the case of\nfinite monodromy as classified by Beukers-Heckmann. In the quadratic irrational\ncase, we obtain an unconditional lower bound on the density of bounded primes.\nAssuming the normality of the $p$-adic digits of quadratic irrationalities,\nthis lower bound is shown to be an exact formula for the density of bounded\nprimes. In the quadratic irrational case, there is a trivial upper bound of\n$1/2$ on the density of bounded primes. In the final section of the paper we\ndiscuss some results and computations on series that attain this bound. In\nparticular, all such examples we have found are associated to imaginary\nquadratic fields, though we do not prove this is always the case.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"t0xXmN0kat9RotDQu_qeJoRsA0OjD4if9oALTs7599U","pdfSize":"232179"}
