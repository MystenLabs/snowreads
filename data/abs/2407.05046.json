The variables space may be\ncontinuously partitioned into subsets where these variables are fixed to a\ngiven value, so that minimizing the objective function restricted to any of the\npartition sets is easier than minimizing the objective function over the whole\nvariables space. Then the major difficulty is translated from solving the\noriginal problem to choosing the partition set minimizing the minimum of the\nobjective function restricted to this set. Hence, a local solution to the\noriginal problem is given by computing this partition set and selecting the\nminimizer of the objective function restricted to this set. This work\nformalizes this framework, studies its theoretical guarantees, and provides a\nnumerical method to seek for an optimal partition set using a derivative-free\nalgorithm. Some illustrative problems are presented to show how to apply the\nPOf and to highlight the gain in numerical performance it provides.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kZ1GYXSiHv_IPn_RE4Fcc9SVDISpeUUemR_fllfMoLU","pdfSize":"2581493"}
