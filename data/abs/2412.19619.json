Due to the complex interactions between\nparticles and fluids, designing effective devices for particle flow processing\nis challenging. In this study, we propose a topology optimization method to\ndesign flow fields that effectively enhance the resistance encountered by\nparticles. Particle flow is simulated using an Eulerian-Eulerian model based on\na finite difference method. Automatic differentiation is implemented to compute\nsensitivities using a checkpointing algorithm. We formulate the optimization\nproblem as maximizing the variation of drag force on particles while reducing\nfluid power dissipation. Initially, we validate the finite difference flow\nsolver through numerical examples of particle flow problems and confirm that\nthe corresponding topology optimization produces a result comparable to the\nbenchmark problem. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of Reynolds and\nStokes numbers on the optimized flow field. The numerical results indicate that\nserpentine flow fields can effectively enhance the variation in particle drag\nforce.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QWhOgGoKT_TU-D0Lws4PbHH8drQnAFjFAbCs-ya9NiU","pdfSize":"1704552"}
