The second part deals with a semi\ndiscrete scheme, which is based on the coupling of discontinuous Galerkin\napproximations for the Vlasov and the Stokes equations for the 2D problem. The\nproposed method is both mass and momentum conservative. Based on a special\nprojection and also the Stokes projection, optimal error estimates in the case\nof smooth compactly supported initial data are derived. Moreover, the\ngeneralization of error estimates to 3D problem is also indicated. Finally,\nbased on time splitting algorithm, some numerical experiments are conducted\nwhose results confirm our theoretical findings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hADGTsFBvIw49EYE97PoWY1N7p6VCj92R-9o28IvbFM","pdfSize":"737462"}
