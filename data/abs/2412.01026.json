Our main results are a syntactic characterization of local\nfiniteness in varieties of $\\mathsf{M^{+}S4}$-algebras, where\n$\\mathsf{M^{+}S4}$ denotes the extension of $\\mathsf{MS4}$ by the Casari axiom,\nand $(\\mathsf{S4}[2] \\times \\mathsf{S5})$-algebras. For the latter, we\ndemonstrate that our methods cannot be extended beyond depth 2, as we give a\ntranslation of the fusion $\\mathsf{S5}_2$ into $\\mathsf{S4}[n] \\times\n\\mathsf{S5}$ for $n \\geq 3$ that preserves and reflects local finiteness,\nsuggesting that a characterization there is difficult. We also establish the\nfinite model property for some of these logics which are not known to be\nlocally tabular.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"b4d2Qzak-2UCRtGW-GEQWS8MYU2GSU5Ho4tWHUKmtto","pdfSize":"380380"}
