Here we examine the $s$-process element abundances in these systems\nusing data from GALAH DR3. Following refined sample analysis with parameter\nestimates based on GALAH spectra, we find a distinct locus where enhanced\n$s$-process elements depend on both the WD mass and metallicity, consistent\nwith loci identified in previous asymptotic giant branch (AGB) nucleosynthesis\nstudies with higher $s$-process yields. Notably, these enhanced abundances show\nno correlation with the systems' orbital parameters, supporting a history of\naccretion in intermediate-separation MS+WD systems. Consequently, our results\nform a direct observational evidence of a connection between AGB masses and\n$s$-process yields. We conclude by showing that the GALAH DR3 survey includes\nnumerous Ba dwarf stars, within and beyond the mass range covered in our\ncurrent sample, which can further elucidate $s$-process element distributions\nin MS+WD binaries.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"XEkPmdcWiAjXdxt6fpDlhu1FSpcoQ1hEiyMKrULS8lE","pdfSize":"1140266"}
