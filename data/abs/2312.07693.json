This paper\nintroduces a streamlined analytical framework that utilizes Large Language\nModels (LLMs), in this instance open-access generative pre-trained transformer\n(GPT) models, offering an efficient solution with deeper insights into\ncommunity dynamics. The framework aids moderators in identifying pseudonymous\nactor intent, moderating toxic behavior, rewarding desired actions to avoid\nunintended consequences of blockchain-based gaming, and gauging community\nsentiment as communities venture into metaverse platforms and plan for\nhypergrowth. This framework strengthens community controls, eases onboarding,\nand promotes a common moral mission across communities while reducing agency\ncosts by 95 pct. Highlighting the transformative role of generative AI, the\npaper emphasizes its potential to redefine the cost of cultural production. It\nshowcases the utility of GPTs in digital community management, expanding their\nimplications in cultural economics and transmedia storytelling.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Qf_4XyJrRqy8GXRjP_kJ1jWxEjz2d4N5btWSOPxlVx8","pdfSize":"456282"}
