  "abstract": "  The $B$-Mesogenesis model explains the matter-antimatter asymmetry and leads\nto the right amount of dark matter in the Universe. In particular, this model\npredicts new decay channels of the $b$ quark. We investigate the modification\nof inclusive $b$-hadron decay rates and of the lifetimes of different $B$\nmesons due to these new decay channels and compare our results with available\npredictions for exclusive $B$ meson decays. We find a small surviving parameter\nspace where the $B$-Mesogenesis model is working and which has not been\nexcluded by experiment. Experimental investigations in the near future should\nbe able to test this remaining parameter space and thus either exclude or\nconfirm the $B$-Mesogenesis model.\n",
