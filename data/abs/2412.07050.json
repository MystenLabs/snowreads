  "abstract": "  The integration of artificial intelligence [AI] into clinical trials has\nrevolutionized the process of drug development and personalized medicine. Among\nthese advancements, deep learning and predictive modelling have emerged as\ntransformative tools for optimizing clinical trial design, patient recruitment,\nand real-time monitoring. This study explores the application of deep learning\ntechniques, such as convolutional neural networks [CNNs] and transformerbased\nmodels, to stratify patients, forecast adverse events, and personalize\ntreatment plans. Furthermore, predictive modelling approaches, including\nsurvival analysis and time-series forecasting, are employed to predict trial\noutcomes, enhancing efficiency and reducing trial failure rates. To address\nchallenges in analysing unstructured clinical data, such as patient notes and\ntrial protocols, natural language processing [NLP] techniques are utilized for\nextracting actionable insights. A custom dataset comprising structured patient\ndemographics, genomic data, and unstructured text is curated for training and\nvalidating these models. Key metrics, including precision, recall, and F1\nscores, are used to evaluate model performance, while trade-offs between\naccuracy and computational efficiency are examined to identify the optimal\nmodel for clinical deployment. This research underscores the potential of\nAI-driven methods to streamline clinical trial workflows, improve\npatient-centric outcomes, and reduce costs associated with trial\ninefficiencies. The findings provide a robust framework for integrating\npredictive analytics into precision medicine, paving the way for more adaptive\nand efficient clinical trials. By bridging the gap between technological\ninnovation and real-world applications, this study contributes to advancing the\nrole of AI in healthcare, particularly in fostering personalized care and\nimproving overall trial success rates.\n",
