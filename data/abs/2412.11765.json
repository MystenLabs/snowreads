The gain mechanism derives from\ncorrelations developed within the decay medium rather than from stimulated\nemission as in lasing, so analog of this process should be possible for\nfermionic final states. We introduce here the concept of superradiant neutrino\nemission from a radioactive Bose Einstein condensate, which can form the basis\nfor a superradiant neutrino laser. A plausible experimental realization based\non a condensate of electron-capture isotope $^{83}$Rb could exhibit effective\nradioactive decay rates accelerated from 82 days to minutes in viably sized\nrubidium condensates of $10^{6}$ atoms.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Gdm5O1mXA32rB8ipve-sVCEEJUqIbdJQ4GClCyHqYVw","pdfSize":"353202"}
