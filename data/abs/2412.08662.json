To conduct the performance test of the\nBDC, the prototype BDC (pBDC) is manufactured and evaluated with the high\nenergy ion beams from HIMAC (Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba) facility\nin Japan. Two kinds of ion beams, 100 MeV proton, and 200 MeV/u $^{12}$C, have\nbeen utilized for this evaluation, and the track reconstruction efficiency and\nposition resolution have been measured as the function of applied high voltage.\nThis paper introduces the construction details and presents the track\nreconstruction efficiency and position resolution of pBDC.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Accelerator Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MMtqC8mmnPikMteip3zQUVb7AEDh5NMqozbCOpdEM3s","pdfSize":"13237725"}
