A common\nconsensus revolves around the necessity of aggregating extensive, high-quality\nannotated data. However, given the inherent challenges in annotating dense\ntasks in computer vision, such as object detection and segmentation, a\npractical strategy is to combine and leverage all available data for training\npurposes. In this work, we propose Plain-Det, which offers flexibility to\naccommodate new datasets, robustness in performance across diverse datasets,\ntraining efficiency, and compatibility with various detection architectures. We\nutilize Def-DETR, with the assistance of Plain-Det, to achieve a mAP of 51.9 on\nCOCO, matching the current state-of-the-art detectors. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on 13 downstream datasets and Plain-Det demonstrates strong\ngeneralization capability.
