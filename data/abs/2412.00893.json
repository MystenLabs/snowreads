  "abstract": "  We relate the Mahler measure of exact polynomials in arbitrary variables to\nthe Deligne cohomology of the Maillot variety using the Goncharov\npolylogarithmic complexes. In the four-variable case, we further study the\nrelationship between the Mahler measure and special values of $L$-functions of\n$K3$ surfaces. The method involves a construction of an element in the motivic\ncohomology of $K3$ surfaces. We apply our method to the exact polynomial\n$(x+1)(y+1)(z+1) + t$.\n",
