We have shown that\nthe model is a special case of Taylor's series after it was analysed using\nAdomian decomposition method and Caputo fractional derivative. By simulating\nthe series with some fractional orders, the results indicate that the greater\nthe fractional order of the model, the series values generated are greater as\nwell. Moreover, the series that is close to the real data is the one with a\nfractional order of $0.5$. Therefore, the growth model with a fractional order\nprovides more accuracy than a classical integer order.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"o07nfKzQJcJc0fKzwzzpKgKvC5Tr4yg38vTDxdPTEjY","pdfSize":"349318"}
