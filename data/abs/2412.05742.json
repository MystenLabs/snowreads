  "abstract": "  Configurable arrays of optically trapped Rydberg atoms are a versatile\nplatform for quantum computation and quantum simulation, also allowing\ncontrollable decoherence. We demonstrate theoretically, that they also enable\nproof-of-principle demonstrations for a technique to build models for open\nquantum dynamics by machine learning with artificial neural networks, recently\nproposed in [Mukherjee et al. [arXiv:2409.18822] (2024)]. Using the outcome of\nquantum transport through a network of sites that correspond to excited Rydberg\natoms, the multi-stage neural network algorithm successfully identifies the\nnumber of atoms (or nodes in the network), and subsequently their location. It\nfurther extracts an effective interaction Hamiltonian and decoherence operators\ninduced by the environment. To probe the Rydberg array, one initiates dynamics\nrepeatedly from the same initial state and then measures the transport\nprobability to an output atom. Large datasets are generated by varying the\nposition of the latter. Measurements are required in only one single basis,\nmaking the approach complementary to e.g. quantum process tomography. The cold\natom platform discussed in this article can be used to explore the performance\nof the proposed protocol when training the neural network with simulation data,\nbut then applying it to construct models based on experimental data.\n",
