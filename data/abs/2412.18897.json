We found two essential factors for generating such phase transitions:\nthe use of higher-order (triadic) interactions and the partial adaptation of a\nglobal order parameter acting on the triadic coupling. A compromise between the\ntwo factors may result in a double explosive transition. To reinforce numerical\nobservations, we employed the Ott--Antonsen ansatz. We observed that for a wide\nclass of hypergraphs, combining two elements can result in a double explosive\ntransition.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1gMyTUKZIM-EsJQTmLigts-H9s7IvdmVBSd9zkDHBJk","pdfSize":"1748517"}
