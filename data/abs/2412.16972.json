  "abstract": "  The properties of the neutron-rich isotope $^{78}$Ni, long postulated to be\ndoubly magic, have been extensively explored through recent experimental and\ntheoretical studies. Confirmations of robust shell closures at $Z=28$ and\n$N=50$ as well as hints of competing deformations in neighboring isotopes have\nbeen obtained. Innovations of a thick liquid hydrogen target system with vertex\nreconstructions and the in-beam $\\gamma$-ray spectroscopy technique have\nfacilitated detailed investigations into the nuclear structure of these extreme\nsystems. Proton knockout reactions conducted at relativistic energies have\nprovided the first experimental evidence of shape coexistence at the\ncornerstone nucleus $^{78}$Ni and its vicinity. As the nuclear structure around\n$^{78}$Ni influences the description of very neutron-rich systems and r-process\nnucleosynthesis, these findings underscore the importance of further\ninvestigations. This review encapsulates the recent results concerning the\nnuclear structure at the vicinity of $^{78}$Ni on both experimental and\ntheoretical aspects. It outlines prospective research directions that could\nfurther illuminate this complex and intriguing area of the nuclear chart.\n",
