The tensor networks are used to numerically calculate\nthe cumulant generating function of the current statistics. By comparing the\ncases whether the reaction is turned on or off, the influence of the reaction\non current fluctuations is clearly manifested, and this provides a numerical\nevidence of an interesting inequality setting an upper bound on the diffusivity\nin terms of the mean current and the driving force or affinity.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"aUbDo0mV6AzeesmMTcy-sMHrSlab_ffKEBOTjSUj2OY","pdfSize":"488813"}
