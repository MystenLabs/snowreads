  "abstract": "  We consider the weakening of Ramsey's theorem that arises from considering\nonly translation-invariant colourings of pairs, and show that this has the same\nstrength (both from the viewpoint of Reverse Mathematics and from the viewpoint\nof Computability Theory) as the \"adjacent Hindman's theorem\", proposed by L.\nCarlucci (Arch. Math. Log. 57 (2018), 381--359). We also investigate some\nhigher dimensional versions of both of these statements.\n",
