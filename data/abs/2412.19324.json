  "abstract": "  Recently proposed $SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ invariant $\\alpha$-attractor models have\nplateau potentials with respect to the inflaton and axion fields. The slope of\nthe potential in the inflaton direction is exponentially suppressed at large\nvalues of the inflaton field, but the slope of the potential in the axion\ndirection is double-exponentially suppressed. Therefore, the axion field\nremains nearly massless and practically does not change during inflation. The\ninflationary trajectory in such models is stable with respect to quantum\nfluctuations of the axion field. We show that isocurvature perturbations do not\nfeed into the curvature perturbations during inflation, and argue that such\ntransfer may remain inefficient at the post-inflationary stage.\n",
