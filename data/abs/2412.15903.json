Oxygen descumming and argon milling\nare standard in situ cleaning methods employed for device preparation. We\ninvestigated the impact of these techniques on tantalum superconducting thin\nfilms using scanning tunneling microscopy at millikelvin temperatures. We\ndemonstrate that these cleaning methods inadvertently introduce magnetic bound\nstates within the superconducting gap of tantalum, likely by oxygen impurities.\nThese bound states can be detrimental to superconducting qubit devices, as they\nadd to dephasing and energy relaxation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Sx0WlRhOz-X2hE7cjJPRswdwlDIAFWhwgEzHBuGHRaI","pdfSize":"5487069"}
