  "abstract": "  We propose a computationally straightforward test for the linearity of a\nspatial interaction function. Such functions arise commonly, either as\npractitioner imposed specifications or due to optimizing behaviour by agents.\nOur test is nonparametric, but based on the Lagrange Multiplier principle and\nreminiscent of the Ramsey RESET approach. This entails estimation only under\nthe null hypothesis, which yields an easy to estimate linear spatial\nautoregressive model. Monte Carlo simulations show excellent size control and\npower. An empirical study with Finnish data illustrates the test's practical\nusefulness, shedding light on debates on the presence of tax competition among\nneighbouring municipalities.\n",
