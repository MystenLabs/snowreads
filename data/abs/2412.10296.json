The\nidea is that by aligning the context of the research question with the value\njudgments inherent to its field, a certain statistical paradigm is warranted.\nThe essay delves into the decision-theoretic foundations of Bayesianism,\nevaluates its descriptive limitations as highlighted by the Ellsberg paradox,\nand examines the difficulty of comparing normative systems.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Other Statistics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"awkt65KrytPYmrnEZr3b9hPbFqDSjJkFaNNbikLpGd4","pdfSize":"149413"}
