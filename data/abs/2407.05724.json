A reduced order model\n(ROM) is designed in order to approximate the statistical properties of\nhigh-dimensional systems. The drift and diffusion coefficients of the ROM are\ninferred from state observations by solving appropriate least-squares problems.\nThe closeness of the ROM obtained by the presented approach to the intrusive\nROM obtained by the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method is\ninvestigated. Two generalisations of the snapshot-based dominant subspace\nconstruction to the stochastic case are presented. Numerical experiments are\nprovided to compare the developed approach to POD.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"kSE0kRXcVg6fYbhyxIzodIP2QwPyTp7tjA4Bi9Koxms","pdfSize":"335589"}
