  "abstract": "  Chimera states, marked by the coexistence of order and disorder in systems of\ncoupled oscillators, have captivated researchers with their existence and\nintricate patterns. Despite ongoing advances, a fully understanding of the\ngenesis of chimera states remains challenging. This work formalizes a\nsystematic method by evoking pattern formation theory to explain the emergence\nof chimera states in complex networks, in a similar way to how Turing patterns\nare produced. Employing linear stability analysis and the spectral properties\nof complex networks, we show that the randomness of network topology, as\nreflected in the localization of the graph Laplacian eigenvectors, determines\nthe emergence of chimera patterns, underscoring the critical role of network\nstructure. In particular, this approach explains how amplitude and phase\nchimeras arise separately and explores whether phase chimeras can be chaotic or\nnot. Our findings suggest that chimeras result from the interplay between local\nand global dynamics at different time scales. Validated through simulations and\nempirical network analyses, our method enriches the understanding of coupled\noscillator dynamics.\n",
