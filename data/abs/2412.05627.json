Its\nspecial values at odd integers greater than 1 are explicitly evaluated by\nBerndt in the real quadratic unit case. Later Arakawa generalized the formula\nto the arbitrary real quadratic number case. The purpose of this article is to\ngive a novel and surprisingly simple proof of the Berndt--Arakawa formula.\nNamely we prove a certain asymptotic identity for two finite cotangent\nDirichlet series, from which we deduce the Berndt--Arakawa formula immediately.\nThe authors believe that the method employed here of evaluating special values\nof infinite Dirichlet series from an asymptotic identity for its finite partial\nsum is of interest in its own right.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8UIpe1rAJt3C0AWOv3bHzl1mJhgb0HmBJ-cHH2LIwVY","pdfSize":"137741"}
