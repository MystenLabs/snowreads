The robustness of our method was\ntested by analyzing the impact of various design choices and hyperparameters on\nMolybdenum (Mo) SG-NNP performance during training and inference/simulation.\nWith less dimensions, SG-NNPs are shown to have superior atomic forces and\ntotal energy predictions than other traditional and ML descriptor-based\ninteratomic potentials on diverse set of materials - Ni, Cu, Li, Mo, Si, Ge,\nNiMo, Li3N and NbMoTaW. From the obtained results we can observe that the\nproposed method improves the performance of atomic descriptors of complex\nenvironments with multiple species.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YdnKyhrc6fiD3c7O2_7OA1834hZ7Gwgpipx3gG4QpKw","pdfSize":"905598"}
