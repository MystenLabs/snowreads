  "abstract": "  Motor imagery (MI) based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable the direct\ncontrol of external devices through the imagined movements of various body\nparts. Unlike previous systems that used fixed-length EEG trials for MI\ndecoding, asynchronous BCIs aim to detect the user's MI without explicit\ntriggers. They are challenging to implement, because the algorithm needs to\nfirst distinguish between resting-states and MI trials, and then classify the\nMI trials into the correct task, all without any triggers. This paper proposes\na sliding window prescreening and classification (SWPC) approach for MI-based\nasynchronous BCIs, which consists of two modules: a prescreening module to\nscreen MI trials out of the resting-state, and a classification module for MI\nclassification. Both modules are trained with supervised learning followed by\nself-supervised learning, which refines the feature extractors. Within-subject\nand cross-subject asynchronous MI classifications on four different EEG\ndatasets validated the effectiveness of SWPC, i.e., it always achieved the\nhighest average classification accuracy, and outperformed the best\nstate-of-the-art baseline on each dataset by about 2%.\n",
