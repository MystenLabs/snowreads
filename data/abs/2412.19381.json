  "abstract": "  Spatial imaging of magnetic stray fields from magnetic materials is a useful\ntool for identifying the underlying magnetic configurations of the material.\nHowever, transforming the magnetic image into a magnetization image is an\nill-poised problem, which can result in artefacts that limit the inferences\nthat can be made on the material under investigation. In this work, we develop\na neural network fitting approach that approximates this transformation,\nreducing these artefacts. Additionally, we demonstrate that this approach\nallows the inclusion of additional models and bounds that are not possible with\ntraditional reconstruction methods. These advantages allow for the\nreconstruction of non-trivial magnetization textures with varying magnetization\ndirections in thin-film magnets, which was not possible previously. We\ndemonstrate this new capability by performing magnetization reconstructions on\na variety of topological spin textures.\n",
