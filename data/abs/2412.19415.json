  "abstract": "  This paper addresses the Poisson $\\pi$ps sampling problem, a topic of\nsignificant academic interest in various domains and with practical data mining\napplications, such as influence maximization. The problem includes a set\n$\\mathcal{S}$ of $n$ elements, where each element $v$ is assigned a weight\n$w(v)$ reflecting its importance. The goal is to generate a random subset $X$\nof $\\mathcal{S}$, where each element $v \\in \\mathcal{S}$ is included in $X$\nindependently with probability $\\frac{c\\cdot w(v)}{\\sum_{v \\in \\mathcal{S}}\nw(v)}$, where $0<c\\leq 1$ is a constant. The subsets must be independent across\ndifferent queries. While the Poisson $\\pi$ps sampling problem can be reduced to\nthe well-studied subset sampling problem, updates in Poisson $\\pi$ps sampling,\nsuch as adding a new element or removing an element, would cause the\nprobabilities of all $n$ elements to change in the corresponding subset\nsampling problem, making this approach impractical for dynamic scenarios. To\naddress this, we propose a dynamic index specifically tailored for the Poisson\n$\\pi$ps sampling problem, supporting optimal expected $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ query\ntime and $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ index update time, with an optimal $\\mathcal{O}(n)$\nspace cost. Our solution involves recursively partitioning the set by weights\nand ultimately using table lookup. The core of our solution lies in addressing\nthe challenges posed by weight explosion and correlations between elements.\nEmpirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves significant\nspeedups in update time while maintaining consistently competitive query time\ncompared to the subset-sampling-based methods.\n",
