  "abstract": "  Quantum computing promises to revolutionize various fields, yet the execution\nof quantum programs necessitates an effective compilation process. This\ninvolves strategically mapping quantum circuits onto the physical qubits of a\nquantum processor. The qubits' arrangement, or topology, is pivotal to the\ncircuit's performance, a factor that often defies traditional heuristic or\nmanual optimization methods due to its complexity. In this study, we introduce\na novel approach leveraging reinforcement learning to dynamically tailor qubit\ntopologies to the unique specifications of individual quantum circuits, guiding\nalgorithm-driven quantum processor topology design for reducing the depth of\nmapped circuit, which is particularly critical for the output accuracy on noisy\nquantum processors. Our method marks a significant departure from previous\nmethods that have been constrained to mapping circuits onto a fixed processor\ntopology. Experiments demonstrate that we have achieved notable enhancements in\ncircuit performance, with a minimum of 20\\% reduction in circuit depth in 60\\%\nof the cases examined, and a maximum enhancement of up to 46\\%. Furthermore,\nthe pronounced benefits of our approach in reducing circuit depth become\nincreasingly evident as the scale of the quantum circuits increases, exhibiting\nthe scalability of our method in terms of problem size. This work advances the\nco-design of quantum processor architecture and algorithm mapping, offering a\npromising avenue for future research and development in the field.\n",
