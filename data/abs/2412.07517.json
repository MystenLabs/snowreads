This paper introduces\nFireFlow, a simple yet effective zero-shot approach that inherits the startling\ncapacity of ReFlow-based models (such as FLUX) in generation while extending\nits capabilities to accurate inversion and editing in $8$ steps. We first\ndemonstrate that a carefully designed numerical solver is pivotal for ReFlow\ninversion, enabling accurate inversion and reconstruction with the precision of\na second-order solver while maintaining the practical efficiency of a\nfirst-order Euler method. This solver achieves a $3\\times$ runtime speedup\ncompared to state-of-the-art ReFlow inversion and editing techniques, while\ndelivering smaller reconstruction errors and superior editing results in a\ntraining-free mode.
