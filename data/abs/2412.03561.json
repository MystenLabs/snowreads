  "abstract": "  CLIP has shown impressive results in aligning images and texts at scale.\nHowever, its ability to capture detailed visual features remains limited\nbecause CLIP matches images and texts at a global level. To address this issue,\nwe propose FLAIR, Fine-grained Language-informed Image Representations, an\napproach that utilizes long and detailed image descriptions to learn localized\nimage embeddings. By sampling diverse sub-captions that describe fine-grained\ndetails about an image, we train our vision-language model to produce not only\nglobal embeddings but also text-specific image representations. Our model\nintroduces text-conditioned attention pooling on top of local image tokens to\nproduce fine-grained image representations that excel at retrieving detailed\nimage content. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on both, existing\nmultimodal retrieval benchmarks, as well as, our newly introduced fine-grained\nretrieval task which evaluates vision-language models' ability to retrieve\npartial image content. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of FLAIR trained on 30M image-text pairs in capturing\nfine-grained visual information, including zero-shot semantic segmentation,\noutperforming models trained on billions of pairs.
