Therefore, this study explores the practices and\nchallenges faced by software practitioners in aligning with these principles.\nThrough semi-structured interviews with 25 practitioners, we investigated their\nmethods, concerns, and strategies for addressing Responsible AI in software\ndevelopment. Our findings reveal that while practitioners frequently address\nfairness, inclusiveness, and reliability, principles such as transparency and\naccountability receive comparatively less attention in their practices. This\nscenario highlights gaps in current strategies and the need for more\ncomprehensive frameworks to fully operationalize Responsible AI principles in\nsoftware engineering.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dvBsgLSqOtgDvG4Ev5Q4IamuZ3I6KgVI29Ooc7qn1WU","pdfSize":"109570"}
