The\ngenerated magnetic fields were thought to have an energy spectrum $\\propto k^3$\nfor small wavenumbers $k$, but here we show that it is actually a spectrum\n$\\propto k^4$ along with characteristic fluctuations in the magnetic helicity.\nUsing scaling results from MHD simulations for the evolution and assuming that\nthe initial magnetic field is coherent on the electroweak Hubble scale, we\nestimate the magnetic field strength to be $\\sim 10^{-13}\\, \\rmG$ on kpc scales\nat the present epoch for non-helical fields. For maximally helical fields we\nobtain $\\sim 10^{-10}\\, \\rmG$ on Mpc scales. We also give scalings of these\nestimates for partially helical fields.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TLaM5x1q3vzN43cCjlacuuT357FiStKmVDhQz_D_LtQ","pdfSize":"796161"}
