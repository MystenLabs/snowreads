In such networks it may be a feature that certain resources are\navailable only to priority users or at a higher user fee, as governed by a\nprotective agency overseeing the communication in the network. If the agency\nwants to restrict the general users to communicate by transmitting states that\nwe categorize as free states of a quantum resource theory (QRT), it may employ\nresource-destroying (RD) channels that do not affect the free states. Such\nchannels, however, only exist for the simplest of QRTs, putting fundamental\nlimitations on how quantum resources can be regulated. In this work, we go\nbeyond the present limitation by devising a nonlinear censorship protocol which\nmakes use of classical information about the transmitted state. We study the\nrequirement disabling malicious users from breaking the censorship. The\nprotocol can establish an unbreakable censorship of imaginarity and\nentanglement, while no such censorship can be made for quantum discord and Bell\nnonlocality.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AaIkvW-S1wammCyW-566cYB0UU5CSkhSHEVy-OywjlI","pdfSize":"397564"}
