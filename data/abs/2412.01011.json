This alternative, named e-fold\ncross validation, aims to minimize the number of folds to achieve a reduction\nin power usage while keeping the reliability and robustness of the test results\nhigh. We tested our method on 5 recommender system algorithms across 6 datasets\nand compared it with 10-fold cross validation. On average e-fold cross\nvalidation only needed 41.5% of the energy that 10-fold cross validation would\nneed, while it's results only differed by 1.81%. We conclude that e-fold cross\nvalidation is a promising approach that has the potential to be an energy\nefficient but still reliable alternative to k-fold cross validation.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"FsoeAGwDWl2fZSyj4cWaE9wQ-f8fFrqk_aKUDLHfP_Y","pdfSize":"412623"}
