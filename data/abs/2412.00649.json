  "abstract": "  This paper characterizes extreme points of the set of incentive-compatible\nmechanisms for screening problems with linear utility. Extreme points are\nexhaustive mechanisms, meaning their menus cannot be scaled and translated to\nmake additional feasibility constraints binding. In problems with\none-dimensional types, extreme points admit a tractable description with a\ntight upper bound on their menu size. In problems with multi-dimensional types,\nevery exhaustive mechanism can be transformed into an extreme point by applying\nan arbitrarily small perturbation. For mechanisms with a finite menu, this\nperturbation displaces the menu items into general position. Generic exhaustive\nmechanisms are extreme points with an uncountable menu. Similar results hold in\napplications to delegation, veto bargaining, and monopoly problems, where we\nconsider mechanisms that are unique maximizers for specific classes of\nobjective functionals. The proofs involve a novel connection between menus of\nextreme points and indecomposable convex bodies, first studied by Gale (1954).\n",
