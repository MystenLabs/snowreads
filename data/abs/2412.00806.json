We apply the\nframework to provide a comprehensive error analysis for the Embedded Trefftz\ndiscontinuous Galerkin method, for a wide range of second-order scalar elliptic\npartial differential equations and a scalar reaction-advection problem. We also\nanalyze quasi-Trefftz methods with our framework and build bridges to other\nmethods that are similar in virtue.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RkccFl7JXixi-52Si6-UPEmmPnT6bAFu9PekJ_iImWI","pdfSize":"1061437"}
