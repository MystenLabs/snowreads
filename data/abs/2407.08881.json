For any bound $B$, one can show that $\\dim\nS_k(\\Gamma_0(N),\\chi) \\le B$ for only finitely many triples $(N,k,\\chi)$. It\nturns out that this property does not extend to the newspace; there exists an\ninfinite family of triples $(N,k,\\chi)$ for which $\\dim\nS_k^{\\text{new}}(\\Gamma_0(N),\\chi) = 0$. However, we classify this case\nentirely. We also show that excluding the infinite family for which $\\dim\nS_k^{\\text{new}}(\\Gamma_0(N),\\chi) = 0$, $\\dim\nS_k^{\\text{new}}(\\Gamma_0(N),\\chi) \\leq B$ for only finitely many triples\n$(N,k,\\chi)$. In order to show these results, we derive an explicit dimension\nformula for the newspace $S_k^{\\text{new}}(\\Gamma_0(N),\\chi)$. We also use this\nexplicit dimension formula to prove a character equidistribution property and\ndisprove a conjecture from Greg Martin that $\\dim\nS_2^{\\text{new}}(\\Gamma_0(N))$ takes on all possible non-negative integers.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oIKQsKbhKidFavUxOz4B4RhgNSNQu-DMxHd6Qrj9DvI","pdfSize":"312305","objectId":"0xd637302a35fc0e07d804880bee2bfdf0cd990474e6159dd7a6e73b6a1ad19194","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
