It is also\nwidely applied as a model of light-matter interactions. In the conventional\ntreatment, the infinitesimal width of each kick allows an immediate integration\nof the equations of motion. This in turn allows a full description of the\ndynamics via a discrete mapping, the Standard Map, if one looks at the dynamics\nonly stroboscopically. It turns out that this model is only part of a much\nricher story if one accounts for finite temporal width of the kick. In this\nletter, we formulate a general model of finite-width periodic forcing and\nderive a continuous set of maps that depend on a parameter shift $\\Delta$ that\nallows one to capture the motion in both the driven and kicked regimes. The\nfixed points and symmetry of the mapping are shown analytically and numerically\nto depend on the value of the shift parameter.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"OnVAGNFVC5R2LFmzJZEm-WJlO2NLjR1XS0Dcfw_gVKs","pdfSize":"1563970"}
