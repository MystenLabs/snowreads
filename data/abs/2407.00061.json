We introduce the probabilistic\n  multi-Stirling numbers of the second kind associated with Y and the proba\nbilistic multi-Lah numbers associated with Y, both of indices (k1,k2,...,kr),\nby\n  means of the multiple logarithm. Those numbers are respectively probabilistic\n  extensions of the multi-Stirling numbers of the second kind and the multi-Lah\n  numbers which, for (k1,k2,...,kr) = (1,1,...,1), boil down respectively to\nthe\n  Stirling numbers of the second and the unsigned Lah numbers. The aim of this\n  paper is to study some properties, related identities, recurrence relations\nand\n  explicit expressions of those probabilistic extension numbers in connection\nwith\n  several other special numbers\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"JOxK1wus-2xaD5cuDQFflMr1cOJ0khsvfU718WLI1u0","pdfSize":"122889","objectId":"0x2096412819a2cc9c5ecb7cef2685b52bb64e2b7780de3274bc1d692ef239ee3a","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
