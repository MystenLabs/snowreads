Under the paradigm of MIL, patch\nimage representations are extracted and then fixed during the training of the\nMIL classifiers for efficiency consideration. However, the invariance of\nrepresentations makes it difficult to perform data augmentation for WSI-level\nmodel training, which significantly limits the performance of the downstream\nWSI analysis. The current data augmentation methods for gigapixel images either\nintroduce additional computational costs or result in a loss of semantic\ninformation, which is hard to meet the requirements for efficiency and\nstability needed for WSI model training. In this paper, we propose a Promptable\nRepresentation Distribution Learning framework (PRDL) for both patch-level\nrepresentation learning and WSI-level data augmentation. Meanwhile, we explore\nthe use of prompts to guide data augmentation in feature space, which achieves\npromptable data augmentation for training robust WSI-level models. The\nexperimental results have demonstrated that the proposed method stably\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wDKtg8BQnzNxa-ZnM7x2aCCrWLGHTqz1OjKlcxx5ZFo","pdfSize":"7483444"}
