  "abstract": "  We consider a class of 3d theories with a $\\mathbb Z_n$ magnetic symmetry in\nwhich confinement is generated by charge $n$ clusters of monopoles. Such\ntheories naturally arise in quantum antiferromagnets in 2+1, QCD-like theories\non $\\mathbb R^3 \\times S^1$, and $U(1)$ lattice theory with restricted monopole\nsums. A confining string fractionates into $n$ strings which each carry $1/n$\nelectric flux. We construct a twisted compactification (equivalently periodic\ncompactification with a topological defect insertion) on $\\mathbb R^2 \\times\nS^1$ that preserves the vacuum structure. Despite the absence of electric\ndegrees of freedom in the microscopic Lagrangian, we show that large Wilson\nloops are completely/partially screened for even/odd $n$, even when the\ncompactification scale is much larger than the Debye length. We show the\nemergence of fractional electric charges $(\\pm 2/n)$ at the junctions of the\ndomain lines and topological defects. We end with some remarks on screening vs.\nconfinement.\n",
