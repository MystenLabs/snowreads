Here, we show that a simple mean-field model involving two\nheterogenous populations of pulse-coupled oscillators, exhibits, in the\nstrong-coupling limit, a robust irregular macroscopic dynamics. The resulting,\nstrongly synchronized, regime is sustained by a homeostatic mechanism induced\nby the shape of the phase-response curve combined with adaptive coupling\nstrength, included to account for energy dissipated by the pulse emission. The\nproposed setup mimicks a neural network composed of excitatory and inhibitory\nneurons.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"P4a9_WdCyP5Hp4WkopVo9gpzm8Q-XRvAtMPS19hBb6o","pdfSize":"699372","objectId":"0xd290f11218bbabb2dde26402b5d79a609af50d6cfe4e3f4bcab60562bb4018e5","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
