Existing models in this area often fall short due to their\ndomain-specific nature and lack a strategy for integrating information from\nvarious sources in the absence of ground truth labels. Key challenges include\nevaluating the quality of different data sources and modeling spatial\nrelationships among them effectively. Addressing these issues, we introduce an\ninnovative multi-source spatial point data prediction framework that adeptly\naligns information from varied sources without relying on ground truth labels.\nA unique aspect of our method is the 'fidelity score,' a quantitative measure\nfor evaluating the reliability of each data source. Furthermore, we develop a\ngeo-location-aware graph neural network tailored to accurately depict spatial\nrelationships between data points. Our framework has been rigorously tested on\ntwo real-world datasets and one synthetic dataset. The results consistently\ndemonstrate its superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aSOHLopvEblGwEMx4faiBuQ3HnRNBy6kP6r3kcoFxig","pdfSize":"2425324"}
