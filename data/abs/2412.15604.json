The proposed adaptive\nvirtual impedance scheme is developed with the aid of a low bandwidth\ncommunication and a simple PI compensator to adaptively adjust the virtual\nimpedance value so that active and reactive power will be shared equally among\ninverters. Meanwhile, the DC offset in output voltage measurement is detected\nby using the voltage ripple information of DC link voltage of inverter. The\nproposed control strategy can be implemented directly without any pre-knowledge\nof the feeder impedances. The proposed compensation scheme is simple and easy\nto implement, and it also does not require extra hardware circuit or sensors.\nThe effectiveness of the proposed solution is verified by simulation and\nexperimental results of 6 kVA microgrid system.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computer Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"GWUgwXIrbh15OjBKc3uJ3OpJTZ_LNAXomup3kzQENJE","pdfSize":"1337809"}
