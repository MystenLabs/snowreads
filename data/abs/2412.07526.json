  "abstract": "  Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disorder and a leading\ncause of disability. Diagnosing OA severity typically requires expert\nassessment of X-ray images and is commonly based on the Kellgren-Lawrence\ngrading system, a time-intensive process. This study aimed to develop an\nautomated deep learning model to classify knee OA severity, reducing the need\nfor expert evaluation. First, we evaluated ten state-of-the-art deep learning\nmodels, achieving a top accuracy of 0.69 with individual models. To address\nclass imbalance, we employed weighted sampling, improving accuracy to 0.70. We\nfurther applied Smooth-GradCAM++ to visualize decision-influencing regions,\nenhancing the explainability of the best-performing model. Finally, we\ndeveloped ensemble models using majority voting and a shallow neural network.\nOur ensemble model, KneeXNet, achieved the highest accuracy of 0.72,\ndemonstrating its potential as an automated tool for knee OA assessment.\n",
