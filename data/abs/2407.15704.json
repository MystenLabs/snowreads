Based on our previous work on the\nTracy-Widom approach to the Janossy densities, we present analytic expressions\nfor the joint probability distribution of two consecutive eigenvalue spacings\nand the distribution of their ratio for the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) of\nrandom Hermitian $N\\times N$ matrices at $N\\to \\infty$, in terms of a system of\ndifferential equations. As a showcase of the efficacy of our results for\ncharacterizing an approach to quantum chaoticity, we contrast them to arguably\nthe most ideal of all quantum-chaotic spectra: the zeroes of the Riemann\n$\\zeta$ function on the critical line at increasing heights.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DJgFkmBFRsSwsl7pDCG49ng-_UjLSlf3EDzuaV8BJ_8","pdfSize":"1800030"}
