However, outcomes with heavy-tailed\ndistributions pose significant challenges to traditional statistical\napproaches. While recent studies have explored these issues under simple\nrandomization, their application in more complex randomization designs, such as\nstratified randomization or covariate-adaptive randomization, has not been\nadequately addressed. To fill the gap, this paper examines the properties of\nthe estimated influence function-based M-estimator under covariate-adaptive\nrandomization with heavy-tailed outcomes, demonstrating its consistency and\nasymptotic normality. Yet, the existing variance estimator tends to\noverestimate the asymptotic variance, especially under more balanced designs,\nand lacks universal applicability across randomization methods. To remedy this,\nwe introduce a novel stratified transformed difference-in-means estimator to\nenhance efficiency and propose a universally applicable variance estimator to\nfacilitate valid inferences. Additionally, we establish the consistency of\nkernel-based density estimation in the context of covariate-adaptive\nrandomization. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethods in finite samples.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"reofgFhE3juH9fN2wxHvfX0YpsbnQPccDSJcl5kBGsI","pdfSize":"878070"}
