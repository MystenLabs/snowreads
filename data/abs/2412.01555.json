  "abstract": "  Approximate Nearest Neighbor search is one of the keys to high-scale data\nretrieval performance in many applications. The work is a bridge between\nfeature extraction and ANN indexing through fine-tuning a ResNet50 model with\nvarious ANN methods: FAISS and Annoy. We evaluate the systems with respect to\nindexing time, memory usage, query time, precision, recall, F1-score, and\nRecall@5 on a custom image dataset. FAISS's Product Quantization can achieve a\nprecision of 98.40% with low memory usage at 0.24 MB index size, and Annoy is\nthe fastest, with average query times of 0.00015 seconds, at a slight cost to\naccuracy. These results reveal trade-offs among speed, accuracy, and memory\nefficiency and offer actionable insights into the optimization of feature-based\nimage retrieval systems. This study will serve as a blueprint for constructing\nactual retrieval pipelines and be built on fine-tuned deep learning networks\nand associated ANN methods.\n",
