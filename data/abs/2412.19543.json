  "abstract": "  Deep generative models are proficient in generating realistic data but\nstruggle with producing rare samples in low density regions due to their\nscarcity of training datasets and the mode collapse problem. While recent\nmethods aim to improve the fidelity of generated samples, they often reduce\ndiversity and coverage by ignoring rare and novel samples. This study proposes\na novel approach for generating diverse rare samples from high-resolution image\ndatasets with pretrained GANs. Our method employs gradient-based optimization\nof latent vectors within a multi-objective framework and utilizes normalizing\nflows for density estimation on the feature space. This enables the generation\nof diverse rare images, with controllable parameters for rarity, diversity, and\nsimilarity to a reference image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach both qualitatively and quantitatively across various datasets and GANs\nwithout retraining or fine-tuning the pretrained GANs.\n",
