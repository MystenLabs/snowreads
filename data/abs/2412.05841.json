Results indicate that implementing MMSE-based CPE\nestimation and compensation in 5G-NR mmWave systems reduced EVM from 7.4\\% to\n4.6\\% for 64QAM and from 5.4\\% to 4.3\\% for 256QAM, while also decreasing BER\nfrom $5.5 \\times 10^{-3}$ to $5.2 \\times 10^{-5}$ for 64QAM, demonstrating\nsignificant improvements in signal quality and reliability across various SNR\nlevels and antenna configurations. Our findings provide valuable insights for\noptimizing phase noise mitigation strategies in 5G-NR mmWave systems,\ncontributing to the development of more robust and efficient next-generation\nwireless networks.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MIEGeYUQsyKdQVm8igrkogA7DJx-BCqlYFNdUVLtIO8","pdfSize":"527565"}
