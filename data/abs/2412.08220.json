We\nestablish the well-posedness of the direct problem in the sense of\ntransposition and improved local regularity. Using classical unique\ncontinuation of the subdiffusion model and improved local solution regularity,\nwe prove the uniqueness of simultaneously recovering the locations of point\nsources, time-dependent strengths and initial condition for both one- and\nmulti-dimensional cases. Moreover, in the one-dimensional case, the elliptic\noperator can have time-dependent coefficients. These results extend existing\nstudies on point source identification for parabolic type problems.\nAdditionally we present several numerical experiments to show the feasibility\nof numerical reconstruction.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"FVc18_HNsTxRk-WllNxUgABWRwn46wCwD1eX30yDsHA","pdfSize":"5987636"}
