We propose and analyze an all-optical resource-efficient scheme for the\nnext-generation DQS systems. Our method utilizes phase-sensitive optical\nparametric amplifiers and linear interferometers and achieves the sensitivity\nclose to the optimal limit, as determined by the quantum Fisher information of\nthe entangled resource state. Furthermore, it utilizes high-gain OPA-assisted\ndetection, offering critical advantages of increased bandwidth and loss\ntolerance, in contrast to conventional methods employing balanced homodyne\ndetection (BHD). We show the efficacy of our proposal for displacement sensing\nand show its loss tolerance against high levels of photon loss, thus\ncircumventing the major obstacle in current BHD-based approaches. Our\narchitectural analysis shows that our scheme can be realized with current\nquantum photonic technology\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nkC6ceeHv9GF2XwTGkRCopDhmbSempem_BiKk_uUnzY","pdfSize":"3155140","objectId":"0xf973c016166c7ba6abbb7b04c893cad7cf86178e5ee03306460efce9f1678c88","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
