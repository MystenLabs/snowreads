I show that $\\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ symmetry remains broken in\nthe $\\mathrm{SU}(2)_A$ symmetric phase if the spectral density\n$\\rho(\\lambda;m)$ develops a singular near-zero peak, tending to\n$O(m^4)/\\lambda$ in the chiral limit. Moreover, $\\mathrm{SU}(2)_A$ restoration\nrequires that the number of modes in the peak be proportional to the\ntopological susceptibility, indicating that such a peak must be of topological\norigin.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SyKwpN_8MnCeJBNNQEj90TcEinw-5MKmuS2ANWMQPnA","pdfSize":"203251"}
