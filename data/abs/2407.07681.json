The consequence\nis that the temporal resolution has to be sacrificed. In order to improve\ntemporal resolution and ensure localization accuracy, we propose a method,\nSH-CS, based on light needle excitation, detection system with single\nhelix-point spread function (SH-PSF), and compressed sensing (CS). Although the\nSH-CS method still has a limitation about the molecule density, it is suited\nfor relatively dense molecules. For each light needle scanning position, an SH\nimage of excited molecules is processed with CS algorithm to decode their axial\ninformation. Simulations demonstrated, for random distributed 1 ~ 15 molecules\nin depth range of 4 {\\mu}m, the axial localization accuracy is 12.1 nm ~ 73.5\nnm. The feasibility of this method is validated by experimental data.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"bBKIAJ6vBZ8MRo4Jovv_prcgZEWTLfwOz8CLWjiSgUw","pdfSize":"1367637"}
