Such a\nutility depends on unrealized potential outcomes, and we show how this yields a\nparadoxical decision recommendation in a simple hypothetical example involving\ngames of Russian roulette. The problem is resolved if we allow the potential\noutcomes to be random variables. This leads us to conclude that, if you are\ninterested in this sort of asymmetric utility function, you need to move to the\nstochastic potential outcome framework. We discuss the implications of the\nchoice of parameterization in this setting.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Other Statistics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PVjByD5T8mdQgcrysVHf6p6j6o7Gd4rUSMPbnEDOZHc","pdfSize":"105330"}
