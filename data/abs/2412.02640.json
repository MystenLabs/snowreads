Recent advances have introduced an algorithmic\nformulation for constructing some of the tightest confidence sequences for\nbounded real random variables. These approaches use a coin-betting framework,\nwhere a player sequentially bets on differences between potential mean values\nand observed data. This letter establishes that such coin-betting formulation\nis optimal among all possible algorithmic frameworks for constructing\nconfidence sequences that build on e-variables and sequential hypothesis\ntesting.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"X1JDfCwT5jj7_k-GzVyN4vW2hg_ElY9kH9eJeK0qbJM","pdfSize":"162618"}
