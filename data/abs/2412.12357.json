  "abstract": "  The classical Thistlethwaite theorem for links can be phrased as asserting\nthat the Kauffman bracket of a link can be obtained from an evaluation of the\nBollob\\'as-Riordan polynomial of a ribbon graph associated to one of the link's\nKauffman states. In this paper, we extend this result to knotoids, which are a\ngeneralization of knots that naturally arises in the study of protein topology.\nSpecifically we extend the Thistlethwaite theorem to the twisted arrow\npolynomial of knotoids, which is an invariant of knotoids on compact, not\nnecessarily orientable, surfaces. To this end, we define twisted knotoids,\nmarked ribbon graphs, and their arrow- and Bollob\\'as-Riordan polynomials. We\nalso extend the Thistlethwaite theorem to the loop arrow polynomial of knotoids\nin the plane, and to spherical linkoids.\n",
