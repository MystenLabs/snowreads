We simulate filamentary conduction in $HfO_2$ by creating an\natomically thin O atom vacancy path inside $HfO_2$. We show that this\natomically thin filament leads to a great reduction of the resistance of the\nstructures. Moreover, we explore the possibility of the influence of O excess\ninside the CMO on the global resistance of the device and confirm the induced\nmodulation. We also shed the light on two possible causes for the observed\nincreas in the resistance when O atoms are inserted inside the CMO. Eventually,\nwe push forward key differences between devices with TaO and TiO as CMO. We\nshow that structures with TaO are more stable in general and lead to a\nbehaviour implying only low and high resistance (two well separated levels)\nwhile structures with TiO allows for intermediate resistances.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"WVnIGZJ3cWvXyjaYCvI65AL2rZ0RjM0ZMAg9TZUycIk","pdfSize":"4199440"}
