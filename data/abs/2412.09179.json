  "abstract": "  Motivated by experimental data at large momentum transfer we update the\nanalysis of the two-photon exchange effect in the electron-nucleon scattering\nusing the effective field theory formalism. Our approach is suitable for\ndescribing the hard region, where the hadronic model calculations are not\naccurate enough. We improve the estimates of various long-range matrix elements\nand discuss the obtained numerical effects for the unpolarised elastic cross\nsection. Assuming a linear behaviour of the reduced cross section with respect\nto the photon polarisation, we show that the obtained description allows us to\nresolve the form factor discrepancy for $Q^2=2.5-3.5$GeV$^2$. However, the\neffect obtained is quite small for higher values of $Q^2$. It is possible that\nnonlinear effects may be important in understanding the discrepancy in this\nregion. Estimates of the elastic electron-neutron cross section in the region\nare also performed. The obtained TPE effects are sufficiently large and must be\ntaken into account.\n",
