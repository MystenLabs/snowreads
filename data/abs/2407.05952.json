Existing methods rely on either of the approaches and are\nconstrained by their respective limitations. Textual reasoning excels in\nsemantic interpretation unlike symbolic reasoning (SQL logic), but falls short\nin mathematical reasoning where SQL excels. In this paper, we introduce a novel\nalgorithm H-STAR, comprising table extraction and adaptive reasoning,\nintegrating both symbolic and semantic (text-based) approaches. To enhance\nevidence extraction, H-STAR employs a multi-view approach, incorporating\nstep-by-step row and column retrieval. It also adapts reasoning strategies\nbased on question types, utilizing symbolic reasoning for quantitative and\nlogical tasks, and semantic reasoning for direct lookup and complex lexical\nqueries. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that H-STAR significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods across three tabular question-answering\n(QA) and fact-verification datasets, underscoring its effectiveness and\nefficiency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"ZXxES1VNRIH-x0Fp3EMXj9LSW9lSAtcuGJVlOetSpNM","pdfSize":"902171"}
