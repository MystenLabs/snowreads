In\nconjunction, these properties allow to construct a well defined kinematical\nquantization of the holonomy flux-algebra on top of which the remaining\nconstraints can be implemented. While this idea has traditionally been mainly\nused for Einstein gravity, any gravitational theory with the above properties\ncan be accommodated. In this paper, we are going to review three strands of\nwork building on this observation, namely the study of higher-dimensional loop\nquantum gravity, supersymmetric extensions of loop quantum gravity, as well as\nthe quantization of modified gravitational theories.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"F9WgWpkwznyiIkqiBNPkMgXBCP2BAR2Ybylots56Ri4","pdfSize":"458282"}
