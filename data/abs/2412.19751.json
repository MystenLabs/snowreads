Because of the gauge\nsinglet nature, the production of RHNs at the LHC is typically suppressed by\nthe tiny light-heavy neutrino mixing angles. In this study, we explore a\npromising scenario where the presence of an LQ mediator significantly enhances\nRHN production. We focus on first-generation scalar and vector LQs interacting\nwith the first-generation RHN. The prospects are better for the\nfirst-generation scenario than the other generations because of the enhanced\nparton distribution functions (PDFs) of first-generation quarks. The enhanced\nPDFs boost the production cross sections of LQs, particularly their single and\nindirect productions. Incorporating all production modes of LQs that result in\na pair of RHNs, we estimate the discovery prospects by analysing the\nmonoelectron and dielectron channels arising from the decay of the RHN pair. We\nfind that the indirect production of LQs is crucial in determining the\ndiscovery reach at the HL-LHC for the first-generation scenario.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"b75INdqLAZJESZW0QGbEIKclmu-UlnM6LC1tq_T-92o","pdfSize":"2270516"}
