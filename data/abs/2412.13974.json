  "abstract": "  In light of Kim's conjecture on regular polytopes of dimension four, which is\na generalization of Waring's problem, we establish asymptotic formulas for\nrepresenting any sufficiently large integer as a sum of numbers in the form of\nthose regular 4-polytopes. Moreover, we are able to obtain a more general\nresult of the asymptotics for any degree-four polynomial $f$ satisfying\n$f(0)=0$ and $f(1)=1$.\n",
