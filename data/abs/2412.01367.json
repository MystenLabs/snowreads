This result has no analogue in parameter-driven models,\nas it exploits the different structure of the score-driven factor dynamics.\nConsequently, score-driven models offer a clear advantage in terms of economic\ninterpretability compared to parameter-driven factor models, which are\nidentifiable only up to orthogonal transformations. Our restrictions are\norder-invariant and can be generalized to scoredriven factor models with\ndynamic loadings and nonlinear factor models. We test extensively the\nidentification strategy using simulated and real data. The empirical analysis\non financial and macroeconomic data reveals a substantial increase of\nlog-likelihood ratios and significantly improved out-of-sample forecast\nperformance when switching from the classical restrictions adopted in the\nliterature to our more flexible specifications.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kmJveEizIfnjDfh_RoyudA8P4ZodMN00LEqkidZcZj4","pdfSize":"3378642"}
