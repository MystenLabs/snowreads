Our technique introduces a strategy that combines\nnon-differentiable computation of hyperplane intersection through duality\ntransform with differentiable optimization for vertex positioning with\nthree-plane intersection, enabling gradient-based optimization without the need\nfor 3D implicit fields. This allows for efficient shape representation across a\nrange of applications, from shape parsing to compact mesh reconstruction. This\nwork not only overcomes the challenges of previous approaches but also sets a\nnew standard for representing shapes with convex polyhedra.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Graphics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dewPGNICcsiu6gohN38mmqRU5B_9-Xl4FbRU23TmmeQ","pdfSize":"20081906"}
