Yet, while previous work in the HRI community\nmeasured perceptions of human autonomy, there is little work on measuring\nperceptions of robot autonomy. In this paper, we present our progress toward\nthe creation of the Robot Autonomy Perception Scale (RAPS): a theoretically\nmotivated scale for measuring human perceptions of robot autonomy. We\nformulated a set of fifteen Likert scale items that are based on the definition\nof autonomy from Beer et al.'s work, which identifies five key autonomy\ncomponents: ability to sense, ability to plan, ability to act, ability to act\nwith an intent towards some goal, and an ability to do so without external\ncontrol. We applied RAPS to an experimental context in which a robot\ncommunicated with a human teammate through different levels of Performative\nAutonomy (PA): an autonomy-driven strategy in which robots may \"perform\" a\nlower level of autonomy than they are truly capable of to increase human\nsituational awareness. Our results present preliminary validation for RAPS by\ndemonstrating its sensitivity to PA and motivate the further validation of\nRAPS.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xfy75ThitfN_Fj36JFJWgVwqiSdSk2rQXZaUGMJ9f7Q","pdfSize":"242779"}
