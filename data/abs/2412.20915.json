  "abstract": "  We analyze oriented Riemannian 4-manifolds whose Weyl tensors $W$ satisfy the\nconformally invariant condition $W(T,\\cdot,\\cdot,T) = 0$ for some nonzero\nvector $T$. While this can be algebraically classified via $W$'s normal form,\nwe find a further geometric classification by deforming the metric into a\nLorentzian one via $T$. We show that such a $W$ will have the analogue of\nPetrov Types from general relativity, that only Types I and D can occur, and\nthat each is completely determined by the number of critical points of $W$'s\nassociated Lorentzian quadratic form. A similar result holds for the Lorentzian\nversion of this question, with $T$ timelike.\n",
