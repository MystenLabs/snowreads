We develop a technique that, when applicable, enables us to characterize\nthe global minimizer of $\\mathbb{D}(u)$ in $A$ as the unique global minimizer\nof the associated functional $F(u):=\\mathbb{D}(u)+ \\int_{\\Omega} f(x) \\, \\det\n\\nabla u(x) \\, dx$ in the free class $H^1_{u_0}(\\Omega;\\mathbb{R}^2)$. A key\ningredient is the mean coercivity of $F(\\varphi)$ on\n$H^1_0(\\Omega;\\mathbb{R}^2)$, which condition holds provided the `pressure' $f\n\\in L^{\\infty}(\\Omega)$ is `tuned' according to the procedure set out in\n\\cite{BKV23}. The explicit examples to which our technique applies can be\ninterpreted as solving the sort of constrained minimization problem that\ntypically arises in incompressible nonlinear elasticity theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1sx2RlQTdCsRVo-AUnD0G7BGQGi4QTFgEO9AZZiT13o","pdfSize":"1116715"}
