Considering the interference effect between $\\rho(770)^0$\nand $f_0(500)$, we utilize the experimentally more direct event yields for\nfitting and get the soft rescattering parameters $|\\rho_k^{SP}|=3.29\\pm1.01$\nand $|\\rho_k^{PS}|=2.33\\pm0.73$ in $B\\rightarrow PS$ and $B\\rightarrow SP$\ndecays ($P$ and $S$ denote pseudoscalar and scalar mesons, respectively),\nrespectively. We also study the branching ratios and $CP$ asymmetries in the\ndecay modes involving other scalar mesons, including $f_0(980)$, $a_0(980)$,\n$a_0(1450)$ and $K_0^*(1430)$, to test the rationality of the values of\n$|\\rho_k^{SP}|$ and $|\\rho_k^{PS}|$. Meanwhile, the wealth of experimental data\nfacilitate the examination of the forward-backward asymmetry induced $CP$\nasymmetries (FB-CPAs), and the localized $CP$ asymmetries (LACPs). We\ninvestigate these asymmetries resulting from the interference between\n$\\rho(770)^0$ and $f_0(500)$ for $B^\\pm\\rightarrow \\pi^\\pm\\pi^+\\pi^-$ and\n$B^\\pm\\rightarrow K^\\pm\\pi^+\\pi^-$ decays when the invariant mass of\n$\\pi^+\\pi^-$ locates in the low-energy region\n$0.445\\mathrm{GeV}<m_{\\pi\\pi}<0.795\\mathrm{GeV}$. Our theoretical results of\nFB-CPAs and LACPs align with the experimental findings. We propose that the\ninterference between $\\rho(770)^0$ and $f_0(500)$ can be extended to other\nbeauty and charmed mesons decays.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"AhGt9HF8eS4SnjTjkUleg3wn4AJNMuLatjS6mbJWTL4","pdfSize":"651040"}
