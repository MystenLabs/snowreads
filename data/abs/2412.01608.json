We test the accuracy of our method and fix conventions\nthrough a computation of bounds on the OPE coefficients for low-lying operators\nin the free fermion, free scalar, and generalised free vector field theories.\nWe then compute new OPE bounds for scalar operators in the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa\nmodel, $O(2)$ model, and large $N$ limit of the $O(N)$ model. Additionally, we\npresent a number of exclusion plots for such 3d CFTs. In particular, we look at\nthe space of even and odd parity scalar operators in the low-lying spectrum\nthat are compatible with crossing symmetry. As well as recovering the known\ntheories, there are some kinks that indicate new unknown theories.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GQ5eKJxfdfr3df_bCfb6NqjaS9yAPsaKCyLkKWUeAVA","pdfSize":"804801"}
