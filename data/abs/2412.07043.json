In doing\nso, we determine the probability of a higher-order transition state from\n$\\nu_\\tau\\rightarrow\\nu_\\lambda$, where $\\nu_\\lambda$ represents a more massive\ngeneration than Standard Model neutrinos. We first calculate an approximate\ncross section for high-energy neutrinos which allows us to formulate\ncomparisons for the oscillation distances of solar, supernova and higher-energy\ncosmic ray neutrinos. The flavor distributions of the resulting neutrino\npopulations from each source detected at Earth are then compared via fractional\ndensity charts.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"x5vO2ZnaZk8N5BHsoEbc5kc3fjsgMsO7zkLPVwG5KOI","pdfSize":"837654"}
