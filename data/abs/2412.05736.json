  "abstract": "  For highly skewed or fat-tailed distributions, mean or median-based methods\noften fail to capture the central tendencies in the data. Despite being a\nviable alternative, estimating the conditional mode given certain covariates\n(or mode regression) presents significant challenges. Nonparametric approaches\nsuffer from the \"curse of dimensionality\", while semiparametric strategies\noften lead to non-convex optimization problems. In order to avoid these issues,\nwe propose a novel mode regression estimator that relies on an intermediate\nstep of inverting the conditional quantile density. In contrast to existing\napproaches, we employ a convolution-type smoothed variant of the quantile\nregression. Our estimator converges uniformly over the design points of the\ncovariates and, unlike previous quantile-based mode regressions, is uniform\nwith respect to the smoothing bandwidth. Additionally, the Convolution Mode\nRegression is dimension-free, carries no issues regarding optimization and\npreliminary simulations suggest the estimator is normally distributed in finite\nsamples.\n",
