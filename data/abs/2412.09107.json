Call $R_q(a,d)$\nthis set. We show the existence or non-existence of the density of $R_q(a,d)$\nfor three distinct notions of density. In particular, the sets $R_q(a,d)$ have\na Dirichlet density. Under some assumptions, we prove simple formulas for the\ndensity values.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Lol5W9JRUOmyCJy__37hBVoDSeNjVAsOwvSHk9amweQ","pdfSize":"298825"}
