The distributional\ntreatment effect provides a more comprehensive understanding of treatment\neffects by characterizing heterogeneous effects across individual units, as\nopposed to relying solely on the average treatment effect. To enhance the\nprecision of distributional treatment effect estimation, we propose a\nregression adjustment method that utilizes the distributional regression and\npre-treatment information. Our method is designed to be free from restrictive\ndistributional assumptions. We establish theoretical efficiency gains and\ndevelop a practical, statistically sound inferential framework. Through\nextensive simulation studies and empirical applications, we illustrate the\nsubstantial advantages of our method, equipping researchers with a powerful\ntool for capturing the full spectrum of treatment effects in experimental\nresearch.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"2T6LtGB_xcCG8cOne6VAiN1uHWJyyJTCVl723uPHpCc","pdfSize":"715998"}
