While\nsubstantial research has focused on quantitatively analyzing complex behavioral\npatterns, characterizing these dynamics aiming for inclusive comparison to the\nbehavior of living systems remains challenging. In this study, we\nexperimentally and numerically investigated the 'life-like' behavior of an oil\ndroplet in an aqueous surfactant solution by identifying behavioral modes of\nspontaneous motion patterns in response to varying physical parameters, such as\nvolume and oil concentration. Leveraging data-driven nonparametric dynamical\nsystems analysis, we discovered the low dimensionality and nonlinearity of the\nunderlying dynamical system governing oil droplet motion. Notably, our\nsimulations demonstrate that the two-dimensional Langevin equations effectively\nreproduce the overall behavior experimentally observed while retaining the\nrational correspondence with physical parameter interpretations. These findings\nnot only elucidate the fundamental dynamics governing the spontaneous motion of\noil droplet systems but also suggest potential pathways for developing more\ndescriptive models that bridge the gap between nonliving and living behaviors.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BUqWJ4FY_RjFeprDHUUUdpS2w3o50o0RxRBfAxVDSIQ","pdfSize":"2927874"}
