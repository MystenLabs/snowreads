We establish Lipschitz stability\nestimates in L^2 norm for the source in terms of the solution and/or its normal\nderivative on a connected component of the boundary. The main tools are\nrepresented by: appropriate Carleman estimates in L^2 norms, with boundary\nobservations, and positivity improving properties for the solutions to\nparabolic equations and systems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wkwDNPIdtiITchlSB70cKnU_ZC8rSAcavVZxnKK7hPs","pdfSize":"282848"}
