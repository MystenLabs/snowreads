The process is\nindexed by functions $f$ from a class $\\mathcal{H}$, but the supremum over\n$f\\in $ $\\mathcal{H}$ is taken outside the probability. This form is a\nprerequisite for the Koml\\'{o}s-Major-Tusn\\'{a}dy inequality in the space of\nbounded functionals $l^{\\infty }(\\mathcal{H})$, but contrary to the latter it\nessentially preserves the classical $n^{-1/2}\\log n$ approximation rate over\nlarge functional classes $\\mathcal{H}$ such as the H\\\"{o}lder ball of\nsmoothness $1/2$. This specific form of a strong approximation is useful for\nproving asymptotic equivalence of statistical experiments.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"MSmq4AKb1bLp5gpAMJX5dpvac5FUNalIgDRQg67Kf0s","pdfSize":"359225"}
