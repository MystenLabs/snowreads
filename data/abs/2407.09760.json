Our approach combines state-of-the-art multi-modal models,\nincluding Language Model (LM) and Large Vision Language Model (LVLM), to\nachieve superior performance. By leveraging these models, we outperform\nexisting benchmarks, securing the top rank in the ICCV23 Visual-Dialog Based\nEmotion Explanation Generation Challenge, which is part of the 5th Workshop On\nClosing The Loop Between Vision And Language (CLCV) with significant scores in\nF1 and BLEU metrics. Our method demonstrates exceptional ability in generating\naccurate emotion explanations, advancing our understanding of emotional impacts\nin art.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"F8fP49eUs_a59UMPFAH3sckCyzVHyPNpaxEKx7FgU7E","pdfSize":"1392333"}
