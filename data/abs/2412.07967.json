We describe the early stage in terms of\nan evolving $SU(3)$ glasma stage, that is dominated by intense,\nout-of-equilibrium gluon fields. On top of these fields, we liberate heavy\nquark-antiquark pairs, whose constituents are let evolve according to\nrelativistic kinetic theory coupled to the gluon fields. We define a\npair-by-pair probability that the pair melts during the evolution, which we\nrelate to the relative distance between the two particles in the pair, as well\nas to the fluctuations of the color charges induced by the interaction of the\nquarks with the gluon fields. We find that the fluctuations of the color\ncharges favor the melting of the pairs. Moreover, we estimate that within $0.2$\nfm/c of proper time, measured with respect to the formation time of the pairs,\nabout the $50\\%$ of $c\\bar c$ and $b\\bar b$ pairs melt as a result of the\ndiffusion of the heavy quarks in the gluon fields; this time estimate doubles\nwhen color fluctuations are neglected.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"V-hDiYMkK-pHKkbBke3D68LZVRW-QQd-1JZgS50vO7A","pdfSize":"836314"}
