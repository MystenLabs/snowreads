By examining these models under various market conditions, we\nhighlight their accuracy, robustness, and adaptability to the volatile\ncryptocurrency market. Our comprehensive analysis reveals the strengths and\nlimitations of each model, providing critical insights for developing effective\ntrading strategies. We employ both machine learning metrics (e.g., Mean\nAbsolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error) and trading metrics (e.g., Profit and\nLoss percentage, Sharpe Ratio) to assess model performance. Our evaluation\nincludes backtesting on historical data, forward testing on recent unseen data,\nand real-world trading scenarios, ensuring the robustness and practical\napplicability of our models. Key findings demonstrate that certain models, such\nas Random Forest and Stochastic Gradient Descent, outperform others in terms of\nprofit and risk management. These insights offer valuable guidance for traders\nand researchers aiming to leverage machine learning for cryptocurrency trading.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Trading and Market Microstructure","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kdQNjX_0223YG6zCkFufQsXmArZRctdLKVu4AvAOTE0","pdfSize":"368373","objectId":"0xbb6bf1f698b4aca64a1d34110b1ce7b2016e2be242fb0a908c95b8bf0e232cfd","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
