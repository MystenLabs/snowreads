Malomed","authorsParsed":[["Malomed","Boris A.",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2024 04:13:34 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-03","timestamp":1733112814000,"abstract":"  This item from the News & Views category, to be published in Light: Science &\nApplications, aims to provide a summary of theoretical and experimental results\nrecently published in Ref. [24], which demonstrate the creation of corner modes\nin nonlinear optical waveguides of the higher-order topological-insulator\n(HOTI) type. Actually, these are second-order HOTIs, in which the transverse\ndimension of the topologically protected edge modes is smaller than the bulk\ndimension (it is 2, in the case of optical waveguide) by 2, implying zero\ndimension of the protected modes, that are actually realized as corner or\ndefect ones. Work [24] reports prediction and creation of various forms of the\ncorner modes in a HOTI with a fractal transverse structure, represented by the\nSierpinski gasket (SG). The self-focusing nonlinearity of the waveguide's\nmaterial transforms the corner modes into corner solitons, almost all of which\nare stable. The solitons may be attached to external or internal corners\ncreated by the underlying SG. This N&V item offers an overview of these new\nfindings reported in Ref. [24] and other recent works, and a brief discussion\nof directions for the further work on this topic.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"O9gZStRiLgfDhk0KVSZGoh5vxlhmfZMSXLkhakQf2pM","pdfSize":"223006"}
