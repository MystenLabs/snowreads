  "abstract": "  Since the early 2000s there has existed the meme that \"DOOM can run on\nanything\". Whether it be an ATM or a calculator, someone at some point has\nrecompiled DOOM to run on it. Now the quantum computer finally joins the list.\nMore specifically, this project represents the first level of DOOM loosely\nrewritten using Hadamards and Toffolis which, despite being a universal gate\nset, has been designed in such a way that it's classically simulable, able to\nreach 10-20 frames per second on a laptop. The circuit uses 72,376 total qubits\nand at least 80 million gates, thus it may have use as a benchmark for quantum\nsimulation software.\n",
