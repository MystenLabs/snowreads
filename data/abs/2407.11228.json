The model contains\ncross-species density-dependent diffusion and proliferation terms that capture\nthe role of the ECM in providing structural support for the cells during\ninvasion while also preventing growth via volume-filling effects. Furthermore,\nthe model includes ECM degradation by the cells. We present an existence result\nfor weak solutions which is based on carefully exploiting the partial gradient\nflow structure of the problem which allows us to overcome the non-regularising\nnature of the ODE involved.\n  In addition, we present simulations based on a finite difference scheme that\nillustrate that the system exhibits travelling wave solutions, and we\ninvestigate numerically the asymptotic behaviour as the ECM degradation rate\ntends to infinity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hcjHVB2Fy3Rt-ua-_8SZRxySIG7sQsrrdMrf8-J_TgI","pdfSize":"768921"}
