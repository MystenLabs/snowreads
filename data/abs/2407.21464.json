By varying grain\ngeometry from spherical to highly non-convex shapes, adjusting frictional\nproperties and the particle number of branches, we examine how these parameters\nand the drum speed influence the flow behavior. Our study identifies two\ndistinct flow regimes: the rolling regime, where granular matter exhibits\nsolid-like behavior near the walls and flows like a liquid near the free\nsurface, and the slumping regime, characterized by cyclic avalanches and solid\nbody rotations. Using quantitative criteria such as the repose angle difference\nand the area ratio of particle packings, we construct phase diagrams\ndelineating the cross-over between these regimes. Our findings highlight the\nsignificant effects of particle concavity, friction, and rotation speed on the\nflow dynamics of granular materials, providing new insights into the mechanical\nbehaviors of \\emph{meta-granular matter}.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cD2ujiYdIRIbymDLnLMK4GudaX27XqJyWjqCUC8FVZk","pdfSize":"6973459"}
