It involves optimizing a set of\ntruck routes to service a set of customers, subject to limits on truck\ncapacity, to reduce travel costs. The biggest challenge faced whilst attempting\nto solve the issue is that the time complexity of the issue grows exponentially\nwith the number of customers and trucks, rendering it virtually intractable to\ntraditional computers and algorithms. In this paper, we propose a method to\ncircumvent this limitation, employing quantum computers to aid classical\ncomputers in solving problems faster while reducing complexity. To obtain our\nresults, we employ two algorithms: Hybrid Two Step (H2S) and Hybrid Three Step\n(H3S). Both algorithms involve two phases: clustering and routing. It has been\nobserved that both algorithms produce promising results, both in terms of\nsolution time and solution cost.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computer Science/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computer Science/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VyGdxYuubsggxb9r8tHOwY1xuUbBS11I6KBN7OxTeoE","pdfSize":"794161"}
