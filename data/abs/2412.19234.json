This paper provides a comprehensive study of this evolution,\nhighlighting the challenges and key advancements in the transition from\nsingle-core to multi-core processors. It also examines state-of-the-art\nhardware accelerators, including Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and their\nderivatives, RipTide and the Catapult fabric, and evaluates their strategies\nfor optimizing critical performance metrics such as energy consumption,\nlatency, and flexibility.\n  Ultimately, this study emphasizes the role of reconfigurable systems in\novercoming current architectural challenges and driving future advancements in\ncomputational efficiency.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2TFAXylB3LN05eZR-wy3OVNVnXMetDfBiCMF9ZQagjs","pdfSize":"629232"}
