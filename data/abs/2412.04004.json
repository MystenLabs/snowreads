  "abstract": "  We report high average power THz emission from a GaAs-based large-area\nphotoconductive emitter, excited by a commercial Yb-laser amplifier without any\ncompression schemes, doubled to the green. The LAE is pumped at 11.4 W of green\naverage power (515 nm) and 310 fs pulse duration at 400-kHz repetition rate. We\nobtain a maximum THz power of 6.7 mW with a spectrum extended up to 3 THz.\nUsing electro-optic sampling (EOS) for detection, we measure a high dynamic\nrange of 107 dB in a measurement time of 70 s. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the highest power THz source so far demonstrated by photoconductive\nemitters, based on a simple and robust, commercially available Yb-laser.\n",
