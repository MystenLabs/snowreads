Recent\nobservations with NICER resulted in measurements of radii for three neutron\nstars using this technique. In this paper, we explore correlations between\nmodel parameters and the degree to which individual parameters can be inferred\nfrom pulse profiles, using an analytic model that allows for an efficient and\ninterpretable exploration. We introduce a new set of model parameters that\nreduce the most prominent correlations and allow for an efficient sampling of\nposteriors. We then demonstrate that the degree of beaming of radiation\nemerging from the neutron star surface has a large impact on the uncertainties\nin the inferred model parameters. Finally, we show that the uncertainties in\nthe model parameters for neutron stars for which the polar cap temperature\nfalls outside of the NICER energy range are significantly degraded.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"u6CikCL5B3e28JMRMR4CubWgL60dAhairPdQW6pkUg8","pdfSize":"1457577"}
