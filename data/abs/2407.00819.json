Most papers discussing\nthe monogenity of pure number fields focus only on the case where $m$ is\nsquare-free. In this paper, based on a classical theorem of Ore on the prime\nideal decomposition \\cite{MN92, O}, we study the monogenity of $K$ with $m$ is\nnot necessarily square-free. As an application, several examples of the\napplication of monogenic fields to CNS (Canonical Number System) are shown. In\nthis way, our results extend some parts of previously established results\n\\cite{BFC, BF, HNHCNS}.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6F_tAT2RXVk-QwRaBtvU-whp082-E_rCIMKOec3aIQM","pdfSize":"227394"}
