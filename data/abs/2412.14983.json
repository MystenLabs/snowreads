  "abstract": "  It is a continued open question how there can be an azimuthal anisotropy of\nhigh $p_\\perp$ particles quantified by a sizable $v_2$ in p+Pb collisions when,\nat the same time, the nuclear modification factor $R_\\text{AA}$ is consistent\nwith unity. We address this puzzle within the framework of the jet quenching\nmodel \\textsc{Jewel}. In the absence of reliable medium models for small\ncollision systems we use the number of scatterings per parton times the squared\nDebye mass to characterise the strength of medium modifications. Working with a\nsimple brick medium model we show that, for small systems and not too strong\nmodifications, $R_\\text{AA}$ and $v_2$ approximately scale with this quantity.\nWe find that a comparatively large number of scatterings is needed to generate\nmeasurable jet quenching. Our results indicate that the $R_\\text{AA}$\ncorresponding to the observed $v_2$ could fall within the experimental\nuncertainty. Thus, while there is currently no contradiction with the\nmeasurements, our results indicate that $v_2$ and $R_\\text{AA}$ go\nhand-in-hand. We also discuss departures from scaling, in particular, due to\nsizable inelastic energy loss.\n",
