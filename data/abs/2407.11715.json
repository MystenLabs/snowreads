Despite its relatively simple rules,\nSAA introduces a complex strategic game with an unknown optimal bidding\nstrategy. Given the high stakes involved, with billions of euros sometimes on\nthe line, developing an efficient bidding strategy is of utmost importance. In\nthis work, we extend our previous method, a Simultaneous Move Monte-Carlo Tree\nSearch (SM-MCTS) based algorithm named $SMS^{\\alpha}$ to incomplete information\nframework. For this purpose, we compare three determinization approaches which\nallow us to rely on complete information SM-MCTS. This algorithm addresses, in\nincomplete framework, the four key strategic issues of SAA: the exposure\nproblem, the own price effect, budget constraints, and the eligibility\nmanagement problem. Through extensive numerical experiments on instances of\nrealistic size with an uncertain framework, we show that $SMS^{\\alpha}$ largely\noutperforms state-of-the-art algorithms by achieving higher expected utility\nwhile taking less risks, no matter which determinization method is chosen.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"S1A9CsQCsf-ObJDoIU8j5NLuB9HaX2CN4O8Kh5cTHL4","pdfSize":"813173"}
