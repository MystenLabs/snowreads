  "abstract": "  Tinnitus and hyperacusis can occur together or in isolation, with hyperacusis\nbeing associated with tinnitus much more frequently than vice versa. This\nstriking correlation between tinnitus and hyperacusis prevalence implicates\nthat there might be a common origin such as a (hidden) hearing loss and\npossibly interrelated neural mechanisms of pathological development of those\ntwo conditions. In this theoretical paper, we propose such interrelated\npathological mechanisms, localized in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) of the\nbrainstem, that are based on classical mechanisms of Hebbian and associative\nplasticity known from classical conditioning. Specifically, our model proposes\nthat hyperacusis results from synaptic enhancement of cochlear input to the\nDCN, whereas chronic tinnitus results from synaptic enhancement of\nsomatosensory input to the DCN. Specific conditions leading to one or the other\ncondition are discussed. Our model predicts, that hearing loss leads to chronic\ntinnitus, while noise exposure (which may also cause hearing loss) leads to\nhyperacusis.\n",
