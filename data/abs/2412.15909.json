While\nsignificant progress has been made to learn NDF from various kind of sensor\ndata, a crucial aspect that demands attention is the supervision of neural\nfields during training as the ground-truth NDFs are not available for\nlarge-scale outdoor scenes. Previous works have utilized various forms of\nexpected signed distance to guide model learning. Yet, these approaches often\nneed to pay more attention to critical considerations of surface geometry and\nare limited to small-scale implementations. To this end, we propose a novel\nmethodology leveraging second-order derivatives of the signed distance field\nfor improved neural field learning. Our approach addresses limitations by\naccurately estimating signed distance, offering a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of underlying geometry. To assess the efficacy of our\nmethodology, we conducted comparative evaluations against prevalent methods for\nmapping and localization tasks, which are primary application areas of NDF. Our\nresults demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach, highlighting its\npotential for advancing the capabilities of neural distance fields in computer\nvision and graphics applications.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_VmlkdMPq4g8Gs526cjk_uvNs6prO_p_XN5VWqmBWFs","pdfSize":"17601029"}
