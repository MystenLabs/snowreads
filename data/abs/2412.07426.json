The main idea is to avoid\nadapting the mesh (and - as much as possible - the discrete operators) to the\ntime-dependent fluid domain with the aim to maximize computational efficiency.\nWe restrict our attention to spherical particle shapes (while deviations from\nsphericity are treated in a subsequent chapter). We show that similar ideas can\nbe successfully implemented in a variety of underlying fluid flow solvers,\nleading to powerful tools for the direct numerical simulation of large\nparticulate systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"X5Cp1Y-PQvtlrSpyR2DAiGrJYqoYPmp5gjrsqSJzyqA","pdfSize":"1014225"}
