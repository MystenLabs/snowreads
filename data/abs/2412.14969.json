The library includes implementations of popular and state-of-the-art\nmethods, dataset integration tools, and evaluation metrics. Utilizing the\nBenchmark tool in PhotoHolmes, users can effortlessly compare various methods.\nThis facilitates an accurate and reproducible comparison between their own\nmethods and those in the existing literature. Furthermore, PhotoHolmes includes\na command-line interface (CLI) to easily run the methods implemented in the\nlibrary on any suspicious image. As such, image forgery methods become more\naccessible to the community. The library has been built with extensibility and\nmodularity in mind, which makes adding new methods, datasets and metrics to the\nlibrary a straightforward process.
