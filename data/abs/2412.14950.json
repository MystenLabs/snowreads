However, most CA methods suffer\nfrom a significant drawback: they learn a single set of individual constraints\nfor a specific problem instance, but cannot generalize these constraints to the\nparameterized constraint specifications of the problem. In this paper, we\naddress this limitation by proposing GenCon, a novel approach to learn\nparameterized constraint models capable of modeling varying instances of the\nsame problem. To achieve this generalization, we make use of statistical\nlearning techniques at the level of individual constraints. Specifically, we\npropose to train a classifier to predict, for any possible constraint and\nparameterization, whether the constraint belongs to the problem. We then show\nhow, for some classes of classifiers, we can extract decision rules to\nconstruct interpretable constraint specifications. This enables the generation\nof ground constraints for any parameter instantiation. Additionally, we present\na generate-and-test approach that can be used with any classifier, to generate\nthe ground constraints on the fly. Our empirical results demonstrate that our\napproach achieves high accuracy and is robust to noise in the input instances.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OLv7J_5Nv7xoTf6yZEvDpPs-z0C_f6NV9mh2lBY3QqM","pdfSize":"3304865"}
