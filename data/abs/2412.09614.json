  "abstract": "  We introduce a novel approach to enhance the capabilities of text-to-image\nmodels by incorporating a graph-based RAG. Our system dynamically retrieves\ndetailed character information and relational data from the knowledge graph,\nenabling the generation of visually accurate and contextually rich images. This\ncapability significantly improves upon the limitations of existing T2I models,\nwhich often struggle with the accurate depiction of complex or culturally\nspecific subjects due to dataset constraints. Furthermore, we propose a novel\nself-correcting mechanism for text-to-image models to ensure consistency and\nfidelity in visual outputs, leveraging the rich context from the graph to guide\ncorrections. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that\nContext Canvas significantly enhances the capabilities of popular models such\nas Flux, Stable Diffusion, and DALL-E, and improves the functionality of\nControlNet for fine-grained image editing tasks. To our knowledge, Context\nCanvas represents the first application of graph-based RAG in enhancing T2I\nmodels, representing a significant advancement for producing high-fidelity,\ncontext-aware multi-faceted images.\n",
