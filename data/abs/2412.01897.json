  "abstract": "  Quantum mechanics is formulated on a Hilbert space that is assumed to be\nseparable. However, there seems to be no clear reason justifying this\nassumption. Does it have physical implications? We answer in the positive by\nproposing a test that witnesses the non-separability of the Hilbert space, at\nthe expense of requiring measurements with uncountably many outcomes. In the\nsearch for a less elusive manifestation of non-separability, we consider the\noriginal Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) state as a candidate for possessing\nnonlocal correlations stronger than any state in a separable Hilbert space.\nNevertheless, we show that, under mild assumptions, this state is not a vector\nin any bipartite space, even non-separable, and therefore cannot be described\nwithin the standard Hilbert space formalism.\n",
