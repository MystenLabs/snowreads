It\nis well-known in the theory of designs that a finite subset of a sphere is a\ntight spherical 1-design if and only if it is a pair of antipodal points. On\nthe other hand, antipodal sets and 2-number for a Riemannian manifold are\nintroduced by B.-Y. Chen and T. Nagano in 1982.\n  An antipodal set is called a great antipodal set if its cardinality is equal\nto the 2-number. The main purpose of this paper is to provide a survey on\nimportant results in compact symmetric spaces with great antipodal sets as the\ndesigns. In the last two sections of this paper, we present some important\napplications of 2-number and great antipodal sets to topology and group theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DN7nbp4Aj51P152_uNGTrirCoPjP6cNlEwckBKP3Oek","pdfSize":"215778"}
