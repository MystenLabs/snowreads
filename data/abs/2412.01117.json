However, in particular estimation scenarios, the FIM is\nnon-invertible due to redundancy in the parameter set, which depends on the\nprobe state and measurement observable. Particularly, this has led to the use\nof a weaker form of the CRB to bound the estimation uncertainty in distributed\nquantum sensing. This weak CRB is generally lower than or equal to the exact\nCRB, and may, therefore, overestimate the achievable estimation precision. In\nthis work, we propose an alternative approach, employing the Moore-Penrose\npseudoinverse of the FIM for constrained parameters, providing a unified CRB,\nattainable with an unbiased estimator. This allows us to construct simple\nstrategies for each case in both simultaneous estimation and distributed\nquantum sensing, covering paradigmatic examples considered in the literature.\nWe believe this study to provide a unified framework for addressing\nnon-invertible FIMs and improving the precision of quantum multi-parameter\nestimation in various practical scenarios.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IoC_k8rWKmSGxRESK1GeJNFWRCwTSgHowZOTHuF-Zws","pdfSize":"446107"}
