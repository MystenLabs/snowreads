TOI-4994b transits a G-type star (V = 12.6 mag) with a mass,\nradius, and effective temperature of $M_{\\star} =1.005^{+0.064}_{-0.061}\nM_{\\odot}$, $R_{\\star} = 1.055^{+0.040}_{-0.037} R_{\\odot}$, and $T_{\\rm eff} =\n5640 \\pm 110$ K. We obtained follow-up ground-based photometry from the Las\nCumbres Observatory (LCO) and the Antarctic Search for Transiting ExoPlanets\n(ASTEP) telescopes, and we confirmed the planetary nature of TOI-4994b with\nmultiple radial velocity observations from the PFS, CHIRON, HARPS, FEROS, and\nCORALIE instruments. From a global fit to the photometry and radial velocities,\nwe determine that TOI-4994b is in a 21.5-day, eccentric orbit ($e = 0.32 \\pm\n0.04$) and has a mass of $M_{P}= 0.280^{+0.037}_{-0.034} M_{J}$, a radius of\n$R_{P}= 0.762^{+0.030}_{-0.027}R_{J}$, and a Saturn-like bulk density of\n$\\rho_{p} = 0.78^{+0.16}_{-0.14}$ $\\rm g/cm^3$. We find that TOI-4994 is a\npotentially viable candidate for follow-up stellar obliquity measurements.\nTOI-4994b joins the small sample of warm Saturn analogs and thus sheds light on\nour understanding of these rare and unique worlds.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UwRCp7J0jgSYa2Y1tuFT9CQzllhEGG7OQ_xelFy7bLU","pdfSize":"7962439"}
