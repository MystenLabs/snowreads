This study examines the relationships between premature\ndeath rates and multiple risk factors across several Texas counties, utilizing\nEPA air quality data, Census information, and county health records from recent\nyears. We analyze the impact of air quality (PM2.5 levels), socioeconomic\nfactors (median household income), and health conditions (COPD prevalence)\nthrough statistical analysis and modeling techniques. Results reveal COPD\nprevalence as a strong predictor of premature death rates, with higher\nprevalence associated with a substantial increase in years of potential life\nlost. While socioeconomic factors show a significant negative correlation, air\nquality demonstrates more complex indirect relationships. These findings\nemphasize the need for integrated public health interventions that prioritize\nkey health conditions while addressing underlying socioeconomic disparities.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cTlITDIC39HLdJ5F4n7ShWBrGzTT-3MxUjcoscpk3gM","pdfSize":"821269"}
