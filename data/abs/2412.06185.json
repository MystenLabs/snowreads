We construct a\nglobal-in-time weak solution to this problem by using an approximation method\nthat incorporates a penalizing repulsive force of the form\n$\\frac1\\varepsilon\\chi_{\\{\\eta<0\\}} (\\partial_t\\eta)^-$. The weak solution\nexhibits well-controlled energy dissipation, occurring only during contact on a\nset of zero measure and exclusively when the string moves downward.\nFurthermore, the velocity is shown to vanish after contact in a specific weak\nsense. This model serves as a simplified framework for studying contact\nproblems in fluid-structure interaction contexts.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tulOmnVPeoIsQ5gYeVVXLuK0nGVsHcvKdyDmjy5XsIs","pdfSize":"2205132"}
