Techniques like quantization and distillation have further expanded\nPTM applicability to resource-constrained IoT hardware. Given the many PTM\noptions for any given task, engineers often find it too costly to evaluate each\nmodel's suitability. Approaches such as LogME, LEEP, and ModelSpider help\nstreamline model selection by estimating task relevance without exhaustive\ntuning. However, these methods largely leave hardware constraints as future\nwork-a significant limitation in IoT settings. In this paper, we identify the\nlimitations of current model recommendation approaches regarding hardware\nconstraints and introduce a novel, hardware-aware method for PTM selection. We\nalso propose a research agenda to guide the development of effective,\nhardware-conscious model recommendation systems for IoT applications.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lbAAeaKP1wPLkEMKWIZj98KD6cracYJWNlv8Mj53lVY","pdfSize":"354257"}
