However, the development and\nranking of state-of-the-art (SotA) models are driven by their In-Distribution\n(ID) performance on individual competition datasets. We present an OoD testing\nprotocol that homogenizes datasets and prediction tasks across two large-scale\nmotion datasets. We introduce a novel prediction algorithm based on polynomial\nrepresentations for agent trajectory and road geometry on both the input and\noutput sides of the model. With a much smaller model size, training effort, and\ninference time, we reach near SotA performance for ID testing and significantly\nimprove robustness in OoD testing. Within our OoD testing protocol, we further\nstudy two augmentation strategies of SotA models and their effects on model\ngeneralization. Highlighting the contrast between ID and OoD performance, we\nsuggest adding OoD testing to the evaluation criteria of trajectory prediction\nmodels.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gSNvg6RsKf6FRHp3Ro0aNrRNq2LwUAEExO21SJOgGK0","pdfSize":"1518297"}
