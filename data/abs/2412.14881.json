  "abstract": "  In the SU3-IBM the oblate shape is described by the \\textrm{SU(3)}\nthird-order Casimir operator in the large-$N$ limit. However for finite $N$,\nthis interaction can produce a boson number odd-even effect. In this Letter,\nthe unique odd-even effect is really found in the nuclei $^{196-204}$Hg. This\nfinding implies that realistic low-lying excitations are sensitive to certain\nboson number $N$. The IBM hypothesis is verified for the first time since the\nadvent of the interacting boson model. This also proves the accuracy and\nvalidity of the SU3-IBM directly. The SU(3) symmetry and the higher-order\ninteractions are both indispensable for understanding the nuclear deformations.\n",
