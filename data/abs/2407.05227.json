In particular, we study the fixed-point properties of the\nMordukhovich differential operator for the metric projection operator onto some\nclosed and convex subsets in Banach spaces, such as, closed balls in Banach\nspaces, positive cones in real spaces l2 and l1 and sets of polynomials in C[0,\n1].\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EQ-WMqKlV5ocgaWqgaiuvuHV43KShoCaqZD6QWz90M0","pdfSize":"452043"}
