  "abstract": "  We consider the classical minisuperspace model describing a closed,\nhomogeneous and isotropic Universe, with a positive cosmological constant. Upon\ncanonical quantization, the infinite number of possible operator orderings in\nthe quantum Hamiltonian leads to distinct Wheeler-DeWitt equations for the\nwavefunction $\\psi$ of the Universe. Similarly, ambiguity arises in the\npath-integral formulation of $\\psi$, due to the infinite choices of\npath-integral measures for the single degree of freedom of the model. For each\nchoice of path-integral measure, we determine the correct operator ordering of\nthe quantum Hamiltonian and derive the exact form of the Wheeler-DeWitt\nequation, including all corrections in $\\hbar$. Additionally, we impose\nHermiticity of the Hamiltonian to deduce the Hilbert-space measure $\\mu$, which\nappears in the definition of the Hermitian inner product. Remarkably, all\nquantum predictions can be expressed through the combination $\\Psi=\\sqrt{\\mu}\\,\n\\psi$, which satisfies a universal Wheeler-DeWitt equation, independent of the\ninitial path-integral prescription. This result demonstrates that all seemingly\ndistinct quantum theories arising from different quantization schemes of the\nsame classical model are fundamentally equivalent.\n",
