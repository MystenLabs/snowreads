Our 2D kagome structure formed by creating patterned nano pores in\nthe graphene sheet, nomenclatured as porous graphene-based kagome lattice\n(PGKL), is inspired by the recent bottom-up synthesis of similar structures.\nBecause of absence of mirror symmetry in our porous graphene, by considering\nonly first nearest neighbour intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (ISOC) within the\ntight-binding model unlike mostly used next nearest neighbour ISOC in the\nKane-Mele model for graphene, PGKL exhibits distinctive band structures with\nDirac bands amidst flat bands, allowing for the realization of topological\nstates near the Fermi level. Delving into Berry curvature and Chern numbers\nprovides a comprehensive understanding of the topological insulating properties\nof PGKL, offering valuable insights into 2D topological insulators. Analysis of\nthe 1-D ribbon structure underscores the emergence of topological edge states.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_OVMZTtWTgnFhepsHvz1NvNCjA_O2NOYZQ_NTpi19hI","pdfSize":"3324024"}
