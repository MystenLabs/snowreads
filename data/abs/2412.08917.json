They present the story\nof the algebraic Lefschetz properties from their origin in algebraic geometry\nto some recent developments in commutative algebra. The common thread of the\nnotes is a bias towards topics surrounding the algebraic Lefschetz properties\nthat have a topological flavor. These range from the Hard Lefschetz Theorem for\ncohomology rings to commutative algebraic analogues of these rings, namely\nartinian Gorenstein rings, and topologically motivated operations among such\nrings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QiHw6_SHZYxIVYF6y3PotwJsp8LSv_2UnmzrGacz7a4","pdfSize":"418480"}
