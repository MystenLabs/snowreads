The length of $\\mathcal S$ is the smallest number $k$ such that\n$\\mathcal A$ equals the $\\mathbb F$-linear span of all products of length at\nmost $k$ of elements from $\\mathcal S$. The length of $\\mathcal A$, denoted by\n$l(\\mathcal A)$, is defined to be the maximal length of its generating set. In\nthis paper, it is shown that the $l(\\mathcal A)$ does not exceed the maximum of\n$\\dim \\mathcal A / 2$ and $m(\\mathcal A)-1$, where $m(\\mathcal A)$ is the\nlargest degree of the minimal polynomial among all elements of the algebra\n$\\mathcal A$. For arbitrary odd $n$, it is proven that the length of the group\nalgebra of the dihedral group of order $2n$ equals $n$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"btWrEAUKu3nb3Dzn9zZdCV9zgA_SRGbG03PjSTquqYU","pdfSize":"125397"}
