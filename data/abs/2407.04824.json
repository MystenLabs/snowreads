This problem is\nsometimes dubbed the Santa Claus problem and its different variants have been\nsubject to extensive research towards approximation algorithms over the past\ntwo decades.\n  In the case where each player has a potentially different additive valuation\nfunction, Chakrabarty, Chuzhoy, and Khanna [FOCS'09] gave an\n$O(n^{\\epsilon})$-approximation algorithm with polynomial running time for any\nconstant $\\epsilon > 0$ and a polylogarithmic approximation algorithm in\nquasi-polynomial time. We show that the same can be achieved for monotone\nsubmodular valuation functions, improving over the previously best algorithm\ndue to Goemans, Harvey, Iwata, and Mirrokni [SODA'09], which has an\napproximation ratio of more than $\\sqrt{n}$.\n  Our result builds up on a sophisticated LP relaxation, which has a recursive\nblock structure that allows us to solve it despite having exponentially many\nvariables and constraints.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"GtDvlDyOxiYrlvS7jOBQDmaBzUf-0z4_iO9ZRx5tbCA","pdfSize":"647179"}
