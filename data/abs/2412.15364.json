In total, we identify 208 new\n(genuine 6-party) orbits, 52 of which violate at least one known holographic\nentropy inequality. For the remaining 156 orbits, which do not violate any such\ninequalities, we construct holographic graph models for 150 of them. For the\nfinal 6 orbits, it remains an open question whether they are holographic.\nConsistent with the strong form of the conjecture in\n\\cite{Hernandez-Cuenca:2022pst}, 148 of these graph models are trees. However,\n2 of the graphs contain a \"bulk cycle\", leaving open the question of whether\nequivalent models with tree topology exist, or if these extreme rays are\ncounterexamples to the conjecture. The paper includes a detailed description of\nthe algorithm used for the computation, which is presented in a general\nframework and can be applied to any situation involving a polyhedral cone\ndefined by a set of linear inequalities and a partial order among them to find\nextreme rays corresponding to down-sets in this poset.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"U1F8hNJ3DU4Xu6oNRznaOp2o3_wXFxp5Ro064kxMmmw","pdfSize":"1642741"}
