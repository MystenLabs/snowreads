The polished surfaces of as-cast alloys were leached with 10 mole NaOH\nsolution for 0.5- 8 hours. The x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy\nand transmission electron microscopy techniques have been used for structural\nand microstructural characterization. Energy dispersive x-ray analysis has been\ncarried out for chemical composition analysis. Chemical leaching exclusively\nremoves the Al from the surfaces of the Al65Cu15Co20 and Al65Cu20Co15 decagonal\nquasicrystalline alloys, consequently by the formation of porous structure\ncontaining nano size particles of Cu, Co and their oxides have been observed.\nAl65Cu15Co20 exhibits high porosity in comparison to Al65Cu20Co15 alloy,\nhowever the size of the precipitated nano-particles i.e. Cu, Co, Cu2O and CuO\nwere smaller in the case of Al65Cu20Co15 alloy. The energy dispersive X-ray\nanalysis mapping suggests homogeneous distribution of Cu and Co found on the\nleached surface and the presence of oxygen was also detected.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LIoXT4BlkQm1mtdvGAO6QDdhFYEY5hfipCHQ-coFAlE","pdfSize":"1592442"}
