  "abstract": "  This study introduces a federated learning-based approach to predict HER2\nstatus from hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained whole slide images (WSIs),\nreducing costs and speeding up treatment decisions. To address label imbalance\nand feature representation challenges in multisite datasets, a point\ntransformer is proposed, incorporating dynamic label distribution, an auxiliary\nclassifier, and farthest cosine sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nstate-of-the-art performance across four sites (2687 WSIs) and strong\ngeneralization to two unseen sites (229 WSIs).\n",
