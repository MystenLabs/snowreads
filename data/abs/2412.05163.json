The automated system\ngathers new human responses to survey items daily, anonymizes and publicly\ndistributes microdata, and presents analyses through a publicly viewable Web\ndashboard. A demonstration implementation tracked support for further\ndevelopment of artificial intelligence at daily resolution. As of 2025-02-13,\nthe system had collected 4001 responses and autonomously produced daily and\nmonthly estimates of support. Two trends emerged: On average, American adults\nincreasingly supported further development of AI. A crossover interaction of\npolitical party affiliation and time suggests AI support changed at different\nrates for Democrats and Republicans. I argue that more scientists should adopt\nthe method of open nowcasting, because it encourages transparency in research\ndesign and eases replication.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fVDgKJs99zNWQzt-tH1RxgG2fgToNcz-Bbmy2c0fwws","pdfSize":"723126"}
