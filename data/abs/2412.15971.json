We prove the convergence of the finite-dimensional\ndistributions, a functional CLT, and limit theorems for smooth transformations\nof the process, which covers a large class of Volterra kernels that includes\nrough models based on Riemann-Liouville kernels with short- and long-range\ndependencies. To illustrate our results, we derive asymptotic pricing formulae\nfor digital calls on the realized variance in three different regimes. The\nlatter provides a robust and model-independent pricing method for small\nmaturities in rough volatility models. Finally, for the case of completely\nmonotone kernels, we introduce a flexible framework of Hilbert space-valued\nMarkovian lifts and derive analogous limit theorems for such lifts.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RA8pNOpSadzfla0A3jfKrNodOx_F4R1U8d2uW4SEoI4","pdfSize":"514082"}
