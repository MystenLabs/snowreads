This\neffectively delivers almost ideal isentropic transformations. We concentrate on\nthe characterization of the performance of a quantum Zeno heat pump implemented\nwith a quantum harmonic oscillator, showing that optimal performance can be\nachieved faster than with shortcut-to-adiabaticity techniques.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Up8jlRKFlvi_0buQxCs7P7NTS42Y5qMJ48bQiEwXEOU","pdfSize":"946774"}
