Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) is\nemployed to construct optimally weighted templates. The proposed method\nachieves 69% accuracy using the Frobenius norm at rank 10. The results\npartially validate the assumption that dominant features, such as fur color,\ncan be effectively captured through low-rank approximations. However, the\naccuracy suggests that additional features or methods may be required for more\nrobust classification, highlighting the trade-off between simplicity and\nperformance in resource-constrained environments.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ldq94559LNWsF8-czmMZLq4T6UqtUmUdTfEEshJSIc4","pdfSize":"5218747"}
