In handball, few nations will\nfight hard to win the precious metal with speculations predicting the victory\nfor France or Denmark for men and France or Norway for women. However, there is\nso far no scientific method proposed to predict the final results of the\ncompetition. In this work, we leverage a deep learning model to predict the\nresults of the handball tournament of the 2024 Olympic Games. This model,\ncoupled with explainable AI (xAI) techniques, allows us to extract insightful\ninformation about the main factors influencing the outcome of each match.\nNotably, xAI helps sports experts understand how factors like match information\nor individual athlete performance contribute to the predictions. Furthermore,\nwe integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate human-friendly\nexplanations that highlight the most important factors impacting the match\nresults. By providing human-centric explanations, our approach offers a deeper\nunderstanding of the AI predictions, making them more actionable for coaches\nand analysts.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iriUmjEzpkNtFtgvc59QsFHU1scBmz7mmIk-389FwOE","pdfSize":"850620"}
