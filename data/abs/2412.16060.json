State-of-the-art Cloud\nsystems frequently adopt microservices or serverless architectures. Among\nthese, TeaStore is a recognised microservice reference architecture that offers\na benchmarking framework for modelling and resource management techniques.\nHowever, TeaStore's original configuration lacks the flexibility necessary to\naddress the varied scenarios encountered in real-world applications. To\novercome this limitation, we propose an enhanced variant of TeaStore that\ndistinguishes between mandatory and optional services while incorporating\nthird-party service integration. Core services such as WebUI, Image Provider,\nand Persistence are designated as mandatory to maintain essential\nfunctionality, whereas optional services, such as Recommender and Auth, extend\nthe architecture's feature set. We outline the design and configuration\npossibilities of this adaptable TeaStore variant, aimed at enabling a broader\nspectrum of configurability and operational resilience.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"R_LWgSVTJJ6xzE3Q9K87BlUClGOj6ya83nced2KDOhQ","pdfSize":"401473"}
