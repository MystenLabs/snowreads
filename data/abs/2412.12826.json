The [OIII]5008\nand H$\\alpha$ emission lines are detected and spectroscopically resolved. The\nline profiles are well-modeled by a narrow Gaussian component with intrinsic\nFWHMs of 189$\\pm$25 and 231$\\pm$52 kms$^{-1}$, respectively. We do not find any\nevidence of a dominant broad H$\\alpha$ emission line component tracing a Broad\nLine Region in a type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, a broad\n($\\sim$430-470 kms$^{-1}$) and weak ($<$ 20-30%) H$\\alpha$ line component,\ntracing a minor AGN contribution in the optical, cannot be ruled out completely\nwith the sensitivity of the present data. The physical and excitation\nproperties of the ionized gas are consistent with a low-metallicity starburst\nforming stars at a rate of SFR(H$\\alpha$)$=$24 $\\pm$3$M_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$. The\nelectron temperature of the ionized gas is\n$T_{\\mathrm{e}}$(O$^{++}$)$=$14000$\\pm$2100K, while the direct-$T_{\\mathrm{e}}$\ngas-phase metallicity is 12+$\\log$(O/H)$=$7.91$\\pm$0.07\n(Z=0.17$\\pm$0.03Z$_{\\odot}$). The optical line ratios locate GN-z11 in the\nstarburst or AGN region but more consistent with those of local low-metallicity\nstarbursts and high-$z$ luminous galaxies detected at redshifts similar to\nGN-z11. We conclude that the MRS optical spectrum of GN-z11 is consistent with\nthat of a massive, compact, and low-metallicity starburst galaxy. Due to its\nhigh SFR and stellar mass surface densities, close to that of the densest\nstellar clusters, we speculate that GN-z11 could be undergoing a feedback-free,\nhighly efficient starburst phase. Additional JWST data are needed to validate\nthis scenario, and other recently proposed alternatives, to explain the\nexistence of bright compact galaxies in the early Universe.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Ms1d9JRFpNtgV4-Ztut7-vX3L_k3BBJsTsSftTngEpI","pdfSize":"4435937"}
