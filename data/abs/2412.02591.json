  "abstract": "  Most algorithms for computing persistent homology do so by tracking cycles\nthat represent homology classes. There are many choices of such cycles, and\nspecific choices have found different uses in applications. Although it is\nknown that persistence diagrams can be computed in matrix multiplication time\n[8] for the more general case of zigzag persistent homology, it is not clear\nhow to extract cycle representatives, especially if specific representatives\nare desired. In this paper, we provide the same matrix multiplication bound for\ncomputing representatives for the two choices common in applications in the\ncase of ordinary persistent (co)homology. We first provide a fast version of\nthe reduction algorithm, which is simpler than the algorithm in [8], but\nreturns a different set of representatives than the standard algorithm [6] We\nthen give a fast version of a different variant called the row algorithm [4],\nwhich returns the same representatives as the standard algorithm.\n",
