The tangent space of the\nmoduli space of Higgs bundles at $(E,\\theta)$ is equipped with two natural\nmetrics called the Hitchin metric and the semi-flat metric. It is known that\nthe difference between two metrics along the curve $(E,t\\theta)$ $(t\\geq 1)$\ndecays in an exponential way. In this paper, we shall study how the exponential\nrate is improved.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3piZzsU_PdGqBy-0MQRnZtNm86qXBVVzLVDU-trT6JA","pdfSize":"498878"}
