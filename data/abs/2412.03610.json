  "abstract": "  It is beyond dispute that the potential benefits of artificial intelligence\n(AI) in military intelligence are considerable. Nevertheless, it remains\nuncertain precisely how AI can enhance the analysis of military data. The aim\nof this study is to address this issue. To this end, the AI demonstrator\ndeepCOM was developed in collaboration with the start-up Aleph Alpha.\n  The AI functions include text search, automatic text summarization and Named\nEntity Recognition (NER). These are evaluated for their added value in military\nanalysis. It is demonstrated that under time pressure, the utilization of AI\nfunctions results in assessments clearly superior to that of the control group.\nNevertheless, despite the demonstrably superior analysis outcome in the\nexperimental group, no increase in confidence in the accuracy of their own\nanalyses was observed. Finally, the paper identifies the limitations of\nemploying AI in military intelligence, particularly in the context of analyzing\nambiguous and contradictory information.\n",
