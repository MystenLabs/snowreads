  "abstract": "  Bell measurements, entailing the projection onto one of the Bell states, play\na key role in quantum information and communication, where the outcome of a\nvariety of protocols crucially depends on the success probability of such\nmeasurements. Although in the case of qubit systems, Bell measurements can be\nimplemented using only linear optical components, the same result is no longer\ntrue for qudits, where at least the use of ancillary photons is required. In\norder to circumvent this limitation, one possibility is to introduce nonlinear\neffects. In this work, we adopt the latter approach and propose a scalable Bell\nmeasurement scheme for high-dimensional states, exploiting multiple squeezer\ndevices applied to a linear optical circuit for discriminating the different\nBell states. Our approach does not require ancillary photons, is not limited by\nthe dimension of the quantum states, and is experimentally scalable, thus\npaving the way toward the realization of an effective high-dimensional Bell\nmeasurement.\n",
