Increasing the number of actuators can enhance the robot's capacity,\nbut controlling them requires communication bandwidth to increase equally in\norder to avoid time delays. We propose a novel control method that has constant\ntime delays no matter how many actuators are in the robot. Having a distributed\nnature, the method first approximates target shapes, then broadcasts the\napproximation coefficients to the actuators, and relies on themselves to\ncompute the inputs. We build a robotic pin array and measure the time delay as\na function of the number of actuators to confirm the system size-independent\nscaling behavior. The shape-changing ability is achieved based on function\napproximation algorithms, i.e. discrete cosine transform or matching pursuit.\nWe perform experiments to approximate target shapes and make quantitative\ncomparison with those obtained from standard sequential control method. A good\nagreement between the experiments and theoretical predictions is achieved, and\nour method is more efficient in the sense that it requires less control\nmessages to generate shapes with the same accuracy. Our method is also capable\nof dynamic tasks such as object manipulation.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HTIEyR-HsmSpAyKY8F1NSiDSazW_vNQ-JmQuE55rAeA","pdfSize":"3361470"}
