  "abstract": "  Motivated by the need for advanced solutions in the segmentation and\ninpainting of glioma-affected brain regions in multi-modal magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI), this study presents an integrated approach leveraging the\nstrengths of ensemble learning with hybrid transformer models and convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs), alongside the innovative application of 3D Pix2Pix\nGenerative Adversarial Network (GAN). Our methodology combines robust tumor\nsegmentation capabilities, utilizing axial attention and transformer encoders\nfor enhanced spatial relationship modeling, with the ability to synthesize\nbiologically plausible brain tissue through 3D Pix2Pix GAN. This integrated\napproach addresses the BraTS 2023 cluster challenges by offering precise\nsegmentation and realistic inpainting, tailored for diverse tumor types and\nsub-regions. The results demonstrate outstanding performance, evidenced by\nquantitative evaluations such as the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC),\nHausdorff Distance (HD95) for segmentation, and Structural Similarity Index\nMeasure (SSIM), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Mean-Square Error (MSE)\nfor inpainting. Qualitative assessments further validate the high-quality,\nclinically relevant outputs. In conclusion, this study underscores the\npotential of combining advanced machine learning techniques for comprehensive\nbrain tumor analysis, promising significant advancements in clinical\ndecision-making and patient care within the realm of medical imaging.\n",
