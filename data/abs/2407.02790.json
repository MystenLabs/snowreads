The proposed approach introduces absorbing particles surrounding the\ncomputational domain that efficiently absorb outgoing waves and reduce\nreflections, allowing for accurate modeling of wave propagation and its further\nimpact on geotechnical slope stability analysis. The study also includes\nseveral benchmark tests to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method,\nsuch as several types of impulse loading and symmetric and asymmetric base\nshaking. The conducted numerical tests also demonstrate the ability to handle\nlarge deformation problems, including the failure of elasto-plastic soils under\ngravity and dynamic excitations. The findings extend the capability of MPM in\nsimulating continuous analysis of earthquake-induced landslides, from shaking\nto failure.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dwjGFjVjzMQr2ufMft6DMj9Eqwgo_OTy8mRcfVBYRDY","pdfSize":"9687354"}
