Unlike\nexisting works, StarCache does not cache hot items in the switch memory.\nInstead, we make hot items revisit the switch data plane continuously by\nexploiting packet recirculation. Our approach keeps cached key-value pairs in\nthe switch data plane while freeing them from item size limitations caused by\nhardware constraints. We implement a StarCache prototype on an Intel Tofino\nswitch. Our experimental results show that StarCache can balance highly skewed\nworkloads with various key and value sizes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6GV-NPmbTwCJ_AnMXIKAncLP4EnNgz0rOVKTv9ai2oI","pdfSize":"501610"}
