By leveraging the Landauer\nprinciple in conjunction with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy law, we derive the\nusual value for the Immirzi parameter precisely, $\\gamma = \\ln2/(\\pi\n\\sqrt{3})$, without using the typical procedure that involves the\nBoltzmann-Gibbs entropy. Furthermore, following an analogous procedure, we\nderive a modified expression for the Immirzi parameter aligned with Barrow's\nentropy formulation. Our analysis also yields a new expression for the Immirzi\nparameter consistent with a corresponding modified Kaniadakis entropy for black\nhole entropy further illustrating, along with Barrow's entropy, the\napplicability of Landauer's principle in alternative statistical contexts\nwithin black hole physics.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4sMpEL_RMhrXkxuyEtlv0nQ_6cHyEPbN4XZKSdZeXwE","pdfSize":"349366"}
