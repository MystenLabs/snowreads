This paper presents an enhanced ResNet50 architecture, integrated with\nthe SimAM attention module, to address the challenge of limited contrast in\ndental images and optimize deep learning performance while mitigating\ncomputational demands. The SimAM module, incorporated after the second ResNet\nblock, refines feature extraction by capturing spatial dependencies and\nenhancing significant features. Our model demonstrates superior performance\nacross various feature extraction techniques, achieving an F1 score of 0.676\nand outperforming traditional architectures such as VGG, EfficientNet,\nDenseNet, and AlexNet. This study highlights the effectiveness of our approach\nin improving classification accuracy and robustness in dental image analysis,\nunderscoring the potential of deep learning to enhance diagnostic accuracy and\nefficiency in dental care. The integration of advanced AI models like ours is\npoised to revolutionize dental diagnostics, contributing to better patient\noutcomes and the broader adoption of AI in dentistry.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pjYhvFS8jqWWdor6McG3X_sBcUHhK8-SnYniGatwY1o","pdfSize":"360430"}
