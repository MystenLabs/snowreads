The key\ningredient is a new linear $L^4$-Strichartz estimate which is effective on\nfrequency-dependent time scales. The $L^4$-Strichartz estimates follow from\ncombining an $\\ell^2$-decoupling inequality recently proved by\nGuth--Maldague--Oh with semiclassical Strichartz estimates. Moreover, we rely\non a variant of Bourgain's bilinear Strichartz estimate on frequency-dependent\ntimes, which is proved via the C\\'ordoba--Fefferman square function estimate.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"D6ZqVhBFN8L9vQ-aYx9XVfVPkRvRJNWi9Qa-s1zd1JM","pdfSize":"644343"}
