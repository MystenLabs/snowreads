The\nagent randomly chooses one class among those available, then randomly picks an\nitem within the selected class. We give a formal definition of a choice\ngenerated by this procedure, and provide a characterization. The characterizing\nproperties allow an external observer to elicit that categorization is applied.\nIn a more general interpretation, the model allows to describe the observed\nchoice as the composition of independent subchoices. This composition preserves\nrationalizability by random utility maximization. A generalization of the model\nsubsumes Luce model and Nested Logit.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"y1A-ZSX1GVZIB1uqO2eJr126tjRNezGHmW95XWrUm30","pdfSize":"345637"}
