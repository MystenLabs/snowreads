Surface Paul traps for ion confinement open the\nopportunity to scale quantum processors to hundreds of qubits and enable\nhigh-connectivity manipulations on ions. To fabricate such a system with\ncertain characteristics, the special design of a surface electrode structure is\nrequired. The depth of the trapping potential, the stability parameter, the\nsecular frequency and the distance between an ion and the trap surface should\nbe optimized for better performance. Here we present the optimized design of a\nrelatively simple surface trap that allows several important high-fidelity\nprimitives: tight ion confinement, laser cooling, and wide optical access. The\nsuggested trap design also allows to perform an important basic operation,\nnamely, splitting an ion chain into two parts.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KiyFLlBz3T2DIrp_nCF7yxiWzdcp0cCR7VEKE97V-_4","pdfSize":"855992"}
