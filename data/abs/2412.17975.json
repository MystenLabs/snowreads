Computational techniques\nin medicine enhance the diagnosis and treatment efficiency. However, many\ncomputational techniques, particularly those based on Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs), require high resources and time for training, highlighting the\nresearch opportunities in methods with low computational overhead. In this\npaper, we propose a novel approach combining conventional classifiers,\nsegmented images, and CNNs for the automated classification of sickle cell\ndisease. We evaluated the impact of segmented images on classification,\nproviding insight into deep learning integration. Our results demonstrate that\nusing segmented images and CNN features with an SVM achieves an accuracy of\n96.80%. This finding is relevant for computationally efficient scenarios,\npaving the way for future research and advancements in medical-image analysis.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"35fqiGVL2D7WaqdTnme6ClhPS9p-uxe5p4n49-RuHtY","pdfSize":"372957"}
