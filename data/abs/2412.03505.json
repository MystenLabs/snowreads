We prove that $\\tau = \\mathcal{O}(n^{1 -\n1/t})$ which confirms their conjecture and is best possible assuming the widely\nbelieved conjecture that $\\operatorname{ex}(n, K_{t, t}) = \\Theta(n^{2 -\n1/t})$. Our proof uses a density increment argument.\n  We also construct an infinite family of extremal graphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"r34UOwqvo48Ja2Gq20G2uwPhhnJ7wXXAW5C7APt79hg","pdfSize":"362171"}
