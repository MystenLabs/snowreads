Several examples including cases of point and\nhigher symmetry invariance are presented and discussed. An implementation of\nthe algorithm in Maple is provided.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"L-2oHGP26BT9qsw-rPvMSGbvuS3ky7JNpC5VNxtHiXA","pdfSize":"240482"}
