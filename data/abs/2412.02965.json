  "abstract": "  For a system of partial differential equations that has an extended\nKovalevskaya form, a reduction procedure is presented that allows one to use a\nlocal (point, contact, or higher) symmetry of a system and a symmetry-invariant\nconservation law to algorithmically calculate constants of motion holding for\nsymmetry-invariant solutions. Several examples including cases of point and\nhigher symmetry invariance are presented and discussed. An implementation of\nthe algorithm in Maple is provided.\n",
