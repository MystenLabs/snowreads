A popular approach to cope with the NP-hardness of this problem is to\ncompute a strong coreset, which is a small weighted subset of the input points\nwhich simultaneously approximates the cost of every $k$-dimensional subspace,\ntypically to $(1+\\varepsilon)$ relative error for a small constant\n$\\varepsilon$.\n  We obtain the first algorithm for constructing a strong coreset for $\\ell_p$\nsubspace approximation with a nearly optimal dependence on the rank parameter\n$k$, obtaining a nearly linear bound of $\\tilde\nO(k)\\mathrm{poly}(\\varepsilon^{-1})$ for $p<2$ and $\\tilde\nO(k^{p/2})\\mathrm{poly}(\\varepsilon^{-1})$ for $p>2$. Prior constructions\neither achieved a similar size bound but produced a coreset with a modification\nof the original points [SW18, FKW21], or produced a coreset of the original\npoints but lost $\\mathrm{poly}(k)$ factors in the coreset size [HV20, WY23].\n  Our techniques also lead to the first nearly optimal online strong coresets\nfor $\\ell_p$ subspace approximation with similar bounds as the offline setting,\nresolving a problem of [WY23]. All prior approaches lose $\\mathrm{poly}(k)$\nfactors in this setting, even when allowed to modify the original points.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QkGkWY36F2lRS4cZbbv4r5GSupytgWNE2aNKaz8p13s","pdfSize":"620844"}
