This result establishes a limitation on the extent to which\nstructural properties of ultrafilters can determine the cardinal arithmetic at\nlarge cardinals, and answers a question posed by Goldberg concerning the\nfailure of the Continuum Hypothesis at a measurable cardinal in a model of the\nUltrapower Axiom. The construction introduces several methods in extensions of\nembeddings theory and fine-structure-based forcing, designed to control the\nbehavior of non-normal ultrafilters in generic extensions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kklrMZpsp3Mhkbc5xNr6UobMuujDElwEWNMk0TZxSTc","pdfSize":"886259"}
