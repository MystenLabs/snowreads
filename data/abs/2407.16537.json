We validate a novel approach which models error rates as a function\nof relative textual predictability, and yields a single number, $k$, which\nmeasures the effect of textual predictability on the recognizer. We use this\nmethod to demonstrate that a Wav2Vec 2.0-based model makes greater stronger use\nof textual context than a hybrid ASR model, in spite of not using an explicit\nlanguage model, and also use it to shed light on recent results demonstrating\npoor performance of standard ASR systems on African-American English. We\ndemonstrate that these mostly represent failures of acoustic--phonetic\nmodelling. We show how this approach can be used straightforwardly in\ndiagnosing and improving ASR.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"9B9ZR1uoJySxq_Def8YAcpfvRi5CwLi-RnFc8aWgG14","pdfSize":"307254"}
