We study how the difference operator interacts with limits\nand colimits as categorical versions of the usual product and sum rules. The\nfirst main result is a lax chain rule which has no counterpart for mere\nfunctions. We also show that many important classes of functors (polynomials,\nanalytic functors, reduced powers, ...) are taut, and calculate explicit\nformulas for their differences. Covariant Dirichlet series are introduced and\nstudied. The second main result is a Newton summation formula expressed as an\nadjoint to the difference operator.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kcPyi-ncTE-_wsusNt9jOlim8F7ib-OJCBRGx9zNDck","pdfSize":"599148"}
