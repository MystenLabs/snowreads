We discuss two scenarios depending on\nwhether the magnomechanical coupling is linear or dispersive. We show that in\nboth cases the strong mechanical squeezing obtained via two-tone driving of the\noptical cavity can be efficiently transferred to the magnon mode. In the linear\ncoupling case, stationary magnon squeezing is achieved; while in the dispersive\ncoupling case, a transient magnonic squeezed state is prepared in a two-step\nprotocol. The proposed magnonic squeezed states find promising applications in\nquantum information processing and quantum sensing using magnons.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"1fjEXjf6g3waqvx-u49EPeXn7_Ooho3rm1aB3NSpdC4","pdfSize":"4981801","objectId":"0x0645bd639e29c278103ef9d8f5f938420a74d9ae57bc988af3a3576d3b58bcb3","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
