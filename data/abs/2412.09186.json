  "abstract": "  We discuss a nondeterministic variant of the recently introduced machine\nmodel of deterministic auxiliary depth-$k$ storage automata (or aux-$k$-sda's)\nby Yamakami. It was proven that all languages recognized by polynomial-time\nlogarithmic-space aux-$k$-sda's are located between $\\mathrm{LOGDCFL}$ and\n$\\mathrm{SC}^k$ (the $k$th level of Steve's class SC). We further propose a new\nand simple computational model of semi-unbounded fan-in Boolean circuits\ncomposed partly of cascading blocks, in which the first few AND gates of\nunbounded fan-out (called AND$_{(\\omega)}$ gates) at each layer from the left\n(where all gates at each layer are indexed from left to right) are linked in a\n\"cascading\" manner to their right neighbors though specific AND and OR gates.\nWe use this new circuit model to characterize a nondeterministic variant of the\naux-$2k$-sda's (called aux-$2k$-sna's) that run in polynomial time using\nlogarithmic work space. By relaxing the requirement for cascading circuits, we\nalso demonstrate how such cascading circuit families characterize the\ncomplexity class $\\mathrm{P}$. This yields an upper bound on the computational\ncomplexity of $\\mathrm{LOG}k\\mathrm{SNA}$ by $\\mathrm{P}$.\n",
