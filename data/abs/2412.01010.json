  "abstract": "  The Transfer Elastic Net is an estimation method for linear regression models\nthat combines $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ norm penalties to facilitate knowledge\ntransfer. In this study, we derive a non-asymptotic $\\ell_2$ norm estimation\nerror bound for the estimator and discuss scenarios where the Transfer Elastic\nNet effectively works. Furthermore, we examine situations where it exhibits the\ngrouping effect, which states that the estimates corresponding to highly\ncorrelated predictors have a small difference.\n",
