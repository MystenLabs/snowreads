An emulator is built using a feed-forward artificial neural\nnetwork (ANN). We train the ANN with nuclear data and relative abundance\npatterns. We take as input the $\\beta$-decay half-lives and the one-neutron\nseparation energy of the nuclei in the rare-earth region. The output is the\nfinal isotopic abundance pattern. In this work, we focus on the nuclear data\nand abundance patterns in the rare-earth region to reduce the dimension of the\ninput and output space. We show that the ANN can capture the effect of the\nchanges in the nuclear physics inputs on the final $r$-process abundance\npattern in the adopted astrophysical conditions. We employ the deep ensemble\nmethod to quantify the prediction uncertainty of the neutal network emulator.\nThe emulator achieves a speed-up by a factor of about 20,000 in obtaining a\nfinal abundance pattern in the rare-earth region. The emulator may be utilized\nin statistical analyses such as uncertainty quantification, inverse problems,\nand sensitivity analysis.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NTjuYVVvfm_Th2dZF5_CfbpKyJNn8mSVWAAIVAWj7wE","pdfSize":"1263060"}
