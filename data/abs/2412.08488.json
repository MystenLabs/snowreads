Under appropriate potential\nconditions, we obtain new Strichartz estimates and construct the new space to\nget orbital stability of normalized ground state. To our best knowledge, this\nis the first orbital stability result for this model. Our method is also\napplicable to other mixed nonlinear equations with potential.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PnwiedUfXrIQiPbE0_uJ6-TL8Qp68CSXEbGAB1iGWNY","pdfSize":"262777"}
