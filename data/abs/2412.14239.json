  "abstract": "  Monopoles are generally expected in Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) where they\ncan catalyze baryon decay at an unsuppressed rate by the Callan-Rubakov effect.\nFor the first time, we show this catalysis effect can generate the observed\nbaryon asymmetry at GeV scale temperatures. We study the minimal SU(5) GUT\nmodel and demonstrate that monopoles-fermion scattering with a $CP$-violating\n$\\theta$-term leads to realistic baryogenesis even when $\\theta\\lesssim\n10^{-10}$ is below the neutron EDM bound, potentially detectable in the future\nmeasurements. Our calculation also shows that to generate the observed baryon\nasymmetry, the abundance of the monopoles is below the current experiential\nbounds.\n",
