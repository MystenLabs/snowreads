Current text-based VQA systems\nlimit their utility in scenarios where hands-free interaction and accessibility\nare crucial while performing tasks. A speech-based VQA system may provide a\nbetter means of interaction where information can be accessed while performing\ntasks simultaneously. To this end, this work implements a speech-based VQA\nsystem by introducing a Textless Multilingual Pathological VQA (TMPathVQA)\ndataset, an expansion of the PathVQA dataset, containing spoken questions in\nEnglish, German & French. This dataset comprises 98,397 multilingual spoken\nquestions and answers based on 5,004 pathological images along with 70 hours of\naudio. Finally, this work benchmarks and compares TMPathVQA systems implemented\nusing various combinations of acoustic and visual features.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EEcPnY7-JCXf4n44XO56oqPCcvEMQJmQ1D8clLWZzfs","pdfSize":"359166"}
