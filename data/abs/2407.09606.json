We show some functorial properties of this assignment\nas a functor on the category of rigid analytic spaces. Moreover, we show that\nthere exists a full six functor formalism for the precomposition with the\nanalytification functor by evoking Ayoub's thesis. As an application, we\nidentify connective analytic K-theory in the unstable homotopy category with\nboth $\\mathbb{Z}\\times\\mathrm{BGL}$ and the analytification of connective\nalgebraic K-theory. As a consequence, we get a representability statement for\ncoefficients in light condensed spectra.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"vXkIImgMxTvbphowUzV5ly-737BieyUUrCowY9La2iw","pdfSize":"505311","objectId":"0x795000c7a4a1a5745e554b915946bc717223a1d994d6cc1fa1f31247eb983176","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
