In the\nsecond part we prove some properties of big and nef vector bundles. In\nparticular it is shown that the tensor product of a nef vector bundle with a\nnef and big vector bundle is again nef and big. This generalizes a result of\nSchneider.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UcTwVrqDrjYbkbtqQENYo_uwkWisksDVUnJJQtO7lZQ","pdfSize":"123877"}
