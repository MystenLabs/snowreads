  "abstract": "  A question if a polynomially bounded operator is similar to a contraction was\nposed by Halmos and was answered in the negative by Pisier. His counterexample\nis an operator of infinite multiplicity, while all its restrictions on\ninvariant subspaces of finite multiplicity are similar to contractions. In the\npaper, cyclic polynomially bounded operators which are not similar to\ncontractions and are quasisimilar to $C_0$-contractions or to isometries are\nconstructed. The construction is based on a perturbation of the sequence of\nfinite dimensional operators which is uniformly polynomially bounded, but is\nnot uniformly completely polynomially bounded, constructed by Pisier.\n",
