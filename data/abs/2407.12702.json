This paper proposes TransCAD, an end-to-end transformer-based\narchitecture that predicts the CAD sequence from a point cloud. TransCAD\nleverages the structure of CAD sequences by using a hierarchical learning\nstrategy. A loop refiner is also introduced to regress sketch primitive\nparameters. Rigorous experimentation on the DeepCAD and Fusion360 datasets show\nthat TransCAD achieves state-of-the-art results. The result analysis is\nsupported with a proposed metric for CAD sequence, the mean Average Precision\nof CAD Sequence, that addresses the limitations of existing metrics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Ai20u21Jhv7PZpnIoPr1IDM44yWOrHpy2NEAsEguxhk","pdfSize":"25292421"}
