We implement it and test it in\nrealistic conditions for its application to low-background dark matter searches\nlike the TREX-DM experiment. Methods: for this, we use a Micromegas of\nmicrobulk type, built with radiopure materials. A small test chamber allowing\nfor systematic scanning of voltages and pressures is used. In addition, a\nTREX-DM full-scale set-up has also been built and tested, featuring a replica\nof the fully-patterned TREX-DM microbulk readout. Results: we report on GEM\neffective extra gain factors of about 90, 50 and 20 in 1, 4 and 10 bar of\nAr-1%iC$_{4}$H$_{10}$. Conclusions: the results here obtained show promise to\nlower the threshold of the experiment down to 50 eV$_{ee}$, corresponding to\nsubstantially enhanced sensitivity to low-mass WIMPs (Weakly Interacting\nMassive Particles).\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"n9yoqFOrzb-USe-6jiYEVMqp98TJl-0jfVEF2vcZuR8","pdfSize":"3073501"}
