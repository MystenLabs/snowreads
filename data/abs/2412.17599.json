Motivated by\na similar question posed by Erd\\H{o}s and Graham in the unordered setting, we\nstudy the problem of bounding the ordered Ramsey number of any ordered graph\n$G$ with $m$ edges and no isolated vertices. We prove that $r_<(G) \\leq e^{10^9\n\\sqrt{m} (\\log \\log m)^{3/2}}$ for any such $G$, which is tight up to the\n$(\\log \\log m)^{3/2}$ factor in the exponent. As a corollary, we obtain the\ncorresponding bound for the oriented Ramsey number of a directed graph with $m$\nedges.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-Yf9TeMPnfm3YeXatERLyfHvhN27bb0vESpr0RaNot8","pdfSize":"251243"}
