  "abstract": "  We study the colour-dependence of scattering amplitudes in Yang-Mills theory\nwith arbitrary (but fixed) gauge group and various representations of charged\nmatter. When the rank of the gauge theory is taken arbitrarily large compared\nto the number of particles involved in an amplitude, it is well known that the\nnumber of independent colour-structure tensors grows factorially with\nmultiplicity; however, for any fixed gauge group, this number grows at most\nexponentially with multiplicity. We review how this counting arises in\nrepresentation theory and survey its implications for a wide variety of\nspecific gauge groups with various representations of charged matter,\nuncovering several surprising structures along the way.\n",
