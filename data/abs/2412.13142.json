To address the problem, we\npropose a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework for denoising STEM\nimages. Our method integrates spectral fidelity, total variation, and\nbrightness/contrast consistency losses to ensure the preservation of fine\nstructures, smooth regions, and physical signal intensities, maintaining the\nstructural integrity of the denoised images. Our proposed method effectively\nbalances noise reduction with the preservation of atomic resolution details and\ncomplements existing methods, seeking to enhance the utility of STEM images in\nmaterial characterization and analysis.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"L5Z_z_CimNOGbZL9KUiOFdPBnSS151t59mIt4xsEuf4","pdfSize":"2804386"}
