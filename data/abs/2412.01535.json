We employ three ensembles with\napproximately equal physical volume of about 5.5~fm, three values of the\nlattice spacing, approximately 0.06~fm, 0.07~fm and 0.08~fm, and with the mass\nof the degenerate up and down, strange and charm quarks tuned to approximately\ntheir physical values. We compute both isovector and isoscalar charges and\n$\\sigma$-terms and their flavor decomposition including the disconnected\ncontributions. We use the Akaike Information Criterion to evaluate systematic\nerrors due to excited states and the continuum extrapolation. For the nucleon\nisovector axial charge we find $g_A^{u-d}=1.250(24)$, in agreement with the\nexperimental value. Moreover, we extract the nucleon $\\sigma$-terms and find\nfor the light quark content $\\sigma_{\\pi N}=41.9(8.1)$~MeV and for the strange\n$\\sigma_{s}=30(17)$~MeV.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"l3ZVwqHVbJEPtFedBAcyr_nfSxi22XREjypSM6WF6XU","pdfSize":"5146380"}
