Nuclear energy is therefore\nunlikely to play a role in a future energy supply that relies on low costs and\nreliability.\n","subjects":["Physics/Popular Physics","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HtSZMG-oeevbaJDWfOy7aT9XI1XkWyqbcx1d5Z_5EqM","pdfSize":"1929792"}
