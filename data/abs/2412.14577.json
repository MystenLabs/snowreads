  "abstract": "  We show that certain radially symmetric steady states of compressible viscous\nfluids in domains with inflow/outflow boundary conditions are unconditionally\nstable. This means that any not necessarily radially symmetric solution of the\nassociated evolutionary problem converges to a single radially symmetric steady\nstate.\n",
