  "abstract": "  Following the research from the paper \"Triangles, squares and geodesics\"\n(arXiv:0910.5688) of Rena Levitt and Jon McCammond we investigate the\nproperties of groups acting on CAT(0) triangle-square complexes, focusing\nmostly on biautomaticity of such groups. In particular we show two examples of\nnonpositively curved triangle-square complexes $X_1$ and $X_2$, such that their\nuniversal covers violate conjectures given in the aforementioned paper. This\nshows that the Gersten-Short geodesics cannot be used as a way of proving\nbiautomaticity of groups acting on such complexes. Lastly we give a proof of\nbiautomaticity of $\\pi_1(X_1)$, however the biautomaticity of $\\pi_1(X_2)$\nremains unknown.\n",
