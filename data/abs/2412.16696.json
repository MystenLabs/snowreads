The gas of breathers is obtained from a $N$-breather\nsolution in the limit $N\\to \\infty$.\\\\ The limit is performed at the level of\nscattering data by letting the $N$-breather spectrum to fill uniformly a\nsuitable compact domain of the complex plane in the limit $N\\to\\infty$. The\ncorresponding norming constants are interpolated by a smooth function and\nscaled as $1/N$. For particular choices of the domain and the interpolating\nfunction, the gas of breathers behaves as finite breathers solution. This\nextends the shielding effect discovered in \"M. Bertola, T.
