Existing\nsupervised methods depend on datasets containing triplets of input image,\nedited image, and edit instruction. These are generated by either existing\nediting methods or human-annotations, which introduce biases and limit their\ngeneralization ability. Our method addresses these challenges by introducing a\nnovel editing mechanism called Cycle Edit Consistency (CEC), which applies\nforward and backward edits in one training step and enforces consistency in\nimage and attention spaces. This allows us to bypass the need for ground-truth\nedited images and unlock training for the first time on datasets comprising\neither real image-caption pairs or image-caption-edit triplets. We empirically\nshow that our unsupervised technique performs better across a broader range of\nedits with high fidelity and precision. By eliminating the need for\npre-existing datasets of triplets, reducing biases associated with supervised\nmethods, and proposing CEC, our work represents a significant advancement in\nunblocking scaling of instruction-based image editing.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jGo_-6wxlCHwZMFBA-q2I5G2PCiIi_O4m3gWai-ik_s","pdfSize":"5902757"}
