The data used in this\nwork were collected at five radio frequencies, 4.8, 8.0, 14.5, 22.0, and 37.0\nGHz between 1979--2013 as observed at the University of Michigan Radio\nAstronomical Observatory, Crimean Astrophysical Observatory, and Aalto\nUniversity Mets{\\\"a}hovi Radio Observatory. We employ generalized Lomb-Scargle\nperiodogram and weighted wavelet transform analyses to search for periodicities\nin these light curves. We confirm a QPO period of $\\sim$ 2000 day to be at\nleast 4$\\sigma$ significant using both methods at all five radio frequencies\nbetween 1979 and 2007, after which a strong flare changed the character of the\nlight curve. We also find a $\\sim$~600 day period which is at least 4$\\sigma$\nsignificant, but only in the 22.0 and 37.0 GHz light curves. We briefly discuss\nphysical mechanisms capable of producing such variations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Asc4TWhUTUWywDbuY0FV47sSgaUXrPeZg8dlbmu_IVM","pdfSize":"3810338"}
