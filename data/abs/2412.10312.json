  "abstract": "  A popular end-to-end architecture for selective rationalization is the\nselect-then-predict pipeline, comprising a generator to extract highlights fed\nto a predictor. Such a cooperative system suffers from suboptimal equilibrium\nminima due to the dominance of one of the two modules, a phenomenon known as\ninterlocking. While several contributions aimed at addressing interlocking,\nthey only mitigate its effect, often by introducing feature-based heuristics,\nsampling, and ad-hoc regularizations. We present GenSPP, the first\ninterlocking-free architecture for selective rationalization that does not\nrequire any learning overhead, as the above-mentioned. GenSPP avoids\ninterlocking by performing disjoint training of the generator and predictor via\ngenetic global search. Experiments on a synthetic and a real-world benchmark\nshow that our model outperforms several state-of-the-art competitors.\n",
