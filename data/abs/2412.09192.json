By a large-scale DFT\ncalculation (up to 4212 atoms), we propose a way to realize strongly\nspin-polarized bands in the absence of these ingredients by twisting monolayers\nof van der Waals magnetic semiconductor CrSBr. Furthermore, due to the highly\nanisotropic electronic transport in this material, the twist-induced electronic\ntransport becomes strongly coupled to the spin transport. We show that an\nin-plane electric field induces a transverse spin current, manifesting a\ntwist-tunable spin-Hall effect in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. Using\nhighthroughput computations, we also identify 231 other material candidates out\nof a set of 6000 magnetic two-dimensional materials, which satisfy the\nnecessary conditions to realize this behavior, paving the way to widespread\napplication of twist-tunable spin transport.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IrTjbMRx5gEjPsE4UuGvk2exnWLOmBSxKIvcZkztmmY","pdfSize":"1394999"}
