Simulators are used for purposes such as evaluation and\ntraining and are taken on various configurations accordingly. The ship\nmaneuvering mathematical model used in such a simulator is an important element\nthat characterizes the simulator. In this paper, we discuss the dynamic model\nof the hull and its position in the simulator that will be required for MASSs\nin the future. It also discusses guidelines for selecting an appropriate model,\nwhich has not been discussed extensively in previous studies. Finally, we\ndiscuss the functional requirements that simulators should have.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"66dJCNo2dHK0ey5PQRjnjiT7oDbT2BXemjEZeraBEEs","pdfSize":"825306"}
