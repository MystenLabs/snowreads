  "abstract": "  Systemic optimization of thermoelectric materials is arduous due to their\nconflicting electrical and thermal properties. A strategy based on Design of\nExperiments and machine learning is developed to optimize the thermoelectric\nefficiency of AgSb1+xTe2+y, an established thermoelectric. From eight\nexperiments, high thermoelectric performance in AgSb1.021Te2.04 is revealed\nwith a peak and average thermoelectric figure of merit of 1.61 +/- 0.24 at 600\nK and 1.18 +/- 0.18 (300 - 623 K), respectively, which is over 30% higher than\nthe best literature values for AgSb1+xTe2+y. Ag-deficiency and suppression of\nsecondary phases in AgSb1.021Te2.04 improves the electrical properties and\nreduces the thermal conductivity (~0.4 W m-1 K-1). Our strategy is implemented\ninto an open-source graphical user interface, and it can be used to optimize\nthe methodologies, properties, and processes across different scientific\nfields.\n",
