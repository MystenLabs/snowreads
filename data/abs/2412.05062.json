Therefore, we study the lattice thermal conductivities of\na series of (oligo)acenes, where an increasing number of rings per molecule\nleads to a systematic increase of the crystals' complexity.\nTemperature-dependent thermal conductivity experiments in these systems\ndisagree with predictions based on the traditional Peierls-Boltzmann framework,\nwhich describes heat transport in terms of particle-like phonon propagation. We\ndemonstrate that accounting for additional phonon-tunneling conduction\nmechanisms through the Wigner Transport Equation resolves this disagreement and\nquantitatively rationalizes experiments. The pronounced increase of tunneling\ntransport with temperature explains several unusual experimental observations,\nsuch as a weak temperature dependence in naphthalene's conductivity and an\nessentially temperature-invariant conductivity in pentacene. While the\nanisotropic conductivities within the acene planes are essentially\nmaterial-independent, the tunneling contributions (and hence the total\nconductivities) significantly increase with molecular length in the molecular\nbackbone direction, which for pentacene results in a surprising minimum of the\nthermal conductivity at 300K.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"G5q0V5qqWvoC_ZSewEXcHGJzMKcS6f6U5twl7BdC_VA","pdfSize":"8240859"}
