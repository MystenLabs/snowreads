It is based on our real-time\nenergy measurement system, which uses tiny beacons attached to electricity\nmeters. Four participants aged 67-82 years took part in our study. We observed\ntheir electric power consumption for approx. a month, and then we analyzed\nthem, taking into account the participants' notes on their activities. We\ncreated typical daily usage profiles for each participant and used anomaly\ndetection to find unusual energy consumption. We found out that real-time\nenergy measurement can give significant insight into someone's daily activities\nand, consequently, bring invaluable information to caregivers about the\nwell-being of an elderly person, while being discreet and entirely\nnon-intrusive.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7apMtpmBSpIAZeelNTre-vPPEk4CjKRIXk13AecSJqk","pdfSize":"542040","objectId":"0x54d5e318eaba0b774b1b56484136e215c8e9b2227ee097bee87d4fabf13bf766","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
