We prove the\ncorrectness and completeness of the approach and show that it performs very\nwell on 10 domains with required concurrency.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"G9Q9DDiOGLNaBPg69uAuelPml7D2wekO0uaD4DgspFk","pdfSize":"180985"}
