  "abstract": "  In this work we obtain weighted boundedness results for singular integral\noperators with kernels exhibiting exponential decay. We also show that the\nclasses of weights are characterized by a suitable maximal operator.\nAdditionally, we study the boundedness of various operators associated with the\ngeneralized Schr\\\"odinger operator $-\\Delta + \\mu$, where $\\mu$ is a\nnonnegative Radon measure in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, for $d\\geq 3$.\n",
