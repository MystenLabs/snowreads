  "abstract": "  We consider statistical inference for a class of mixed-effects models with\nsystem noise described by a non-Gaussian integrated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.\nUnder the asymptotics where the number of individuals goes to infinity with\npossibly unbalanced sampling frequency across individuals, we prove some\ntheoretical properties of the Gaussian quasi-likelihood function, followed by\nthe asymptotic normality and the tail-probability estimate of the associated\nestimator. In addition to the joint inference, we propose and investigate the\nthree-stage inference strategy, revealing that they are first-order equivalent\nwhile quantitatively different in the second-order terms. Numerical experiments\nare given to illustrate the theoretical results.\n",
