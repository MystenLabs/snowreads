  "abstract": "  This study applies machine learning to predict S&P 500 membership changes:\nkey events that profoundly impact investor behavior and market dynamics.\nQuarterly data from WRDS datasets (2013 onwards) was used, incorporating\nfeatures such as industry classification, financial data, market data, and\ncorporate governance indicators. Using a Random Forest model, we achieved a\ntest F1 score of 0.85, outperforming logistic regression and SVC models. This\nresearch not only showcases the power of machine learning for financial\nforecasting but also emphasizes model transparency through SHAP analysis and\nfeature engineering. The model's real world applicability is demonstrated with\npredicted changes for Q3 2023, such as the addition of Uber (UBER) and the\nremoval of SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG). By incorporating these predictions\ninto a trading strategy i.e. buying stocks announced for addition and shorting\nthose marked for removal, we anticipate capturing alpha and enhancing\ninvestment decision making, offering valuable insights into index dynamics\n",
