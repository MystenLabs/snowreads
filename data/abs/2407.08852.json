The precise delineation of such structures requires ample global\ncontext alongside understanding of textural patterns. CNNs specialise in the\nlatter, though their ability to generate global features is limited. Attention\nmeasures long range dependencies in images, capturing global context, though at\na large computational cost. We propose a gridded attention mechanism to address\nthis limitation, greatly increasing efficiency by processing multi-scale\nfeatures into smaller tiles. We also enhance the attention mechanism for\nincreased sensitivity to texture orientation, by measuring correlations across\nfeatures dependent on different orientations, in addition to channel and\npositional attention. We present results on a new dataset of astronomical\nimages, where the task is segmenting large contaminating dust clouds.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5Q9oB9-WPuvSdoKsOqw1XFmRCZZRTTVRkua21FFmxbg","pdfSize":"5056233","objectId":"0x2012fc1ed0dfe8362ad8ea7d0f03a986130d1a11d1b386f1a029f47e75d9201d","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
