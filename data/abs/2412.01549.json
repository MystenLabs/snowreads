It further\nuncovers the lack of effective digital peacebuilding initiatives. These issues\nparticularly impact women, who bear a disproportionate burden in the armed\nconflict. These repercussions extend beyond the digital sphere, affecting\nwomen's socio-economic conditions, safety, and well-being. This reality was\nstarkly evident during the war, where women faced gender-based and sexual\nviolence. The research findings disclose the interface between social media\npolarization, conflict, and gender based violence. It also reveals the\nmarginalization of women's voice in peacebuilding initiatives. This\nmarginalization in peacebuilding efforts can be attributed to hostile online\nenvironments, the digital divide, cultural and societal norms, as well as\ntop-down peace initiatives. The study highlights substantial gaps in leveraging\ndigital media for sustainable peace and empowering women's participation. The\nunregulated landscape of social media in Ethiopia exacerbates these problems,\nnecessitating heightened demands for accountability, especially from major\nsocial media platforms. The study recommends enhanced moderation and ethical\nconsiderations in algorithmic design gains traction, underlining the urgency\nfor transparent and responsible social media frameworks. It is also recommended\nthat digital peacebuilding initiatives should adopt a gender-sensitive and\ninclusive approach to address these complexities effectively and sustainably.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computers and Society","Computer Science/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eR2BtpWrUzs3gJZmM5G8fBnuCUxudm7Tolb1_p4_jyY","pdfSize":"685159"}
