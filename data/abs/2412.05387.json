  "abstract": "  In this paper, we study an inverse problem for identifying the initial value\nin a space-time fractional diffusion equation from the final time data. We show\nthe identifiability of this inverse problem by proving the existence of its\nunique solution with respect to the final observed data. It is proved that the\ninverse problem is an ill-posed problem. Namely, we prove that the solution to\nthe inverse problem does not depend continuously on the measured data. The\ninverse problem is formulated as a regularized optimization one minimizing a\nleast-squares type cost functional. Then the conjugate gradient method combined\nwith Morozov's discrepancy is proposed for finding a stable approximate\nsolution to the regularized variational problem. Numerical examples with\nnoise-free and noisy data illustrate the applicability and high accuracy of the\nproposed method to some extent.\n",
