Unlike previous methods -- such as CV\ndazzle, adversarial patches, and theatrical disguises -- this work achieves\neffective obfuscation through subtle modifications to key-point regions,\nparticularly the brow, nose bridge, and jawline. Empirical testing with Haar\ncascade classifiers and commercial systems like BetaFaceAPI and Microsoft Bing\nVisual Search reveals that vertical perturbations near dense facial key points\nsignificantly disrupt detection without relying on overt disguises.\nAdditionally, leveraging alpha transparency attacks in PNG images creates a\ndual-layer effect: faces remain visible to human observers but disappear in\nmachine-readable RGB layers, rendering them unidentifiable during reverse image\nsearches. The results highlight the potential for creating scalable,\nlow-visibility facial obfuscation strategies that balance effectiveness and\nsubtlety, opening pathways for defeating surveillance while maintaining\nplausible anonymity.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"FpoOldSj94kFk6pPTjPUGgbNtrQ353wKnfvp5oP8OfE","pdfSize":"728592"}
