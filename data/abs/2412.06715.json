Here, we use the transpose channel to analytically\nobtain the near-optimal performance of any Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code\nunder pure loss and pure amplification. We present rigorous connections between\nGKP code's near-optimal performance and its dual lattice geometry and average\ninput energy. With no energy constraint, we show that when $\\vert\\frac{\\tau}{1\n- \\tau}\\vert$ is an integer, specific families of GKP codes simultaneously\nachieve the loss and amplification capacity. $\\tau$ is the transmissivity\n(gain) for loss (amplification). Our results establish GKP code as the first\nstructured bosonic code family that achieves the capacity of loss and\namplification.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9tSVISmY4J7jVscK-8BuCJjsMJZ90iAytHBmAec7aRc","pdfSize":"1590944"}
