The proposed AMEGO-X is enabled by a\nsilicon tracker utilizing AstroPix chips - a pixelated silicon HVCMOS sensor\nnovel for space use. To achieve science goals, each 500 x 500 $\\mu$m$^2$ pixel\nmust be sensitive for energy deposits ranging from 25 - 700 keV with an energy\nresolution of 5 keV at 122 keV (< 10%). This is achieved through depletion of\nthe 500 $\\mu$m thick sensor, although complete depletion poses an engineering\nand design challenge. This work will summarize the current status of depletion\nmeasurements highlighting direct measurement with TCT laser scanning and the\nagreement with simulation. Future plans for further testing will also be\nidentified.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TbCi5Un6q8HNUHibQCbth5H6zOJKfuSRI751KWSfHDI","pdfSize":"6749153"}
