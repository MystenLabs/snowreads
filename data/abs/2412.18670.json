The\nISO/IEC 42001 standard provides a foundation for fulfilling these requirements\nbut does not cover all EU-specific regulatory stipulations. To enhance the\nimplementation of the AIA in Germany, the Federal Office for Information\nSecurity (BSI) could introduce the national standard BSI 200-5, which specifies\nAIA requirements and integrates existing ISMS standards, such as ISO/IEC 27001.\nThis paper examines the interfaces between an information security management\nsystem (ISMS) and an AI management system (AIMS), demonstrating that\nincorporating existing ISMS controls with specific AI extensions presents an\neffective strategy for complying with Article 15 of the AIA. Four new AI\nmodules are introduced, proposed for inclusion in the BSI IT Grundschutz\nframework to comprehensively ensure the security of AI systems. Additionally,\nan approach for adapting BSI's qualification and certification systems is\noutlined to ensure that expertise in secure AI handling is continuously\ndeveloped. Finally, the paper discusses how the BSI could bridge international\nstandards and the specific requirements of the AIA through the nationalization\nof ISO/IEC 42001, creating synergies and bolstering the competitiveness of the\nGerman AI landscape.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Cryptography and Security","Computer Science/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wKN7WR6ehPVkQK6yGYEitMQbJ2QRW2_ogNTRlZcbbX0","pdfSize":"228631"}
