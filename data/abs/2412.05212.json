  "abstract": "  A key unresolved question in microbial ecology is how the extraordinary\ndiversity of microbiomes emerges from the behaviour of individual populations.\nThis process is driven by the cross-feeding networks that structure these\ncommunities, but are hard to untangle due to their inherent complexity. We\naddress this problem using the tools of network science to develop a model of\nmicrobial community structure. We discover tipping points at which diversity\nabruptly declines due to the catastrophic collapse of cross-feeding networks.\nOur results are a rare example of an ecological tipping point in diversity and\nprovide insight into the fundamental processes shaping microbiota and their\nrobustness. We illustrate this by showing how the unculturability of microbial\ndiversity emerges as an inherent property of their microbial cross-feeding\nnetworks.\n",
