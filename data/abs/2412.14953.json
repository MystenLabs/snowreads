  "abstract": "  We simulate high-pressure hydrogen in its liquid phase close to molecular\ndissociation using a machine-learned interatomic potential. The model is\ntrained with density functional theory (DFT) forces and energies, with the\nPerdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional. We show that an\naccurate NequIP model, an E(3)-equivariant neural network potential, accurately\nreproduces the phase transition present in PBE. Moreover, the computational\nefficiency of this model allows for substantially longer molecular dynamics\ntrajectories, enabling us to perform a finite-size scaling (FSS) analysis to\ndistinguish between a crossover and a true first-order phase transition. We\nlocate the critical point of this transition, the liquid-liquid phase\ntransition (LLPT), at 1200-1300 K and 155-160 GPa, a temperature lower than\nmost previous estimates and close to the melting transition.\n",
