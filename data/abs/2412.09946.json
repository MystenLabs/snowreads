We introduce a novel Chinese nursing dataset and implement\nincremental pre-training (IPT) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) techniques to\nenhance LLM performance in specialized tasks. Using LangChain, we develop a\ndynamic nursing assistant capable of real-time care and personalized\ninterventions. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements,\npaving the way for AI-driven solutions to meet the growing demands of\nhealthcare in aging populations.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"W_8DUYvLWfUKVrzqcPEH4xkT61u3xZfXRVcYgiKfTs4","pdfSize":"143635"}
