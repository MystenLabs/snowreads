Depending on whether the\ntop-quark produced together with the $H^{\\pm}$ decays hadronically or\nsemi-leptonically, the search targets $\\tau$+jets or $\\tau$+lepton final\nstates, in both cases with a $\\tau$-lepton decaying into a neutrino and\nhadrons. No significant excess over the Standard Model background expectation\nis observed. For the mass range of $80 \\leq m_{H^{\\pm}} \\leq 3000$ GeV, upper\nlimits at 95% confidence level are set on the production cross-section of the\ncharged Higgs boson times the branching fraction $\\mathrm{\\cal{B}}(H^{\\pm} \\to\n\\tau^{\\pm}\\nu_{\\tau})$ in the range 4.5 pb-0.4 fb. In the mass range 80-160\nGeV, assuming the Standard Model cross-section for $t\\bar{t}$ production, this\ncorresponds to upper limits between 0.27% and 0.02% on $\\mathrm{\\cal{B}}(t\\to\nbH^{\\pm}) \\times \\mathrm{\\cal{B}}(H^{\\pm} \\to \\tau^{\\pm}\\nu_{\\tau})$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"g41gmeTQz8nNKxzZV4COg3Z66vEqPL94i-q9u0GcPA0","pdfSize":"1835344"}
