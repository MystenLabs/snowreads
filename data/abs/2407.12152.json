CLP learns from\nmolecular string representations (e.g., Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry\nSystems [SMILES] and Self-Referencing Embedded Strings [SELFIES]) with methods\nakin to natural language processing. Despite their growing importance, training\npredictive CLP models is far from trivial, as it involves many 'bells and\nwhistles'. Here, we analyze the key elements of CLP training, to provide\nguidelines for newcomers and experts alike. Our study spans three neural\nnetwork architectures, two string representations, three embedding strategies,\nacross ten bioactivity datasets, for both classification and regression\npurposes. This 'hitchhiker's guide' not only underscores the importance of\ncertain methodological choices, but it also equips researchers with practical\nrecommendations on ideal choices, e.g., in terms of neural network\narchitectures, molecular representations, and hyperparameter optimization.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vz9xhanJdLo22MmZzdmJu_65He9DN2DCvfctcZEw2Pg","pdfSize":"519363"}
