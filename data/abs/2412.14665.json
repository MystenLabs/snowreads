  "abstract": "  Preconditioned eigenvalue solvers offer the possibility to incorporate\npreconditioners for the solution of large-scale eigenvalue problems, as they\narise from the discretization of partial differential equations. The\nconvergence analysis of such methods is intricate. Even for the relatively\nsimple preconditioned inverse iteration (PINVIT), which targets the smallest\neigenvalue of a symmetric positive definite matrix, the celebrated analysis by\nNeymeyr is highly nontrivial and only yields convergence if the starting vector\nis fairly close to the desired eigenvector. In this work, we prove a new\nnon-asymptotic convergence result for a variant of PINVIT. Our proof proceeds\nby analyzing an equivalent Riemannian steepest descent method and leveraging\nconvexity-like properties. We show a convergence rate that nearly matches the\none of PINVIT. As a major benefit, we require a condition on the starting\nvector that tends to be less stringent. This improved global convergence\nproperty is demonstrated for two classes of preconditioners with theoretical\nbounds and a range of numerical experiments.\n",
