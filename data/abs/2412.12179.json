{"id":"2412.12179","title":"Towards a (meta-)mathematical theory of consciousness: universal\n  (mapping) properties of experience","authors":"Steven Phillips, Naotsugu Tsuchiya","authorsParsed":[["Phillips","Steven",""],["Tsuchiya","Naotsugu",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2024 03:06:24 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-18","timestamp":1734059184000,"abstract":"  Conscious (subjective) experience permeates our daily lives, yet general\nconsensus on a theory of consciousness remains elusive. Integrated Information\nTheory (IIT) is a prominent approach that asserts the existence of subjective\nexperience (0th axiom), from an intrinsic system of causally related units, and\nfive essential properties (axioms 1-5): intrinsicality, information,\nintegration, exclusion and composition. However, despite empirical support for\nsome aspects of IIT, the supposed necessity of these axioms is unclear given\ntheir informal presentation and operationalized dependence on a specific\nmathematical instantiation as the so-called postulates. The category theory\napproach presented here attempts to redress this situation. Category theory is\na kind of meta-mathematics invented to make relations between formal structures\nformally precise and so facilitate doing \"ordinary\" mathematics. In this way,\nthe five essential properties for consciousness are organized around a smaller\nnumber of meta-mathematical principles for comparison with IIT. In particular,\ncategory theory characterizes mathematical structures by their \"universal\nmapping properties\" -- a unique-existence condition for all instances of the\nstructure. Accordingly, axioms 1-5 pertain to universal mapping properties for\nexperience, whence the slogan, \"Consciousness is a universal property.\"\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bklPHBf82-o-IV8VfHopjHK7Lqm-iZocgZiWvXjiJxo","pdfSize":"391798"}
