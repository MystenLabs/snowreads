  "abstract": "  The most studied class of Condorcet domains (acyclic sets of linear orders)\nis the class of peak-pit domains of maximal width. It has a number of\ncombinatorial representations by such familiar combinatorial objects like\nrhombus tilings and arrangements of pseudolines. Arrow's single-peaked domains\nare peak-pit but do not have maximal width. We suggest how to represent them by\nmeans of generalised arrangements of pseudolines.\n",
