It has a number of\ncombinatorial representations by such familiar combinatorial objects like\nrhombus tilings and arrangements of pseudolines. Arrow's single-peaked domains\nare peak-pit but do not have maximal width. We suggest how to represent them by\nmeans of generalised arrangements of pseudolines.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"S1T5heTKUn5KhbBlErC7U0U95OBhJd1_NPsqbTspYLY","pdfSize":"125136"}
