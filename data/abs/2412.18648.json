{"id":"2412.18648","title":"Twist like behavior in non-twist patterns of triods","authors":"Sourav Bhattacharya and Ashish Yadav","authorsParsed":[["Bhattacharya","Sourav",""],["Yadav","Ashish",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Dec 2024 18:37:16 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-30","timestamp":1735065436000,"abstract":"  We prove a sufficient condition for a \\emph{pattern} $\\pi$ on a \\emph{triod}\n$T$ to have \\emph{rotation number} $\\rho_{\\pi}$ coincide with an end-point of\nits \\emph{forced rotation interval} $I_{\\pi}$. Then, we demonstrate the\nexistence of peculiar \\emph{patterns} on \\emph{triods} that are neither\n\\emph{triod twists} nor possess a \\emph{block structure} over a \\emph{triod\ntwist pattern}, but their \\emph{rotation numbers} are an end point of their\nrespective \\emph{forced rotation intervals}, mimicking the behavior of\n\\emph{triod twist patterns}. These \\emph{patterns}, absent in circle maps (see\n\\cite{almBB}), highlight a key difference between the rotation theories for\n\\emph{triods} (introduced in \\cite{BMR}) and that of circle maps. We name these\n\\emph{patterns}: ``\\emph{strangely ordered}\" and show that they are\nsemi-conjugate to circle rotations via a piece-wise monotone map. We conclude\nby providing an algorithm to construct unimodal \\emph{strangely ordered\npatterns} with arbitrary \\emph{rotation pairs}.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4cLwYSM2-hGlKcbZ0LMTn-8Lq9mkB5a08zjXjiK-bc4","pdfSize":"997564"}
