  "abstract": "  Disfluencies are a natural feature of spontaneous human speech but are\ntypically absent from the outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs). This absence\ncan diminish the perceived naturalness of synthesized speech, which is an\nimportant criteria when building conversational agents that aim to mimick human\nbehaviours. We show how the insertion of disfluencies can alleviate this\nshortcoming. The proposed approach involves (1) fine-tuning an LLM with\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to incorporate various types of disfluencies into\nLLM-generated utterances and (2) synthesizing those utterances using a\ntext-to-speech model that supports the generation of speech phenomena such as\ndisfluencies. We evaluated the quality of the generated speech across two\nmetrics: intelligibility and perceived spontaneity. We demonstrate through a\nuser study that the insertion of disfluencies significantly increase the\nperceived spontaneity of the generated speech. This increase came, however,\nalong with a slight reduction in intelligibility.\n",
