Model pruning is an effective method for model compression.\nHowever, existing methods rarely take into account the specificity of remote\nsensing images, resulting in significant accuracy loss after pruning. To this\nend, we propose an effective structural pruning approach for remote sensing\nimage classification. Specifically, a pruning strategy that amplifies the\ndifferences in channel importance of the model is introduced. Then an adaptive\nmining loss function is designed for the fine-tuning process of the pruned\nmodel. Finally, we conducted experiments on two remote sensing classification\ndatasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves minimal\naccuracy loss after compressing remote sensing classification models, achieving\nstate-of-the-art (SoTA) performance.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"CxzAIxf3DOG2GEtqQ1YCNxflfe-YLNlQZ5V_MarvFy8","pdfSize":"947192"}
