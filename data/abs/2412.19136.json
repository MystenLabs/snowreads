Here, we investigate the\nmagnetic properties of bulk CrSBr$_{1-x}$Cl$_x$ ($x = 0{-}1$) and the\nstrain-dependent switchable magnetic phases in bilayers CrSBr, CrSCl, and\nCrSBr/CrSCl heterostructures, using firstprinciples calculations. Our findings\ndemonstrate that Cl incorporation in CrSBr induces competing interlayer\nantiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic couplings, leading to a spin-glass state\nwhen the Cl content exceeds a 67%. This is accompanied by a decrease of\nmagnetic anisotropy, where a $XY$-type magnetic ground state is observed in\npristine CrSCl. For CrSBr and CrSCl bilayers, we report a reversible\nstrain-induced switching between interlayer antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic\nconfigurations. Furthermore, we reveal the emergence of interfacial\nferromagnetism in CrSBr/CrSCl heterostructures, stabilizing an in-plane\nmagnetization axis for CrSCl by proximity to CrSBr. These results underscore\nthe potential of manipulating magnetism in 2D magnetic materials through\nprecise control of magnetic phases.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sxaAoS3GX30fdEpM0ujBHMNX5h1KpTRBvUkMWjJJuAY","pdfSize":"1706871"}
