  "abstract": "  We present a new method for obtaining norm bounds for random matrices, where\neach entry is a low-degree polynomial in an underlying set of independent\nreal-valued random variables. Such matrices arise in a variety of settings in\nthe analysis of spectral and optimization algorithms, which require\nunderstanding the spectrum of a random matrix depending on data obtained as\nindependent samples.\n  Using ideas of decoupling and linearization from analysis, we show a simple\nway of expressing norm bounds for such matrices, in terms of matrices of\nlower-degree polynomials corresponding to derivatives. Iterating this method\ngives a simple bound with an elementary proof, which can recover many bounds\npreviously required more involved techniques.\n",
