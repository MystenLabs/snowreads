  "abstract": "  We introduce PyPulse, a Python package for imputation of biosignals in both\nclinical and wearable sensor settings. Missingness is commonplace in these\nsettings and can arise from multiple causes, such as insecure sensor attachment\nor data transmission loss. PyPulse's framework provides a modular and\nextendable framework with high ease-of-use for a broad userbase, including\nnon-machine-learning bioresearchers. Specifically, its new capabilities include\nusing pre-trained imputation methods out-of-the-box on custom datasets, running\nthe full workflow of training or testing a baseline method with a single line\nof code, and comparing baseline methods in an interactive visualization tool.\nWe released PyPulse under the MIT License on Github and PyPI. The source code\ncan be found at: https://github.com/rehg-lab/pulseimpute.\n",
