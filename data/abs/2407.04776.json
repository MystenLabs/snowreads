With experiments on both published\nstatistics and synthetic data, we explore a particular privacy concern:\nrespondents in subsidized housing may deliberately not mention unauthorized\nchildren and other household members for fear of being evicted. By combining\npublic statistics from the Decennial Census and the Department of Housing and\nUrban Development, we demonstrate a simple, inexpensive reconstruction attack\nthat could identify subsidized households living in violation of occupancy\nguidelines in 2010. Experiments on synthetic data suggest that a random\nswapping mechanism similar to the Census Bureau's 2010 disclosure avoidance\nmeasures does not significantly reduce the precision of this attack, while a\ndifferentially private mechanism similar to the 2020 disclosure avoidance\nsystem does. Our results provide a valuable example for policymakers seeking a\ntrustworthy, accurate census.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"5FiC4A7oZD5ilbKCtAx5d15JMb-KGphy1WdOT1mLUvk","pdfSize":"2984160"}
