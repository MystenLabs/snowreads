The interplay between chaos,\nentropy dynamics, and Prigogine's dissipative systems offers profound insights\ninto the emergence, stabilization, and eventual collapse of\nfar-from-equilibrium systems. This study proposes that, alongside thermodynamic\ndissipative systems as highlighted by Ilya Prigogine, informational dissipative\nsystems actively contribute to granting inanimate matter properties\ncharacteristic of living systems, such as autopoiesis. By examining cyclic\nentropy flows between water topology (Shannon space) and molecular systems\n(Boltzmann space), the work emphasizes the pivotal role of disquisotropic\nentropy, an informational entropy reservoir arising from imperfections in\nmolecular structures. The analysis demonstrates that chaos functions as a\nstabilizing force, enhancing resilience, adaptability, and longevity by\ndelaying thermodynamic equilibrium. This research connects foundational\nthermodynamic principles with the emergent behavior of chaotic systems, paving\nthe way for a deeper understanding of complexity in natural and technological\ncontexts. By exploring the relationship between chaos, entropy, and dissipative\ndynamics, the study advances a paradigm where disorder becomes a mechanism to\nsustain order, a hallmark of life and complex systems.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Subcellular Processes"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"jykqJdOM3v9boNjAR3KiZZ_LY20uTBaDIoAO_UBBBnI","pdfSize":"1993810"}
