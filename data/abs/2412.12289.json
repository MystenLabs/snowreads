  "abstract": "  An important object appearing in the framework of the Tomita--Takesaki theory\nis an invariant cone under the modular automorphism group of von Neumann\nalgebras. As a result of the connection between von Neumann algebras and\nquantum field theory, von Neumann algebras have become increasingly important\nfor (higher) category theory and topology.\n  We show explicitly how an example of a class of cones discovered by\nConnes--Araki--Haagerup (CAH), invariant under the modular automorphism group,\nare related to Wishart laws and information geometry. Given its relation to 2D\nquantum field theory this highlights new relations between (quantum)\ninformation geometry and quantum geometry.\n",
