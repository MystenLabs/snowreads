{"id":"2412.04348","title":"Influence of mergers on LyC escape of high redshift galaxies","authors":"Ivan Kostyuk, Benedetta Ciardi","authorsParsed":[["Kostyuk","Ivan",""],["Ciardi","Benedetta",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2024 17:08:01 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-06","timestamp":1733418481000,"abstract":"  Aims: We investigate the impact of galaxy mergers on the Lyman Continuum\n(LyC) radiation escape, fesc, from high-redshift galaxies. Methods: We\npost-process ~ 6e5 galaxies (redshift 5.2 < z < 10) extracted from the TNG50\ncosmological simulation using a physically motivated analytic model for LyC\nescape. Results: Galaxies that have not experienced a merger for the last ~ 700\nMyr have an average fesc ~ 3%, which increases to up to 14% immediately\nfollowing a merger. The strongest effect can be observed in galaxies with\nstellar masses of ~ 1e7 Msun. We attribute the increase in the escape fraction\nto two main factors: (i) accretion of metal-poor gas onto the central region of\na galaxy, which feeds star formation and LyC emission; and (ii) displacement of\nneutral gas relative to star-forming regions, which reduces the optical depth\nto LyC photons. We additionally examine how proximity to other galaxies\ninfluences LyC escape, finding that galaxies with more neighbors tend to have\nmore frequent mergers, and thus a higher LyC leakage. However, galaxies in\noverdense regions tend to have a larger LyC escape fraction independently from\nmergers, because of their higher gas inflow, and consequent increase in the\nstar formation rate. The increase in both mergers and gas inflow could\ncontribute to low-mass galaxies ionizing proximity zones of high-z Ly-alpha\nleakers recently observed with JWST.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MHmuN2o_kwgSY3_dCP3FhXoPqzIES9K-TwazklNx1ME","pdfSize":"857885"}
