In the context of massive\nmachine-type communications (mMTC), a RIS can be used to support the\ntransmission from a group of sensors to a collector node. Due to the short data\npackets, we focus on the design of the RIS for maximizing the weighted sum and\nminimum rates in the finite blocklength regime. Under the assumption of\nnon-orthogonal multiple access, successive interference cancelation is\nconsidered as a decoding scheme to mitigate interference. Accordingly, we\nformulate the optimizations as non-convex problems and propose two sub-optimal\nsolutions based on gradient ascent (GA) and sequential optimization (SO) with\nsemi-definite relaxation (SDR). In the GA, we distinguish between Euclidean and\nRiemannian gradients. For the SO, we derive a concave lower bound for the\nthroughput and maximize it sequentially applying SDR. Numerical results show\nthat the SO can outperform the GA and that strategies relying on the\noptimization of the classical Shannon capacity might be inadequate for mMTC\nnetworks.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Gb8c9km9ILJBzSUvT6hbqNW6cXR5bIwwsS_i1GYS0_E","pdfSize":"479445"}
