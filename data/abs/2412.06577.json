  "abstract": "  We explore the effect of Couette flow on knotted linear polymer chains with\nextensive Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Hydrodynamic interactions are\naccounted for by means of Multi-Particle Collision Dynamics (MPCD). The polymer\nchain, containing originally a simple trefoil knot at rest, is described by a\ncoarse-grained bead-spring model in a coil or globular state. We demonstrate\nthat under shear existing loosely localized knots in polymer coils typically\ntighten to several segments beyond a certain shear rate threshold. At large\nshear rates the polymer undergoes a tumbling-like motion during which knot\nsizes can fluctuate. In contrast, sheared knotted globules unwind into a\nconvoluted pearl-necklace structure of sub-globules that folds back onto itself\nand in which knot types change over time.\n",
