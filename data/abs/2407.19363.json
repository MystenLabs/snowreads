We develop our formalism within the framework of the chiral action and\nderive the equations of motion of the theory. One particular test model is\nexplored: since anisotropy is an intrinsic property of the theory, a modified\nversion of the spatially flat Bianchi I model with two different scale factors\nis considered. We apply our formalism and derive the Friedmann equations which\nregulate the scale factors and the Higgs field. We also present a Proca-like\nterm for the connection, which when reduced to minisuperspace with a positive\n$\\Lambda$ yields a De Sitter universe with an effective cosmological constant\nthat depends on the mass of the gauge fields. We finally investigate the effect\nof these mass terms on gravitational waves and find that the wave equation\nremains unchanged relatively to GR; however the Weyl tensor is scaled by a\nconstant which depends on the mass of the connection components.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"M_p1fxXPzhuk6yaGAL3oFuEcGUmdNfaRr63t2kpk1A0","pdfSize":"146054"}
