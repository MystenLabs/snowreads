As such, eavesdroppers can be\ndetected by analyzing the error rate in the shared key obtained by the parties\nperforming the key exchange. Nevertheless, this paper developed and\ninvestigated a novel attack strategy capable of being undetected through error\nanalysis of the shared key. Said attack entails an eavesdropper measuring the\nquantum channel (i.e., the channel used to transmit quantum particles between\ntwo parties) using a higher dimension than that used by the legitimate parties.\nBy measuring a particle in a dimension that spans all possible states in a\ngiven quantum key distribution algorithm, the collapsed state of the measured\nparticle should be undetectable when measured in the lower dimension. To\nanalyze the proposed high-dimensional eavesdropping attack, the simulator Cirq\nwas used to model the attack on BB84, a four-dimensional variant of BB84, and\nthe Six-State Protocol. The results of these simulations show the efficiency of\nthis attack, with an eavesdropper being undetectable through quantum bit error\nrate analysis in each algorithm This promotes the need for further analysis of\nthe high-dimensional eavesdropping attack on physical hardware and other\nquantum key distribution algorithms\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5ZccZt7OpAkcYLusTWvpS_spenpF5uknQX7av0HJGAU","pdfSize":"328596"}
