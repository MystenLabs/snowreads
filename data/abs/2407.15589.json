However, these claims have not been thoroughly\nanalyzed yet. Recently, foundation models have demonstrated unparalleled\ncapabilities across diverse domains from language to computer vision, marking\nthem as a potential cornerstone of future research for a multitude of\ncomputational tasks. In this paper, we conduct an extensive empirical study on\nrepresentation learning for downstream Visual Question Answering (VQA), which\nrequires an accurate compositional understanding of the scene. We thoroughly\ninvestigate the benefits and trade-offs of OC models and alternative approaches\nincluding large pre-trained foundation models on both synthetic and real-world\ndata, and demonstrate a viable way to achieve the best of both worlds. The\nextensiveness of our study, encompassing over 800 downstream VQA models and 15\ndifferent types of upstream representations, also provides several additional\ninsights that we believe will be of interest to the community at large.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ytly1Mx3L4DjKWuesKJjlTf2uxpUmJ0xegtPx_8Y0l0","pdfSize":"1447900"}
