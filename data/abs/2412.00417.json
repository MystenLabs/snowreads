  "abstract": "  Correctness is one of the more important criteria of qualitative software.\nHowever, it is often taught in isolation and most students consider it only as\nan afterthought. They also do not receive sufficient feedback on code quality\nand tests unless specified in the assignment. To improve this, we developed a\nprocedural guidance that guides students to an implementation with appropriate\ntests. Furthermore, we have developed a toolkit that students can use to\nindependently get individual feedback on their solution and the adequateness of\ntheir tests. A key instrument is a test coverage analysis which allows for\nteachers to customize the feedback with constructive instructions specific to\nthe current assignment to improve a student's test suite. In this paper, we\noutline the procedural guidance, explain the working of the feedback toolkit\nand present a method for using the toolkit in conjunction with the different\nsteps of the procedural guidance.\n",
