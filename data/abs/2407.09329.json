In a previous paper, we introduce the notion of formal manifolds\nand develop the foundational framework of formal manifolds. In this paper, we\nstudy various function spaces on formal manifolds, including generalizations of\nvector-valued generalized functions and vector-valued distributions on smooth\nmanifolds to the setting of formal manifolds.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"m-B-3Jicx0aZZjjY_NZrSo6DKVZU5mwWGM2n09m8l8A","pdfSize":"525218"}
