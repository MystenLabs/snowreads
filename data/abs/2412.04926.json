  "abstract": "  In this proceedings article we survey the results in [5] and their\nmotivation, as presented at the 50th Journ\\'ees EDP 2024. With the aim of\nquantifying turbulent behaviors of vortex filaments, we study the\nmultifractality of a family of generalized Riemann's non-differentiable\nfunctions. These functions represent, in a certain limit, the trajectory of\nregular polygonal vortex filaments that evolve according to the binormal flow,\nthe classical model for vortex filaments dynamics. We explain how we determined\ntheir spectrum of singularities through a careful design of Diophantine sets,\nwhich we study by using the Duffin-Schaeffer theorem and the Mass Transference\nPrinciple.\n",
