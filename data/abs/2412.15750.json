  "abstract": "  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance across a wide\nrange of tasks. However, the size of LLMs is steadily increasing, hindering\ntheir application on computationally constrained environments. On the other\nhand, despite their general capabilities, there are many situations where only\none specific task is performed, rendering all other capabilities unnecessary\nand wasteful. This leads us to the following question: Is it possible to\nextract the minimal subset from an LLM that is able to perform a specific task\nin a faster, standalone manner? Recent works on Mechanistic Interpretability\n(MI) have shown that specific tasks are performed by a localized subset of\ncomponents, or circuit. However, current techniques used to identify the\ncircuit cannot be used to extract it for its standalone usage. In this work, we\npropose a novel approach to automatically extract the subset of the LLM that\nproperly performs a targeted task requiring no additional training and a small\namount of data samples. We evaluate our approach on different tasks and show\nthat the resulting models are (i) considerably smaller, reducing the number of\nparameters up to 82.77% and (ii) more interpretable, as they focus on the\ncircuit that is used to carry out the specific task, and can therefore be\nunderstood using MI techniques.\n",
