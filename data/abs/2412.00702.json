  "abstract": "  We propose a method to improve the generalization of skin lesion\nclassification models by combining self-supervised learning (SSL) and active\ndomain adaptation (ADA). The main steps of the approach include selection of an\nSSL pre-trained model on natural image datasets, subsequent SSL retraining on\nall available skin-lesion datasets, fine-tuning of the model on source domain\ndata with labels, and application of ADA methods on target domain data. The\nefficacy of the proposed approach is assessed in ten skin lesion datasets with\nfive different ADA methods, demonstrating its potential to improve\ngeneralization in settings with different amounts of domain shifts.\n",
