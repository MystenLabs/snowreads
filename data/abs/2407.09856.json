The best\nestimate omega=1.546(30) has been obtained from the finite-size scaling of the\nsusceptibility data in the range of linear lattice sizes L from 128 to 2048 at\nthe critical value of the Binder cumulant, this result is confirmed also by\nseveral other MC estimations. It served as a basis for a critical\nreconsideration of some earlier theoretical conjectures and scaling\nassumptions. In particular, we have corrected and refined our previous analysis\nby grouping Feynman diagrams. The renewed analysis gives omega = 4-d-2 eta as\nsome approximation for spatial dimensions d<4, or omega approximately 1.5 in\ntwo dimensions. Our MC value is comparable with the known results of the\nepsilon-expansion.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tHD185zLkw6XZnhxny0hgk_2tdsQfbFTtrQkLu1Ndk8","pdfSize":"211444"}
