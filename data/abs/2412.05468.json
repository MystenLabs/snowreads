  "abstract": "  This paper presents a mathematical foundation for physical models in\nnonlinear optics through the lens of evolutionary equations. It focuses on two\nkey concepts: well-posedness and exponential stability of Maxwell equations,\nwith models that include materials with complex dielectric properties,\ndispersion, and discontinuities. We use a Hilbert space framework to address\nthese complex physical models in nonlinear optics. While our focus is on the\nfirst-order formulation in space and time, higher solution regularity recovers\nand equates to the second-order formulation. We incorporate perfectly matched\nlayers (PMLs), which model absorbing boundary conditions, to facilitate the\ndevelopment of numerical methods. We demonstrate that the combined system\nremains well-posed and exponentially stable. Our approach applies to a broad\nclass of partial differential equations (PDEs) and accommodates materials with\nnonlocal behavior in space and time. The contribution of this work is a unified\nframework for analyzing wave interactions in advanced optical materials.\n",
