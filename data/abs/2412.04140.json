We propose that memorization arises from isolated points in the\nlearned probability distribution, characterized by sharpness in the probability\nlandscape, as indicated by large negative eigenvalues of the Hessian. Through\nexperiments on various datasets, we demonstrate that these eigenvalues\neffectively detect and quantify memorization. Our approach provides a clear\nunderstanding of memorization in diffusion models and lays the groundwork for\ndeveloping strategies to ensure secure and reliable generative models\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nJuT-Nsmue3rWbioSpGSrdkj1tX35Eyyv3mxChTqO4s","pdfSize":"14165681"}
