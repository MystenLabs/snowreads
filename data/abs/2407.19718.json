We aim\nto improve the overall performance of integrated satellite-terrestrial maritime\ncommunication system. Thus, it makes sense to jointly optimize transmit\nbeamforming at the TBS and LEO satellite. Due to sea wave fluctuation, the\nobtained channel state information (CSI) is often imperfect. In this context, a\nrobust beamforming design algorithm is proposed with the goal of minimizing the\ntotal power consumption of integrated satellite-terrestrial maritime\ncommunication system while satisfying quality of service (QoS) requirements.\nBoth theoretical analysis and simulation results confirm the effectiveness of\nproposed algorithm in maritime communications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WCuOvKVOhS1HjFsfnjleX-6b105No35rEQVcvABvgzk","pdfSize":"364378","objectId":"0xbacb26772fc1e5349a20e0a0f7a60749af5a7f19089d3e2ef721072cb3795936","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
