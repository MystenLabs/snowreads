Through a comprehensive series of characterizations\ninvolving atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Raman\nspectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the\nresulting graphene nanosheets demonstrate superior crystallinity compared to\nthose obtained via the conventional method. The high-crystalline freestanding\ngraphene nanosheets derived from this method not only facilitate easier\nseparation but also significantly enhance the physical performance of the\noriginal materials. This method showcases the potential for scalable production\nof layered materials with increased yield and crystallinity, paving the way for\ntheir utilization in various applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"5seek6ZkgaA5-YSzD1qXQX-lnAWBqOQY0t0kRSOOX3c","pdfSize":"3649309"}
