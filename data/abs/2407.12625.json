The starting point is a\nnew abstract construction of general scope which, given three complexes linked\nby extension and reduction maps, generates a fourth complex with cohomology\nisomorphic to the former three. This construction is used to devise new\nserendipity versions of rot-rot and Stokes complexes derived in the Discrete de\nRham spirit.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"j_bZUvD-0uNgolnJSiGQ_ksyWn5G1pnU649Aesfjb58","pdfSize":"352244"}
