  "abstract": "  Using data from the LAMOST Medium-Resolution Spectroscopic Survey of Nebulae,\nwe create a sample of 17,821 diffuse ionized gas (DIG) spectra in the\nanti-center region of the Milky Way, by excluding fibers in the directions of H\nII regions and supernova remnants. We then analyze the radial and vertical\ndistributions of three line ratios ([N II]/H$\\alpha$, [S II]/H$\\alpha$, and [S\nII]/[N II]), as well as the oxygen abundance.\n  [N II]/H$\\alpha$ and [S II]/H$\\alpha$ do not exhibit a consistent, monotonic\ndecrease with increasing Galactocentric distance (R$_{gal}$). Instead, they\nshow enhancement within the interarm region, positioned between the Local Arm\nand the Perseus Arm. [S II]/[N II] has a radial gradient of 0.1415 $\\pm$ 0.0646\nkpc$^{-1}$ for the inner disk (8.34 $ < R_{gal} < $ 9.65 kpc), and remains\nnearly flat for the outer disk ($R_{gal} > $ 9.65 kpc). In the vertical\ndirection, [N II]/H$\\alpha$, [S II]/H$\\alpha$, and [S II]/[N II] increase with\nincreasing Galactic disk height ($|z|$) in both southern and northern disks.\n  Based on the N2S2H$\\alpha$ method, which combines [S II]/[N II] and [N\nII]/H$\\alpha$, we estimate the oxygen abundance. The oxygen abundance exhibits\na consistent radial gradient with R$_{gal}$, featuring a slope of -0.0559 $\\pm$\n0.0209 dex kpc$^{-1}$ for the inner disk and a similar slope of -0.0429 $\\pm$\n0.0599 dex kpc$^{-1}$ for the outer disk. A single linear fitting to the entire\ndisk yields a slope of -0.0317 $\\pm$ 0.0124 dex kpc$^{-1}$. In the vertical\ndirection, the oxygen abundance decreases with increasing $|z|$ in both\nsouthern and northern disks.\n",
