Let u($k$) (resp. u_s($k$))\ndenote the u-invariant (resp. the strong u-invariant) of $k$. We give a\ndescription of this invariant for $k$ in terms of the u-invariant (resp. the\nstrong u-invariant) of its residue field. Let $C$ be a curve over $k$ and $F$ =\n$k(C)$. We prove similar results for the u-invariant of $F$. For $l$ a prime\naway from the characteristic of the residue field of $k$, we obtain bounds for\nthe Brauer-$l$-dimensions of $k$ and $F$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6Rw6U9KUwRge0prmptraeOXuOrReYKoWO9It85257NM","pdfSize":"244543"}
