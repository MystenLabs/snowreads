  "abstract": "  We study mixed state entanglement measures in a higher dimensional $T\\bar{T}$\ndeformed field theory at finite temperature. The holographic dual is described\nby AdS$_{d+1}$ black brane geometry with a finite cut-off. We compute the\nentanglement wedge cross section (EWCS), proposed to be dual to entanglement of\npurification (EoP) and holographic entanglement negativity (HEN) for strip like\nsubsystems. The behavior of EWCS and HEN is studied across different regimes of\ntemperature and deformation parameter. It is observed that the deformation and\ntemperature exhibit similar effects on these two entanglement measures.\nIncreasing the deformation leads to a decrease in the entanglement between the\nsubsystems.\n",
