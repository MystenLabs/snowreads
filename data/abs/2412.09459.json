  "abstract": "  High temperatures are typically thought to increase disorder. Here we examine\nthis idea in Quantum Field Theory in 2+1 dimensions. For this sake we explore a\nnovel class of tractable models, consisting of nearly-mean-field scalars\ninteracting with critical scalars. We identify UV-complete, local, unitary\nmodels in this class and show that symmetry breaking $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\to\n\\emptyset$ occurs at any temperature in some regions of the phase diagram. This\nphenomenon, previously observed in models with fractional dimensions, or in the\nstrict planar limits, or with non-local interactions, is now exhibited in a\nlocal, unitary 2+1 dimensional model with a finite number of fields.\n",
