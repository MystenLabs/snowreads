The computational complexity and memory usage of the proposed\nmethod scale linearly with the number of samples, making it highly attractive\nfor high-dimensional settings. In several examples, we demonstrate the\nefficiency of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art methods.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Machine Learning","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eEJSulCtrE562s3UzjkVOWphySm4VZc95OSRm8F-4DE","pdfSize":"7077610"}
