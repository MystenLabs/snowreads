These\nquantum corrections are incorporated into the framework of large-scale\ngravitational systems, utilizing the holographic principle to derive modified\nFriedmann equations. By redefining the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, our model\npredicts significant alterations to the Friedmann equations within specific\nparameter ranges, offering novel perspectives on cosmological scales. Using\ndistance modulus data from the Pantheon supernova sample, we demonstrate the\nmodel's potential to constrain the parameters governing quantum corrections and\naddress unresolved cosmological issues. Crucially, our analysis reveals that\nquantum fluctuations can increase the area of the event horizon by up to 47\\%.\nBeyond this threshold, theoretical predictions encounter substantial challenges\nwhen compared with observational data. This approach bridges quantum gravity\nand observational cosmology, opening new avenues for testing and refining\ntheoretical models.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uJJJBKgrO07CLubgzgIXX7Rd2sYi_jkwKZLEhktAuxE","pdfSize":"850776"}
