Here we pioneer a new\nstrategy to create discrete low-rank models of the system-environment\ninteraction, by exploiting the frequency and time domain information encoded in\nthe fluctuation-dissipation relation connecting the system-bath correlation\nfunction and the spectral density. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nmethodology by combining it with tensor-network methodologies and simulating\nthe quantum dynamics of a complex excitonic systems in a highly structured\nbosonic environment. The new modeling framework sets the basis for a leap in\nthe analysis of open quantum systems providing controlled accuracy at\nsignificantly reduced computational costs, with benefits in all connected\nresearch areas.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"BsDGuYe7c0iljextFxhVrmWghZdndmzGw8V67RQiupo","pdfSize":"541423","objectId":"0xcf8c9b3c3b153eac5cdf61196e00ac55c68e8cac64339a84580d513e1920d64d","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
