The measurement uses multileptonic final states and a simultaneous\nlikelihood fit to the number of events in four different lepton flavour\ncategories: eee, ee$\\mu$, $\\mu\\mu $e, and $\\mu\\mu\\mu$. The selection is\noptimized to minimize the number of background events, and relies on an\nefficient prompt lepton discrimination strategy. The WZ production cross\nsection is measured in a phase space defined within a 30 GeV window around the\nZ boson mass, as $\\sigma_{\\text{total}}$(pp$\\to$WZ) = 55.2$\\pm$1.2 (stat)\n$\\pm$1.2 (syst) $\\pm$0.8 (lumi) $\\pm$0.1 (theo) pb. In addition, the cross\nsection is measured in a fiducial phase space closer to the detector-level\nrequirements. All the measurements presented in this paper are in agreement\nwith standard model predictions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aAHsixQJUbbqAbdGmSJtiN_g8FAqw241I9Q85fjafUg","pdfSize":"1656576"}
