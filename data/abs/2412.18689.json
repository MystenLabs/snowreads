  "abstract": "  We theoretically investigate magnon heat transport in an antiferromagnetic\n(AFM) insulator containing a domain wall (DW) in the presence of a magnetic\nfield applied along the easy axis. We show that the intrinsic spin of the DW\ncouples to the external magnetic field which modifies the transmission of spin\nwave (SW) through the DW. Applying the magnetic field lifts the degeneracy\nbetween two AFM magnon modes and results in different occupation numbers for\nthe two magnon modes. Combined with the finite reflection of a narrow domain\nwall, this is found to have a significant impact on the magnon heat transport,\ngiving rise to thermal magnetoresistance. Our findings suggest that an AFM DW\ncan be used as a controllable element for regulating the magnon heat current in\nmagnonic devices through the application of a magnetic field.\n",
