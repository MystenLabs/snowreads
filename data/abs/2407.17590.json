While the theory is obviously not true, an\nincreasing amount of posts on social media have been made by bots optimised to\ngain followers and drive engagement on social media platforms. This paper looks\nat the recent phenomenon of these bots, analysing their behaviour through the\nlens of computational creativity to investigate the question: is computational\ncreativity flourishing on the dead internet?\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"iBQ_77FJdfbyhQIc9SHJcYK780-bpQSc7JzjaFNmUFk","pdfSize":"8990834","objectId":"0x07a1957bde2c4236427583105174b7748bef9682b923c5792273c1b95a846a4d","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
