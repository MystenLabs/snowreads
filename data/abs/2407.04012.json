We firstly apply this\nresult for the evaluation functor on the functor category\n$\\operatorname{Add}(\\mathcal{A}, R \\mbox{-Mod})$ equipped with an exact\nstructure $\\mathcal{E}$. Under mild conditions on $\\mathcal{A}$, we introduce\nthe stalk functor at any object of $\\mathcal{A}$, and subsequently, we\ninvestigate cotorsion pairs induced by stalk functors. Finally, we use them to\npresent an intrinsic characterization of projective/injective objects in\n$(\\mbox{Add}(\\mathcal{A}, R\\mbox{-Mod}); \\mathcal{E})$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Category Theory","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"NI4kZeUyF9yjLYZkHDFKm12Vr8OOwdihvRYfSrd5PY4","pdfSize":"526518"}
