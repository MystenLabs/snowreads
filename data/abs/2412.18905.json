A Laplacian-based model is proposed to govern the\nevolution of opinions in the group when the agents are subjected to external\nbiases like agents' traits, news, etc. The objective of the paper is to design\na control input which leads to any desired opinion clustering even in the\npresence of external bias factors. Further, we also determine the conditions\nwhich ensure the reachability to any arbitrary opinion states. Note that all of\nthese results hold for any kind of graph structure. Finally, some numerical\nsimulations are discussed to validate these results.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computer Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"yxI5moJPj2MR_qWc_vmE929sxVXRCn3b500Pnrp1QJ0","pdfSize":"231518"}
