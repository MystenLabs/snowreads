We explore and use Meta's DINOv2 vision transformer model\nfor feature extraction to tackle species' high variability and visual\nsimilarity in a dataset of 182,261 images. We perform exploratory analysis on\nembeddings to understand their structure, and train a linear classifier on the\nembeddings to predict species. Despite achieving a score of 39.69, our results\nshow promise for DINOv2 embeddings in snake identification.
