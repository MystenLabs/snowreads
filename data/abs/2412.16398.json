Performance is on par with or exceeds\nhardware-accelerated solutions on x86_64 and ARMv8 processors, and these\nhardware-accelerated solutions see a performance increase of 5-20% depending on\nmessage length. The small number of operations required with this approach\ncould simplify hardware CRC32 implementations.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6Sa0UUjL_uSxyTVHlSzOk1BTz6JWCg292QY1vIluhe8","pdfSize":"482242"}
