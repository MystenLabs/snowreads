We also prove that if the $\\gamma$-support of an element\nin the completion is compact, then it is connected.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"n970pboaibNkdJq_Iwmwcvg7QVGqJX9dlhy66zNDQtQ","pdfSize":"522639"}
