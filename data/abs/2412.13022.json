  "abstract": "  Let $E$ be an elliptic curve with $j$-invariant $0$ or $1728$ and let\n$\\widetilde{E}$ be a $k^{th}$ twist of $E$. We show that for any prime $p$ of\ngood reduction of $\\widetilde{E}$, a degree $k$ relative $p$-class group and\nthe root number of $\\widetilde{E}$ determines the dimension of the $p$-Selmer\ngroup of $\\widetilde{E}$. As a consequence, we construct families of large rank\n$p$-class group. We also relate congruent number and cube sum problem with\nrelative $p$-class group.\n",
