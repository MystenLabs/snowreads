  "abstract": "  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures have recently garnered\nsignificant attention for their ability to improve truth grounding and\ncoherence in natural language processing tasks. However, the reliability of RAG\nsystems in producing accurate answers diminishes as the volume of data they\naccess increases. Even with smaller datasets, these systems occasionally fail\nto address simple queries. This issue arises from their dependence on\nstate-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), which can introduce uncertainty\ninto the system's outputs. In this work, I propose a novel Comparative RAG\nsystem that introduces an evaluator module to bridge the gap between\nprobabilistic RAG systems and deterministically verifiable responses. The\nevaluator compares external recommendations with the retrieved document chunks,\nadding a decision-making layer that enhances the system's reliability. This\napproach ensures that the chunks retrieved are both semantically relevant and\nlogically consistent with deterministic insights, thereby improving the\naccuracy and overall efficiency of RAG systems. This framework paves the way\nfor more reliable and scalable question-answering applications in domains\nrequiring high precision and verifiability.\n",
