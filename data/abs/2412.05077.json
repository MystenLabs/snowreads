  "abstract": "  Proper continued fractions are generalized continued fractions with positive\ninteger numerators $a_i$ and integer denominators with $b_i\\geq a_i$. In this\npaper we study the strength of approximation of irrational numbers to their\nconvergents and classify which pairs of integers $p,q$ yield a convergent $p/q$\nto some irrational $x$. Notably, we reduce the problem to finding convergence\nonly of index one and two. We completely classify the possible choices for\nconvergents of odd index and provide a near-complete classification for even\nindex. We furthermore propose a natural two-dimensional generalization of the\nclassical Gauss map as a method for dynamically generating all possible\nexpansions and establish ergodicity of this map.\n",
