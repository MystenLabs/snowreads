The model\nhas a degree of freedom to test for response biases, but is unable to detect\nrandom answering. In this paper, we propose two new methods to indirectly\nestimate and correct for random answering. One method uses a non-sensitive\ncontrol statement and a quasi-randomized innocuous statement to which both\nanswers are known to estimate the proportion of random respondents. The other\nmethod assigns less weight in the estimation procedure to respondents who\ncomplete the survey in an unrealistically short time. For four surveys among\nelite athletes, we use these methods to correct the prevalence estimates of\ndoping use for random answering.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XVpdPiedkz1Jzq9PMytaKwCc-V-w95ZeNM1OMYWuLsA","pdfSize":"673936"}
