The\ncanonical U(4)->U(3)->U(2)->U(1) coupling and recoupling coefficients are\napplicable to any system that possesses U(4) symmetry, while the physical\nU(4)->SU_S(2)xSU_T(2) coupling coefficients are more specific to nuclear\nstructure studies that utilize Wigner's Supermultiplet Symmetry concept. The\nprocedure that is proposed sidesteps the use of binomial coefficients and\nalternating sum series, and consequently enables fast and accurate computation\nof any and all U(4)-underpinned features. The inner multiplicity of a (S,T)\npair within a single U(4) irreducible representation is obtained from the\ndimension of the null space of the SU(2) raising generators; while the\nresolution for the outer multiplicity follows from the work of Alex et al. on\nU(N). It is anticipated that a C++ library will ultimately be available for\ndetermining generic coupling and recoupling coefficients associated with both\nthe \\textit{canonical} and the \\textit{physical} group-subgroup chains of U(4).\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"jMxyBR7JhHlJaC98YnWjwAHnvZXF100XlJcmonI2n-w","pdfSize":"969352"}
