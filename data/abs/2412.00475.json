Given the design of the overall FAST survey, the inhomogeneous\ndetection sensitivity of FASHI is likely to introduce significant biases in the\nstatistical properties of the catalog. To mitigate the potential influence of\nspurious clustering effects due to these sensitivity variations, we focus on\nextragalactic \\textsc{Hi} sources within the sensitivity range of $[0.65,\n1.0]$. This refined subsample is divided into ten distinct sky regions, for\nwhich we compute the two-point angular correlation functions (2PACF) over\nangular scales of $0.5^\\circ < \\theta < 10^\\circ$. We apply the Markov chain\nMonte Carlo method to fit these 2PACFs with a power-law model and assess the\nstatistical significance of the best-fit parameters for the ten FASHI sky\nregions by comparing them against results from mock catalogs generated under\nthe assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy. Our findings indicate that the\nlocal Universe, as traced by the \\textsc{Hi} sources in the FASHI survey,\naligns with the cosmic isotropy hypothesis within a $2\\sigma$ confidence level.\nWe do not detect any statistically significant deviations from cosmic isotropy\nin the FASHI survey data.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uI6CNge3ecIWXeT18Ngt2xs2QYoMF1Qh4afA5FV1JVg","pdfSize":"922113"}
