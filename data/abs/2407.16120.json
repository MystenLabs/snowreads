This improves and extends earlier\nresults of Bloch and P\\'olya and Erd\\'elyi and, as a special case, recaptures a\nspecial case of a more general recent result of Jacob and Nazarov.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yNuaIQ6KQKGHfTs5dMEyeqxYrQ0UJHx3PrXyYEJ-S_E","pdfSize":"115160"}
