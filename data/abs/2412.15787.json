The emerging field of AI apology investigates the\nuse of apologies by artificially intelligent systems, with recent research\nsuggesting how this tool may provide similar value in human-machine\ninteractions. Until recently, contributions to this area were sparse, and these\nworks have yet to be synthesised into a cohesive body of knowledge. This\narticle provides the first synthesis and critical analysis of the state of AI\napology research, focusing on studies published between 2020 and 2023. We\nderive a framework of attributes to describe five core elements of apology:\noutcome, interaction, offence, recipient, and offender. With this framework as\nthe basis for our critique, we show how apologies can be used to recover from\nmisalignment in human-AI interactions, and examine trends and inconsistencies\nwithin the field. Among the observations, we outline the importance of curating\na human-aligned and cross-disciplinary perspective in this research, with\nconsideration for improved system capabilities and long-term outcomes.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cI1TQZebVreRNlhWNpFZSwa3cucipwoXkhk0vXqgbnE","pdfSize":"1846224"}
