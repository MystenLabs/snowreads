We show that these two quantities are equivalent in the\nkinematic range probed by H1 Collaboration data. We propose that scaling\nentropy associated with partonic interactions is a more efficient way to detect\nscaling in experimental data. We used a combined analysis of the inclusive\ncross section and entropy obtained from multiplicities $P(N)$ of final-state\nhadrons to accurately determine the value of the Pomeron intercept. The\napproach could provide new constraints for future hadron collider experiments\nand deepen our understanding of parton saturation.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BfLsNcyste9xYAQ_5iq7FSAqgVqOjgjfyZd1qM3MROI","pdfSize":"624614"}
