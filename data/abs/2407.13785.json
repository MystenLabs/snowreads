It\naims to foster an understanding of the challenges and vulnerabilities inherent\nin software supply chain resilience and to promote transparency and trust in\nthe digital infrastructure that underpins contemporary society. By examining\nthe concept of software supply chain resilience and assessing the current state\nof supply chain security, the article provides a foundation for discussing\nstrategies and practices that can mitigate security risks and ensure security\ncontinuity throughout the development lifecycle. Through this comprehensive\nanalysis, the article contributes to the ongoing effort to strengthen the\nsecurity posture of software supply chains, thereby ensuring the reliable and\nsecure operation of digital systems in a connected world\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Lky5uYho2ygWDj6-8JZaHJkS_hRnPYzFtW3Ej_ZJ__U","pdfSize":"460561"}
