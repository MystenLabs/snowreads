Observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background, large-scale structure,\nand distant galaxies have provided unprecedented insights into the processes\nthat shaped our Universe. This PhD thesis contributes to this research by\nexploring how these cosmic observables can be leveraged to constrain new\nphysics beyond the standard $\\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter model.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rJ6S_Y4eZhd78CNvjdcuUGcE4656Li9_I8ubFeqcPWI","pdfSize":"20208048"}
