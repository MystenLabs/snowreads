  "abstract": "  Alcoved polytopes are convex polytopes which are the closure of a union of\nalcoves in an affine Coxeter arrangement. They are rational polytopes, and\ntherefore have Ehrhart quasipolynomials. We describe a method for computing the\ngenerating function of the Ehrhart quasipolynomial, or Ehrhart series, of any\nalcoved polytope via a particular shelling order of its alcoves. We also\nconjecture a connection between Early's decorated ordered set partitions and\nthis shelling order for the hypersimplex $\\Delta_{2,n}$.\n",
