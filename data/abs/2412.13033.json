  "abstract": "  This paper presents a guidance algorithm for solving the problem of following\nparametric paths, as well as a curvature-varying speed setpoint for land-based\ncar-type wheeled mobile robots (WMRs). The guidance algorithm relies on\nSingularity-Free Guiding Vector Fields SF-GVF. This novel GVF approach expands\nthe desired robot path and the Guiding vector field to a higher dimensional\nspace, in which an angular control function can be found to ensure global\nasymptotic convergence to the desired parametric path while avoiding field\nsingularities. In SF-GVF, paths should follow a parametric definition. This\nfeature makes using Bezier's curves attractive to define the robot's desired\npatch. The curvature-varying speed setpoint, combined with the guidance\nalgorithm, eases the convergence to the path when physical restrictions exist,\nsuch as minimal turning radius or maximal lateral acceleration. We provide\ntheoretical results, simulations, and outdoor experiments using a WMR platform\nassembled with off-the-shelf components.\n",
