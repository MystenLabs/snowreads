This study examines the role of inhibitory control (IC) in managing\nthese misinterpretations among Chinese-English bilinguals. Using self-paced\nreading tasks, we investigated how IC influences recovery from garden-path\nsentences in Chinese (L1) and its interaction with language proficiency during\nEnglish (L2) processing. Results indicate that IC does not affect garden-path\nrecovery in Chinese, suggesting reliance on semantic context may reduce the\nneed for IC. In contrast, findings for English L2 learners reveal a complex\nrelationship between language proficiency and IC: Participants with low L2\nproficiency but high IC showed lingering misinterpretations, while those with\nhigh proficiency exhibited none. These results support and extend the Model of\nCognitive Control (Ness et al., 2023). Moreover, our comparison of three Stroop\ntask versions identifies L1 colour-word Stroop task as the preferred measure of\nIC in bilingual research.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Xlj5OMiFeEacwD0h4RowguNWykyZTq-7oT7jGJLgzrQ","pdfSize":"881113"}
