This article presents a case study that provides some\nanswers to these questions. We apply the low-energy effective field theory to\n$e^+e^- \\to \\mu^+\\mu^-$ data below the Z boson mass from the JADE experiment at\nDESY. The low-energy effective field theory allows the observation of physics\nbeyond QED in the JADE data and furthermore, by matching the Wilson\ncoefficients to the electroweak theory, a rough measurement of the masses of\nthe W and Z bosons is possible. This rough measurement would have been\nsufficient to guide the construction of colliders such as the super\nproton-antiproton synchrotron or the large electron-positron collider, and so\nwe anticipate that a discovery of new physics via effective field theory at the\nLHC would be similarly sufficient to guide the construction of future\ncolliders.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"5MOE5zNZ6zvmj6c1Js4nQmUaIMY6TtVF7SJmMg6O1dY","pdfSize":"725435"}
