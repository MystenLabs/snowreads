  "abstract": "  The Bologna Process has affected almost every field and every aspect of\nhigher education in European countries which participate in it. The strife\ntowards unification of the degrees, quality assurance and expanded access to\nhigher education brought a lot of positive adjustments in multiple aspects,\nhowever, at the cost of new challenges to undertake. One of these obstacles\ninclude the problem of student retention. Over the years, the percentage of\nBachelors who remain at the university for Master's degree programme has\ndropped significantly. There is a myriad of possible reasons for this\nphenomenon and the aim of this paper is to provide at least a partial answer\nthat question using the data we have collected from the students of multiple\nuniversities in Poland.\n",
