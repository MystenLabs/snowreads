Using the extensive collection\nof archival XMM-Newton, Chandra, and NICER observations spanning over two\ndecades, we obtain the first firm measurement of the spin-down rate for RX\nJ2143.0+0654, while for the rest we improve upon previously published spin\nephemerides and extend them by up to an additional decade. Five of the XINS\nfollow steady spin-down with no indication of major anomalies in their\nlong-term timing behavior; the notable exception is RX J0720.4-3125, for which,\nin addition to confirming the previously identified glitch, we detect a second\nspin derivative. The high quality folded X-ray pulse profiles produced with the\nupdated timing solutions exhibit diverse and complex morphologies, as well as\nstriking energy dependence. These peculiarities cannot be readily explained by\nblackbody-like isotropic emission and simple hot spot configurations, hinting\nat the presence of complex multi-temperature surface heat distributions and\nhighly anisotropic radiation patterns, such as may arise from a strongly\nmagnetized atmospheric layer.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FrMdfGO29nRC6qKcDeyrqoL2vNVe1o7gTCHRlMlNR3I","pdfSize":"2303726"}
