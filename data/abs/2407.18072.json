We do this within the framework of simplicial Homotopy\nType Theory of Riehl and Shulman. Our main result characterizes exponentiable\nfunctors. In order to achieve this, we explore Segal type completions.\nMoreover, we verify that our result is semantically sound.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Category Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fVmXl6KZUCX9V8NcNp9ve2YRs_DVKPteOS_G1GDYAsU","pdfSize":"232850"}
