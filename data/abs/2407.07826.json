Such mixtures, of varying non-zero activity, remain largely\nunexplored even though they are relevant for a plethora of systems and\napplications ranging from cellular biophysics to drone swarms. Our mixtures are\nmodulated by their activity ratios ($\\mathrm{Pe}^\\mathrm{R}$), which we find to\nencode information by giving rise to three regimes, each of which display their\nunique emergent behaviors. Specifically, we found non-monotonic behavior of\nmacroscopic properties, e.g. density and pressure, as a function of activity\nratio, microphase separation of fast and slow particle domains, increased\nfluctuations on the interface and severe avalanche events compared to\nmonodisperse active systems. Our approach of simultaneously varying the two\nactivities of the particle species allowed us to discover these behaviors and\nexplain the microscopic physical mechanisms that drive them.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2-BzjLhkwhZClUjn9wd02HhpaxBiWCiMTIvrb0MSUo8","pdfSize":"3887682","objectId":"0x287934f0bafd54f0a22e574d2a63e5e22bc31c5e2618a58c8e56c099d690ae6e","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
