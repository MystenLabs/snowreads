The question is to check if the two sets of vectors cover the\nentire integer box by upward and downward domination, respectively. It is known\nthat the problem is (quasi-)polynomially equivalent to that of enumerating all\nmaximal feasible solutions of a given monotone system of\nlinear/separable/supermodular inequalities over integer vectors. The\nequivalence is established via showing that the dual family of minimal\ninfeasible vectors has size bounded by a (quasi-)polynomial in the sizes of the\nfamily to be generated and the input description. Continuing in this line of\nwork, in this paper, we consider systems of polynomial, second-order cone, and\nsemidefinite inequalities. We give sufficient conditions under which such\nbounds can be established and highlight some applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MSP-SqtqQOJlw1sv3-tEC12TqkEAmdDRksFEwopfRmg","pdfSize":"310551","objectId":"0x865a5c7524a5ed5487b6ad408ea9d829ba320fb914da40ebdd6e5f8537f3d21d","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
