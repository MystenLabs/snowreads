  "abstract": "  Until about a decade ago, ring systems were only known to exist around giant\nplanets. Each one of the four giant planets harbours its own distinctive and\nunique system of rings and inner satellites. The past decade has been marked by\nthe unexpected discoveries of dense rings around small objects of the outer\nsolar system: the Centaur object Chariklo (and possibly Chiron), the dwarf\nplanet Haumea and the trans-Neptunian object Quaoar. In the latter case, an\nadditional surprise came from the fact that Quaoar's rings orbit well beyond\nthe Roche limit of the body. Here, we address the possible origins and\nevolution of these ring systems.\n",
