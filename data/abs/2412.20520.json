The View from Nowhere interprets frame\nrepresentations as perspectives on an invariant equivalence class, while the\nView from Everywhere posits each frame representation as constituting reality\nitself. TWhat emerges is a conception of reality that I term \"Relality\". The\npaper critically examines the philosophical and practical implications of these\nviews, with a focus on reconciling theory with experimental practice. Central\nto the discussion is the challenge of providing a perspicuous characterisation\nof ontology. The View from Nowhere aligns with the so-called sophisticated\napproach on symmetries and it complicates the empirical grounding of\ntheoretical constructs. In contrast, the View from Everywhere offers a\nrelational ontology that avoids the abstraction of equivalence classes.\n","subjects":["Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zhlhc5Ap3qsFOvvsa5QTfFPb2znmJEbgal59iS5b8OM","pdfSize":"600309"}
