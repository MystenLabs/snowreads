The method takes advantage\nof collective states of two transmon qubits located in the center of a\nwaveguide. The Hilbert space of such a system forms two separate subspaces\n(bright and dark) which are coupled differently to external noise sources.\nMeasuring transmission through the waveguide allows one to extract separately\nthe temperatures of the baths responsible for global and local excitations in\nthe system. Such a system would allow for building a new type of primary\ntemperature sensor capable of distinguishing between local and global baths.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"i98DyHtm8TTWADn44bDg5kafNxqr-_jZX2lHNc3laE8","pdfSize":"4003039"}
