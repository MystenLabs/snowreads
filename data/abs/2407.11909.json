Despite its\nrelevance, little is known about how scholars facilitate new collaborations\namong their peers. In this study, we quantify brokerage in academia and study\nits effect on the careers of physicists worldwide. We find that early-career\nparticipation in brokerage increases later-stage involvement for all\nresearchers, with increasing participation rates and greater career impact\namong more successful scientists. This cumulative advantage process suggests\nthat brokerage contributes to the unequal distribution of success in academia.\nSurprisingly, this affects both women and men equally, despite women being more\njunior in all brokerage roles and lagging behind men's participation due to\ntheir late and slow arrival to physics. Because of its cumulative nature,\npromoting brokerage opportunities to early career scientists might help reduce\nthe inequalities in academic success.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Q4uciGu6MtxLUTJJYpCm-v4V2dLuAnI-KYs01lEIhww","pdfSize":"1038994"}
