  "abstract": "  Azo-containing liquid crystal elatomers are photomechanical materials which\ncan be actuated by illumination. The photomechanical response is a result of\nthe photoisomerization of the azo moiety, which produces bulk stresses in the\nmaterial. These stresses arise via two distinct and competing mechanisms: order\nparameter change induced stress and direct contractile stress. We describe\nthermomechanical and photomechanical experiments aimed at assessing the\nrelative contributions of these. we discuss our results and summarize our\nfindings.\n",
