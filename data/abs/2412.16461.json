Our method simultaneously optimizes material\nstiffness and rest shape parameters under box constraints to exactly enforce\nzero net force while avoiding stability issues and violations of physical laws.\nFor efficiency, we split our constrained optimization problem into primal and\ndual subproblems via the augmented Lagrangian method, while handling the dual\nsubproblem via simple vector updates. To efficiently solve the box-constrained\nprimal subproblem, we propose a new active-set Cholesky preconditioner. Our\nmethod surpasses prior work in generality, robustness, and speed.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SwshvLfEHRru2cLcpPh5CbrBEvf3ATVMMtncZOBBaIA","pdfSize":"20565889"}
