Our objective is to complement previous\nstudies by providing an informational perspective that distinguishes different\nsolutions based on their energy configurations. We explore how the DCC measure\nrelates to energy and its applicability in analyzing degenerate states. Our\nfindings indicate that DCC effectively correlates with the energy parameters of\nthe solutions, offering significant insights into their informational\nproperties. This study underscores the value of using informational metrics\nlike DCC to deepen our understanding of the structural and dynamic\ncharacteristics of complex systems in theoretical physics.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons","Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"9EhyZ1yiODWlz5yCNb0nG6kLWiAZL4LsmsWmHQfaZl0","pdfSize":"542322"}
