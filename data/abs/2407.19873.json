Approaches to describe these dynamics are based on models in\nwhich the time and length scales defining the jumps are parameters to be\ndetermined. We instead propose a model-independent method to detect these\njumps. Our method uses the theory of the inspection paradox to analyze particle\ntrajectories and reveals the time and length scales defining a jump without\nfree parameters. Given its simplicity and generality, our method can be applied\nto resolve hopping motion in a broad class of systems, including experimental\nones.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"p6CNqkr_xQt88mNZxbjGHorFW_5ZVTBlmp8JDgj_O0E","pdfSize":"715289"}
