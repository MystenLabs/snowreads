We show for the first time that\nthe evolution of SMBHs with redshift leads to a unique signature on the angular\ncross-correlation power spectrum between the multi-frequency nano-hertz (nHz)\nstochastic gravitational wave (SGWB) and the galaxy density in the Universe. By\nusing galaxy catalogs from the upcoming Rubin LSST Observatory in synergy with\nthe nHz SGWB signal accessible from the Square Kilometer Array, we can measure\nthis signal with a signal-to-noise ratio above five, thereby opening a new\nobservational window to the cosmic evolution of SMBHs across redshift. This\ndiscovery space that can be opened by the cross-correlation of the nHz SGWB\nwill not be possible by any other currently known techniques.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"6so9wXItRYLmOucvhC71jIKttRVoETHHThLg9XIe4Aw","pdfSize":"1593649"}
