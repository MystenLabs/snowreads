Through an investigation using resonant inelastic X-ray\nspectroscopy (RIXS), Raman spectroscopy, and theoretical ligand-field multiplet\nand $ab initio$ calculations, we fully characterized the electronic structure\nof Ba$_2$CaOsO$_6$, particularly, the crystal-field symmetry of the 5$d^2$\nelectrons in this anomalous material. The low-energy multiplet excitations from\nRIXS at the oxygen $K$ edge and Raman-active phonons both show no splitting,\nconfirming the absence of Jahn-Teller distortion. These findings are consistent\nwith the ground state with the 'hidden order' of magnetic octupoles. Obtained\nparameters pave the way for further realistic microscopic studies of this\nhighly unusual class of materials, advancing our understanding of spin-orbit\nphysics in systems with higher-order multipoles.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Fs8f7RlVpCHq5ZNS6JeQsKA37HhbMzORO40Jyu7_oPo","pdfSize":"1561715"}
