Three model problems that\nuse a Drucker-Prager-type pressure-dependent yield function are considered to\nsimulate the non-linearities exhibited by a composite material. A further core\ningredient is the analysis of a canonical and non-conventional constitutive\nstructure, with respect to associated and non-associated flow response, where\nthe use of latter is motivated by the physical inconsistencies induced by the\nformer under shear dominated loads. These models are evaluated quantitatively\nby comparison to experimental data.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pe-TA53zfc3TrlywOzLOneLtG4FIblAvim53YP5TqFg","pdfSize":"537029"}
