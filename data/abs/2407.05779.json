This paper discusses\nthe exploitation of an environment representation obtained via Gaussian process\nregression (GPR) for smooth path planning using gradient descent B\\'ezier curve\noptimisation (BCO). A continuous differentiable GPR of the terrain\ntraversability and obstacle distance is used to plan paths with a weighted A*\ndiscrete planner, a T-RRT sampling-based planner and BCO using A* or T-RRT\ncomputed paths as prior. Numerical experiments in procedurally generated 2D\nenvironments allowed to compare the paths planned by the described methods and\nhighlight the benefits of the joint use of the GPR continuous representation\nand the BCO smooth path planning with these different priors.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"9XtI_J8lSpYl_n5ptCYn60BY_rYzq-ZoBGy9dM4ASSE","pdfSize":"1498237"}
