A challenging problem in the context\nof PDL is solving fixed-point equations, i.e., formulae of the form $x \\equiv\n\\phi(x)$ such that $x$ is a propositional variable and $\\phi(x)$ is a formula\ncontaining $x$. A solution to such an equation is a formula $\\psi$ that omits\n$x$ and satisfies $\\psi \\equiv \\phi(\\psi)$, where $\\phi(\\psi)$ is obtained by\nreplacing all occurrences of $x$ with $\\psi$ in $\\phi(x)$. In this paper, we\nidentify a novel class of PDL formulae arranged in two dual hierarchies for\nwhich every fixed-point equation $x \\equiv \\phi(x)$ has a solution. Moreover,\nwe not only prove the existence of solutions for all such equations, but also\nprovide an explicit solution $\\psi$ for each fixed-point equation.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Logic in Computer Science","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_SbEKtO_fpMWG9fO3Fx3eNr6Eoke2Jiys12JJ9AwUd0","pdfSize":"148344"}
