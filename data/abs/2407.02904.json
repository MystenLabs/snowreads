However, current robot learning approaches focus on motion-centric\naction spaces that do not explicitly give the policy control over the\ninteraction. In this paper, we discuss the repercussions of this choice and\nargue for more interaction-explicit action spaces in robot learning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HSMgJqmCQWvQp-M4jmQNB47PQ28Cv9GEvKmu02B7CxI","pdfSize":"176488"}
