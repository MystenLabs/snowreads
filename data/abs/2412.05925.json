  "abstract": "  The rollout of the fifth-generation (5G) networks has raised some concerns\nabout potential health effects from increased exposure to electromagnetic\nfields (EMF). To address these concerns, we design a novel EMF-aware\narchitecture for uplink communications. Specifically, we propose an aerial\nreconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS) assisted multi-user multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) system, where the ARIS features a reconfigurable\nintelligent surface (RIS) panel mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV),\noffering a flexible and adaptive solution for reducing uplink EMF exposure. We\nformulate and solve a new problem to minimize the EMF exposure by optimizing\nthe system parameters, such as transmit beamforming, resource allocation,\ntransmit power, ARIS phase shifts, and ARIS trajectory. Our numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of EMF-aware transmission scheme over the\nbenchmark methods, achieving EMF reductions of over 30% and 90% compared to the\nfixed ARIS and non-ARIS schemes, respectively.\n",
