  "abstract": "  Critique has surfaced concerning the existing linguistic annotation framework\nfor Korean Universal Dependencies (UDs), particularly in relation to syntactic\nrelationships. In this paper, our primary objective is to refine the definition\nof syntactic dependency of UDs within the context of analyzing the Korean\nlanguage. Our aim is not only to achieve a consensus within UDs but also to\ngarner agreement beyond the UD framework for analyzing Korean sentences using\ndependency structure, by establishing a linguistic consensus model.\n",
