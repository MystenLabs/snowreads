Definitions of these functionals are given\nand characteristic functions of these functionals are written for the model of\nexponential distribution of incoming demands. The possibilities of using\nboundary functionals are demonstrated using examples of a unicyclic network\nwith affinity A, an asymmetric random walk, nonlinear diffusion and multiple\ndiffusing particles with reversible target-binding kinetics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1gEUmqg8R_ZoXPuZhpvek4-UcKwDZa3QlKFUOMn_1gQ","pdfSize":"1735979","objectId":"0x87521e73d47d6de19d99dee8f496e1b3f00ae4ac3de963fad7cbba67999df148","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
