This can have observational\nconsequences in the current detection of gravitational waves, as most of the\nwaveforms for gravitational radiation are computed assuming a flat (Minkowski)\nbackground. In this work, we compute gravitational radiation within the\nquadrupole approximation on positive $\\Lambda$ (de Sitter) background for a\nbinary system interacting gravitationally through a hyperbolic encounter.\n  We quantify the influence of the cosmological constant on the radiated energy\nas small corrections to the leading order Minkowski background results. The\nfirst order de Sitter background correction is of the order $\\sqrt{\\Lambda}$,\nand is thus extremely small.\n  Therefore, the cosmological constant influence on the gravitational radiation\nis negligible and may not be detected with the existing or planned\ngravitational wave detectors.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Du2p0VqRrO_fRKIZCxKpZMEbt-l3oCXKLor4NskjETQ","pdfSize":"457841"}
