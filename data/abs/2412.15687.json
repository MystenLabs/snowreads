GraphDOP learns the\ncorrelations between observed quantities - such as brightness temperatures from\npolar orbiters and geostationary satellites - and geophysical quantities of\ninterest (that are measured by conventional observations), to form a coherent\nlatent representation of Earth System state dynamics and physical processes,\nand is capable of producing skilful predictions of relevant weather parameters\nup to five days into the future.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Gf-Cg27ajfhm7y_ZInlzEfawEONowkNesBd6kTKXg3U","pdfSize":"36722372"}
