  "abstract": "  The von Neumann entropy of an $n$-partite system $A_1^n$ given a system $B$\ncan be written as the sum of the von Neumann entropies of the individual\nsubsystems $A_k$ given $A_1^{k-1}$ and $B$. While it is known that such a chain\nrule does not hold for the smooth min-entropy, we prove a counterpart of this\nfor a variant of the smooth min-entropy, which is equal to the conventional\nsmooth min-entropy up to a constant. This enables us to lower bound the smooth\nmin-entropy of an $n$-partite system in terms of, roughly speaking, equally\nstrong entropies of the individual subsystems. We call this a universal chain\nrule for the smooth min-entropy, since it is applicable for all values of $n$.\nUsing duality, we also derive a similar relation for the smooth max-entropy.\nOur proof utilises the entropic triangle inequalities for analysing\napproximation chains. Additionally, we also prove an approximate version of the\nentropy accumulation theorem, which significantly relaxes the conditions\nrequired on the state to bound its smooth min-entropy. In particular, it does\nnot require the state to be produced through a sequential process like previous\nentropy accumulation type bounds. In our upcoming companion paper, we use it to\nprove the security of parallel device independent quantum key distribution.\n",
