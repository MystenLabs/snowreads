  "abstract": "  We present a probabilistic argument supporting the application of polar\nduality, as discussed in our previous work, to express the indeterminacy\nprinciple of quantum mechanics. Our approach combines the properties of the\nMahler volume of a convex body with the Donoho--Stark uncertainty principle\nfrom harmonic analysis, which characterizes the concentration of a function and\nits Fourier transform. The central result demonstrates that the sum of the\nprobabilities of position concentration near a convex body and momentum\nconcentration near its polar dual is equal to one, with an error term that\ndiminishes rapidly as the number of degrees of freedom increases. This result\nmotivates the interpretation of polar duality as a kind of geometric Fourier\ntransform.\n",
