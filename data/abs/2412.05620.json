  "abstract": "  The present manuscript is concerned with component-wise estimation of the\npositive power of ordered restricted standard deviation of two normal\npopulations with certain restrictions on the means. We propose several improved\nestimators under a general scale invariant bowl-shaped loss function. Also, we\nproposed a class of improved estimators. It has been shown that the boundary\nestimator of this class is a generalized Bayes. As an application, the improved\nestimators are obtained with respect to quadratic loss, entropy loss, and a\nsymmetric loss function. We have conducted extensive Monte Carlo simulations to\nstudy and compare the risk performance of the proposed estimators. Finally, a\nreal life data analysis is given to illustrate our findings.\n",
