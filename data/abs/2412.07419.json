Classically, building the meaning of a linguistic utterance is said\nto be incremental, step-by-step, based on a compositional process. However,\nmany different works have shown for a long time that non-compositional\nphenomena are also at work. It is therefore necessary to propose a framework\nbringing together both approaches. We present in this paper an approach based\non Construction Grammars and completing this framework in order to account for\nthese different mechanisms. We propose first a formal definition of this\nframework by completing the feature structure representation proposed in\nSign-Based Construction Grammars. In a second step, we present a general\nrepresentation of the meaning based on the interaction of constructions, frames\nand events. This framework opens the door to a processing mechanism for\nbuilding the meaning based on the notion of activation evaluated in terms of\nsimilarity and unification. This new approach integrates features from\ndistributional semantics into the constructionist framework, leading to what we\ncall Distributional Construction Grammars.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AHW1iZCPjYgDEaAyS6aRtzwQVpUM-74RLTPCKiqxdkw","pdfSize":"420385"}
