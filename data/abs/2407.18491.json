Suppose the fibers\n$X_t=\\pi^{-1}(t)$ are biholomorphic to $S$ for all $t\\neq0$, where $S$ is a\ngiven projective manifold. If the canonical line bundle of $S$ is semiample,\nthen we show that the central fiber $X_0$ is also biholomorphic to $S$. As an\napplication, we obtain that, for smooth families over projective curves\nsatisfying that the canonical line bundle of the generic fiber is semiample,\nbirational isotriviality equals to isotriviality. Moreover, we also obtain a\nnew Parshin-Arakelov type isotriviality criterion.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jF1unRnZ55jxEe7Ic77RLOjZXoFLeTvjEeX6oAg5e0c","pdfSize":"307092"}
