  "abstract": "  Constructing the maximum spanning tree $T$ of an edge-weighted connected\ngraph $G$ is one of the important research topics in computer science and\noptimization, and the related research results have played an active role in\npractical applications. In this paper, we are concerned with the ratio of the\nweighted sum of a spanning tree $T$ of $G$ to the weighted sum of $G$, which we\ntry to minimize. We propose an interesting theorem to simplify this problem and\nshow that this optimal problem can be solved in polynomial time. Furthermore,\nwe apply the optimal problem in chordal graphs.\n",
