We combined\nfor the first time a twin Frisch-gridded ionization chamber with a world-class\n$\\gamma$-ray spectrometer that was designed to measure high-multiplicity\n$\\gamma$-ray events, Gammasphere. The chamber, loaded with a $^{252}$Cf(sf)\nsource, provides a fission trigger, the TKE of the fragments, the approximate\nfragment masses, and the polar angle of the fission axis. Gammasphere provides\nthe total $\\gamma$-ray yield, fragment identification through the tagging of\ndecay $\\gamma$ rays, and the feeding of rotational bands in the fragments. We\ndetermine the dependence of the average spin of $^{144}$Ba on the fragments'\nTKE by correlating the fragment properties with the distribution of discrete\nlevels that are fed. We find that the average spin only changes by about $0.5$\n$\\hbar$ across the TKE range of 158-203 MeV. The virtual independence of the\nspin on TKE suggests that spin is not solely generated through the statistical\nexcitation of rotational modes, and more complex mechanisms are required.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LCnV5EhcFRVSxJhJTsO-aE_wiFwTbVn6ysG9BqN-x3Y","pdfSize":"1081770"}
