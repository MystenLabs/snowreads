In this paper we study the $k$-center objective in the fully\ndynamic setting, where the update is either a point insertion or a point\ndeletion. Before our work, {\\L}\\k{a}cki, Haeupler, Grunau, Rozho\\v{n}, and\nJayaram [SODA '24] gave a deterministic fully dynamic constant-factor\napproximation algorithm for the $k$-center objective with worst-case recourse\nof $2$ per update.\n  In this work, we prove that the $k$-center clustering problem admits optimal\nrecourse bounds by developing a deterministic fully dynamic constant-factor\napproximation algorithm with worst-case recourse of $1$ per update. Moreover\nour algorithm performs simple choices based on light data structures, and thus\nis arguably more direct and faster than the previous one which uses a\nsophisticated combinatorial structure. Additionally, we develop a new\ndeterministic decremental algorithm and a new deterministic incremental\nalgorithm, both of which maintain a $6$-approximate $k$-center solution with\nworst-case recourse of $1$ per update. Our incremental algorithm improves over\nthe $8$-approximation algorithm by Charikar, Chekuri, Feder, and Motwani [STOC\n'97]. Finally, we remark that since all three of our algorithms are\ndeterministic, they work against an adaptive adversary.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0muqw87rzxhnHDzfqYkJWDiITKUb8kMeE97mQg-oxAk","pdfSize":"1119438"}
