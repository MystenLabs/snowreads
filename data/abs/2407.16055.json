Integrable systems, quantum scars, MBL, hidden\ntensor structures, and systems with gauge symmetries are examples. Beyond\ndimension and volume, spectral features such as an $O(1)$-density of periodic\neigenvalues can also imply observable recurrence. Low volume dynamics will\nrecur near its initial state $| \\psi_0\\rangle$ more rapidly, i.e.\n$\\lVert\\mathrm{U}^k | \\psi_0\\rangle - | \\psi_0\\rangle \\rVert < \\epsilon$ is\nmore likely to occur for modest values of $k$, when the (forward) orbit\n$\\operatorname{closure}(\\{\\mathrm{U}^k\\}_{k=1,2,\\dots})$ is of relatively low\ndimension $d$ and relatively small $d$-volume. We describe simple quantum\nalgorithms to detect such approximate recurrence. Applications include\ndetection of certain cases of hidden tensor factorizations $\\mathrm{U} \\cong\nV^\\dagger(\\mathrm{U}_1\\otimes \\cdots \\otimes \\mathrm{U}_n)V$. \"Hidden\" refers\nto an unknown conjugation, e.g. $\\mathrm{U}_1 \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes\n\\mathrm{U}_v \\rightarrow V^\\dagger(\\mathrm{U}_1 \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes\n\\mathrm{U}_n)V$, which will obscure the low-volume nature of the dynamics.\nHidden tensor structures have been observed to emerge both in a high energy\ncontext of operator-level spontaneous symmetry breaking [FSZ21a, FSZ21b,\nFSZ21c, SZBF23], and at the opposite end of the intellectual world in\nlinguistics [Smo09, MLDS19]. We collect some observations on the computational\ndifficulty of locating these structures and detecting related spectral\ninformation. A technical result, Appendix A, is that the language describing\nunitary circuits with no spectral gap (NUSG) around 1 is QMA-complete. Appendix\nB connects the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem to hidden tensor\nstructures.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"elI2Stp38yJg80wGBEwEdHku8MUbUXW9rn15CWSeW0k","pdfSize":"405130","objectId":"0x1320cc261e744f32f7b78f17809e0aae0c0a2aede84347771e962ec8b5ac51c4","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
