On this purpose, we modeled perception processes of\ncontinuous sensory sequences using our previous proposed variational RNN model\nwhich was developed based on the free energy principle. The current study\nextended this model by introducing an adaptation mechanism of a meta-level\nparameter, referred to as the meta-prior $\\mathbf{w}$, which regulates the\ncomplexity term in the free energy. Our simulation experiments demonstrated\nthat autonomous shifts between focused perception and mind-wandering take place\nwhen $\\mathbf{w}$ switches between low and high values associated with decrease\nand increase of the average reconstruction error over the past window. In\nparticular, high $\\mathbf{w}$ prioritized top-down predictions while low\n$\\mathbf{w}$ emphasized bottom-up sensations. This paper explores how our\nexperiment results align with existing studies and highlights their potential\nfor future research.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"L3Jgsf2FtldPKF-XM5TjsBe_H1FqomH3urG7J89_yN0","pdfSize":"2003996"}
