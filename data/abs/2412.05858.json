In case\n$(m,n) = (2,1)$ and using the Euclidean norm on $\\mathbb{R}^2$, they showed\nthat the spectrum is an interval. We generalize this result to arbitrary $(m,n)\n\\neq (1,1)$ and arbitrary norms, improving previous works from recent years. We\nalso define some related spectra and show that they too are intervals. Our\nargument is a modification of an argument of Khintchine from 1926.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZO17wKEc9yTJJjQNdsWDoH1jZoNkiNFojR_h8btaTc0","pdfSize":"280711"}
