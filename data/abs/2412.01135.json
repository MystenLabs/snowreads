  "abstract": "  Given experimental data, one of the main objectives of biological modeling is\nto construct a model which best represents the real world phenomena. In some\ncases, there could be multiple distinct models exhibiting the exact same\ndynamics, meaning from the modeling perspective it would be impossible to\ndistinguish which model is ``correct.'' This is the study of\nindistinguishability of models, and in our case we focus on linear\ncompartmental models which are often used to model pharmacokinetics, cell\nbiology, ecology, and related fields. Specifically, we focus on a family of\nlinear compartmental models called skeletal path models which have an\nunderlying directed path, and have recently been shown to have the first\nrecorded sufficient conditions for indistinguishability based on underlying\ngraph structure. In this recent work, certain families of skeletal path models\nwere proven to be indistinguishable, however the proofs relied heavily on\nlinear algebra. In this work, we reprove several of these indistinguishability\nresults instead using a graph theoretic framework.\n",
