The resultant distinct\nneutrino bursts and narrow mass range of AIC events offer critical insights\ninto the existence and properties of hybrid stars, including constraints on the\nonset density of PT.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MQm0q6bcFaFwNA1EegJBlr-HvQ2pF1V32igkpB3CIv8","pdfSize":"1700036"}
