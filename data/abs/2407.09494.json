It consists of\n2485 facial recognition images depicting emotions (happy, sad, angry, natural,\nsurprised), 2054 images for face recognition, and 2284 images for face\ndetection. The dataset covers various conditions, color palettes, shooting\nangles, and zoom levels, with a temperature range of -10{\\deg}C to 400{\\deg}C\nand a resolution of 19,200 pixels. It serves as a valuable resource for\nadvancing thermal imaging technology, aiding in algorithm development, and\nbenchmarking for facial recognition across different palettes. Additionally, it\ncontributes to facial motion recognition, fostering interdisciplinary\ncollaboration in computer vision, psychology, and neuroscience. The dataset\npromotes transparency in thermal face detection and recognition research, with\napplications in security, healthcare, and human-computer interaction.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3oB0TFHKhkCEcQBp5x8uER7gos8znB5G1FsCcpt9GHA","pdfSize":"1673700"}
