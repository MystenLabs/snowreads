  "abstract": "  This paper presents some concepts of the theory of interactive fuzzy numbers,\nand mainly, a class of interactive fuzzy numbers, called $f$-correlated fuzzy\nnumbers. We start from the foundations of general fuzzy mathematics and go\nthrough operations and the notion of interactivity for fuzzy numbers. The main\nresult is that $f$-correlation preserve the shape of certains fuzzy numbers.\nMore specificaly, if two fuzzy numbers are $f$ correlated, and one is a LR-type\nfuzzy number, the other is also a LR-type fuzzy number. This paper also\npresents some operations with the $f$-correlated fuzzy numbers wich are\ninteresting to applications like biomathematics.\n",
