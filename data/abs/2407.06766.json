Such a\nperspective underlies various graph database systems but very few theoretical\ninvestigations have been conducted on it. This perspective offers a powerful\nand unified framework to study graph database querying, by which algorithms and\ncomplexity follow from classical results. We provide two concrete applications.\n  The first is querying property graphs. The property graph data model\nsupersedes previously proposed graph models and underlies the new standard GQL\nfor graph query languages. We show that this standard can be, by and large,\nexpressed by extensions of relational calculus with transitive closure\noperators (FO[TC]) and existential second-order quantifiers (ESO). With this,\nwe obtain optimal data complexity bounds, along with extensions including\nschema validation.\n  The second application is incorporating data from concrete domains (e.g.,\nnumbers) in graph database querying. We use embedded finite model theory and,\nby exploiting a generic Restricted Quantifier Collapse (RQC) result for FO[TC]\nand ESO, we obtain optimal data complexity bounds for GQL with arithmetics and\ncomparisons. Moreover, we show that Regular Data Path Querying with operations\non data (i.e. using register automata formalisms) can be captured in FO[TC]\nover embedded finite graphs while preserving nondeterministic logspace data\ncomplexity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5I323gUMXXtzl1m2-5R4OeOIhf_KOJkW6UnAgG294l0","pdfSize":"2085069"}
