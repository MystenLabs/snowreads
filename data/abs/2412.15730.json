  "abstract": "  We study the convergence of a novel family of thermodynamically compatible\nschemes for hyperbolic systems (HTC schemes) in the framework of dissipative\nweak solutions, applied to the Euler equations of compressible gas dynamics.\nTwo key novelties of our method are i) entropy is treated as one of the main\nfield quantities and ii) the total energy conservation is a consequence of\ncompatible discretization and application of the Abgrall flux.\n",
