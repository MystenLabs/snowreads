In particular, we define the natural (most\nconservative) extension of a given choice assessment to a coherent choice\nfunction -- whenever possible -- and use this natural extension to make new\nchoices. We provide a practical algorithm for computing this natural extension\nand various ways to improve scalability. Finally, we test these algorithms for\ndifferent types of choice assessments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"17tn3PNbklFemuvdVcB1MPnTa0R-0GBL7X0Yib66Ef4","pdfSize":"798425"}
