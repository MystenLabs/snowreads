  "abstract": "  Undercompressive shocks are a special type of discontinuities that satisfy\nthe viscous profile criterion rather than the Lax inequalities. These shocks\ncan appear as a solution to systems of two or more conservation laws. This\npaper presents the construction of the undercompressive shock surface for two\ntypes of diffusion matrices. The first type is the identity matrix. The second\none is the capillarity matrix associated with the proper modeling of the\ndiffusive effects caused by capillary pressure. We show that the structure of\nthe undercompressive surface for the different diffusion matrices is similar.\nWe also show how the choice of the capillarity matrix influences the solutions\nto the Riemann problem.\n",
