Our\nsolution is robust against black-box attacking and well-established generative\nadversarial network (GAN) based image restoration. We analyze the potential\nrisk in previous work, where the proposed cosine similarity computation might\ndirectly leak the protected precomputed embedding stored on the server side. We\npropose a Function Secret Sharing (FSS) based face embedding comparison\nprotocol without any intermediate result leakage. In addition, we show in\nexperiments that the proposed protocol is more efficient compared to the Secret\nSharing (SS) based protocol.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"9-dq-8fn66AF8jwG-6aPNDGt5XieWlNOnSxOHK2mroc","pdfSize":"1743157"}
