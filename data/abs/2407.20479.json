We develop the theory formally and show that the main matching\nalgorithm has input-linear complexity both in theory as well as experimentally.\nWe apply thorough evaluation on popular benchmarks that show that RE# is over\n71% faster than the next fastest regex engine in Rust on the baseline, and\noutperforms all state-of-the-art engines on extensions of the benchmarks often\nby several orders of magnitude.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4oO-_SCscmxuApn0_aP_CjE3X3OHAKbosBmnnB5wTYA","pdfSize":"1114403"}
