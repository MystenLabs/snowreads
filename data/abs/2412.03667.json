The gauging\nshould fix the ambiguity once and for all, however, and, for translations, the\ngeneral covariance demands us to use the Lie derivative. We argue that, with\nthis alone and without any further tweaking, the Noether energy-momentum\n$\\hat{\\mathbb{T}}$ must equal the symmetric counterpart, $T$, inevitably and\nshow the equality explicitly for general tensors. For spinors, a subtlety with\nthe Lie derivative itself enters the issue and leads us to the Kosmann lift,\noften unnoticed by the physics community, from which $T=\\hat{\\mathbb{T}}$ again\nemerges straightforwardly and in a naturally symmetric form. Finally, we\naddress how the same Kosmann lift affects the anomaly computations and show\nthat the diffeomorphism anomaly from the seminal paper must be halved, while\nthe venerable anomaly polynomials themselves stand unaffected. We discuss the\nramifications of these findings.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"x1nw-imJ8bpp9XOyALcdqBuyhgCm9euTWsBMM-R1ga8","pdfSize":"464637"}
