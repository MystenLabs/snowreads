  "abstract": "  The original proof of the Gromov's non-squeezing theorem [Gro85] is based on\npseudo-holomorphic curves. The central ingredient is the compactness of the\nmoduli space of pseudo-holomorphic spheres in the symplectic manifold\n$(\\mathbb{CP}^1\\times T^{2n-2}, \\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}\\oplus\n\\omega_{\\mathrm{std}})$ representing the homology class\n$[\\mathbb{CP}^1\\times\\{\\operatorname{pt}\\}]$. In this article, we give two\nproofs of this compactness. The fact that the moduli space carries the minimal\npositive symplectic area is essential to our proofs. The main idea is to\nreparametrize the curves to distribute the symplectic area evenly and then\napply either the mean value inequality for pseudo-holomorphic curves or the\nGromov-Schwarz lemma to obtain a uniform bound on the gradient. Our arguments\navoid bubbling analysis and Gromov's removable singularity theorem, which makes\nour proof of Gromov's non-squeezing theorem more elementary.\n",
