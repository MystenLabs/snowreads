Machine learning-based streamflow forecasting relies on large\nstreamflow datasets derived from rating curves. Uncertainties in rating curve\nmodeling could introduce errors to the streamflow data and affect the\nforecasting accuracy. This study proposes a streamflow forecasting method that\naddresses these data errors, enhancing the accuracy of river flood forecasting\nand flood modeling, thereby reducing flood-related risk. A convolutional\nrecurrent neural network is used to capture spatiotemporal patterns, coupled\nwith residual error learning and forecasting. The neural network outperforms\ncommonly used forecasting models over 1-6 hours of forecasting horizons, and\nthe residual error learners can further correct the residual errors. This\nprovides a more reliable tool for river flood forecasting and climate\nadaptation in this critical 1-6 hour time window for flood risk mitigation\nefforts.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Machine Learning","Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"0lR43oAQWomK9W1fVNysoEUxIZjPYRdtyIsUPacqv5c","pdfSize":"948513"}
