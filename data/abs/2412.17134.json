  "abstract": "  The fair division of chores, as well as mixed manna (goods and chores), has\nreceived substantial recent attention in the fair division literature; however,\nours is the first paper to extend this research to matching markets. Indeed,\nour contention is that matching markets are a natural setting for this purpose,\nsince the manna that fit into the limited number of hours available in a day\ncan be viewed as one unit of allocation. We extend several well-known results\nthat hold for goods to the settings of chores and mixed manna. In addition, we\nshow that the natural notion of an earnings-based equilibrium, which is more\nnatural in the case of all chores, is equivalent to the pricing-based\nequilibrium given by Hylland and Zeckhauser for the case of goods.\n",
