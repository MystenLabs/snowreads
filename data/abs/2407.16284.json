They are often treated by the empirical\nMatthiessen rule, which says that total resistivity is just the sum of these\ntwo contributions, which are computed separately. This is quite misleading for\ntwo reasons. First, the two mechanisms are generally correlated. Second,\ncomputing the elastic resistivity alone masks the fundamental fact that the\nlinear-response approximation has a vanishing validity interval at vanishing\ndissipation. Limits of zero electric field and zero dissipation do not commute\nfor the simple reason that one needs to absorb the Joule heat quadratic in the\napplied field. Here, we present a simple model that illustrates these two\npoints. The model also illuminates the role of variational principles for\nnon-equilibrium steady states.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gRFqFrvL6g67YOvZkVKYpKZTP7taj5Do2RgM5PrVl4Q","pdfSize":"86680"}
