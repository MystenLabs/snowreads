  "abstract": "  In this contribution, which introduces the \"Crossing the Portal\" session of\nthe NOW 2024 meeting, I discuss the value of the concepts of\ninterdisciplinarity and innovation for neutrino physics. After some historical\nconsiderations, which provide an initial illustration of the significant role\nof these concepts, I review some well-known cases of neutrino science,\ninvolving both astrophysics and particle physics, which allow us to deepen the\nanalysis. The importance of a harmonious relationship between theoretical\nelaborations and experiments emerges: effective collaboration between\ntheoretical and experimental physicists played a key role in many of the\nsuccessful cases and proved marginal or defective in the doubtful ones. The\ndiscussion highlights also the need to proceed armed with a patience, a virtue\nthat Feynman himself indicated as essential to science, all the more necessary\nwhen investigating interesting but elusive particles such as neutrinos.\n",
