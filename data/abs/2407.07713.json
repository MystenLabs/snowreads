The construction of accurate Radio Environment Maps (REMs) has become\nan important and challenging topic in recent decades. In this paper, we present\na method to estimate REMs using Graph Neural Networks. This approach utilizes\nboth physical cell information and sparse geo-located signal strength\nmeasurements to estimate REMs. The method first divides and encodes mobile\nnetwork coverage areas into a graph. Then, it inputs sparse geo-located signal\nstrength measurements, characterized by Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP)\nand Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ) metrics, into a Graph Neural\nNetwork Model to estimate REMs. The proposed architecture inherits the\nadvantages of a Graph Neural Network to capture the spatial dependencies of\nnetwork-wide coverage in contrast with network Radio Access Network node\nlocations and spatial proximity of known measurements.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"p5elGt_I0CYHQsfhCqwUqfRNxiDMbOH2q9MLL_1NcxM","pdfSize":"617442"}
