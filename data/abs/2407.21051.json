Most of the initial literature on LLMs in medicine\nhas emphasized that LLMs are unsuitable for medical use because they are\nnon-deterministic, may provide incorrect or harmful responses, and cannot be\nregulated to assure quality control. If these issues could be corrected,\noptimizing LLM technology could benefit patients and physicians by providing\naffordable, point-of-care medical knowledge. Our proposed framework refines LLM\nresponses by restricting their primary knowledge base to domain-specific\ndatasets containing validated medical information. Additionally, we introduce\nan actor-critic LLM prompting protocol based on active inference principles of\nhuman cognition, where a Therapist agent initially responds to patient queries,\nand a Supervisor agent evaluates and adjusts responses to ensure accuracy and\nreliability. We conducted a validation study where expert cognitive behaviour\ntherapy for insomnia (CBT-I) therapists evaluated responses from the LLM in a\nblind format. Experienced human CBT-I therapists assessed responses to 100\npatient queries, comparing LLM-generated responses with appropriate and\ninappropriate responses crafted by experienced CBT-I therapists. Results showed\nthat LLM responses received high ratings from the CBT-I therapists, often\nexceeding those of therapist-generated appropriate responses. This structured\napproach aims to integrate advanced LLM technology into medical applications,\nmeeting regulatory requirements for establishing the safe and effective use of\nspecial purpose validated LLMs in medicine.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JdON2Kp18lTQZeBEK8tX1ZYirDqtQo6eDSBpeU2jV6c","pdfSize":"2145140"}
