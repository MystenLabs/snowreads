We\ndemonstrate that for NSs in an environment of sufficiently high DM density\n($\\rhox\\gtrsim10^{9}\\unit{GeV/cm^3}$), the effects of both multiscatter capture\nand DM evaporation cannot be neglected. If a Bose Einstein Condensate (BEC)\nforms from ADM, then its low temperature and densely cored profile render\nevaporation from the BEC negligible, strengthening detectability of low-mass\nDM. Because of this, we find that the most easily observable Population III\nstars could be highly effective at constraining high-$\\sigma$ low-$\\mx$ DM,\nmaintaining efficacy below $\\mx=10^{-15}\\unit{GeV}$ thanks to their far lower\nvalue of $\\mx$ at which capture saturates to the geometric limit. Finally, we\nderive closed-form approximations for the evaporation rate of DM from arbitrary\npolytropic objects.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hQ80iHVOYWUymRVkffnwAK_cmvCkBIgQbvxVgxC4RX8","pdfSize":"1711029"}
