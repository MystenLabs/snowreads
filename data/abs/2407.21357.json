With this in mind, we propose a research\nline aimed at incrementally building both the technology and the\ntrustworthiness of AGC. The core element in this approach is that trust can\nonly be built over time, through demonstrably mutually beneficial interactions.\n  To this end, we advocate starting from unobtrusive, nonthreatening artificial\nagents that would explicitly collaborate with humans, similarly to what\ndomestic animals do. By combining multiple research fields, from Evolutionary\nRobotics to Neuroscience, from Ethics to Human-Machine Interaction, we aim at\ncreating embodied, self-sustaining Artificial General Creatures that would form\nsocial and emotional connections with humans. Although they would not be able\nto play competitive online games or generate poems, we argue that creatures\nakin to artificial pets would be invaluable stepping stones toward symbiotic\nArtificial General Intelligence.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GUlxTAGq3py7KgkliN3MkiGhS-sTUIhh6eysn9sE9iU","pdfSize":"827845","objectId":"0x7ef31a540c4fdce084ca44b8b9e35909c812998dc624e577de640adc9576c6a4","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
