We construct the gradient discretisation method (GDM), an abstract\nframework combining several numerical method families. The paper provides the\ndiscretisation and proves the convergence of the approximate schemes using a\ncompactness argument that works under natural assumptions on data. We also\ninvestigate, using a finite volume method, known as the hybrid mixed mimetic\n(HMM) approach, the effects of multiplicative noise on the dynamics of the\ntravelling waves in the excitable media displayed by the model. Particularly,\nwe consider how sufficiently high noise can cause waves to backfire or fail to\npropagate.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YqM3_VHVH9VLGbFeItVeRgB8lxO53TFQUHUeTo6jcEc","pdfSize":"970261"}
