  "abstract": "  We introduce two new static, spherically symmetric regular black hole\nsolutions that can be obtained from non-linear electrodynamics models. For each\nsolution, we investigate the dynamic stability with respect to arbitrary linear\nfluctuations of the metric and electromagnetic field, and also examine the\nenergy conditions that those black holes satisfy. Moreover, based on those\nsolutions, we present two additional ones that satisfy the Limiting Curvature\nCondition. Finally, we make a comparison between the two solutions exploring\ntheir null geodesics and circular photon orbits.\n",
