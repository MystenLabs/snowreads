In addition, we studied this functional separately for the\nclass $\\mathcal{K}$ of convex functions and we emphasize that all the results\nof the paper are sharp (i.e. the best possible). The advantages of the present\nstudy are that the techniques used in the proofs are more easier and use known\nresults regarding the univalent functions, and those that it give the best\npossible results not only for the entire class of univalent normalized\nfunctions $\\mathcal{S}$ but also for its subclass of convex functions\n$\\mathcal{K}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"d98tSJZwKuKSnQm1xNbJ1SUjfN3wzAFd0j1kUVDGVoA","pdfSize":"224027"}
