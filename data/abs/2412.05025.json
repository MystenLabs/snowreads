  "abstract": "  Ultralong-range Rydberg molecules, composed of an excited Rydberg atom and a\nground-state atom, are characterized by large bond lengths, dipole moments,\nsensitivity to external fields, and an unusual binding mechanism based on\nlow-energy elastic electron scattering. Although Rydberg molecules formed\nbetween alkali atoms have received the most attention, the additional\ncomplexity found in atoms with more than a single valence electron poses new\ntheoretical challenges as well as new possibilities for control and design of\nthe molecular structure. In this paper, we extend the theory of Rydberg\nmolecules to include the additional spin coupling of the Rydberg states of a\nmultivalent atom. We employ this theory to describe the properties of Rydberg\nmolecules composed of mercury atoms. We calculate the potential energy curves\nof both heteronuclear (Hg*Rb) and homonuclear (Hg*Hg) molecules. In the former\ncase, we propose the realization of long-range spin entanglement and remote\nspin flip. In the latter, we show how long-lived metastable molecular states of\nHg*Hg exist as resonances above the dissociation threshold.\n",
