In this work, we take a step toward addressing this\nchallenge by introducing a novel NOCI approach designed with three primary\nobjectives: (1) ensuring the method is systematic, (2) achieving a compact NOCI\nexpansion, and (3) treating all electronic states of interest on equal footing.\nThe development of our approach is presented step by step, with each building\nblock evaluated and validated through applications to simple model systems,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness and potential.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5Ee5vuwKUITc2MMKm5p9fGwDqo5uYGKAbLGkGm3M464","pdfSize":"726485"}
