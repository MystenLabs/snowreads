  "abstract": "  I argue that generative AI will have an uneven effect on the evolution of the\nlaw. To do so, I consider generative AI as a labor-augmenting technology that\nreduces the cost of both writing more complete contracts and litigating in\ncourt. The contracting effect reduces the demand for court services by making\ncontracts more complete. The litigation effect, by contrast, increases the\ndemand for court services by a) making contracts less complete and b) reducing\nlitigants' incentive to settle, all else equal. Where contracts are common, as\nin property and contract law, the change in the quantity of litigation is\nuncertain due to offsetting contracting and litigation effects. However, in\nareas where contracts are rare, as in tort law, the amount of litigation is\nlikely to rise. Following Rubin (1977) and Priest (1977) generative AI will\naccelerate the evolution of tort law toward efficiency.\n",
