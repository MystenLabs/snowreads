We\nintroduce a novel hybrid quantum-classical autoencoder architecture that\ncombines parameterized quantum circuits with classical deep neural networks\n(DNNs). Specifically, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical autoencoder (QAE)\nframework to optimize the E2E communication system. Our results demonstrate the\nfeasibility of the proposed hybrid system, and reveal that it is the first work\nthat can achieve comparable block error rate (BLER) performance to classical\nDNN-based and conventional channel coding schemes, while significantly reducing\nthe number of trainable parameters. Additionally, the proposed QAE exhibits\nsteady and superior BLER convergence over the classical autoencoder baseline.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"hdmPuVV1JhUOEV7wc0JLX9Flk-R74juBz1vZaZ6Eg6Y","pdfSize":"1383573"}
