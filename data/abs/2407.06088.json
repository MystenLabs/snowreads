Forbus","authorsParsed":[["Hancock","Will",""],["Forbus","Kenneth D.",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2024 16:28:38 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-09","timestamp":1720456118000,"abstract":"  Event perception refers to people's ability to carve up continuous experience\ninto meaningful discrete events. We speak of finishing our morning coffee,\nmowing the lawn, leaving work, etc. as singular occurrences that are localized\nin time and space. In this work, we analyze how spatiotemporal representations\ncan be used to automatically segment continuous experience into structured\nepisodes, and how these descriptions can be used for analogical learning. These\nrepresentations are based on Hayes' notion of histories and build upon existing\nwork on qualitative episodic memory. Our agent automatically generates event\ndescriptions of military battles in a strategy game and improves its gameplay\nby learning from this experience. Episodes are segmented based on changing\nproperties in the world and we show evidence that they facilitate learning\nbecause they capture event descriptions at a useful spatiotemporal grain size.\nThis is evaluated through our agent's performance in the game. We also show\nempirical evidence that the perception of spatial extent of episodes affects\nboth their temporal duration as well as the number of overall cases generated.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IQexfYfysIbvv8woISK_e2Zf9b1J3Y2KEGI1u2UC7ZI","pdfSize":"745177"}
