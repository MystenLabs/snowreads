  "abstract": "  We study the structure of normal operators of double fibration transforms\nwith conjugate points. Examples of double fibration transforms include Radon\ntransforms, $d$-plane transforms on the Euclidean space, geodesic X-ray\ntransforms, light-ray transforms, and ray transforms defined by null\nbicharacteristics associated with real principal type operators. We show that,\nunder certain stable conditions on the distribution of conjugate points, the\nnormal operator splits into an elliptic pseudodifferential operator and several\nFourier integral operators, depending on the degree of the conjugate points.\nThese results were first proved for geodesic X-ray transforms by Holman and\nUhlmann (Journal of Differential Geometry, {\\bf 108} (2018), pp.459--494).\n",
