We detect extremely\nfaint emission from this Galactic Warm Ionized Medium (WIM) using the Green\nBank Telescope to make radio recombination line (RRL) observations toward two\nMilky Way sight lines: G20, $(\\ell,{\\it b}) = (20^\\circ, 0^\\circ)$, and G45,\n$(\\ell,{\\it b}) = (45^\\circ, 0^\\circ)$. We stack 18 consecutive Hn$\\alpha$\ntransitions between 4.3-7.1 GHz to derive ${\\rm \\langle Hn\\alpha \\rangle}$\nspectra that are sensitive to RRL emission from plasmas with emission measures\nEM >10 ${\\rm \\,cm^{-6}\\,pc}$. Each sight line has two Gaussian shaped spectral\ncomponents with emission measures that range between $\\sim$100 and $\\sim$300\n${\\rm \\,cm^{-6}\\,pc}$. Because there is no detectable RRL emission at negative\nLSR velocities the emitting plasma must be located interior to the Solar orbit.\nThe G20 and G45 emission measures imply RMS densities of 0.15 and 0.18$\\,{\\rm\ncm^{-3}}$, respectively, if these sight lines are filled with homogeneous\nplasma. The observed ${\\rm \\langle Hn\\beta \\rangle}$/${\\rm \\langle\nHn\\alpha\\rangle}$ line ratios are consistent with LTE excitation for the\nstrongest components. The high velocity component of G20 has a narrow line\nwidth, 13.5 km s$^{-1}$, that sets an upper limit of <4,000 K for the plasma\nelectron temperature. This is inconsistent with the ansatz of a canonically\npervasive, low density, $\\sim$ 10,000 K WIM plasma.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vLRLLlAHY2QY9WBU0AVWV6G_DqLjKCTq8A5kVE0HnBc","pdfSize":"2681276"}
