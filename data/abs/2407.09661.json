The Bridging Dictionary includes a static, printable document\nfeaturing 796 terms with summaries generated by a large language model. These\nsummaries highlight how the terms are used distinctively by Republicans and\nDemocrats. Additionally, the Bridging Dictionary offers an interactive\ninterface that lets users explore selected words, visualizing their frequency,\nsentiment, summaries, and examples across political divides. We present a use\ncase for journalists and emphasize the importance of human agency and trust in\nfurther enhancing this tool.
