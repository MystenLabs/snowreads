We study the problem in a very simple geometric situation as the\nregion between two parallel planes, with periodicity along the two planes. This\nsetting, which is often used in the theory of boundary layers, requires some\nspecial treatment for what concerns the functional setting and allows us to\ncharacterize in a rather explicit manner eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the\nassociated Stokes problem. These, will be then used in order to identify\ninfinite dimensional classes of data leading to global strong solutions for the\ncorresponding evolution Navier-Stokes equations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"GkVLtvyY3Q9P0AeH_gpaWNUc7a9CEukKxjmPCaVJH0k","pdfSize":"1146226"}
