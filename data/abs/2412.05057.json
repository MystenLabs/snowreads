  "abstract": "  Surface-plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are electromagnetic waves that propagate\nalong metal-dielectric interfaces, with important applications in sensing,\nenergy, and nanotechnology. While the behavior of SPPs in single metal slabs is\nwell understood, the coupling between plasmon modes in multilayer systems has\nreceived less attention. In this paper, we explore the response functions of\nSPPs in single-slab, double-slab, and two-different-slab systems using the\njellium model. Thanks to a comparison with classical models, our study reveals\nhow quantum effects influence the resonance frequencies of these modes. It also\ndetails the spatial description of the different SPP modes and unveils how\ntheir coupling occurs in two-different-slab systems. These findings provide new\ninsights into the behavior of SPPs, especially in complex nanostructures.\n",
