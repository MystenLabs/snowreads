The present paper\nshows how to generate additional, doubly infinite summed series involving\n\\,_{1}F_{2} hypergeometric functions from Chebyshev polynomial expansions of\nBessel functions, and trebly infinite sets of summed series involving\n\\,_{1}F_{2} hypergeometric functions from Gegenbauer polynomial expansions of\nBessel functions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"r8i2iEnGG64kqPg-qwCdeWhd3tvd4-Fs93CHEOdXOYI","pdfSize":"204225"}
