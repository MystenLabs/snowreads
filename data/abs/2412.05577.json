In this work we study the cosmological properties of interacting\nBarrow holographic dark energy model in the case of non-zero curvature\nuniverse. We construct the differential equations governing the evolution of\nthe Barrow holographic dark energy density parameter and the dark matter\ndensity parameter in coupled form for both closed and open spatial geometry.\nConsidering three different forms of coupling, we obtain the corresponding\nanalytical expressions for the equation of state parameter for the dark energy\ncomponent. We confront the scenario using recent observational datasets like\ncosmic chronometer and Pantheon data. It has been found that the strength of\ninteraction as well as the curvature contribution come out to be nonzero which\nindicates that a non-flat interacting scenario is preferred by observational\ndata.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"AaiS3abd29jTwUJL7cq1Ub4LPUWU8ccS1mipJnSGWlI","pdfSize":"1009077"}
