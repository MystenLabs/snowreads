In particular,\nthe Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) compartment model is foundational\nfor population epidemiological modeling and has been implemented in several\nprior Petri net studies. However, the SIR model is generally stated as a system\nof ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with continuous time and variables,\nwhile Petri nets are discrete event simulations. To our knowledge, no prior\nstudy has investigated the numerical equivalence of Petri net SIR models to the\nclassical ODE formulation. We introduce crucial numerical techniques for\nimplementing SIR models in the GPenSim package for Petri net simulations. We\nshow that these techniques are critical for Petri net SIR models and show a\nrelative root mean squared error of less than 1% compared to ODE simulations\nfor biologically relevant parameter ranges. We conclude that Petri nets provide\na valid framework for modeling SIR-type dynamics using biologically relevant\nparameter values provided that the other PN structures we outline are also\nimplemented.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Other Quantitative Biology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"LAQBpzKiEVwgrEVat_poAro-VuUZkd4pt4CoWcge_FQ","pdfSize":"1269755"}
