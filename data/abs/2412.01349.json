To understand structure\nformation in cosmological models, it is essential to study both the background\nand perturbative aspects of their cosmology. While extensive analysis of both\nHorndeski gravity and its teleparallel analog exists in the literature, a\nquantitative understanding requires a detailed examination of their\ncosmological perturbations. We review here all the different gauges for the\nscalar, vector and tensor perturbations of a cosmological background up to\nsecond order and we hope this will help people who work with observations, to\nincorporate it in existing codes.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aHmJh3a4XTw0RxdVqoMC1GkERhZpc4PA4pWNF1M4nK0","pdfSize":"421956"}
