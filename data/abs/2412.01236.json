  "abstract": "  Full-vectorial finite difference method with perfectly matched layers\nboundaries is used to identify the single mode operation region of submicron\nrib waveguides fabricated using sili-con-on-insulator material system.\nAchieving high mode power confinement factors is emphasized while maintaining\nthe single mode operation. As opposed to the case of large cross-section rib\nwaveguides, theoretical single mode conditions have been demonstrated to hold\nfor sub-micron waveguides with accuracy approaching 100%. Both, the deeply and\nthe shallowly etched rib waveguides have been considered and the single mode\ncondition for entire sub-micrometer range is presented while adhering to design\nspecific mode confinement requirements.\n",
