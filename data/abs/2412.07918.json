We establish foundational\nproperties for indecomposability and locality in $\\mathbb{N}$-graded vertex\nalgebras, with our main result demonstrating the equivalence of locality,\nindecomposability, and specific structural conditions on semiconformal-vertex\nalgebras. The study of symmetric invariant bilinear forms of\nsemiconformal-vertex algebra is investigated. We also examine the structural\ncharacteristics of $V_0$ and $V_1$, demonstrating conditions under which\ncertain $\\mathbb{N}$-graded vertex algebras cannot be quasi vertex operator\nalgebras, semiconformal-vertex algebras, or vertex operator algebras, and\nexplore $\\mathbb{N}$-graded vertex algebras $V=\\bigoplus_{n=0}^{\\infty}V_n$\nassociated with Gorenstein algebras. Our analysis includes examining the socle,\nPoincar\\'{e} duality properties, and invariant bilinear forms of $V_0$ and\ntheir influence on $V_1$, providing conditions for embedding rank-one\nHeisenberg vertex operator algebras within $V$. Supporting examples and\ndetailed theoretical insights further illustrate these algebraic structures.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Y--V4p9HvbLc1BqkufUbWVsAzEf9GKonQddixVBzbAk","pdfSize":"391774"}
