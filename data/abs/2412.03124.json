The paper is an executable literate Agda script, and source of\nthe paper is available as an artifact in the file Weaken.lagda.md.\n  Not all consequences of the pandemic have been awful. For the last three\nyears, I've had the great pleasure of meeting with Peter Thiemann and Jeremy\nSiek for a couple of hours every week, via Zoom, exploring topics including\ncore calculi, gradual typing, and formalisation in Agda. The work reported here\narose from those discussions, and is dedicated to Peter on the occasion of his\n60th birthday.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Programming Languages","Computer Science/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UGsYa1kMXNMypl-W9tTgXcab6OklNKaAPfqK7yj7O7w","pdfSize":"196515"}
