The XANE embeddings are used to estimate specific\nparameters related to the background acoustic properties of the signal which\nallows the embeddings to be explainable in terms of those parameters. We\nperform ablation studies on the XANE system and show that estimating all\nacoustic parameters jointly has an overall positive effect. Furthermore, we\nillustrate the value of XANE embeddings by performing clustering experiments on\nunseen test data and show that the proposed embeddings achieve a mean F1 score\nof 92\\% for three different tasks, outperforming significantly the WavLM based\nsignal embeddings and are complimentary to speaker embeddings.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"-8ftnLKX-rwHdg8xNDXcTmkS-hP5AGs2BYUd2vQvKo0","pdfSize":"1395034"}
