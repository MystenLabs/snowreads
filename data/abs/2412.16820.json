  "abstract": "  For integral weights $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$ of a classical simple Lie algebra\n$\\mathfrak{g}$, Kostant's weight multiplicity formula gives the multiplicity of\nthe weight $\\mu$ in the irreducible representation with highest weight\n$\\lambda$, which we denote by $m(\\lambda,\\mu)$. Kostant's weight multiplicity\nformula is an alternating sum over the Weyl group of the Lie algebra whose\nterms are determined via a vector partition function. The Weyl alternation set\n$\\mathcal{A}(\\lambda,\\mu)$ is the set of Weyl group elements that contribute\nnontrivially to the multiplicity $m(\\lambda,\\mu)$. In this article, we prove\nthat Weyl alternation sets are order ideals in the weak Bruhat order of the\ncorresponding Weyl group. Specializing to the Lie algebra\n$\\mathfrak{sl}_{r+1}(\\mathbb{C})$, we give a complete characterization of the\nWeyl alternation sets $\\mathcal{A}(\\tilde{\\alpha},\\mu)$, where $\\tilde{\\alpha}$\nis the highest root and $\\mu$ is a negative root, answering a question of Harry\nposed in 2024. We also provide some enumerative results that pave the way for\nour future work where we aim to prove Harry's conjecture that the $q$-analog of\nKostant's weight multiplicity formula\n$m_q(\\tilde{\\alpha},\\mu)=q^{r+j-i+1}+q^{r+j-i}-q^{j-i+1}$ when\n$\\mu=-(\\alpha_i+\\alpha_{i+1}+\\cdots+\\alpha_{j})$ is a negative root of\n$\\mathfrak{sl}_{r+1}(\\mathbb{C})$.\n",
