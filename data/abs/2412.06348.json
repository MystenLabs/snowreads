  "abstract": "  In this article, we study discrete maximal function associated with the\nBirch-Magyar averages over sparse sequences. We establish sparse domination\nprinciple for such operators. As a consequence, we obtain $\\ell^p$-estimates\nfor such discrete maximal function over sparse sequences for all $p>1$. The\nproof of sparse bounds is based on scale-free $\\ell^p-$improving estimates for\nthe single scale Birch-Magyar averages.\n",
