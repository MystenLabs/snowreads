Herein, we propose a method based upon a multi-objective\nevolutionary search that uses both a structure's enthalpy and similarity to a\nreference XRD pattern (constituted by a list of peak positions and their\nintensities) to facilitate structure solution of inorganic systems. Because the\nsimilarity index is computed for locally optimized cells that are subsequently\ndistorted to find the best match with the reference, this process transcends\nboth computational (e.g. choice of theoretical method, and 0 K approximation)\nand experimental (e.g. external stimuli, and metastability) limitations. We\nillustrate how the proposed methodology can be employed to successfully uncover\ncomplex crystal structures by applying it to a range of test cases, including\ninorganic minerals, pure elements ramp-compressed to extreme conditions, and\nmolecular crystals. The results demonstrate that our approach not only improves\nthe accuracy of structure prediction but also significantly reduces the time\nrequired to achieve reliable solutions, thus providing a powerful tool for the\nadvancement of materials science and related fields.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"P9Km61eGZASayOE8RFqg99YUeSTkk37jvB22n8qtyfQ","pdfSize":"843424"}
