The large $n$ asymptotic behaviour of the number $K_{n}$\nof blocks in the Ewens-Pitman random partition has been extensively\ninvestigated in terms of almost-sure and Gaussian fluctuations, which show that\n$K_{n}$ scales as $\\log n$ and $n^{\\alpha}$ depending on whether $\\alpha=0$ or\n$\\alpha\\in(0,1)$, providing non-random and random limiting behaviours,\nrespectively. In this paper, we study the large $n$ asymptotic behaviour of\n$K_{n}$ when the parameter $\\theta$ is allowed to depend linearly on\n$n\\in\\mathbb{N}$, a non-standard asymptotic regime first considered for\n$\\alpha=0$ in Feng (\\textit{The Annals of Applied Probability}, \\textbf{17},\n2007). In particular, for $\\alpha\\in[0,1)$ and $\\theta=\\lambda n$, with\n$\\lambda>0$, we establish a law of large numbers (LLN) and a central limit\ntheorem (CLT) for $K_{n}$, which show that $K_{n}$ scales as $n$, providing\nnon-random limiting behaviours. Depending on whether $\\alpha=0$ or\n$\\alpha\\in(0,1)$, our results rely on different arguments. For $\\alpha=0$ we\nrely on the representation of $K_{n}$ as a sum of independent, but not\nidentically distributed, Bernoulli random variables, which leads to a\nrefinement of the CLT in terms of a Berry-Esseen theorem. Instead, for\n$\\alpha\\in(0,1)$, we rely on a compound Poisson construction of $K_{n}$,\nleading to prove LLNs, CLTs and Berry-Esseen theorems for the number of blocks\nof the negative-Binomial compound Poisson random partition, which are of\nindependent interest.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CTZtHjWUOejlBSEvDMgaUc_4h2HNkrBJPWk-mHnO1X0","pdfSize":"803593"}
