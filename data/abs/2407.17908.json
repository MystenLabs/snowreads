All-electron and valence-only versions of\nthe bounds are given, and the latter are found to be more informative. The\nbounds on $\\ell$ are particularly interesting, as they provide reasonably tight\nestimates for an ellusive ground-state property -- the average localization\nlength of valence electrons -- from tabulated experimental data: electron\ndensity, high-frequency dielectric constant, and optical gap. The localization\nlengths estimated in this way for several materials follow simple chemical\ntrends, especially for the alkali halides. We also illustrate our findings via\nanalytically solvable harmonic oscillator models, which reveal an intriguing\nconnection to the physics of long-ranged van der Waals forces.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"a6b_yJum1Oo8vPq_a23KqJjJB3dYCNzYlbPXr-UTTA4","pdfSize":"511661","objectId":"0x17ae1f26e32ce750a852e65d4933f1400a0fecd07dc96eaffb36bb80e4ed2e2e","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
