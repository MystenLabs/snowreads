Their dynamics can be\ndescribed by a Hamiltonian constraint, which modifies the spinnetwork graphs.\nFixed graph approximations of the dynamics have been extensively studied, but\nits full graph-changing action so far remains elusive. The latter, alongside\nthe solutions of its constraint, are arguably the missing features to access\nphysically correct quantum-relativistic phenomenology from canonical LQG. Here,\nwe introduce the first numerical tool that implements graph-changing dynamics\nvia the Hamiltonian constraint. We find new solutions to this constraint and\nshow that some quantum-geometrical observables behave differently than in the\ngraph-preserving truncation. This work aims at fostering a new era of numerical\nsimulations in canonical LQG that, crucially, embrace the graph-changing\naspects of its dynamics, laying aside debated approximations.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"NR87-CQC9UYBclNM5yIagI_jCpLqtkFmyhma6jXPkjU","pdfSize":"469003"}
