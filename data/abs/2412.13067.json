In this paper, we\nintroduce Hamiltonian recognition, a framework that bridges quantum hypothesis\ntesting and quantum metrology, aiming to identify the Hamiltonian governing\nquantum dynamics from a known set of Hamiltonians. To identify $H$ for an\nunknown qubit quantum evolution $\\exp(-iH\\theta)$ with unknown $\\theta$, from\ntwo or three orthogonal Hamiltonians, we develop a quantum algorithm for\ncoherent function simulation, built on two quantum signal processing (QSP)\nstructures. It can simultaneously realize a target polynomial based on\nmeasurement results regardless of the chosen signal unitary for the QSP.\nUtilizing semidefinite optimization and group representation theory, we prove\nthat our methods achieve the optimal average success probability, taken over\npossible Hamiltonians $H$ and parameters $\\theta$, decays as $O(1/k)$ with $k$\nqueries of the unknown unitary transformation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the\nvalidity of our protocol on a superconducting quantum processor. This work\npresents an efficient method to recognize Hamiltonians from limited queries of\nthe dynamics, opening new avenues in composite channel discrimination and\nquantum metrology.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EHe4qWrMiF5gQndUiqsDr1oKTsKe72eIlSVSKH-rBlE","pdfSize":"1768051"}
