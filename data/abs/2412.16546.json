We show that the fundamental\ncharacterizations of the property of being universally Baire have natural\ngeneralizations that can be formulated also for subsets of $2^\\kappa$, in\nparticular we provide four equivalent uniform definitions in the parameter\n$\\kappa$ (for $\\kappa$ an infinite cardinal) characterizing for each such\n$\\kappa$ the class of universally Baire subsets of $2^\\kappa$. For\n$\\kappa=\\omega$, these definitions bring us back to the original notion of\nuniversally Baire sets of reals given by Feng, Magidor and Woodin [2].\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"2HSDGRKWPcgi-B981PVRybuMrUJnedjKikDt-CtBU74","pdfSize":"474244"}
