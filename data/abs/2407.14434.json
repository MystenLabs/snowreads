However, existing methods often\noverlook the importance of considering the context of biological tissues (e.g.,\nshape, spatial layout, and tissue type) in the synthetic data. Moreover, while\ngenerative models have shown superior performance in synthesizing realistic\nhistopathology images, none of the existing methods are capable of producing\nimage-label pairs at the same time. In this paper, we introduce a novel\nframework for co-synthesizing histopathology nuclei images and paired semantic\nlabels using a context-conditioned joint diffusion model. We propose\nconditioning of a diffusion model using nucleus centroid layouts with\nstructure-related text prompts to incorporate spatial and structural context\ninformation into the generation targets. Moreover, we enhance the granularity\nof our synthesized semantic labels by generating instance-wise nuclei labels\nusing distance maps synthesized concurrently in conjunction with the images and\nsemantic labels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in\ngenerating high-quality samples on multi-institutional, multi-organ, and\nmulti-modality datasets. Our synthetic data consistently outperforms existing\naugmentation methods in the downstream tasks of nuclei segmentation and\nclassification.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"iKD9JpNi7WscFVEWLZ_dg3i5qqZf3dBXVBB-6dDTG1M","pdfSize":"3173696","objectId":"0x4aced2fa5e055fd72a44ac2a784b751610abd682507e211900d9d4481dd80eff","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
