Our main result gives moderate\ndeviation principles of occupation times of the process starting from an\ninvariant product measure. Two replacement lemmas play key roles in the proof\nof our main result. To obtain these replacement lemmas, we utilize duality\nrelationships between the symmetric exclusion process and two types of random\nwalks on $\\mathbb{T}^d$ and $\\left(\\mathbb{T}^d\\right)^2$ respectively.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Nd01bo-pMtgZPdS52qFtB_uFS_FxZkOjF8-TACEl4rY","pdfSize":"272959"}
