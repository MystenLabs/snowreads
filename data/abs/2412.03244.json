  "abstract": "  We compute the leading clustering (abelian non-global) logarithms, which\narise in the distribution of non-global QCD observables when final-state\npartons are clustered using the $k_t$ jet algorithm, up to six loops in\nperturbation theory. Our calculations are based on the recently introduced\nformula for the analytic structure of $k_t$ clustering [1]. These logarithms\nexhibit a pattern of exponentiation and are subsequently resummed into an\nexponential form. We compare this resummed result with all-orders numerical\ncalculations. Additionally, we enhance the analytical distribution using\ntechniques from the study of non-abelian non-global logarithms, particularly\nthrough the application of conformal transformations.\n",
