  "abstract": "  A planar graph $G$ is called a pentagulation of an $n$-gon ($n\\geq$ is an\ninteger) if all faces of $G$ are pentagons, except one, which is an $n$-gon. A\n$3$-connected pentagulation $G$ of an $n$-gon is called minimal if it has the\nsmallest number of pentagons among all such $3$-connected pentagulations. It is\nknown that minimal pentagulations of the $3$-gon and $4$-gon contain 15 and 14\npentagons, respectively. We determined all minimal pentagulations of $n$-gons\nfor all $n$ such that $3\\leq n\\leq 12$ using computer calculations. The\ncalculations employed the plantri package, which generates all planar\ntriangulations for a given number of vertices. We also present several open\nquestions on this topic.\n",
