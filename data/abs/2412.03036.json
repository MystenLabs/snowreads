In CT, hundreds of\nX-ray images acquired as the X-ray source and detector rotate around a central\naxis, are used for precise reconstruction. In security baggage inspection,\nX-ray imaging is also widely used; however, unlike the rotating systems in\nmedical CT, stationary X-ray systems are more common, and publicly available\nreconstructed data are limited. This makes it challenging to obtain large-scale\n3D labeled data and voxel representations essential for training. To address\nthese limitations, our study presents a calibration and reconstruction method\nusing an unaligned sparse multi-view X-ray baggage dataset, which has extensive\n2D labeling. Our approach integrates multi-spectral neural attenuation field\nreconstruction with Linear pushbroom (LPB) camera model pose optimization,\nenhancing rendering consistency for novel views through color coding network.\nOur method aims to improve generalization within the security baggage\ninspection domain, where generalization is particularly challenging.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"8w6nqwb6zxROxPRCuKiiqEYtyGFByo1MWk4AChUXHuM","pdfSize":"7691380"}
