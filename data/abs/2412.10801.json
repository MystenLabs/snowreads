  "abstract": "  We extend the classical Otal-Peign\\'e's Theorem to the class of proper,\nGromov-hyperbolic spaces that are line-convex. Namely, we prove that when a\ngroup acts discretely and virtually freely by isometries on a metric space in\nthis class then its critical exponent equals the topological entropy of the\ngeodesic flow of the quotient metric space. We also show examples of proper,\nGromov-hyperbolic spaces that are not line-convex and for which the statement\nfails.\n",
