We also delve into the business implications, mitigation strategies, and\nfuture research directions. To gain practical insights, we employ the\nAdversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART) [1] library to simulate these attacks on\nreal-world use cases, such as self-driving cars. Our goal is to inform\npractitioners and researchers about the challenges and opportunities in\ndefending AI systems against adversarial threats. By providing a comprehensive\ncomparison of different attack methods, we aim to contribute to the development\nof more robust and secure AI systems.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fCST2-vDZM8kRjNCyS5Gvln6FzutgaKY3_Lv9NMdSvI","pdfSize":"1551391"}
