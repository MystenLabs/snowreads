  "abstract": "  While optical clock technology has advanced rapidly in recent years,\nincorporating the technology into operational timescales has progressed more\nslowly. The highest accuracy frequency standards for groundbreaking\nmeasurements do not easily translate to critical timing where continuous,\nuninterrupted operation over many months and years is required. For example,\nintermittent steering of a hydrogen maser with an optical standard fails to\nharness all of the dramatic improvements possible with optical technology. Here\nwe present progress on development and integration of optical-clock technology\nfor operational timescales. An optical oscillator steered to an atomic fountain\ncomprises a hybrid clock with optical-level stability at short times and a\nreliable long-term reference, and obviates the need for a steered maser. Atomic\nbeam optical clocks are being developed to support 24/7 operations at a level\nthat improves upon the performance of the U.S. Naval Observatory's rubidium\nfountains. An optical lattice is being developed as a gold-standard frequency\nreference, complementing the role of the atomic beam clocks.\n",
