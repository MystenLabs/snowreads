The increased use of such graphs creates a paramount need for generative\nmodels suitable for applications such as data augmentation, obfuscation, and\nanomaly detection. However, there are few generative techniques that handle\ncontinuously changing temporal graph data; existing work largely relies on\naugmenting static graphs with additional temporal information to model dynamic\ninteractions between nodes. In this work, we propose a fundamentally different\napproach: We instead directly model interactions as a joint probability of an\nedge forming between two nodes at a given time. This allows us to\nautoregressively generate new synthetic dynamic graphs in a largely assumption\nfree, scalable, and inductive manner. We formalize this approach as DG-Gen, a\ngenerative framework for continuous time dynamic graphs, and demonstrate its\neffectiveness over five datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that DG-Gen not\nonly generates higher fidelity graphs compared to traditional methods but also\nsignificantly advances link prediction tasks.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"evdOMZrkRKZn7wYwKlShEINusF21P5gFbQKTJ6M-8Uc","pdfSize":"593615"}
