Onboard event classification\ncan be required to decide on which data to downlink with priority, given\nlimited data-transfer bandwidth. Event classification is also the first and one\nof the most crucial steps in reconstructing data. Its outcome determines the\nfurther handling of the event, i.e., the type of reconstruction (Compton, pair)\nor, possibly, the decision to discard it. Errors at this stage result in\nmisreconstruction and loss of source information. We present a classification\nalgorithm driven by a Convolutional Neural Network. It provides classification\nof the type of electromagnetic interaction, based solely on low-level detector\ndata. We introduce the task, describe the architecture and the dataset used,\nand present the performance of this method in the context of the proposed\n(e-)ASTROGAM and similar telescopes.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"QjFnPjWHEBmqKvp4YCYIeMBo2X7uTepo5bwuuw68AaM","pdfSize":"1131013","objectId":"0x23069f18d6140b2418847bfef64d8f8f894ab8e6e8e895065a69969a98cf468d","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
