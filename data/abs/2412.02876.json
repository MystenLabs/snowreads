We train the network on a dataset of experimentally\nmeasured dipole strength functions for 216 different nuclei. To assess its\npredictive capability, we test the trained model on an additional set of 10 new\nnuclei, where experimental data exist. Our results demonstrate that the\nartificial neural network not only accurately reproduces known data but also\nidentifies potential inconsistencies in certain experimental datasets,\nindicating which results may warrant further review or possible rejection.\nAdditionally, for nuclei where experimental data are sparse or unavailable, the\nnetwork confirms theoretical calculations, reinforcing its utility as a\npredictive tool in nuclear physics. Finally, utilizing the predicted electric\ndipole polarizability, we extract the value of the symmetry energy at\nsaturation density and find it consistent with results from the literature.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HVhS_AY1-qKnE9LLuELFi7aiBPbxfEwuuvAcEVXk49k","pdfSize":"667461"}
