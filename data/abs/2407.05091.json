First, unlike previous studies, we\nderive $\\textbf{k}$-linear Rashba term from a first-principles Hamiltonian in a\nphysically convincing manner. The $\\textbf{k}$-dependent in-plane intrinsic\nmagnetic-field term originates from the spin--orbit interaction and hybridized\n$s$-$p_z$ orbital, whereas a steep nucleus potential realizes the linearity for\nthe $\\textbf{k}$ of the effective magnetic field. Next, we analyze the Rashba\neffect of a QWS using a one-dimensional tight-binding model developed based on\nthe bottom-up approach that is aforementioned. The Rashba-splitting behavior of\nthis system is captured from the density at the interface. The density can be\nexpressed analytically as a function of the monolayer number and well depth.\nFinally, we apply our formula to the QWS of a few-monolayers Ag on an Au(111)\nsurface to validate the theory based on a realistic system. Our tight-binding\nanalysis qualitatively fits the first-principles result using only two fitting\nparameters and predicts the optimal condition for achieving a large Rashba\nsplitting.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"skkgkBSKJNGd0ftKgdWI68GVOS6tteCGHSRxpuJ7Mj0","pdfSize":"725370"}
