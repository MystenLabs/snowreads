  "abstract": "  Quantum memory devices with high storage efficiency and bandwidth are\nessential elements for future quantum networks. Here, we report a storage\nefficiency greater than 28% in a Tm$^{3+}$: YAG crystal in elevated\ntemperatures and without compromising the memory bandwidth. Using various\npumping and optimization techniques, we demonstrate multi-frequency window\nstorage with a high memory bandwidth of 630 MHz. Moreover, we propose a general\nmethod for large-bandwidth atomic-frequency memory with non-Kramers\nrare-earth-ion (REI) in solids enabling significantly higher storage efficiency\nand bandwidth. Our study advances the practical applications of quantum memory\ndevices based on REI-doped crystals.\n",
