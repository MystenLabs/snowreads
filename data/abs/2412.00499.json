This study synthesizes a defective and strained black Bi2O3 by\nsevere straining under high pressure, via a high-pressure torsion method, to\nimprove its photocatalytic hydrogen production. The material rich in oxygen\nvacancies exhibits a ten-fold improvement in water splitting with excellent\ncycling stability. Such improvement is due to improved light absorption,\nnarrowing band gap and reduced irradiative electron-hole recombination.\nMoreover, the valence band bottom energy positively increases by straining\nleading to a high overpotential for hydrogen production. This research\nhighlights the potential of vacancies and lattice strain in developing\ndopant-free active catalysts for water splitting.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Rfr7Egh0_yRuV6-3LxDhuU7KWVODQ6Y1FBW6KUzMxmI","pdfSize":"1116380"}
