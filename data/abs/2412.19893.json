Considering a scalar that has universal and couplings\nto leptons only, we compute this leptophilic scalar contribution to the\n$e^{-}e^{+} \\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-} S $ production cross section with $S\n\\rightarrow \\ell^+\\ell^-$. We later compare the expected signal with recent\ndata from the Belle collaboration collected near the resonance $\\Upsilon(4S)$\nwith $\\mathcal{L}=626 fb^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity to place limits on the\ncouplings-mass plane for the $4$~MeV-$6.5$~GeV mass range to show that Belle\nstands a great laboratory for light scalars, particularly excluding part of the\nparameter space in which the muon g-2 anomaly is addressed.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"y30fTbHkFxcjxil8JFfPbsQbZqQGhps06HrSKfEKPaE","pdfSize":"706984"}
