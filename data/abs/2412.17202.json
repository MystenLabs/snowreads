It has been studied so far as a theoretical model, where an\nexternal field would be the source of the non-commutativity effects in\nspace-time. Being the Standard Model of fundamental interactions a local\ntheory, the prediction of observables within it would be drastically altered by\nsuch affects. The natural question that arises is: how do particles interact\nwith this field? In this work, we will answer this question using a point-like\ncharged particle interacting with the Poisson gauge field, investigating how\ntheir trajectories are affected using the $\\kappa$-Minkowski structure. The\ninteraction arises from the construction of a gauge-invariant action. Using the\nfield solutions, we find the second-order equation for the deformed Lorentz\nforce, indicating possible effects of an emergent gravity due to\nnon-commutativity.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cv4KGn8vHrTaEnidtq3xrRUiBxgXJPCM9MHDTjQmz_Q","pdfSize":"414591"}
