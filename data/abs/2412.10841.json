We show that every such surface $S$ is isomorphic to either\n$\\mathbb{F}_1$ or a surface $S_r$ defined by a rational number $r \\in\n\\mathbb{Q} \\setminus \\mathbb{Z}$ $(r >1)$. If $a:= [ r]$ then $S_r$ is obtained\nfrom the minimal desingularization of the weighted projective plane\n$\\mathbb{P}(1, 2, 2a+1)$ by toric blow-ups whose quantity equals the level of\nthe rational number $\\{ r \\} \\in (0,1)$ in the classical Farey tree. Moreover,\nwe show that if $r = b/c$ with coprime $b$ and $c$, then $S_r$ is the minimal\ndesingularization of the weighted projective plane $\\mathbb{P}(1, c, b)$. We\napply $2$-dimensional regular fans $\\Sigma_r$ of toric surfaces $S_r$ for\nconstructing $2$-dimensional colored fans $\\Sigma^c$ of minimal horospherical\n$3$-folds having a regular $SL(2) \\times \\mathbb{G}_m$-action. The latter are\nminimal toric $3$-folds $V_r$ classified by Z. Guan. We establish a direct\ncombinatorial connection between the $3$-dimensional fans\n$\\widetilde{\\Sigma}^c_r$ of $3$-folds $V_r$ and the $2$-dimensional fans\n$\\Sigma_r$ of surfaces $S_r$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XUxCfwEtjlhwtb-fnCZxEY-a_izDmhdHb6A92VyhqVw","pdfSize":"234293"}
