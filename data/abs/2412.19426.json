  "abstract": "  The recently proposed dark dimension scenario reveals that the axions can be\nlocalized on the Standard Model brane, thereby predicting the quantum\nchromodynamics (QCD) axion decay constant from the weak gravity conjecture:\n$f_a\\lesssim M_5 \\sim 10^{9}-10^{10}\\, \\rm GeV$, where $M_5$ is the\nfive-dimensional Planck mass. When combined with observational lower bounds,\nthis implies that $f_a$ falls within a narrow range $f_a\\sim 10^{9}-10^{10}\\,\n\\rm GeV$, corresponding to the axion mass $m_a\\sim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}\\, \\rm eV$.\nAt this scale, the QCD axion constitutes a minor fraction of the total cold\ndark matter (DM) density $\\sim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}$. In this work, we investigate\nthe issue of QCD axion DM within the context of the dark dimension and\ndemonstrate that the QCD axion in this scenario can account for the entire DM\nabundance through a simple two-axion mixing mechanism. Here we consider the\nresonant conversion of an axion-like particle (ALP) into a QCD axion. We find\nthat, in a scenario where the ALP possesses a mass of approximately $m_A \\sim\n10^{-5} \\, \\rm eV$ and a decay constant of $f_A \\sim 10^{11} \\, \\rm GeV$, the\nQCD axion in the dark dimension scenario can account for the overall DM.\n",
