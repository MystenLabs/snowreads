Our approach focuses on\nthe observable (O) segments of network flows, particularly analyzing Packet\nInter-Arrival Time (PIAT) values and other derived metrics, to infer the\nbehavior of non-observable (NO) segments. Through a comprehensive evaluation,\nwe identify an optimal O/NO split threshold of 10 observed delay samples,\nbalancing prediction accuracy and resource utilization. Evaluating models\nincluding Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and Multi-Layer Perceptron, we find\nXGBoost outperforms others, achieving an F1-score of 0.74, balanced accuracy of\n0.84, and AUROC of 0.97. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of\nincorporating comprehensive early flow features and the potential of our method\nto offer a practical solution for monitoring network traffic in\nresource-constrained environments. This approach ensures enhanced user\nexperience and network performance by preemptively addressing potential SD,\nproviding the basis for a robust framework for maintaining high-quality network\nservices.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8ABXlmXAUfAH075wkbcMuKI09JcxtbQ3YQtjHLTkojA","pdfSize":"1557840"}
