Our main tool is the ``hyperbolic\ndevelopment\" interpretation of the bicycling monodromy of plane curves. Based\non computer experiments, we pose two conjectures concerning the bicycling\nmonodromy of strictly convex closed plane curves.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zT8zaTTUwJAQoM3fjW3sJMHUgbM6reUEOZxGqLkZykY","pdfSize":"976111"}
