In this context,\nGraph Neural Networks are promising due to their ability to learn from\ngraph-structured data. Combined with Reinforcement Learning, they can serve as\ncontrol approaches to determine remedial network actions. This review analyses\nhow Graph Reinforcement Learning (GRL) can improve representation learning and\ndecision making in power grid use cases. Although GRL has demonstrated\nadaptability to unpredictable events and noisy data, it is primarily at a\nproof-of-concept stage. We highlight open challenges and limitations with\nrespect to real-world applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1aTWI4IKlyxm5FoJo-yqaElJHGVEY7ATwq5xaOMYahU","pdfSize":"761901"}
