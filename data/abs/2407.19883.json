We observed two\nferroelectric transitions at 182 ($T_{FE1}$) and 52 K ($T_{FE2}$),\nsignificantly higher than $T_N$ for Sm$_2$Ti$_{2-x}$V$_x$O$_7$ ($x$ = 0, 0.1).\nAlthough the ferroelectric transition temperatures remain unchanged, the\npolarization value decreases considerably with V doping. A structural\ntransition to a polar $R3m$ rhombohedral phase from the cubic $Fd\\bar{3}m$\nstructure occurs at $T_{FE1}$, involving a distortion in the pyochlore lattice.\nRemarkably, significant linear magnetoelectric coupling is observed in both\ncompounds, with further enhancement of magnetoelectric coupling due to magnetic\nV doping. The existence of magnetoelectric coupling without long-range magnetic\norder in a frustrated pyrochlore system could enable the tailoring of\nmagnetoelectric coupling properties, which can be further fine-tuned through V\ndoping. The emergence of ferroelectricity in a frustrated magnetic system\nintroduces an intriguing aspect to these compounds and paves the way for\ndeveloping ferroelectric order driven by the alleviation of magnetic\nfrustration in pyrochlore systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"I3w-nxSS_l9nerpa8tpSpTx6NRJosepP4rQlRFSgC8Q","pdfSize":"4075316"}
