Motivated by the increased theoretical and practical\ninterest in navigational queries, this paper considers the question for which\nof these fragments decidability of querying extends to regular path queries\n(RPQs). In fact, decidability of RPQs has recently been shown to generally hold\nfor the comprehensive family of all fragments that come with the guarantee of\nuniversal models being reasonably well-shaped (that is, being of finite\ncliquewidth). Yet, for the second major family of fragments, known as finite\nunification sets (short: fus), which are based on first-order-rewritability,\ncorresponding results have been largely elusive so far. We complete the picture\nby showing that RPQ answering over arbitrary fus rulesets is undecidable. On\nthe positive side, we establish that the problem is decidable for the prominent\nfus subclass of sticky rulesets, with the caveat that a very mild extension of\nthe RPQ formalism turns the problem undecidable again.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"mti_w5KJLNqrtxtrVdKT9xI45nM_RQWXtKE9A8X4OQ8","pdfSize":"646327"}
