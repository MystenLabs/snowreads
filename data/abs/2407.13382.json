We define the spatial configuration of objects by\nfirst-order logic in terms of relations and attributes. A neuro-symbolic\nprogram matches the logic formulas to probabilistic object proposals for the\ngiven image, provided by language-vision models by querying them for the\nsymbols. This work is the first to combine neuro-symbolic programming\n(reasoning) and language-vision models (learning) to find spatial\nconfigurations of objects in images in an open world setting. We show the\neffectiveness by finding abandoned tools on floors and leaking pipes. We find\nthat most prediction errors are due to biases in the language-vision model.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XOZ5ZNxk4dt6i5G3LG768CqWjBKY5fGGqYjbmBodVkY","pdfSize":"9138625"}
