This\ncomposition corresponds to the minimum Gibbs free energy release rate in the\nsteady state regime, aligning with Prigogine principle of minimum entropy\nproduction for steady states. Geometrically, this is represented by the\nparallel tangents rule, a generalization of the common tangent rule for\ntransitioning from equilibrium to steady state conditions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oXCRp_kUSPPSfAc18S_XLBYfwyX8y3nF29FDZuxAdOE","pdfSize":"863333"}
