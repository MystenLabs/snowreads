The missForestPredict R package proposes an adaptation of the\nmissForest imputation algorithm that is fast, user-friendly and tailored for\nprediction settings. The algorithm iteratively imputes variables using random\nforests until a convergence criterion (unified for continuous and categorical\nvariables and based on the out-of-bag error) is met. The imputation models are\nsaved for each variable and iteration and can be applied later to new\nobservations at prediction time. The missForestPredict package offers extended\nerror monitoring, control over variables used in the imputation and custom\ninitialization. This allows users to tailor the imputation to their specific\nneeds. The missForestPredict algorithm is compared to mean/mode imputation,\nlinear regression imputation, mice, k-nearest neighbours, bagging, miceRanger\nand IterativeImputer on eight simulated datasets with simulated missingness (48\nscenarios) and eight large public datasets using different prediction models.\nmissForestPredict provides competitive results in prediction settings within\nshort computation times.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"C97hrh-8X0hWHwqD66VZ3p4i5ara-R4vutTAdxXxEZM","pdfSize":"1257723"}
