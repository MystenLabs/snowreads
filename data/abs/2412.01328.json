Recently, two major\nevolutions are changing the way pervasive applications are developed. The first\ndeals with moving computation and storage to the edge. The second is the\nmassive use of machine learning techniques to build these applications.\nHowever, architectural principles and integrated frameworks are still missing\ntoday to successfully and repetitively support application developers in the\ncreation of edge-level AI applications. In this paper, we present a novel\narchitecture and platform allowing the development of such applications in\nsmart spaces.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"knT-p3oNSKOV7y0NVuh0M_Lxb0yGsWZyEGN9H1cRaJQ","pdfSize":"806041"}
