Experiments conducted since 2018 indicate an\nanomalous presence of a type of speculated interstellar signal, delta-t delta-f\npolarized pulse pairs, thought to be possibly sourced from a celestial\ndirection near 5.25 hr Right Ascension and -7.6 deg. Declination. A recent\nexperiment utilizing a radio interferometer identified anomalous pulse pairs\nassociated with these celestial coordinates. The experiment is described in\narXiv:2404.08994. Other experiments produced anomalous results, reported in\narXiv:2105.03727, arXiv:2106.10168, arXiv:2202.12791 and arXiv:2203.10065.\nAfter the recent experiment was concluded, the interferometer antenna elements\nwere modified to have increased aperture and reduction in radio\ninterference-caused false positives. An experiment was conducted to attempt\nreplication of the previously reported interferometer measurements.\nObservations are reported here. Apparent replicated falsification of an\nexpected random white noise explanatory hypothesis compels the development and\ntesting of alternate and auxiliary hypotheses.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"OVaSdUOhDrcUghIkqMV_ARBS7H4BGO8qqfTeIyu5a2g","pdfSize":"465263","objectId":"0x8688fd45ed84fc9c2944260041acb3377a2218dd171b756d9cfdb2ecefd418cd","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
