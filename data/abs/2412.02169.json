  "abstract": "  A thorough account of electromagnetic interactions of massive Dirac neutrinos\nas well as their spin-flavor state in the theoretical formulation of elastic\nneutrino-nucleon scattering is given. The formalism of neutrino charge,\nmagnetic, electric, and anapole form factors defined as matrices in the mass\nbasis is employed under the assumption of three-neutrino mixing. The flavor and\nspin change of neutrinos propagating from the source to the detector is taken\ninto account in the form of a spin-flavor density matrix of the neutrino\narriving at the detector. The potential effects of the neutrino charge radii,\nmagnetic moments, and spin polarization in the neutrino-nucleon scattering\nexperiments are outlined.\n",
