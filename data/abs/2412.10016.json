  "abstract": "  We develop a framework for designing density-dependent stochastic resetting\nprotocols to regulate distributions of random walkers on networks. Resetting\nmechanisms that depend on local densities induce correlations in otherwise\nnon-interacting walkers. Our framework allows for the study of both transient\ntrajectories and stationary properties and identifies resetting protocols that\nmaximise the likelihood of homogeneous and, more generally, rare configurations\nof random walkers.\n",
