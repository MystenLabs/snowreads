Fabricated by LFoundry\nusing a 150nm process, it features an improved architecture to mitigate\ncrosstalk, which has been an issue with the predecessor RD50-MPW3, allowing\nmore sensitive threshold settings and full matrix operation. Enhancements\ninclude separated power domains for peripheral and in-pixel digital readout, a\nnew backside-biasing step, and an improved guard ring structure supporting\nbiasing up to 500V, significantly boosting radiation hardness. Laboratory\nmeasurements and test beam results presented in this paper show significant\nimprovements over its predecessor regarding noise behavior, spatial resolution,\nand efficiency.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"fzqz0iY8je5w1BVtZDtk-qhjvciT7tF4uICqGelTouA","pdfSize":"395692"}
