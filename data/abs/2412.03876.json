  "abstract": "  Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models are widely recognized for their ability\nto generate high-quality and diverse images based on text prompts. However,\ndespite recent advances, these models are still prone to generating unsafe\nimages containing sensitive or inappropriate content, which can be harmful to\nusers. Current efforts to prevent inappropriate image generation for diffusion\nmodels are easy to bypass and vulnerable to adversarial attacks. How to ensure\nthat T2I models align with specific safety goals remains a significant\nchallenge. In this work, we propose a novel, training-free approach, called\nPrompt-Noise Optimization (PNO), to mitigate unsafe image generation. Our\nmethod introduces a novel optimization framework that leverages both the\ncontinuous prompt embedding and the injected noise trajectory in the sampling\nprocess to generate safe images. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that\nour framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in suppressing toxic image\ngenerations and demonstrates robustness to adversarial attacks, without needing\nto tune the model parameters. Furthermore, compared with existing methods, PNO\nuses comparable generation time while offering the best tradeoff between the\nconflicting goals of safe generation and prompt-image alignment.\n",
