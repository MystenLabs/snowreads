We investigated the\nbiomechanics of type VI glandular trichomes in cultivated tomato (Solanum\nlycopersicum) and its wild relative (Solanum habrochaites). Using micropipette\nforce sensors and high-speed imaging, we uncovered the rupture mechanics\nunderlying gland bursting, highlighting the small forces and short time-scales\ninvolved in this process. Additionally, we observed larvae of the Western\nflower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis), a major pest in tomato cultivation,\ninadvertently triggering trichome rupture and accumulating glandular secretions\non their bodies. These findings demonstrate how rapid gland bursting and the\nfluid dynamics of glandular secretions act as an efficient and swift plant\ndefense mechanism against insect herbivory.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Vb7OkchDaXUug4DeTGx_GlakygXH5HqR4SQsmJxW0gY","pdfSize":"29105096"}
