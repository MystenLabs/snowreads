It is the\nfundamental, and hence indispensable, concept behind compact and monolithically\nintegrated linear optical transformation1. The true relevance of this becomes\napparent in the high-dimensional context of unconventional optical computing,\nthat is, in optical neural networks. Yet, integrating such holographic\nconnections is very challenging. It demands high fabrication accuracy, and\nnumerical design of the circuit is often non-tractable for large architectures.\nBoth challenges are intrinsically linked to the usually large refractive index\ndifferences between sections of such holographic optical waveguides when using\nstandard techniques of silicon photonics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0-X5rK9nb2pldo3ySuhMsvB240cyIC38Jh83W3crDK0","pdfSize":"1712560"}
