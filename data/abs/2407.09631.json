The behavior is complicated\nwhen the external field is applied modulating also the noise. In this work,\nusing the computerized model, we study the temperature limits of the\ntransitional quantum dynamics in the all-electrically controlled graphene\nsingle-TLS and three-TLS devices exposed to the electromagnetic field. We\nanalyze how the external ac field changes the state of the system and observe\nthat it not only influences the coherent transport there but modifies the\neffect of noise. The conducted numerical experiments determine the conditions\nprovided the quantum coherence in QC may be much prolonged even above the\nambient room temperature which can improve the performance of various quantum\ndevices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"a1IiW5QrkZD0Jp9gXPEmQ4jjVybQiSqSZ2tfosUlQ10","pdfSize":"845253","objectId":"0xf7d5c74daeda90bf31866a1fc20ab3202f95b972c3d0aad5d9ea673783361fbf","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
