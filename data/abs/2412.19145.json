Despite synthetic point clouds (SPC) having\nthe potential to compensate for data shortage, how synthetic color and mixing\nproportion impact DL-based segmentation remains a long-standing question.\nTherefore, this paper addresses this question with extensive experiments by\nintroducing: 1) method to generate SPC with real colors and uniform colors from\nBIM, and 2) enhanced benchmarks for better performance evaluation. Experiments\non DL models including PointNet, PointNet++, and DGCNN show that model\nperformance on SPC with real colors outperforms that on SPC with uniform colors\nby 8.2 % + on both OA and mIoU. Furthermore, a higher than 70 % mixing\nproportion of SPC usually leads to better performance. And SPC can replace real\nones to train a DL model for detecting large and flat building elements.\nOverall, this paper unveils the performance-improving mechanism of SPC and\nbrings new insights to boost SPC's value (for building large models for point\nclouds).\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"hqRXyJSy9B9lwb1Nfdm78xCB0CzXBGjAGI4njIs9Y9c","pdfSize":"2225716"}
