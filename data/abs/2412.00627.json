  "abstract": "  Cooking meals can be difficult, causing many to resort to cookbooks and\nonline recipes. However, relying on these traditional methods of cooking often\nresults in missing ingredients, nutritional hazards, and unsatisfactory meals.\nUsing Augmented Reality (AR) can address these issues; however, current AR\ncooking applications have poor user interfaces and limited accessibility. This\npaper proposes a prototype of an iOS application that integrates AR and\nComputer Vision (CV) into the cooking process. We leverage Google's Gemini\nLarge Language Model (LLM) to identify ingredients in the camera's field of\nvision and generate recipe choices with detailed nutritional information.\nAdditionally, this application uses Apple's ARKit to create an AR user\ninterface compatible with iOS devices. Users can personalize their meal\nsuggestions by inputting their dietary preferences and rating each meal. The\napplication's effectiveness is evaluated through three rounds of user\nexperience surveys. This application advances the field of accessible cooking\nassistance technologies, aiming to reduce food wastage and improve the meal\nplanning experience.\n",
