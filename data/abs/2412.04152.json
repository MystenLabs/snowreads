Here, using the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and\nthe Kitaev chain as examples, we study the impact of a type of experimentally\nrealizable bond dissipation on topological systems by calculating the\nsteady-state density matrix, and demonstrate that such dissipation applied near\nthe system boundary can assist in preparing topological edge states of the\nparent Hamiltonian, irrespective of the initial state or filling. This effect\nstems from the matching between the phase distribution encoded in the\ntopological edge states and the target state prepared through bond dissipation.\nThis work provides new insights into the preparation of topological edge\nstates, particularly in the context of Majorana zero modes.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"adeeDILg5Fu_uLpoHGgsHvU4YDdEA6VAns-aDGtFmKE","pdfSize":"1097250"}
