Here we report a pair of\ncompact multifunctional photodetectors that can selectively measure the local\nphase gradient of, respectively, the right and left circular-polarization\ncomponent of any incident wave. These devices employ a chiral pair of\nintegrated plasmonic metasurfaces to introduce a sharp dependence of\nresponsivity on local direction of propagation of the desired polarization\ncomponent. An order-of-magnitude polarization selectivity with respect to phase\ngradient is demonstrated with both devices. Using the measured device\ncharacteristics, we also describe computationally a pixel array that allows for\nthe simultaneous separate mapping of the right and left circularly-polarized\nincident wavefronts in a particularly simple imaging setup. These unique\ncapabilities may be exploited to enable new functionalities for applications in\nchemical sensing, biomedical microscopy, and machine vision.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mjD2SASN3t7lsgLB-czJmBW81e8dfRh10jMfIMASQP8","pdfSize":"3036661"}
