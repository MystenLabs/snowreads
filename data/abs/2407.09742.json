B.Deroin and S.Hurtado recently proved the 30-year-old\nconjecture that no irreducible lattice in $G$ has a left-invariant total order.\n(Equivalently, they proved that no such lattice has a nontrivial,\norientation-preserving action on the real line.) We will explain many of the\nmain ideas of the proof, by using them to prove the analogous result for\nlattices in $p$-adic semisimple groups. The $p$-adic case is easier, because\nsome of the technical issues do not arise.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yofD_1e-hw0M8NSyeqxv9UM5QctuY0KzmBqFIowQ_cc","pdfSize":"628071","objectId":"0x254ba867eaf211aa1e5fb097b568096ea32bc7373f9430bb638d1361ea0f9627","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
