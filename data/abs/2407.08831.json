Extending this domain, the\nproposed approach explores the application of asymmetric cryptography within a\nneural network framework to safeguard the exchange between two communicating\nentities, i.e., Alice and Bob, from an adversarial eavesdropper, i.e., Eve. It\nemploys a set of five distinct cryptographic keys to examine the efficacy and\nrobustness of communication security against eavesdropping attempts using the\nprinciples of elliptic curve cryptography. The experimental setup reveals that\nAlice and Bob achieve secure communication with negligible variation in\nsecurity effectiveness across different curves. It is also designed to evaluate\ncryptographic resilience. Specifically, the loss metrics for Bob oscillate\nbetween 0 and 1 during encryption-decryption processes, indicating successful\nmessage comprehension post-encryption by Alice. The potential vulnerability\nwith a decryption accuracy exceeds 60\\%, where Eve experiences enhanced\nadversarial training, receiving twice the training iterations per batch\ncompared to Alice and Bob.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sEEMrp2vJEzpIDIQ-JfwSCC4hIRzP4w_AyfMJN_CWSY","pdfSize":"3186870"}
