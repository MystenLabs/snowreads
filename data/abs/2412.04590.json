Previous\nstudies have explored using LLMs for translating code between different\nprogramming languages. Since LLMs are more effective with natural language,\nusing natural language as an intermediate representation in code translation\ntasks presents a promising approach. In this work, we investigate using\nNL-specification as an intermediate representation for code translation. We\nevaluate our method using three datasets, five popular programming languages,\nand 29 language pair permutations. Our results show that using NL-specification\nalone does not lead to performance improvements. However, when combined with\nsource code, it provides a slight improvement over the baseline in certain\nlanguage pairs. Besides analyzing the performance of code translation, we also\ninvestigate the quality of the translated code and provide insights into the\nissues present in the translated code.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xq3GIkYNw9oa6Nvqnmntmul5relxJsyhPAc6y-GbhfE","pdfSize":"581460"}
