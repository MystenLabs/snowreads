  "abstract": "  Cosmological simulations of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) are computationally\nexpensive, and the resulting halos lack flexibility in parameter adjustments,\nsuch as virial mass, density profile, and global velocity. Previous studies\nhave introduced a method for constructing FDM halos with predefined density\nprofiles. In this study, we investigate the initial global velocity of these\nconstructed halos and find that it is non-zero. We provide the theoretical\nformula for this velocity and illustrate that it arises from the interference\nbetween states of odd and even parity. Our calculated results closely match\nsimulation outcomes. Additionally, we showcase how to counteract this velocity\nand create a halo with a customizable initial global velocity. Our study\npresents a practical method for adjusting the initial global velocity of halos\nin controlled FDM simulations, facilitating investigations into tidal effects,\ngalaxy collisions, and other scenarios.\n",
