Traditional\nstrategies, such as aggregating region proposals, often suffer from feature\nvariance due to the inclusion of background information. We introduce a novel\ninstance mask-based feature aggregation approach, significantly refining this\nprocess and deepening the understanding of object dynamics across video frames.\nWe present FAIM, a new VOD method that enhances temporal Feature Aggregation by\nleveraging Instance Mask features. In particular, we propose the lightweight\nInstance Feature Extraction Module (IFEM) to learn instance mask features and\nthe Temporal Instance Classification Aggregation Module (TICAM) to aggregate\ninstance mask and classification features across video frames. Using YOLOX as a\nbase detector, FAIM achieves 87.9% mAP on the ImageNet VID dataset at 33 FPS on\na single 2080Ti GPU, setting a new benchmark for the speed-accuracy trade-off.\nAdditional experiments on multiple datasets validate that our approach is\nrobust, method-agnostic, and effective in multi-object tracking, demonstrating\nits broader applicability to video understanding tasks.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_baWfatoui0SREx96DjLe41JeMvJLnAf8K4mBb-1FQo","pdfSize":"10957793"}
