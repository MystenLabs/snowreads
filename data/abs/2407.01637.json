Despite its theoretical advantages, RBFS is complex and difficult to\nteach and to implement, limiting its widespread adoption. To address these\nchallenges, Iterative Linear Best-First Search (ILBFS) was introduced as a\nsimpler, more intuitive alternative while maintaining the linear space\ncomplexity of RBFS. In this paper, we present the first implementation of\nILBFS, validate its memory usage and node expansion order claims, and explore\ncritical aspects of its implementation, such as tie-breaking and node deletion\nmechanisms. Our findings demonstrate that ILBFS can serve as an effective\nstepping stone for researchers and practitioners looking to use memory\nefficient best-first search methods, facilitating the adoption of RBFS-like\nalgorithms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2VxMvYWsIOZiPrVgIrimzoa-apjmX53bZgagU1KZABE","pdfSize":"175381"}
