  "abstract": "  The tuning of magnetic properties through electrochemical loading of hydrogen\nhas recently attracted significant interest as a way to manipulate magnetic\ndevices with electric fields. In this paper we investigate quantitatively the\nmagneto-ionic effect of hydrogen uptake on the magnetic properties of\nrare-earth transition metal alloy Tb$_x$Co$_{(100-x)}$ in the composition range\nof $x=10-39$ at.\\% using ion implantation. Using this technique we are able to\nlink changes in magnetic behaviour to exact concentrations of hydrogen,\nisolated from the movement of any other ions that would be a factor in\nelectrochemical studies. The composition of the alloy has been varied alongside\nthe hydrogen dose to characterize the effect of progressive hydrogen loading on\nthe full range of $x$ displaying out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy. We find\nlarge changes in two important properties: the compensation composition and the\nCo-rich in-plane to out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy transition composition,\nboth of which move by 6 at.\\% towards higher Tb concentrations after hydrogen\nimplantation. This shift in composition does not increase with a larger dose.\nFrom the changes in magnetization we attribute the change in compensation\ncomposition to a significant reduction of the moment on the Tb sublattice.\n",
