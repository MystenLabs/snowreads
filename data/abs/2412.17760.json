  "abstract": "  We study the critical fluctuations near the resistive transition of very thin\nfilms of high-temperature cuprate superconductors composed of a number $N$ of\nonly a few unit cells of superconducting bilayers. For that, we solve the\nfluctuation spectrum of a Gaussian-Ginzburg-Landau model for few-bilayers\nsuperconductors considering two alternating Josephson interlayer interaction\nstrengths, and we obtain the corresponding paraconductivity above the\ntransition. Then, we extend these calculations to temperatures below the\ntransition through expressions for the Ginzburg number and\nKosterlitz--Thouless-like critical region. When compared with previously\navailable data in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\\delta}$ few-bilayers systems, with $N=1$\nto $4$, our results seem to provide a plausible scenario for their critical\nregime.\n",
