We study these\nquestions in the context of family of curves, in particular Kodaira fibrations,\nand in the context of the family of Jacobians associated to a Kodaira\nfibration. We showed that in the case of family of curves, both the topological\nand Hodge-theoretic analogues of the injectivity part of the section conjecture\nholds, and that in the case of family of Jacobians, the topological analogue of\nthe surjectivity part of the section conjecture does not hold in general. For\nfamily of curves, we also reduce the topological analogue of the surjectivity\npart of the section conjecture to the case where the families have no algebraic\nsections.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"_8FtIVBBT9PKFVju3rdzFNTzss6Eebq3hGEiTfgUoAU","pdfSize":"306303"}
