While the hypothesis is provably correct in classical\nsystems, it is known to fail in the quantum regime. Here, we derive a suitably\nadjusted quantum version of Onsager's original hypothesis. Rigorous analytical\nresults are complemented by a variety of numerical examples.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"obywOaaNjYEnBOBksw92Y-eUHPBAgE_WZeJbYkkAFxg","pdfSize":"544657"}
