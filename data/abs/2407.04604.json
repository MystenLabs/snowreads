Departing from traditional text or sketch-based methods, we for\nthe first time allow users to choose visual concepts by parts for their\ncreative endeavors. The outcome is fine-grained generation that precisely\ncaptures selected visual concepts, ensuring a holistically faithful and\nplausible result. To achieve this, we first parse objects into parts through\nunsupervised feature clustering. Then, we encode parts into text tokens and\nintroduce an entropy-based normalized attention loss that operates on them.\nThis loss design enables our model to learn generic prior topology knowledge\nabout object's part composition, and further generalize to novel part\ncompositions to ensure the generation looks holistically faithful. Lastly, we\nemploy a bottleneck encoder to project the part tokens. This not only enhances\nfidelity but also accelerates learning, by leveraging shared knowledge and\nfacilitating information exchange among instances. Visual results in the paper\nand supplementary material showcase the compelling power of PartCraft in\ncrafting highly customized, innovative creations, exemplified by the \"charming\"\nand creative birds.
