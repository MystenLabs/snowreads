By quenching the system to a different thermal bath and\nobtaining different kinds of initial states, we solve the real-time evolution\nof the system numerically. Our main focus is on studying far-from equilibrium\ndynamics of strongly-coupled system and universal scaling behaviors related to\nsuch dynamics. The most striking observation is that an additional\nprethermalization stage emerges at non-critical temperature after introducing\nthe Goldstone modes, which is not reported in any previous studies. Some basic\nproperties related to this additional prethermalization stage have been\ndiscussed in detail. More interestingly, we also report a new scaling relation\ndescribing non-equilibrium evolution at non-critical temperature. This\nadditional universal behavior indicates the appearance of a non-thermal fixed\npoint in the dynamical region.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nHtS8nZwWUlkFy1mtY9qyzd_HgpNAzIwu8qUgOcuc58","pdfSize":"1710316"}
