Previous research\nhas proposed frameworks for risk mitigation, but has left gaps in our\nunderstanding of the perceived effectiveness of measures for mitigating\nsystemic risks. Our study addresses this gap by evaluating how experts perceive\ndifferent mitigations that aim to reduce the systemic risks of general-purpose\nAI models. We surveyed 76 experts whose expertise spans AI safety; critical\ninfrastructure; democratic processes; chemical, biological, radiological, and\nnuclear risks (CBRN); and discrimination and bias. Among 27 mitigations\nidentified through a literature review, we find that a broad range of risk\nmitigation measures are perceived as effective in reducing various systemic\nrisks and technically feasible by domain experts. In particular, three\nmitigation measures stand out: safety incident reports and security information\nsharing, third-party pre-deployment model audits, and pre-deployment risk\nassessments. These measures show both the highest expert agreement ratings\n(>60\\%) across all four risk areas and are most frequently selected in experts'\npreferred combinations of measures (>40\\%). The surveyed experts highlighted\nthat external scrutiny, proactive evaluation and transparency are key\nprinciples for effective mitigation of systemic risks. We provide policy\nrecommendations for implementing the most promising measures, incorporating the\nqualitative contributions from experts. These insights should inform regulatory\nframeworks and industry practices for mitigating the systemic risks associated\nwith general-purpose AI.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computers and Society","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"u_qzDdHxOUoU6nri9pWEAjnda-v0NQGliF-ATh6Uxhg","pdfSize":"1227117"}
