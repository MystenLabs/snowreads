We consider structures generated from the\n$Cmma$ reference structure by all possible combinations of the zone center and\nzone boundary modes belonging to the unstable flat phonon branches. We find 12\ndistinct locally-stable structures, of which 5 correspond to well-known phases.\nWe show that 6 of these 7 remaining structures can be described as period-2\nsuperlattices of the ferroelectric $Pca2_1$ (o-FE), ferroelectric $Pnm2_1$\n(o-FE2), and and monoclinic $P2_1/c$ (m) structures. We demonstrate how the\nunstable flat phonon bands can explain the atomically thin grain boundaries in\nthe various types of superlattices. Finally, we point out that arbitrary-period\nHfO$_2$ superlattices derived from the 6 different types of period-2\nsuperlattices are expected to form based on the flatness of the unstable phonon\nbranches. The organizing principle provided by this work deepens our\nunderstanding of the underlying physics in the phase stability of HfO$_2$ and\nprovides guidance for functional phase stabilization.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rv4sog1s8fBFphmhHikuWoLQBncF11bcdoEW7pbRWpU","pdfSize":"9321496"}
