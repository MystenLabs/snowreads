This uses a new Drinfeld type\npresentation of this affine $\\imath$quantum group which admits very nontrivial\nSerre relations. We then construct \\`a la Springer a family of\nfinite-dimensional standard modules and irreducible modules of this\n$\\imath$quantum group, and provide a composition multiplicity formula of the\nstandard modules.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"loFO-eFUNhK7GC1c7NskHVeRtStX5vwP8kBudE5ZRT8","pdfSize":"515627"}
