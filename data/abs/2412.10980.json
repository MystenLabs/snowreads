We\nformulate and prove a result concerning the anticyclotomic Iwasawa main\nconjecture for CM Hilbert modular forms. Additionally, we obtain a result\ntowards the study of the Mordell-Weil ranks of the CM abelian varieties.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_MeaTN66dZwCFEM-DEH92qy_4mp2-l2Z8DYGGs1Qt7E","pdfSize":"315416"}
