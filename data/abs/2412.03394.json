  "abstract": "  We introduce an alternative route to quasiparticle self-consistent $GW$\ncalculations ($\\mathrm{qs}GW$) on the basis of a Joint Approximate\nDiagonalization of the one-body $GW$ Green's functions $G(\\varepsilon_n^{QP})$\ntaken at the input quasiparticle energies. Such an approach allows working with\nthe full dynamical self-energy, without approximating the latter by a\nsymmetrized static form as in the standard $\\mathrm{qs}GW$ scheme. Calculations\non the $GW$100 molecular test set lead nevertheless to a good agreement, at the\n65 meV mean-absolute-error accuracy on the ionization potential, with respect\nto the conventional $\\mathrm{qs}GW$ approach. We show further that constructing\nthe density matrix from the full Green's function as in the fully\nself-consistent $\\mathrm{sc}GW$ scheme, and not from the occupied quasiparticle\none-body orbitals, allows obtaining a scheme intermediate between\n$\\mathrm{qs}GW$ and $\\mathrm{sc}GW$ approaches, closer to CCSD(T) reference\nvalues.\n",
