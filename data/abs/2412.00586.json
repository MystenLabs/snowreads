  "abstract": "  In this paper, we evaluate the capability of large language models to conduct\npersonalized phishing attacks and compare their performance with human experts\nand AI models from last year. We include four email groups with a combined\ntotal of 101 participants: A control group of arbitrary phishing emails, which\nreceived a click-through rate (recipient pressed a link in the email) of 12%,\nemails generated by human experts (54% click-through), fully AI-automated\nemails 54% (click-through), and AI emails utilizing a human-in-the-loop (56%\nclick-through). Thus, the AI-automated attacks performed on par with human\nexperts and 350% better than the control group. The results are a significant\nimprovement from similar studies conducted last year, highlighting the\nincreased deceptive capabilities of AI models. Our AI-automated emails were\nsent using a custom-built tool that automates the entire spear phishing\nprocess, including information gathering and creating personalized\nvulnerability profiles for each target. The AI-gathered information was\naccurate and useful in 88% of cases and only produced inaccurate profiles for\n4% of the participants. We also use language models to detect the intention of\nemails. Claude 3.5 Sonnet scored well above 90% with low false-positive rates\nand detected several seemingly benign emails that passed human detection.\nLastly, we analyze the economics of phishing, highlighting how AI enables\nattackers to target more individuals at lower cost and increase profitability\nby up to 50 times for larger audiences.\n",
