  "abstract": "  Managing mixed traffic comprising human-driven and robot vehicles (RVs)\nacross large-scale networks presents unique challenges beyond\nsingle-intersection control. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning\nframework for coordinating mixed traffic across multiple interconnected\nintersections. Our key contribution is a neighbor-aware reward mechanism that\nenables RVs to maintain balanced distribution across the network while\noptimizing local intersection efficiency. We evaluate our approach using a\nreal-world network, demonstrating its effectiveness in managing realistic\ntraffic patterns. Results show that our method reduces average waiting times by\n39.2% compared to the state-of-the-art single-intersection control policy and\n79.8% compared to traditional traffic signals. The framework's ability to\ncoordinate traffic across multiple intersections while maintaining balanced RV\ndistribution provides a foundation for deploying learning-based solutions in\nurban traffic systems.\n",
