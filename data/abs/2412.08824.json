  "abstract": "  Normalizing flow-based variational inference (flow VI) is a promising\napproximate inference approach, but its performance remains inconsistent across\nstudies. Numerous algorithmic choices influence flow VI's performance. We\nconduct a step-by-step analysis to disentangle the impact of some of the key\nfactors: capacity, objectives, gradient estimators, number of gradient\nestimates (batchsize), and step-sizes. Each step examines one factor while\nneutralizing others using insights from the previous steps and/or using\nextensive parallel computation. To facilitate high-fidelity evaluation, we\ncurate a benchmark of synthetic targets that represent common posterior\npathologies and allow for exact sampling. We provide specific recommendations\nfor different factors and propose a flow VI recipe that matches or surpasses\nleading turnkey Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) methods.\n",
