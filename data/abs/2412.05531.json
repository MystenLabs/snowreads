However, most of the applications deployed\ngenerate a lot of false alarms (violations) because they tend to generalize the\nrequirements of PPE across the industry and tasks. The key to resolving this\nissue is to understand the action being performed by the worker and customize\nthe inference for the specific PPE requirements of that action. In this paper,\nwe propose a system that employs activity recognition models to first\nunderstand the action being performed and then use object detection techniques\nto check for violations. This leads to a 23% improvement in the F1-score\ncompared to the PPE-based approach on our test dataset of 109 videos.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"h_5Y5iu_Nvdc2CxeC7TA5R3fhetqLPtREVqQW6xwcNM","pdfSize":"3025320"}
