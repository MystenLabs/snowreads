  "abstract": "  We extend the scope of analytic combinatorics to classes containing objects\nthat have irrational sizes. The generating function for such a class is a power\nseries that admits irrational exponents (which we call a Ribenboim series). A\ntransformation then yields a generalised Dirichlet series from which the\nasymptotics of the coefficients can be extracted by singularity analysis using\nan appropriate Tauberian theorem. In practice, the asymptotics can often be\ndetermined directly from the original generating function. We illustrate the\ntechnique with a variety of applications, including tilings with tiles of\nirrational area, ordered integer factorizations, lattice walks enumerated by\nEuclidean length, and plane trees with vertices of irrational size. We also\nexplore phase transitions in the asymptotics of families of irrational\ncombinatorial classes.\n",
