This supersolid state has three gapless\nexcitation branches arising from the spontaneously broken continuous\nsymmetries. Two of these branches are related to longitudinal sound waves,\nsimilar to those in one-dimensional supersolids. The third branch is a\ntransverse wave arising from the non-zero shear modulus of the two-dimensional\ncrystal. We present the results of numerical calculations for the excitations\nand dynamic structure factor characterising the density fluctuations, and study\ntheir behavior across the discontinuous superfluid to supersolid transition. We\nshow that the speeds of sound are described by a hydrodynamic theory that\nincorporates generalized elastic parameters, including the shear modulus.\nFurthermore, we establish that dipolar and soft-core supersolids manifest\ndistinct characteristics, falling into the bulk incompressible and rigid\nlattice limits, respectively.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3Y2elI2-z6e95ZYsQteZbveqt5A-YHtCjGsotPOmVF8","pdfSize":"2689118","objectId":"0x1b07379a44a4e1729a8836c97f7aabcd533f6bea444647a2ef3f5458f54b2722","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
