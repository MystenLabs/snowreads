  "abstract": "  We consider a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model in the assisted hopping limit, where\ndirect electron hopping is subdominant. At fixed electron-phonon coupling and\nin the absence of Coulomb interactions, the model shows a deconfined quantum\ncritical point (DQCP) between a $(\\pi,0)$ valence bond solid in the adiabatic\nlimit and a quantum antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase at high phonon frequencies.\nHere, we show that by adding terms to the model that reinforce the AFM phase,\nthereby lowering the critical phonon frequency, the quantum phase transition\nbecomes strongly first order. Our results do not depend on the symmetry of the\nmodel. In fact, adding a Hubbard-$U$ term to the model lowers the O(4) symmetry\nof the model to SU(2) such that the DQCP we observe has the same symmetries as\nother models that account for similar quantum phase transitions.\n",
