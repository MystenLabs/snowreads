Unlike multi-image finetuning approaches such\nas DreamBooth, these zero-shot methods leverage powerful facial encoders to\nextract identity information from a single portrait photo, enabling efficient\nidentity-preserving generation through a single inference pass. However, this\nconvenience introduces new threats to the facial identity protection. This\npaper aims to safeguard portrait photos from unauthorized encoder-based\ncustomization. We introduce IDProtector, an adversarial noise encoder that\napplies imperceptible adversarial noise to portrait photos in a single forward\npass. Our approach offers universal protection for portraits against multiple\nstate-of-the-art encoder-based methods, including InstantID, IP-Adapter, and\nPhotoMaker, while ensuring robustness to common image transformations such as\nJPEG compression, resizing, and affine transformations. Experiments across\ndiverse portrait datasets and generative models reveal that IDProtector\ngeneralizes effectively to unseen data and even closed-source proprietary\nmodels.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"uzy8_FR4ZelJZ8uhwldWeYwDiLRyPnnyUDgAsyTdads","pdfSize":"3467866"}
