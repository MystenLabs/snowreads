  "abstract": "  In this paper, we study the blow up and scattering result of the solution to\nthe focusing nonlinear Hartree equation with potential $$i\\partial_t u +\\Delta\nu - Vu = - (|\\cdot|^{-3} \\ast |u|^2)u, \\qquad (t, x) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\times\n\\mathbb{R}^5 $$ in the energy space ${H}^1(\\mathbb{R}^5)$ below the mass-energy\nthreshold. The potential $V$ we considered is an extension of Kato potential in\nsome sense. We extend the results of Meng [26] to nonlinear Hartree equation\nwith potential $V$ under some conditions. By establishing a Virial-Morawetz\nestimate and a scattering criteria, we obtain the scattering theory based on\nthe method from Dodson-Murphy [11].\n",
