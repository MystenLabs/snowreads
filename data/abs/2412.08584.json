For $d=3$, this result can be improved to the\ncomputational complexity $O(n\\cdot \\log\\,n)$. In this paper, for any fixed\n$d\\geq 2$, an algorithm with the computational complexity $O(n\\cdot\n\\log^{d-1}\\,n)$ is proposed to solve the considered MSTP, which improves the\nprevious achievement for $d\\geq 6$.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Discrete Mathematics","Computer Science/Computational Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JLixctwFnQ5wdtXopE2LjJeZ3dey06gerg0qY5jqN-o","pdfSize":"208897"}
