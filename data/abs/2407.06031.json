However, the gerbes so constructed\nare only canonical up to conjugation by their bands. This is enough in order to\nensure that the cohomology set B(G) is canonical, but not enough data to pin\ndown the set of algebraic cocycles used to compute the set B(G). For arithmetic\napplications it is often desirable to have the finer control provided by these\ncocycles readily at hand. To this end we propose in this paper a framework with\nwhich to work with such spaces of algebraic Kottwitz cocycles. This will play a\ncrucial role in our forthcoming work on the formalism of Shimura varieties.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"E4-fjkjuKZGeNsNh0tmZ-r3JYTkoeBZts_LChGFlino","pdfSize":"848141"}
