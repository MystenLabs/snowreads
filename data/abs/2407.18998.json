These terms center on what makes\ncyberinformation management unique: numerous acts of copying items of\ninformation, the aggregates of copies that result from those acts, and the\nfaithful members of those aggregates that represent all other members.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QWEYuLa5V19VPoz_PSIUoNPSruvqTBG7h6NRgbbyygc","pdfSize":"455781","objectId":"0x4018d69d812be9c8398ea8557896149432714ccf9d0b55d3a5e6c794b32e0390","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
