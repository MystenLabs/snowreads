We find a Mott transition developing at half filling, and\nidentify strong orbital selectivity when the system is at the physical electron\ncount. The orbital selectivity is manifested in the formation of interlayer\nspin singlets between electrons in the $z^2$ orbitals. These features lead to a\nstrong renormalization of the electronic band structure while sustaining a\nsizable splitting between the bonding and antibonding $z^2$ bands. The proposed\norbital-selective correlations naturally explain a series of features as\nobserved in the angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and optical\nconductivity measurements in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Our results provide a basis to\nunderstand both the normal state and the high temperature superconductivity of\nmultilayer nickelates and thereby elucidate correlated superconductivity in\ngeneral.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"DT-Q0H15n4KVY4GGu5_JCo6VTpodmgSbV6L4UsJTmMs","pdfSize":"3148438"}
