Diffuse scattering\nappears along a frustrated wave vector\n$\\textbf{q}_H=(\\frac{1}{3},\\frac{1}{3},\\frac{1}{2})$ at temperatures far\nexceeding the charge order transition $T_{CO}=92~\\mathrm{K}$, preempting\nlong-range charge order with wave vectors along\n$\\textbf{q}_{\\bar{K}}=(\\frac{1}{3},\\frac{1}{3},\\frac{1}{3})$. Using a\ncombination of real space and reciprocal space analysis, we resolve the nature\nof the interactions between the primary out-of-plane Sc-Sn chain instability\nand the secondary strain-mediated distortion of the in-plane V kagome network.\nA minimal model of the diffuse scattering data reveals a high-temperature,\nshort-ranged \"zig-zag\" phase of in-plane correlations that maps to a frustrated\ntriangular lattice Ising model with antiferromagnetic interactions and provides\na real-space understanding of the origin of frustrated charge order in this\nmaterial.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"3MoEa771WIhq7gVtFoKypJNC261zvsD9Ucoex6AGyyY","pdfSize":"3717064"}
