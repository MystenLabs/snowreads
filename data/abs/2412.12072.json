Dog whistles are coded expressions with dual meanings: one\nintended for the general public (outgroup) and another that conveys a specific\nmessage to an intended audience (ingroup). Often, these expressions are used to\nconvey controversial political opinions while maintaining plausible deniability\nand slip by content moderation filters. Identification of dog whistles relies\non curated lexicons, which have trouble keeping up to date. We introduce\nFETCH!, a task for finding novel dog whistles in massive social media corpora.\nWe find that state-of-the-art systems fail to achieve meaningful results across\nthree distinct social media case studies. We present EarShot, a strong baseline\nsystem that combines the strengths of vector databases and Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to efficiently and effectively identify new dog whistles.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OoD6FQ89HLMmH_-j5D6G7bJgjj8sa0EdRFEP-HyBkN4","pdfSize":"2313118"}
