  "abstract": "  The animation of realistic virtual avatars in crowd scenarios is an important\nelement of immersive virtual environments. However, achieving this realism\nrequires attention to multiple factors, such as their visual appearance and\nmotion cues. We investigated how body shape diversity influences the perception\nof motion clones in virtual crowds. A physics-based model was used to simulate\nvirtual avatars in a small-scale crowd of size twelve. Participants viewed\nside-by-side video clips of these virtual crowds: one featuring all unique\nmotions (Baseline) and the other containing motion clones (i.e., the same\nmotion used to animate two or more avatars in the crowd). We also varied the\nlevels of body shape and motion diversity. Our findings revealed that body\nshape diversity did not influence participants' ratings of motion clone\ndetection, and motion variety had a greater impact on their perception of the\ncrowd. Further research is needed to investigate how other visual factors\ninteract with motion in order to enhance the perception of virtual crowd\nrealism.\n",
