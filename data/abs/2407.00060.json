We construct\ninequalities which constrain the third function, $\\xi(s)$, on $\\Im(s)=0$ to lie\nbetween the other two functions, in a sandwich structure. We investigate what\ncan be said about the location of zeros and radius of convergence of expansions\nof $\\xi(s)$, with promising results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_YuDxShiSOeNLFRpwWWG8q08wdNypi88TMeOuqZ4CdY","pdfSize":"2579266","objectId":"0xeb31f5892570243212df2076c8e56d57236cd6dc3d3283462bc70288f7c4c436","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
