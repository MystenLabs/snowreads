  "abstract": "  The first order effect of Coulomb forces between the charged particles of a\nplasma is the well-known Debye-H\\\"uckel-term. It is a negative contribution to\nthe pressure and energy of the gas, that at high densities will overwhelm the\nideal gas contributions and make the gas implode into a black hole. Nature\nobviously constrains this term, avoiding this fate, but how? We investigate\nthree different mechanisms and their effects on the equation of state and on\nsolar models, and the physical justifications for each of them. We conclude\nthat higher order Coulomb terms in combination with quantum diffraction of\nelectrons, provide the needed convergence.\n",
