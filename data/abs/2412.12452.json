  "abstract": "  This paper is concerning the inverse conductive scattering of acoustic waves\nby a bounded inhomogeneous object with possibly embedded obstacles inside. A\nnew uniqueness theorem is proved that the conductive object is uniquely\ndetermined by the fixed frequency far-field measurements, ignoring its\ncontents. Meanwhile, the boundary informations of several related physical\ncoefficients are also uniquely determined. The proof is mainly based on a\ndetailed singularity analysis of solutions near the interface associated with a\nfamily of point sources or hypersingular point sources, which is deduced by the\npotential theory. Moreover, the other key ingredient in the proof is the\nwell-posedness of the interior transmission problem with the conductivity\nboundary condition in the L^2 sense, where several sufficient conditions\ndepending on the domain and physical coefficients are provided.\n",
