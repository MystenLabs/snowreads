Exponential subgroups are a\ngeneralization of normal (and subnormal) subgroups: all subnormal subgroups are\nexponential, but not conversely. Sabatini proved that all subgroups of a finite\ngroup $G$ are exponential if and only if $G$ is nilpotent. The purpose of this\npaper is to explore what the analogues of a simple group and a solvable group\nshould be in relation to exponential subgroups. We say that an exponential\nsubgroup $H$ of $G$ is exp-trivial if either $H = G$ or the exponent of $G$,\n${\\rm exp}(G)$, divides $|G:H|$, and we say that a group $G$ is exp-simple if\nall exponential subgroups of $G$ are exp-trivial. We classify finite exp-simple\ngroups by proving $G$ is exp-simple if and only if ${\\rm exp}(G) = {\\rm\nexp}(G/N)$ for all proper normal subgroups $N$ of $G$, and we illustrate how\nthe class of exp-simple groups differs from the class of simple groups.\nFurthermore, in an attempt to overcome the obstacle that prevents all subgroups\nof a generic solvable group from being exponential, we say that a subgroup $H$\nof $G$ is weakly exponential if, for all $x \\in G$, there exists $g \\in G$ such\nthat $x^{|G:H|} \\in H^g$. If all subgroups of $G$ are weakly exponential, then\n$G$ is wexp-solvable. We prove that all solvable groups are wexp-solvable and\nalmost all symmetric and alternating groups are not wexp-solvable. Finally, we\ncompletely classify the groups ${\\rm PSL}(2,q)$ that are wexp-solvable. We show\nthat if $\\pi(n)$ denotes the number of primes less than $n$ and $w(n)$ denotes\nthe number of primes $p$ less than $n$ such that ${\\rm PSL}(2,p)$ is\nwexp-solvable, then $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{w(n)}{\\pi(n)} = \\frac{1}{4}.$\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"czAyaGSkD4tttr_TY3LdytqJmjmtnpgNi6SOkDWGKPo","pdfSize":"253522","objectId":"0x6da9ece4eb2de8fe13e14340a3d531d701b3c95cd4dc8f954b8a4452507bf9d5","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
