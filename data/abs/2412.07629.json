Furthermore, when applying\nlinearized tables to LMs, the maximum token lengths often imposed in\nself-attention calculations make it difficult to comprehensively understand the\ncontext spread across large tables. To address these challenges, we present\nPieTa (Piece of Table), a new framework for subtable-based question answering\n(QA). PieTa operates through an iterative process of dividing tables into\nsmaller windows, using LMs to select relevant cells within each window, and\nmerging these cells into a subtable. This multi-resolution approach captures\ndependencies across multiple rows and columns while avoiding the limitations\ncaused by long context inputs. Instantiated as a simple iterative subtable\nunion algorithm, PieTa demonstrates improved performance over previous\nsubtable-based QA approaches.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"NA9BKWJuZSQ8Ms0XpUaGFxt-H3I5t2VwOBHwyvUH_NE","pdfSize":"1284848"}
