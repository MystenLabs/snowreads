  "abstract": "  We studied some geometric properties of the Moyal sphere. Using the conformal\nmetric of the sphere in ordinary space and the matrix basis, we calculated the\nscalar curvature, total curvature integral and area of the Moyal sphere. We\nfound that when the noncommutative parameter approaches to 0, the scalar\ncurvature and area of the Moyal sphere return to those of the ordinary sphere.\nAs the noncommutative parameter increases, the area of the Moyal sphere will\ndecrease and eventually approach to 0. We found that the total curvature\nintegral of the two-dimensional Moyal sphere still satisfies the usual\nGauss-Bonnet formula and does not depend on the noncommutative parameter. We\nalso calculated the approximate expression of the conformal metric with a\nconstant curvature and obtained the corresponding correction function. In\naddition, we also studied a type of generalized deformed Moyal sphere with two\nnoncommutative parameters and obtained similar results.\n",
