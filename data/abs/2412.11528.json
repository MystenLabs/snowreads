We focus on compositions with parts restricted to 1 and 2\nand consider the array of counts for such compositions of $n$ with $k$ water\ncells, establishing generating functions for the columns and diagonal sums,\nrecurrences within the array in the spirit of Pascal's lemma, and connections\nto other restricted compositions. Most of our proofs are combinatorial, but we\nalso make connections to Riordan arrays.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"F4rQe6rO8RWC3CtuOa-zfQif1Z96fa0DKHM-9fbyjRg","pdfSize":"143343"}
