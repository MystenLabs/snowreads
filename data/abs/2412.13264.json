Zh\\'ul\\'ong displays an extraordinary combination of\nproperties: 1) a classical bulge centered in a large, face-on exponential\nstellar disk (half-light radius of $R_{\\rm e} = 3.7 \\pm 0.1 \\, \\mathrm{kpc}$),\nwith spiral arms extending across 19 kpc; 2) a clear transition from the red,\nquiescent core ($F150W-F444W=3.1$ mag) with high stellar mass surface density\n($\\log(\\Sigma M_{\\star}/M_{\\odot} \\, \\mathrm{kpc}^{-2}) =\n9.91_{-0.09}^{+0.11}$) to the star-forming outer regions, as revealed by\nspatially resolved SED analysis, which indicates significant inside-out galaxy\ngrowth; 3) an extremely high stellar mass at its redshift, with $\\log\n(M_{\\star}/M_{\\odot})=11.03_{-0.08}^{+0.10}$ comparable to the Milky Way, and\nan implied baryon-to-star conversion efficiency ($\\epsilon \\sim 0.3$) that is\n1.5 times higher than even the most efficient galaxies at later epochs; 4)\ndespite an active disk, a relatively modest overall star formation rate\n($\\mathrm{SFR} =66_{-46}^{+89} ~M_{\\odot} \\, \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$), which is\n$>$0.5 dex below the star formation main sequence at $z \\sim 5.2$ and $>$10\ntimes lower than ultra-massive dusty galaxies at $z=5-6$. Altogether,\nZh\\'ul\\'ong shows that mature galaxies emerged much earlier than expected in\nthe first billion years after the Big Bang through rapid galaxy formation and\nmorphological evolution. Our finding offers key constraints for models of\nmassive galaxy formation and the origin of spiral structures in the early\nuniverse.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cvqcv62QCGLEsGWsPRPGZJ2s-9KJvAi2zyyetupVPro","pdfSize":"7870384"}
