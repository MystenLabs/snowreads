The toolkit provides\nstate-of-the-art performance in five core NLP tasks, namely part-of-speech\ntagging, morphological tagging, dependency parsing, named entity recognition,\nand Greeklishto-Greek transliteration. The toolkit is based on pre-trained\nTransformers, it is freely available, and can be easily installed in Python\n(pip install gr-nlp-toolkit). It is also accessible through a demonstration\nplatform on HuggingFace, along with a publicly available API for non-commercial\nuse. We discuss the functionality provided for each task, the underlying\nmethods, experiments against comparable open-source toolkits, and future\npossible enhancements.
