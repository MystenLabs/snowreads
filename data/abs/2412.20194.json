  "abstract": "  The finite time operation of a quantum Otto heat engine leads to a trade-off\nbetween efficiency and output power, which is due to the deviation of the\nsystem from the adiabatic path. This trade-off caveat can be bypassed by using\nthe shortcut-to-adiabaticity protocol. We experimentally implemented a quantum\nOtto heat engine using spin-1/2 nuclei on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)\nquantum processor. We investigated its performance using the\nshortcut-to-adiabaticity technique via counter-adiabatic driving with the\ninclusion of the cost to perform the shortcut. We use two different metrics\nthat incorporate the cost of shortcut-to-adiabaticity to define engine\nefficiency and experimentally analyze which one is more appropriate for the NMR\nplatform. We found a significant improvement in the performance of the quantum\nOtto heat engine driven by shortcut-to-adiabaticity, as compared to the\nnon-adiabatic heat engine.\n",
