If axions couple to\nneutron spins, a background oscillating axion dark matter field would drive\ntransitions between spin-up and spin-down neutron states in a magnetic field\nwhen the axion particle energy matches the energy gap between the spin states.\nThe transition can be detected in a double-Stern-Gerlach-type apparatus, with\nthe first splitter producing a pure spin-polarized neutron beam and the second\nsplitter selecting spin-flipped signals. Our approach offers enhanced detection\ncapability for axions within the $10^{-12} - 10^{-10} \\,$eV mass window with\nthe capability to surpass the sensitivity of current laboratory experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3ZOD3qP43xb0X4yldBtnSMhJ4cSqhF2qI9F9IXIajIc","pdfSize":"624863"}
