In these results the EFL method was used\nonly in the dynamical evolution of initial data constructed with the Lorene\nlibrary. Here, we extend the use of the EFL method to the construction of\neccentricity reduced initial data for neutron star binaries and present several\nnew BNS simulations resulting from such initial data and show for the first\ntime up to optimal fifth-order convergence in the gravitational waveform phase.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"by6EVjSnckGqyUxuf8sbWXaz0YVaB1HW6M8kIYONL54","pdfSize":"1197602"}
