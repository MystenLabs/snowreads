We will prove a\ncorresponding statement for digraphs, that is, we will prove that every digraph\nthat has an end with infinitely many pairwise disjoint directed rays contains a\nsubdivision of a grid-like digraph all of whose directed rays belong to that\nend.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3gYs8B4kN9w2_J4oPyfqbNqhpdA9A9SCdtBKY0Motvw","pdfSize":"541393"}
