  "abstract": "  Harnessing the potential computational advantage of quantum computers for\nmachine learning tasks relies on the uploading of classical data onto quantum\ncomputers through what are commonly referred to as quantum encodings. The\nchoice of such encodings may vary substantially from one task to another, and\nthere exist only a few cases where structure has provided insight into their\ndesign and implementation, such as symmetry in geometric quantum learning.\nHere, we propose the perspective that category theory offers a natural\nmathematical framework for analyzing encodings that respect structure inherent\nin datasets and learning tasks. We illustrate this with pedagogical examples,\nwhich include geometric quantum machine learning, quantum metric learning,\ntopological data analysis, and more. Moreover, our perspective provides a\nlanguage in which to ask meaningful and mathematically precise questions for\nthe design of quantum encodings and circuits for quantum machine learning\ntasks.\n",
