In this study,\nwe tackle this challenge by leveraging the single-cell BERT-based pre-trained\ntransformer model (scBERT), trained on extensive unlabeled scRNA-seq data, to\naugment structured biological knowledge from existing GRNs. We introduce a\nnovel joint graph learning approach that combines the rich contextual\nrepresentations learned by pre-trained single-cell language models with the\nstructured knowledge encoded in GRNs using graph neural networks (GNNs). By\nintegrating these two modalities, our approach effectively reasons over boththe\ngene expression level constraints provided by the scRNA-seq data and the\nstructured biological knowledge inherent in GRNs. We evaluate our method on\nhuman cell benchmark datasets from the BEELINE study with cell type-specific\nground truth networks. The results demonstrate superior performance over\ncurrent state-of-the-art baselines, offering a deeper understanding of cellular\nregulatory mechanisms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"te23W5Us29LzbpcF_GYkr7A-deb1zybLIRcc6iTpzJc","pdfSize":"1673058"}
