State-of-the-art\n(SOTA) defenses employ too-sophisticated mechanisms that require either a\ncomputationally expensive adversarial search module for reverse-engineering the\ntrigger distribution or an over-sensitive hyper-parameter selection module.\nMoreover, they offer sub-par performance in challenging scenarios, e.g.,\nlimited validation data and strong attacks. In this paper, we propose Neural\nmask Fine-Tuning (NFT) with an aim to optimally re-organize the neuron\nactivities in a way that the effect of the backdoor is removed. Utilizing a\nsimple data augmentation like MixUp, NFT relaxes the trigger synthesis process\nand eliminates the requirement of the adversarial search module. Our study\nfurther reveals that direct weight fine-tuning under limited validation data\nresults in poor post-purification clean test accuracy, primarily due to\noverfitting issue. To overcome this, we propose to fine-tune neural masks\ninstead of model weights. In addition, a mask regularizer has been devised to\nfurther mitigate the model drift during the purification process. The distinct\ncharacteristics of NFT render it highly efficient in both runtime and sample\nusage, as it can remove the backdoor even when a single sample is available\nfrom each class. We validate the effectiveness of NFT through extensive\nexperiments covering the tasks of image classification, object detection, video\naction recognition, 3D point cloud, and natural language processing. We\nevaluate our method against 14 different attacks (LIRA, WaNet, etc.) on 11\nbenchmark data sets such as ImageNet, UCF101, Pascal VOC, ModelNet,\nOpenSubtitles2012, etc.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uQBpvtivKp7brkYzdTGr-K-AlddIPdgzFv5inCnP3pU","pdfSize":"1888051"}
