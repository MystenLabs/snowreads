This allows one to compute the free energy without\nsolving any supergravity equations, just assuming the solutions exist. As well\nas recovering some known results in the literature with ease, we also present\nnew supergravity results that match with holographically dual field theory\ncomputations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oxcMW-3NLphdUzIkSlqnGJb0mVfuz_7EjzdgFD8FrT4","pdfSize":"406047","objectId":"0x66f75d18ff575374a666827ba6fcc30717e7d1a69a38232a9bdb483b0d8e373a","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
