However, data streams often do not\nconform to the same distribution over time, leading to a phenomenon called\nconcept drift. Since a fixed static model is unreliable for inferring\nconcept-drifted data streams, establishing an adaptive mechanism for detecting\nconcept drift is crucial. Current methods for concept drift detection primarily\nassume that the labels or error rates of downstream models are given and/or\nunderlying statistical properties exist in data streams. These approaches,\nhowever, struggle to address high-dimensional data streams with intricate\nirregular distribution shifts, which are more prevalent in real-world\nscenarios. In this paper, we propose MCD-DD, a novel concept drift detection\nmethod based on maximum concept discrepancy, inspired by the maximum mean\ndiscrepancy. Our method can adaptively identify varying forms of concept drift\nby contrastive learning of concept embeddings without relying on labels or\nstatistical properties. With thorough experiments under synthetic and\nreal-world scenarios, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms\nexisting baselines in identifying concept drifts and enables qualitative\nanalysis with high explainability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KnlEgBdUQHhkn0RrIKfOUy1csn8WHKHpOp8D-2apvA4","pdfSize":"1852936"}
