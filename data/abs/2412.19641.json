  "abstract": "  A realization of gravitational amplitudes based in the large $N$ limit of a\ncertain 2d $SU(N)$ Kac-Moody theory has been recently proposed. We relate this\nproposal to Color Kinematics (CK) duality and present an extension to EFT\namplitudes for matter particles with any mass and spin. In particular, we\nrecast these EFT amplitudes as celestial correlation functions and show they\nposses a chiral $w_{1+\\infty}$ symmetry algebra if they are minimally coupled\nin the bulk. Massive states lead to an off-shell 1-parameter deformation of the\nalgebra. Finally, we argue that in the limit $S\\to\\infty$ these states\ncorrespond to the Kerr black hole and we rediscover a classical $w_{1+\\infty}$\naction of Penrose.\n",
