The branches\nare separated by momentum gaps indicating intense amplification of modes, and\ndisplay high and low group velocity ranging from zero to infinity at short\nwavelengths. We simulate how these SPP modes are formed by launching a properly\nengineered laser beam onto the metallic interface and examine their space-time\nevolution. The amplification of the surface plasmons at the interface with a\nphotonic time-crystal offers a path to overcome plasmonic losses, which have\nbeen a major challenge in plasmonics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_gw0qQ9_vvfbsmB8A9fLAF1Fk7irVohcmvxMnF4AjIc","pdfSize":"784462"}
