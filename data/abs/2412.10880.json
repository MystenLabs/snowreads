His monograph \\emph{De circuli magnitudine inventa} is epoch-making\nfor circular measurement and is, indisputably, one of the most beautiful and\nimportant elementary geometric treatises ever written. Yet, the literature does\nnot offer the modern mathematician any detailed description of its rich\ncontent. Our paper fills this gap.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/History and Overview"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RgDvRT6VLsyXQywVyxpQGVzqMlbq9TYC_-Bk1J2tDx0","pdfSize":"239879"}
