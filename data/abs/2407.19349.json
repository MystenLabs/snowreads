Therefore, we established a TCR generative specificity\ndetection framework consisting of an antigen selector and a TCR classifier\nbased on the Random Forest algorithm, aiming to efficiently screen out TCRs and\ntarget antigens and achieve TCR specificity prediction. Furthermore, we used\nthe k-fold validation method to compare the performance of our model with\nordinary deep learning methods. The result proves that adding a classifier to\nthe model based on the random forest algorithm is very effective, and our model\ngenerally outperforms ordinary deep learning methods. Moreover, we put forward\nfeasible optimization suggestions for the shortcomings and challenges of our\nmodel found during model implementation.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AVLXzm_-GfPKiD7uV8oQHSJB539FyyxA68BfNrjTsOc","pdfSize":"2048576"}
