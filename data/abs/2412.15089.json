  "abstract": "  Kreck and Schafer produced the first examples of stably diffeomorphic closed\nsmooth 4-manifolds which are not homotopy equivalent. They were constructed by\napplying the doubling construction to 2-complexes over certain finite abelian\ngroups of odd order. By extending their methods, we formulate a new homotopy\ninvariant on the class of 4-manifolds arising as doubles of 2-complexes with\nfinite fundamental group. As an application we show that, for any $k \\ge 2$,\nthere exist a family of $k$ closed smooth 4-manifolds which are all stably\ndiffeomorphic but are pairwise not homotopy equivalent.\n",
