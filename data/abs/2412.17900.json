  "abstract": "  We revisit duality-covariant higher-derivative corrections which arise from\nthe generalized Bergshoeff-de Roo (gBdR) identification, a prescription that\ngives rise to a two parameter family of $\\alpha'$-corrections to the low-energy\neffective action of the bosonic and the heterotic string. Although it is able\nto reproduce all corrections at the leading and sub-leading ($\\alpha'^2$) order\npurely from symmetry considerations, a geometric interpretation, like for the\ntwo-derivative action and its gauge transformation is lacking. To address this\nissue and to pave the way for the future exploration of higher-derivative\n(=higher-loop for the $\\beta$-functions of the underlying $\\sigma$-model)\ncorrections to generalized dualities, consistent truncations and integrable\n$\\sigma$-models, we recover the gBdR identification's results from the \\PS{}\nconstruction that provides a natural notion of torsion and curvature in\ngeneralized geometry.\n",
