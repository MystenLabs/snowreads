Roughly two years after the initial\nASAS-SN discovery, a second flare was detected coincident with ASASSN-22ci.\nUV/optical photometry and optical spectroscopy indicate that both flares are\nlikely powered by TDEs. The striking similarity in flare properties suggests\nthat these flares result from subsequent disruptions of the same star. Each\nflare rises on a timescale of $\\sim$30 days, has a temperature of\n$\\approx$30,000 K, a peak bolometric luminosity of $L_{UV/Opt} = 10^{43.6 -\n43.9} \\textrm{ erg} \\textrm{ s}^{-1}$, and exhibits a blue optical spectrum\nwith broad H, He, and N lines. No X-ray emission is detected during either\nflare, but X-ray emission with an unabsorbed luminosity of $L_{X} =\n3\\times10^{41} \\textrm{ erg} \\textrm{ s}^{-1}$ and $kT = 0.042$ eV is observed\nbetween the flares. Pre-discovery survey observations rule out the existence of\nearlier flares within the past $\\approx$6000 days, indicating that the\ndiscovery of ASASSN-22ci likely coincides with the first flare. If the observed\nflare separation of $720 \\pm 4.7$ days is the orbital period, the next flare of\nASASSN-22ci should occur near MJD 61075 (2026 February 04). Finally, we find\nthat the existing sample of repeating TDE candidates is consistent with Hills\ncapture of a star initially in a binary with a total mass between $\\sim$$1 - 4$\nM$_{\\odot}$ and a separation of $\\sim$$0.01 - 0.1$ AU.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"d6DgZmFXmWlleZVcyV-SpWWt9cWkI2Y9v0l1qXMab7Y","pdfSize":"7820367"}
