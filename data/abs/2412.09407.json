This paper proposes a graph-based\nlanguage for capturing significantly more complicated structures of\nhigher-order beliefs that agents might have about the rationality of the other\nagents. The two main contributions are a solution concept that captures the\nreasoning process based on a given belief structure and an efficient algorithm\nfor compressing any belief structure into a unique minimal form.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YKcZSqXnkXf-kvCewhnBTPW98KgFJlAvxUnf-EZaOF8","pdfSize":"542666"}
