  "abstract": "  The aim of this project is to implement and design arobust synthetic speech\nclassifier for the IEEE Signal ProcessingCup 2022 challenge. Here, we learn a\nsynthetic speech attributionmodel using the speech generated from various\ntext-to-speech(TTS) algorithms as well as unknown TTS algorithms. Weexperiment\nwith both the classical machine learning methodssuch as support vector machine,\nGaussian mixture model, anddeep learning based methods such as ResNet, VGG16,\nand twoshallow end-to-end networks. We observe that deep learningbased methods\nwith raw data demonstrate the best performance.\n",
