  "abstract": "  In the ferrimagnetic semiconductor Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$, a colossal\nmagnetoresistance (CMR) is observed only when a magnetic field is applied along\nthe magnetic hard axis ($\\mathbf{H}\\parallel c$). This phenomenon suggests an\nunconventional CMR mechanism potentially driven by the interplay between\nmagnetism, topological band structure, and/or chiral orbital currents (COC). By\ncomparing electrical resistance measurements using continuous direct currents\nand pulse currents, we found that the current-induced insulator-metal\ntransition, supporting the COC-driven CMR mechanism, is likely a consequence of\nJoule heating effects. Additionally, multiple magnetic field-induced\nmetamagnetic transitions were identified through AC magnetostriction\ncoefficient experiments, but only when $\\mathbf{H}\\parallel c$. Importantly,\nthe transition at $\\sim$ 5 T marks the boundary between the low-field CMR and\nhigh-field weak MR. These findings suggest that field-induced metamagnetic\ntransition combined with partial polarization of magnetic moments are the\nprimary causes of the band gap closure, leading to the observed CMR in\nMn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$.\n",
