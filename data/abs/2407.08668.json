In\nthis work, we provide a unified approach for analyzing spatial extremes with\nlittle available data by estimating the distribution of model parameters or the\nspatial dependence directly. By employing recent developments in generative\nneural networks we predict a full sample-based distribution, allowing for\ndirect assessment of uncertainty regarding model parameters or other parameter\ndependent functionals. We validate our method by fitting several simulated\nmax-stable processes, showing a high accuracy of the approach, regarding\nparameter estimation, as well as uncertainty quantification. Additional\nrobustness checks highlight the generalization and extrapolation capabilities\nof the model, while an application to precipitation extremes across Western\nGermany demonstrates the usability of our approach in real-world scenarios.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"T9SsY9g-SHINGdorya65ueU2WD-SHVXvRcS-XAJNzCI","pdfSize":"5566636"}
