  "abstract": "  As decentralized applications on permissionless blockchains are prevalent,\nmore and more latency-sensitive usage scenarios emerged, where the lower the\nlatency of sending and receiving messages, the better the chance of earning\nrevenue. To reduce latency, we present Pioplat, a feasible, customizable, and\nlow-cost latency reduction framework consisting of multiple relay nodes on\ndifferent continents and at least one instrumented variant of a full node. The\nnode selection strategy of Pioplat and the low-latency communication protocol\noffer an elastic way to reduce latency effectively. We demonstrate Pioplat's\nfeasibility with an implementation running on five continents and show that\nPioplat can significantly reduce the latency of receiving blocks/transactions\nand sending transactions, thus fulfilling the requirements of most\nlatency-sensitive use cases. Furthermore, we provide the complete\nimplementation of Pioplat to promote further research and allow people to apply\nthe framework to more blockchain systems.\n",
