This\ncoupling binds the charges of one symmetry to the disorder operators of the\nother, and when these composite objects condense, they give rise to emergent\ngeneralized symmetries with mixed 't Hooft anomalies. These anomalies result in\nphases with ordinary symmetry breaking, topological order, and\nsymmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, where the different types of order\nare not independent but intimately related. We further explore the gapped\nboundary states of these exotic phases and develop theories for phase\ntransitions between them. Additionally, we extend our lattice model to\nincorporate a non-invertible global symmetry, which can be spontaneously\nbroken, leading to domain walls with non-trivial fusion rules.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"15PVZTui60LpqbjExL6Blbne5HsDhH2qA0SyJlOM0uY","pdfSize":"8711298"}
