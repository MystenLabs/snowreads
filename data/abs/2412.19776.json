For this we use an interior point method with a\npreconditioned conjugate gradient method solving the linear systems. The\npreconditioner utilizes the low-rank structure of the solution of the\nrelaxations. In order to fully exploit this, we need to re-write the moment\nrelaxations. To treat the arising linear equality constraints we use an\n$\\ell_1$-penalty approach within the interior-point solver. The efficiency of\nthis approach is demonstrated by numerical experiments with the MAXCUT and\nother randomly generated problems and a comparison with a state-of-the-art\nsemidefinite solver and the ADMM method. We further propose a hybrid\nADMM-interior-point method that proves to be efficient for certain problem\nclasses. As a by-product, we observe that the second-order relaxation is often\nhigh enough to deliver a globally optimal solution of the original problem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BjuMMLOkwSQn0h3QzMCYiTfPfwJ5cGe2OBRN-Bvcl8U","pdfSize":"927928"}
