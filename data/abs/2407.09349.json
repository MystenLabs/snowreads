We analyze the influence of these fundamental errors in\nsimulations of proposed experiments with metastable levels of $^{40}$Ca$^+$\nions. We find that ``effective magnetic fields\" generated by leaked qubits have\nsignificant impacts on spin-spin correlation functions for\nGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state preparation or for quantum simulations with\nstrong coupling, while spin squeezing uses a much weaker coupling and is\nlargely insensitive to the simulated leakage errors, even with a few hundred\nions. Our theory and results are expected to be useful in modeling a variety of\nmetastable qubit experiments in the future.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"f5KjChYPIO9DxAL3PsnRavleXkkqGke3wcecJAUSJUk","pdfSize":"1004312"}
