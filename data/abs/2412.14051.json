A\nlow-speed reference ADC is used to train a shallow neural network (NN) to\nestimate errors in a high-speed ADC by comparing the outputs of the ADCs when\ntheir sampling instants align and subtracting these errors in the back-end. The\nproposed NN-calibration improves SFDR of a 28nm, 12-bit, 84MHz ADC by >38dB\nwhile consuming 25.8fJ/conversion-step.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"ZpDOeC81UJ0TsDHrdn9DY5ffgPZIvEDRcDzTQIy_7ek","pdfSize":"1299209"}
