  "abstract": "  The remarkable sensitivity of non-Hermitian systems has been extensively\nstudied and stimulated ideas about developing new types of sensors. In this\npaper, we examine a chain of parametrically driven coupled resonators governed\nby the squeezed Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We emphasize the qualitative\ndifference in sensor performance between configurations depending on bulk\ntopology and boundary modes, specifically for detecting both on-site and\nnon-Hermitian skin effect perturbations. Our analysis goes beyond the scenario\nof infinitesimal perturbations, extending to arbitrary perturbation strengths\nbeyond the linear response regime. We stress the importance of optimizing the\nsystem's parameters to achieve quantum enhancement while avoiding fine-tuned\nregimes that could limit the practical applicability of this system for\nreal-world quantum sensing.\n",
