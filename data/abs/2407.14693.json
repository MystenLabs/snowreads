Within this framework, one announces the appearance of symmetric\nand asymmetric domain walls. Furthermore, it examines the emergent\nfour-dimensional gravity from a theory with non-canonical dynamics. Exploring\nthe physical and mathematical aspects, e.g., brane's energy density and the\nKaluza-Klein (KK) spectrum, one verifies that brane splitting is absent in the\ncanonical and non-canonical theories. Additionally, we note the localization of\nthe four-dimensional fluctuation projection on the 3-branes, which ensures the\ntheory's stability. Thereby, one can conclude that the behavior of\ngravitational perturbations of the domain wall maintains a profile similar to a\nstable and non-localizable tower of massive modes. In contrast, within the\nbrane core, the matter sector generates new barriers and potential wells,\nresulting in massive modes with approximately symmetric amplitudes. However,\nthe non-canonical dynamics generate massive modes with asymmetric amplitudes\nfar from the 3-brane.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"n3wcpD8ROmn442fVzZvXSfA2D-s6Iafywb6oU2szkWg","pdfSize":"1097237","objectId":"0x556db991e78ce0d3717122a1d61ff8e2ea9720247fdcefef2910ea3753da5e6b","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
