This specifies how effective field theories break down for\nlarge field values. However, phenomenological field theories have no moduli,\nbut a scalar potential that deforms dynamical trajectories away from geodesic\ncurves. In this note we speculate on how one should generalise the distance\nconjecture, in asymptotic field regimes, to include a scalar potential. We test\nthe generalised distance conjecture in a few cases, demonstrate a link with\npseudo-/fake supersymmetry and apply it to the ekpyrotic scenario in cosmology.\nFor the latter we observe that the pre-uplift KKLT potential could provide a\nstringy embedding of ekpyrosis away from the asymptotic regimes in field space.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"T8pnaqxXnARRtXZOrnJWk9nt6AUQvoXYi-8QKr7gdrM","pdfSize":"298474"}
