As this radiation\npropagates through space, they encounter sources of lensing such as a\ngravitational field of massive objects or inhomogeneous changes in the electron\ndensity of cold plasma. We have developed a simulation tool to generate these\nlensing morphologies through coherent propagation transfer functions generated\nby phase coherent geometric optics on a spatial grid. In the limit an FRB can\nbe treated as a point source, the ray paths from the FRB to the observer are\nphase coherent. Each image will have a time delay and magnification that will\nalter the emitted frequency-temporal morphology of the FRB to that which is\nobserved. The interference of these images could also decohere the observed\nphase properties of the images, affecting any phase related searches such as\nsearching for the auto-correlation of the observed FRB voltage with other\nimages in time. We present analytic test cases to demonstrate that the\nsimulation can model qualitative properties. We provide example multi-plane\nlensing systems to show the capabilities of the simulation in modeling the\nlensed morphology of an FRB and observed phase coherence.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rUfciR_FjLtJL5YUKrJ2A6i0kgEx3M16NU4Qr8CYmzw","pdfSize":"3382591"}
