The objective of the system is to plan\nreplacements of the UAV's battery on the static battery management stations.\nThe plan ensures that UAVs have sufficient energy to fulfill their long-term\nmission, which would otherwise be impossible.\n  The paper provides a detailed description of the mission planner and all of\nits components. The functionality of the planner is successfully demonstrated\nin simulated multi-UAV multi-station scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"wDgVyp2qVzS43bybApGKNJxVVz1E8rwq5w8hFsnh2hY","pdfSize":"783995"}
