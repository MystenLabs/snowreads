  "abstract": "  Motivated by classical results of approximation theory, we define an\nHermite-type interpolation in terms of $n$-dimensional subspaces of the space\nof $n$ times continuously differentiable functions. In the main result of this\npaper, we establish an error term in integral form for this interpolation in\nthe case when the $n$-dimensional subspace is the kernel of an $n$th order\nlinear differential operator with constant coefficients. Several corollaries\nare deduced illustrating the applicability of this result.\n",
