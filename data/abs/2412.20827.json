  "abstract": "  The problem of a generalized type of $H_\\infty$-control is investigated for a\nclass of admissible descriptor systems with a non-zero initial vector. A\ngeneralized performance measure is used, which characterizes the weighted\ndamping level of external and initial disturbances. A non-degenerate\ntransformation of the system is proposed, which allows to apply known methods\nfor evaluation and the achievement of desired performance measures for\nconventional lower-order systems. A numerical example of a controlled hydraulic\nsystem with three tanks is given.\n",
