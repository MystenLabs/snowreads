These particles are constructed by\nextruding arms onto the faces of Platonic solids, a configuration we term\n\\emph{Platonic polypods}. We explore the emergence and disappearance of\nsolid-like behavior in the absence of adhesive forces between the particles,\nreferred to as \\emph{geometric cohesion}. This investigation is conducted by\nvarying the number of arms of the particles and the thickness of these arms. To\naccomplish this, columns are assembled by depositing particles within a\ncylindrical container, followed by the removal of the container to evaluate the\nstability of the resulting structures. Experiments were carried out using three\ndistinct materials to assess the influence of the friction coefficient between\nthe grains. Our findings reveal that certain granular systems exhibit geometric\ncohesion, depending on their geometrical and contact properties. Furthermore,\nwe analyze the initial solid fraction of the columns, demonstrating that these\narrangements can achieve stability even at highly loose states, which contrasts\nwith traditional granular materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HwyJs6uSyUXj5ZQSaNLMK7SsQkHVN7TX-TouV_UlJEs","pdfSize":"4888301"}
