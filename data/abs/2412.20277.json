  "abstract": "  In this paper, we present a novel cascade control structure with formal\nguarantees of uniform almost global asymptotic stability for the state tracking\nerror dynamics of a quadcopter. The proposed approach features a model\npredictive control strategy for the outer loop, explicitly accounting for the\nnon-zero total thrust constraint. The outer-loop controller generates an\nacceleration reference, which is then converted into attitude, angular velocity\nand acceleration references, subsequently tracked by a nonlinear inner-loop\ncontroller. The proposed cascade control strategy is validated through\nnumerical case studies, underlying high-fidelity models, demonstrating its\nability to track fast trajectories with small error.\n",
