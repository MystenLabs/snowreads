This fact also\nlimits the reproducibility and further exploration of existing research in this\nfield.\n  To address this gap, GIRAFE is a data repository designed to facilitate the\ndevelopment of advanced techniques for the semantic segmentation, analysis, and\nfast evaluation of High-Speed videoendoscopic sequences of the vocal folds. The\nrepository includes 65 high-speed videoendoscopic recordings from a cohort of\n50 patients (30 female, 20 male). The dataset comprises 15 recordings from\nhealthy controls, 26 from patients with diagnosed voice disorders, and 24 with\nan unknown health condition. All of them were manually annotated by an expert,\nincluding the masks corresponding to the semantic segmentation of the glottal\ngap. The repository is also complemented with the automatic segmentation of the\nglottal area using different state-of-the-art approaches.\n  This data set has already supported several studies, which demonstrates its\nusefulness for the development of new glottal gap segmentation algorithms from\nHigh-Speed-Videoendoscopic sequences to improve or create new Facilitative\nPlaybacks. Despite these advances and others in the field, the broader\nchallenge of performing an accurate and completely automatic semantic\nsegmentation method of the glottal area remains open.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"1aCmB3kxyo5qqXMSOrBuIwgllSJ5bc4pyp1G8PAC12Y","pdfSize":"9106650"}
