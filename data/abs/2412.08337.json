We then explore\nthe thermodynamic phase transitions of the black hole within an extended phase\nspace, examining both canonical and grand canonical ensembles. Our findings\nreveal that altering the sign of the perturbation coefficient $\\lambda$ leads\nto a significant shift in the thermodynamic behavior of the black hole,\ntransitioning between Van der Waals-like fluid phase transitions and\nHawking-Page-like transitions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"2ze3kgD1F6JlMWk-FbGdjrO16R3zo4Q7wVA1RqmNVEc","pdfSize":"6106627"}
