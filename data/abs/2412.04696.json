A small REBCO accelerator magnet was\npreviously fabricated and tested in liquid nitrogen, demonstrating over 90%\ncritical current retention in the coils. This paper describes the magnet\nre-assembly with a different support structure and its test in liquid helium at\n1.8-4.5 K. The magnet quench history along with the instrumentation data is\npresented and discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"htFo_-fxSZ90v6PtFZeg4QRHm6KQk2r3BAkKRVyQFaM","pdfSize":"5569020"}
