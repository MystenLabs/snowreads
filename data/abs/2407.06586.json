It is a simple exercise\nto show that extending the prior lower bound of the dark energy parameters\ntilts the preference in favor of $\\Lambda$CDM. Adopting the PantheonPlus\nsupernovae catalog, for instance, a shift of the lower bound for $w_0,w_a$ from\n$-3$ to beyond $-4.6$ and $-5$, respectively, is sufficient to favor\n$\\Lambda$CDM. This calls for caution when interpreting DESI results in the\nBayesian context.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"R38UU853hT0EX--vFK5Sc4GpyVvvwcL51LrFlfuovO4","pdfSize":"390331"}
