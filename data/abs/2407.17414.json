In this setting, we derive and experimentally verify two distinct\nfluctuation theorems that involve the information associated with the\nfeedback-controlled stochastic trajectories. Our experimental setup consists of\na cantilever submitted to an electrostatic feedback force, and our protocol\nimproves the thermodynamic performances of the engine by a factor of 5,\ncompared with previously proposed protocols.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZY0uepPoMr01hwYrWZevkNx7qxsDRdMUZgQgsLjUPBw","pdfSize":"789416","objectId":"0x45e94f8ffa206f4da31544bbe69ea32acc0e0a0e3cd1b9a44bdb6ce9f5a6f94d","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
