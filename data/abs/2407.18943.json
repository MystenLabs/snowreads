In this\narticle, we present a new feature introduced in the recent version of the\npackage, called \"SIA modules\", which allows researchers and practitioners to\noffer new analytical methods for broader use via add-on extensions. We describe\nhow to build the add-on modules with the support of the new SIAtools package\nand demonstrate the concepts using sample modules from the newly introduced\nSIAmodules package. SIA modules are designed to integrate with and build upon\nthe SIA interactive application, enabling them to leverage the existing\ninfrastructure for tasks such as data uploading and processing. They can access\na range of outputs from various analyses, including item response theory\nmodels, exploratory factor analysis, or differential item functioning models.\nBecause SIA modules come in R packages (or extend the existing ones), they may\ncome bundled with their datasets, use object-oriented systems, or even compiled\ncode. We discuss the possibility of broader use of the concept of SIA modules\nin other areas.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QynMHxJTE425fFlB86LDpqzJhHrVp_GGwSpEuktOnPc","pdfSize":"2905131"}
