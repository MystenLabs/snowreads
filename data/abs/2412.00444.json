Nonextensivity is introduced within the PCQMF\nmodel through a dimensionless $q$ parameter to examine the viscous properties\nsuch as shear viscosity ($\\eta$), bulk viscosity ($\\zeta_b$), and conductive\nproperties, including electrical conductivity ($\\sigma_{el}$) and thermal\nconductivity ($\\kappa$). Additionally, some key thermodynamic quantities\nrelevant to the transport coefficients, like the speed of sound ($c_{sq}^2$)\nand specific heat at constant volume ($c_{vq}$), are calculated. The\ntemperature dependence of the transport coefficients is explored through a\nkinetic theory approach with the relaxation time approximation. The results are\ncompared to the extensive case where $q$ approaches 1. The nonextensive $q$\nparameter is found to have a significant effect on all transport coefficients.\nWe find that the nonextensive behaviour of the medium enhances both specific\nshear viscosity $\\eta/s_q$ as well as conductive coefficients $\\sigma_{el}/T$\nand $\\kappa/T^2$. In contrast, the normalised bulk viscosity $\\zeta_b/s_q$ is\nfound to decrease as the nonextensivity of the medium increases. We have also\nstudied the transport coefficients for finite values of chemical potentials.\nThe magnitude of $\\eta$, $\\sigma_{el}$, and $\\kappa$ increases at lower\ntemperatures while $\\zeta$ is found to decrease for systems with non-zero\nchemical potential.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KOhr5hddIHAWvXgsCpa74AvRKFE-WVzbda0fzUjces0","pdfSize":"475030"}
