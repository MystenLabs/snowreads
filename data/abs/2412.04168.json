The protocol involves multiple qubits subjected\nto weak Bell pair measurements with active feedback, where the feedback\noperations are optimized to maximize the Quantum Fisher Information. Our scheme\nefficiently reaches a genuinely entangled one-parameter state manifold.\nNumerical simulations for systems with up to 20 qubits suggest that the\nprotocol is scalable and allows high multipartite entanglement across the\nsystem.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"MHxjhENKptpAfmmUCITxbOJFDIBQnv-W6klJeKT8ykY","pdfSize":"675793"}
