This study\naims to investigate how various linguistic components are represented in both\ntypes of texts, assessing the ability of AI to emulate human writing. Using\nhuman-authored essays as a benchmark, we prompted ChatGPT to generate essays of\nequivalent length. These texts were analyzed using Open Brain AI, an online\ncomputational tool, to extract measures of phonological, morphological,\nsyntactic, and lexical constituents. Despite AI-generated texts appearing to\nmimic human speech, the results revealed significant differences across\nmultiple linguistic features such as consonants, word stress, nouns, verbs,\npronouns, direct objects, prepositional modifiers, and use of difficult words\namong others. These findings underscore the importance of integrating automated\ntools for efficient language assessment, reducing time and effort in data\nanalysis. Moreover, they emphasize the necessity for enhanced training\nmethodologies to improve the capacity of AI for producing more human-like text.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"47BLkoPBEuL-sasFoLZUcdhVjc1dvQAYAcH9GDW1eIc","pdfSize":"435357"}
