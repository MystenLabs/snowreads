Synchronization,\ninitially observed by Christiaan Huygens in 1665, has evolved from the study of\nperiodic signals to encompass chaotic systems, where the sensitive dependence\non initial conditions poses unique challenges. This review pointed to both\ntheoretical foundations and contributions (concepts and methods) and practical\ninsights, reinforcing the relevance of chaos synchronization in physics,\nbiology, engineering, social sciences, economics and communication systems. The\nstudy investigates various coupling schemes, such as unidirectional and\nbidirectional coupling, and presents stability criteria under different\nconfigurations. In a very concise way, some ongoing research carried out by the\nauthors is also indicated, using Lorenz, Rossler and hyperchaotic Rossler\nsystems, and quadratic maps as case studies with parameter values leading to\nchaotic behavior. Special attention is given to the stability of synchronized\nstates and the role of multi-stability and bifurcations, and its implications\nto loss of synchronization. We highlight the role of Lyapunov exponents,\neigenvalues, and Lyapunov functions in guaranteeing local and global stability\nof the synchronized state. We aim to contribute to a broader understanding of\nchaos synchronization and its practical applications in diverse fields of\nknowledge. This text shed light on the control and stability of coupled chaotic\nsystems, offering new perspectives on the synchronization of non-identical\nsystems and the emergence of complex synchronization dynamics.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dZLvqjqnF6XZktcDuF5o-JkyKD0br4hQCl2GnIKjgRw","pdfSize":"208961"}
