  "abstract": "  Given a positive, non-increasing sequence $a$ with a finite sum $L$, we\nconsider all the closed subsets of $[0,L]$ such that the lengths of their\ncomplementary open intervals are a rearrangement of the sequence $a$. We study\nall possible $\\theta$-intermediate dimensions for these sets and show that,\nunder some assumptions, it is an interval.\n",
