In this\npaper, we apply this tenet in case of two {\\it non-local} qubits and qutrits,\nwhich leads the complete spectrum of their entangled states in their respective\nbasis. For qutrit system, the study of their properties reveals the existence\nof a new $\\sqrt{2}$ inequality, in addition to usual Bell-CHSH type $2\\sqrt{2}$\ninequality, which is significant from the experimental point of view.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"N9sPwD4NZOH0DJVlrn945nllmg5ipbKGPvHlCHe9c2U","pdfSize":"174747"}
