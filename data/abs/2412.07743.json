To automate this process while maintaining data privacy, we\ndevelop a practical approach using locally deployable large language models\n(LLMs). Inspired by recent advances in automatic International Classification\nof Diseases (ICD) coding, our method frames ATC coding as a hierarchical\ninformation extraction task, guiding LLMs through the ATC ontology level by\nlevel. We evaluate our approach using GPT-4o as an accuracy ceiling and focus\ndevelopment on open-source Llama models suitable for privacy-sensitive\ndeployment. Testing across Health Canada drug product data, the RABBITS\nbenchmark, and real clinical notes from Ontario Health, our method achieves 78%\nexact match accuracy with GPT-4o and 60% with Llama 3.1 70B. We investigate\nknowledge grounding through drug definitions, finding modest improvements in\naccuracy. Further, we show that fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B matches zero-shot Llama\n3.1 70B accuracy, suggesting that effective ATC coding is feasible with smaller\nmodels. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of automatic ATC coding in\nprivacy-sensitive healthcare environments, providing a foundation for future\ndeployments.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SAlq8tDHVQkdpgZF04LazlGEiAhItU8u2AakYTgo6U4","pdfSize":"429000"}
