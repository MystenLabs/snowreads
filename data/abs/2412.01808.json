We give\nexplicit results for $N = 4$ and $N = 17$. We find that all qualitative\ndifferences that arise for larger $N$ are present for $N = 4$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"q2MTLGdGaa_By_CDRlba1y6Wtyd3mRZNW8XKAOpg34g","pdfSize":"744340"}
