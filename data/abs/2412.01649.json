In\nmodern environments, analogous microbial mats can be found in restricted\nenvironments such as carbonate tidal flats and terrestrial hot springs. Here,\nwe report metagenomic sequence data from an analog in the hot springs of\nWaikite Valley, Aotearoa New Zealand, where carbon-rich, slightly-alkaline\ngeothermal waters support diverse phototrophic microbial mats.\n  The Waikite Valley hot spring in the Taupo Volcanic Zone of Aotearoa New\nZealand was sampled in duplicate at 8 points along a temperature gradient\ntransect of the outflow, from ~62 C (near the source) to ~37 C (~100 meters\ndownstream). ~686 Gb of shotgun metagenomic sequence data was generated by\nIllumina Novaseq. Each sample was assembled using SPAdes, followed by binning\nof metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) by MetaBAT. These data are useful for\nthe genomic analysis of novel phototrophic bacteria, as well as for ecological\ncomparisons between thermophilic communities with varying temperatures but\notherwise similar conditions.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Genomics","Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"lU14GbrNFjneaaVkMj-1e2gFJ4ecEkz9hsE3JOlsLHs","pdfSize":"671570"}
