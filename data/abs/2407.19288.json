We propose SignedLouvain, an adaptation of the Louvain method to\nmaximise signed modularity, efficiently taking advantage of the structure\ninduced by signed relations. We begin by identifying the inherent limitations\nof applying the standard Louvain algorithm to signed networks, before\nintroducing a novel variant specifically engineered to overcome these\nchallenges. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we\ndemonstrate that the proposed method not only maintains the speed and\nscalability of its predecessor but also significantly enhances accuracy in\ndetecting communities within signed networks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eTlC-PVRRJ3LDcgnadCUSBnig6xLwO-0uNSiN51dCpE","pdfSize":"460638"}
