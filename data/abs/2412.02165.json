  "abstract": "  In this article, we propose to use the formalism of quantum mechanics to\ndescribe and explain the so-called \"abnormal\" behaviour of agents in certain\ndecision or choice contexts. The basic idea is to postulate that the\npreferences of these agents are indeterminate (in the quantum sense of the\nterm) before the choice is made or the decision is taken. An agent's state\nbefore the decision is represented by a superposition of potential preferences.\nThe decision is assimilated to a measure of the agent's state and leads to a\nprojection of the state onto one of the particular preferences. We therefore\nconsider that uncertainty about preferences is not linked to incomplete\ninformation but to essential indeterminacy. We explore the consequences of\nthese hypotheses on the usual concepts of decision theory and apply the\nformalism to the problem of the so-called \"framing\" effect.\n",
