The PROCESS Grand Challenge at ICASSP 2025 addresses these tasks by\npromoting innovative classification and regression methods for detecting\ncognitive decline. In this paper, we propose a multimodal fusion strategy that\ncombines interpretable linguistic features with temporal embeddings extracted\nfrom pre-trained models. Our approach achieves an F1-score of 0.649 for the\nclassification task (predicting healthy, MCI, dementia) and an RMSE of 2.628\nfor the regression task (MMSE score prediction), securing the top overall\nranking in the competition.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"vUKDuZTjmpino-LbSmomxK-Z6pKWPvNqcIPUaMZaVfo","pdfSize":"65573"}
