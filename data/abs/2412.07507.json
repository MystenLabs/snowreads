However, they are often tailored to a specific\nEA, which limits their generalizability and necessitates retraining or\nredesigns for different EAs and optimization problems. To address this\nlimitation, we introduce ConfigX, a new paradigm of the MetaBBO framework that\nis capable of learning a universal configuration agent (model) for boosting\ndiverse EAs. To achieve so, our ConfigX first leverages a novel modularization\nsystem that enables the flexible combination of various optimization\nsub-modules to generate diverse EAs during training. Additionally, we propose a\nTransformer-based neural network to meta-learn a universal configuration policy\nthrough multitask reinforcement learning across a designed joint optimization\ntask space. Extensive experiments verify that, our ConfigX, after large-scale\npre-training, achieves robust zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks and\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, ConfigX exhibits strong\nlifelong learning capabilities, allowing efficient adaptation to new tasks\nthrough fine-tuning. Our proposed ConfigX represents a significant step toward\nan automatic, all-purpose configuration agent for EAs.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JKSH9_mHLGvQ8VIkBUrsxLuUklcyO6t0V5qcdAu0h64","pdfSize":"959190"}
