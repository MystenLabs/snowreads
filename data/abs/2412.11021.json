However,when\naccelerating sparse CNNs, the irregular input data demands inside sparse CNNs\nwould cause excessive caching operations (COPs) and multi-cycle internal\ndependencies (MCIDs) between operations, declining the throughput of the\nstreaming CGRA. We propose a mapping method for sparse CNNs onto streaming\nCGRA, SparseMap, which incorporates an efcient I/O data management along with\noperation scheduling and binding, to reduce the COPs and MCIDs, thereby\nensuring the optimal throughput of streaming CGRA.The experimental results show\nSparseMap reduces 92.5% COPs and 46.0 % MCIDs while achieves the same or even\nsmaller initiation interval (II) compared to previous works.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"SibyZ8RTaeR0fzdhkZ7OSJR_srTPnKYJGETjxgMwzFQ","pdfSize":"1034340"}
