The interpretation of these\nexperiments relies on considering the spin of electrons as the sole relevant\ndegree of freedom. By applying ab inito open quantum systems theory to the full\nelectronic wavefunction, here we show that contrary to this widespread\nframework the thermalization of the unpaired electron spin of two Cr(V)\ncoordination compounds is driven by virtual transitions to excited states with\nenergy higher than 20,000 1/cm instead of solely involving low-energy spin\ninteractions such as Zeeman and hyperfine ones. Moreover, we found that a\nwindow of low-energy THz phonons contributes to thermalization, rather than a\nsmall number of high-energy vibrations. This work provides a drastic\nreinterpretation of relaxation in spin-1/2 systems and its chemical control\nstrategies, and ultimately exemplifies the urgency of further advancing an ab\ninitio approach to relaxometry.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MPvysvK2hHG-_s4mwNMZ1c2zsSJf0knhTvMyP_IlbAQ","pdfSize":"1211814"}
