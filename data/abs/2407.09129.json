The existence and stability of quiescent and\nrotating dipole-shaped and vortex QDs with vorticity $S=1$ (DQDs and VQDs,\nrespectively) are numerically studied in the framework of the accordingly\nmodified two-component system. The rotating DQDs trapped in an annular\npotential are built of two crescent-like components, stretching along the\nazimuthal direction with the increase of the rotation frequency. Rotating\nquadrupole QDs (QQDs) bifurcate from the VQDs with $S=2$. Above a certain\nrotation frequency, they transform back into VQDs with a flat-top shape.\nRotating DQDs and QQDs are stable in a broad interval of values of the chemical\npotential. The results provide the first example of stable modes which are\nintermediate states between the rotating DQDs and QQDs on the one hand, and\nVQDs on the other.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"-hygNw1CLekU9fOG8dZylTLQSF0p2bkAiLcnB4nUY-s","pdfSize":"20698519"}
