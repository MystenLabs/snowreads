Thanks to the\ncompatibility, we can work over the analytic change of variables formula for\n$p$-adic integrals, hence avoid adapting to the algebraic setting and Denef's\nformula.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6SJjtlDIvGcy9L4wL4PtHoUu74IoYqP9VidpAg88Xqo","pdfSize":"299412"}
