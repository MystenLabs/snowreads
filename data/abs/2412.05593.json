  "abstract": "  GEANT4 is a particle physics simulation tool used to develop and optimize\nradiation detectors. While C++ based examples exist, Python's growing\npopularity necessitates the development of a more accessible Python bindings\ninterface. This work demonstrates the use of cppyy, the automated C++-Python\nbinding package, to provide an accessible interface for developing applications\nwith GEANT4. Coupled with newly developed Python visualization tools and a\nPython-specific helper layer, we demonstrate the suitability of the interface\nfor use in constructing simplistic simulation scenarios showing some initial\nbenchmarking studies when compared to a pure C++ equivalent simulation example.\n",
