Previous\ndemonstrations of circuit cutting focused on the exponential execution and\npostprocessing costs due to the cuts needed to partition a circuit topology,\nleading to overly pessimistic evaluations of the approach. This work observes\nthat the ansatz Clifford structure and variational parameter pruning\nsignificantly reduce these costs. By keeping track of the limited set of\ncorrect subcircuit initializations and measurements, we reduce the number of\nexperiments needed by up to 16x, matching and beating the error mitigation\noffered by classical shadows tomography. By performing reconstruction as a\nsparse tensor contraction, we scale the feasible ansatzes to over 200 qubits\nwith six ansatz layers, beyond the capability of prior work.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"w6NTMhrFaeuEKT0wzCiN-Qk8PJQuXYNW5wI0uiCqJco","pdfSize":"2191522"}
