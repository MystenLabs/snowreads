Additionally, a thematic review was performed\nto analyze the roles and interactions of key participants within the DeFi\necosystem, focusing on its opportunities and inherent risks. The bibliometric\nanalysis identified a progression in research priorities, transitioning from an\ninitial focus on technological innovation to addressing sustainability,\nenvironmental impacts, and regulatory challenges. Key thematic clusters include\ndecentralization, smart contracts, tokenization, and sustainability concerns.\nThe analysis of participants highlighted the roles of developers, liquidity\nproviders, auditors, and regulators while identifying critical risks such as\nsmart contract vulnerabilities, liquidity constraints, and regulatory\nuncertainties. The study underlines the transformative potential of DeFi to\nenhance financial inclusion and transparency while emphasizing the need for\nrobust security frameworks and regulatory oversight to ensure long-term\nstability. This paper comprehensively explains the DeFi ecosystem by\nintegrating bibliometric and thematic analyses. It offers valuable insights for\nresearchers, practitioners, and policymakers, contributing to the ongoing\ndiscourse on the sustainable development and integration of DeFi into the\nglobal financial system.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ft0-K9u063vwxSOkUR82V9Rghwid1KA2yzYaIHKyPJA","pdfSize":"940809"}
