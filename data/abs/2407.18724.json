The resulting predictions for these baryon form factors indicate\nthat the one-loop perturbative corrections to the hard-gluon-exchange\ncontributions are numerically substantial for a wide range of momentum\ntransfers accessible in the current and forthcoming collider experiments.\nIncluding further the (formally) power-suppressed soft contributions due to the\ncelebrated Feynman mechanism, we then perform the state-of-the-art analysis of\nthe Dirac electromagnetic nucleon form factors from first field-theoretical\nprinciples, thus allowing for the most robust determinations of the nucleon\ndistribution amplitudes from the direct comparison with the experimental\nmeasurements.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qKuUeo5EdBd2rYOUBOFb0Z5osN-CNTx0rAm0-_09cS0","pdfSize":"705865","objectId":"0x67d5496bacef0879b061462da93b6c7abfc797abdc3ff97263b871de6a9758ba","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
