In this context,\nexcitations caused by the breakdown of adiabaticity can be minimized by\nadjusting the schedule of the control parameter that drives the transition.\nDrawing inspiration from the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, we characterize the\ntimescale of onset of adiabaticity for several optimal control procedures. Our\nanalysis reveals that schedules relying on local adiabaticity, such as\nRoland-Cerf's local adiabatic driving and the quantum adiabatic\nbrachistochrone, fail to provide a significant speedup over the adiabatic\nevolution in the transverse-field Ising and long-range Kitaev models. As an\nalternative, we introduce a novel framework, Non-Adiabatic Quantum Optimization\n(NAQO), that, by exploiting the Landau-Zener formula and taking into account\nthe role of higher-excited states, outperforms schedules obtained via both\nlocal adiabaticity and state-of-the-art numerical optimization. NAQO is not\nrestricted to exactly solvable models, and we further confirm its superior\nperformance in a disordered non-integrable model.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LKBezQkOCClZpgro2Vs3lc4VntAWK6oLt2Y8mW4TLM8","pdfSize":"3164271"}
