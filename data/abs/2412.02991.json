In\norder to program such photonic circuits, electrical and all-optical modulation\nmechanisms of optical nonlinearity have been proposed. Among them the\nelectrical methods are bottlenecked by speed, while optical methods like\nFloquet engineering provides a fast heat-free route, but has only been\nexperimentally shown to suppress SHG. Here we theoretically and experimentally\ndemonstrated an ultrafast enhancement of SHG by 40% on a timescale of $\\sim$\n500 femtosecond in van der Waals NiPS$_3$. We performed single-ion model\ncalculations to show that by optically control the electron occupation of\ndifferent energy levels, the SHG can be enhanced due to different electronic\nstates involved in the SHG process. We then performed temperature-dependent\ntime-resolved measurements in both linear and nonlinear optics, which confirm\nour calculations. We also discussed the implications for other materials in the\ntransition metal thiophosphates (MPX$_3$) family.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7QwGExaJfpdI9VrI3wyjf9n43shnQNyy5DONHVsnKyU","pdfSize":"495766"}
