A particular concern in the industry is inspecting\nperimeter safety screens on higher levels of construction sites, intended to\nprevent falls of people and objects. We aim to support workers performing this\ninspection task by tracking which parts of the safety screens have been\ninspected. We use machine learning to automatically detect gaps in the\nperimeter screens that require closer inspection and remediation and to\nautomate reporting. This work-in-progress paper describes the problem, our\nearly progress, concerns around worker privacy, and the possibilities to\nmitigate these.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction","Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sPuffmKwvs80fFT-rHkOPnld1QqtdJTybjfw90Zvwog","pdfSize":"1575243"}
