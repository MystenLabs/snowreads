By exhaustive search for central\ntransport hubs on porous lattice structures, we recursively determine and block\nthe emerging main hub until the evolving network reaches the impenetrability\nlimit. We find that the blockage backbone is a self-similar path with a fractal\ndimension which is distinctly smaller than that of the universality class of\noptimal path crack models. The number of blocking steps versus the rescaled\ninitial occupation fraction collapses onto a master curve for different network\nsizes, allowing for the prediction of the onset of impenetrability. The\nshortest-path length distribution broadens during the blocking process\nreflecting an increase of spatial correlations. We address the reliability of\nour predictions upon increasing the disorder or decreasing the fraction of\nprocessed structural information.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"O3URzwlnGpjLWRvbJk8sUN0E4ErzVyQLsjRMgERljS0","pdfSize":"7918771"}
