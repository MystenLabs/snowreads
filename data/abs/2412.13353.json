The problem\nof computing general cohomological invariants of these classifying spaces is\nongoing. Most relevant to this paper is (1) Totaro's construction of the Chow\nring of a classifying space in general and his use of this to study symmetric\ngroups in arXiv:math/9802097, (2) Guillot's similar examination for the Lie\ngroups $G_{2}$ and $Spin(7)$ in arXiv:math/0508122, (3) Field's computation of\nthe Chow ring of $BSO(2n,\\mathbb{C})$ in arXiv:math/0411424, and (4) Yagita's\nwork on the $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-motivic cohomology of $BSO_{4}$ and $BG_{2}$ in\n[Yag10].\n  The work presented in this paper covers the computation of the motivic\ncohomology of $BSO_{4}$ with integral coefficients. The primary approach draws\non methods laid out by Guillot and Yagita (arXiv:math/0508122, [Yag10]). These\nresults lay the groundwork for future work, most immediately the analogous\ncomputation for $BG_{2}$ ([Por21]).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vDQisCXi4TJ9UbL4ABgppSwhy-DnENKBIyVj8E-S8I0","pdfSize":"213180"}
