Magnons\nare the building blocks of magnonics, which offer promising perspectives for\ndata storage, quantum computing, and communication technologies. These\nexcitations are typically measured through inelastic neutron or x-ray\nscattering techniques, which involve heavy and time-consuming measurements,\ndata processing, and analysis based on various theoretical models. Here, we\nintroduce a machine learning algorithm that integrates adaptive noise reduction\nand active learning sampling, which enables the restoration from minimal\ninelastic neutron scattering point data of spin wave information and the\naccurate extraction of magnetic parameters, including hidden interactions. Our\nfindings, benchmarked against the magnon spectra of CrSBr, significantly\nenhance the efficiency and accuracy in addressing complex and noisy\nexperimental measurements. This advancement offers a powerful machine learning\ntool for research in magnonics and spintronics, which can also be extended to\nother characterization techniques at large facilities.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kJ2gKlsCLfJnONTp5Xudp28tYWr_qBu9803e3Su2BUQ","pdfSize":"8246202"}
