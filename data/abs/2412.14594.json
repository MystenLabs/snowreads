These\nexpressions are represented as arithmetic terms, requiring only a fixed and\nfinite number of elementary arithmetic operations from the set: addition,\nsubtraction, multiplication, division with remainder, exponentiation. Mazzanti\nproved that every Kalmar function can be represented by arithmetic terms. We\ndevelop an arithmetic term representing the prime omega function, omega(n),\nwhich counts the number of distinct prime divisors of a positive integer n.\nFrom this term, we find immediately an arithmetic term for the prime-counting\nfunction, pi(n). We utilize these results, along with a new arithmetic term for\nbinomial coefficients and new prime-related exponential Diophantine equations\nto construct an arithmetic term for the n-th prime number, p(n), thereby\nproviding a constructive solution to a fundamental question in mathematics: Is\nthere an order to the primes?\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"urZabjQyJ9ChRVwtYjwY7GTH7irCMgZm3RMRzFXTcFI","pdfSize":"681043"}
