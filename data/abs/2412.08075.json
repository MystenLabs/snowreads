  "abstract": "  In this paper, we provide a new proof of a density version of Tur\\'an's\ntheorem. We also rephrase both the theorem and the proof using entropy. With\nthe entropic formulation, we show that some naturally defined entropic quantity\nis closely connected to other common quantities such as Lagrangian and spectral\nradius. In addition, we also determine the Tur\\'an density for a new family of\nhypergraphs, which we call tents. Our result can be seen as a new\ngeneralization of Mubayi's result on the extended cliques.\n",
