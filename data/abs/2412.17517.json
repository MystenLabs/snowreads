  "abstract": "  Human action detection using privacy-preserving mmWave radar sensors is\nstudied for its applications in healthcare and home automation. Unlike existing\nresearch, limited to simulations in controlled environments, we present a\nreal-world mmWave radar dataset with baseline results for human action\ndetection.\n",
