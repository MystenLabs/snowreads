As a result of the improved isochrone sequence of the open cluster\nM67, we have created new stellar models that avoid commonly used\nsimplifications in 1D stellar modelling, such as mass-independent core\novershooting and a constant mixing length parameter. This has enabled us to\ndeliver a precise isochrone specifically designed for M67, available for\ndownload. We follow a commonly used qualitative approach to adjust the input\nphysics to match the well-defined colour-magnitude sequence, and we test the\nmodel-predicted masses against a known eclipsing binary system at the main\nsequence turnoff of the cluster. Despite using improvements in photometry and\nstellar physics we cannot match the masses of both binary components with the\nsame theoretical isochrone. A chi-square-based isochrone fitting approach using\nour preferred input physics results in a cluster age of 3.95+0.16-0.15 Gyrs.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oWl6OccHnTawvj9usg3DTTnikCX7jrzpD-qnmCyTJAQ","pdfSize":"2105724"}
