  "abstract": "  We consider the characteristic function of linear spectral statistics of\ngeneralized Wigner matrices. We provide an expansion of the characteristic\nfunction with error $\\mathcal{O} ( N^{-1})$ around its limiting Gaussian form,\nand identify sub-leading non-Gaussian corrections of size $\\mathcal{O}\n(N^{-1/2})$. Prior expansions with this error rate held only for Wigner\nmatrices; only a weaker error rate was available for more general matrix\nensembles. We provide some applications.\n",
