In this\nwork, we propose two novel physics-constrained approaches using synthetic\nquantitative MRI (qMRI) images to enhance the robustness and generalisability\nof segmentation models. We trained a qMRI estimation model to predict qMRI maps\nfrom MPRAGE images, which were used to simulate diverse MRI sequences for\nsegmentation training. A second approach built upon prior work in synthetic\ndata for stroke lesion segmentation, generating qMRI maps from a dataset of\ntissue labels. The proposed approaches improved over the baseline nnUNet on a\nvariety of out-of-distribution datasets, with the second approach outperforming\nthe prior synthetic data method.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Physics/Medical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4Lct_95Zq6yS2bdjNCNPOVt3UohPI5FMfGVJsQOv9gA","pdfSize":"3356195"}
