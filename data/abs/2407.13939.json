Towards this goal, we first demonstrate that underconstrained\ncentral force networks possess a critical rigidity manifold of codimension one\nin the space of their physical constraints. We describe how the geometry of\nthis manifold generates a natural parameterization in terms of the states of\nself-stress, and then use this parameterization to numerically generate\ndisordered network structures that are on the critical rigidity manifold and\nalso optimize various objective functions, such as maximizing the bulk\nstiffness under dilation, or minimizing length variance to find networks that\ncan be self-assembled from equal-length parts. This framework can be used to\ndesign mechanical metamaterials that can tune their rigidity and also exhibit\nother desired properties.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xkdZrjegDNry-nWw0Q9xWcszJcOmk7xZ-TNwUUE-Y9A","pdfSize":"3933623"}
