  "abstract": "  We introduce the notion of partial representation of a weak Hopf algebra. We\npresent the universal algebra $H_{par}^w$, which factorizes these partial\nrepresentations by algebra morphisms. Also, it is shown that $\\Hp$ is\nisomorphic to a partial smash product, that it has the structure of a Hopf\nalgebroid and also that it can be endowed with a quantum inverse semigroup\nstructure. Moreover, it is shown that the algebra objects in the module\ncategory over $H_{par}^w$ correspond to symmetrical partial module algebras.\n",
