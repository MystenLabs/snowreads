  "abstract": "  We re-examine positivity bounds on the $2\\to2$ scattering of identical\nmassless real scalars with a novel perspective on how these bounds can be used\nto constrain the spectrum of UV theories. We propose that the entire space of\nconsistent weakly-coupled (and generically non-supersymmetric) UV amplitudes is\ndetermined as a convex hull of the massive scalar amplitude and a one-parameter\nfamily of scalarless \"extremal amplitudes\" parameterized by the ratio of the\nmasses of the two lightest massive states. Further, we propose that the\nextremal amplitudes can be constructed from a similar one-parameter set of\nmaximally supersymmetric amplitudes, leading to the surprising possibility that\nthe S-matrix bootstrap with maximal supersymmetry may be sufficient to\ndetermine the entire allowed space of four-point amplitudes! Finally, we show\nthat minimal spectrum input reduces the allowed space of Wilson coefficients to\nsmall islands around the open string Dirac-Born-Infeld tree amplitude and the\nclosed string Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude.\n",
