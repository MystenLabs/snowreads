Among others, we exhibit the non-negativity and Dynkin type of the\nhomological quadratic form of a gentle algebra, describe its roots as the\nclasses of indecomposable perfect complexes in the Grothendieck group, and\nexpress its Coxeter polynomial in terms of the Avella-Alaminos Geiss invariant.\nWe also derive some consequences for Brauer graph algebras.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XBnU4x_MpGXo0gHPUbUJRwsxKvdYGbHF6P0-l_xifTs","pdfSize":"734850"}
