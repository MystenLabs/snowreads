  "abstract": "  Let p> 2 be a prime number, and let G be a compact nilpotent p-adic Lie group\nwith nilpotency class N<p. In this note we calculate explicitly the unitary\ndual and the matrix coefficients of every compact nilpotent-adic Lie group with\ndimension less or equal than 5. As an application, we provide the corresponding\nspectral theorem for the Vladimirov sub-Laplacian, and show how this operator\nprovides a non-trivial example of a globally hypoelliptic operator on compact\nnilpotent p-adic Lie groups.\n",
