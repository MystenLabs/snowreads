  "abstract": "  In this work, tunable acoustic energy concentrations are realized based on\npseudo-spin locking waveguides and topological rainbow trappings. Firstly, a\ntunable pseudo-spin locking is proposed, and the broad acoustic energy\ntransport and spin-locked one-way transport are verified. The results show that\nacoustic wave transports based on pseudo-spin locking waveguides are more\nrobust to structure defects than conventional topological edge-state\nwaveguides. Besides, topological rainbow trappings are realized by adjusting\nthe distribution of liquid in tubes. Based on those, we investigate the\ncoupling of the pseudo-spin locking waveguides and the topological rainbow\ntrappings. The results show that high acoustic energy concentrations can be\nobtained conveniently by using the coupling energy concentrator based on the\npseudo-spin locking waveguides and the topological rainbow trappings. The\nresults present a novel method to concentrate acoustic wave energy, which is\nvital in the application field of acoustic sensings and microfludics.\n  The according experimental verifications will be presented in the near\nfuture.\n",
