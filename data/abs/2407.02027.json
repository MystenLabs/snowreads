At the same time, researchers and practitioners alike have\nraised a number of privacy concerns, resulting in a wealth of literature\ncovering various privacy risks and vulnerabilities of AI models. Works\nsurveying such risks provide differing focuses, leading to disparate sets of\nprivacy risks with no clear unifying taxonomy. We conduct a systematic review\nof these survey papers to provide a concise and usable overview of privacy\nrisks in GPAIS, as well as proposed mitigation strategies. The developed\nprivacy framework strives to unify the identified privacy risks and mitigations\nat a technical level that is accessible to non-experts. This serves as the\nbasis for a practitioner-focused interview study to assess technical\nstakeholder perceptions of privacy risks and mitigations in GPAIS.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AtPQmjNTcpkwu3LKkH-dU3fJgQ4mPbgxZnrvaVLUWU0","pdfSize":"143354","objectId":"0x16bbe72ec43d8bdeed41dab6e4846d902a261720d43ba88ce90c579b71e3958b","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
