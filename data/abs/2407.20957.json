However, addressing challenges, such\nas limited qubit coherence and high error rate in near-term devices, requires\nextensive efforts. In this paper, we present a substantial stride in quantum\nchemistry by integrating shortcuts-to-adiabaticity techniques into adiabatic\nand variational algorithms for calculating the molecular ground state. Our\napproach includes the counter-diabatic driving that accelerates adiabatic\nevolution by mitigating adiabatic errors. Additionally, we introduce the\ncounter-diabatic terms as the adiabatic gauge ansatz for the variational\nquantum eigensolver, which exhibits favorable convergence properties with a\nfewer number of parameters, thereby reducing the circuit depth. Our approach\nachieves comparable accuracy to other established ansatzes, while enhancing the\npotential for applications in material science, drug discovery, and molecular\nsimulations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CYogdK6B8NdHfAo7D37FzK0d1-s0W-zRUx3T9gu_uug","pdfSize":"2686351"}
