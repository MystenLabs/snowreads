  "abstract": "  This paper is devoted to the study of two classes of operators related to\ndisjointly weakly compact sets, which we call $DW$-DP operators and\n$DW$-limited operators, respectively. They carry disjointly weakly compact\nsubsets of a Banach lattice onto Dunford-Pettis sets and limited sets,\nrespectively. We show that $DW$-DP (resp. $DW$-limited) operators are precisely\nthe operators which are both weak Dunford-Pettis and order Dunford-Pettis\n(resp. weak$^*$ Dunford-Pettis and order limited) operators. Furthermore, the\napproximation properties of positive $DW$-DP and positive $DW$-limited\noperators are given.\n",
