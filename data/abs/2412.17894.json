  "abstract": "  We revisit the chiral spectra on charged 1- and 5-branes in the 10d\nnon-supersymmetric $\\mathfrak{sp}(16)$ string theory (also known as the\nSugimoto model), and verify that they consistently cancel the anomaly inflow\ninduced by a Green--Schwarz mechanism in the bulk. By analyzing the\n$\\mathfrak{sp}(16)$ representations arising from quantizing the fermion zero\nmodes on these branes as well as uncharged 4-branes, we find compelling\nevidence that the global structure of the gauge group is $Sp(16)/\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nWe further comment on a possible duality to non-supersymmetric heterotic\nstrings, and explore bottom-up anomaly inflow constraints for 10d effective\n$Sp(16)/\\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theories coupled to gravity.\n",
