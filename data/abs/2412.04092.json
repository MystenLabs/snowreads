  "abstract": "  Language models have rapidly evolved, predominantly focusing on English while\noften neglecting extensive pretraining in other languages. This approach has\nrequired initiatives to adapt powerful, English-centric models to other\nlinguistic contexts through finetuning. For Dutch, such a recent endeavour is\n``GEITje'' a model originally derived from the English-based Mistral 7B.\nBuilding on this fundamental work, the current research extends the\ncapabilities of GEITje by supervised finetuning on newly created high-quality\nsynthetic conversational datasets, along with an additional preference\nalignment procedure on a synthetic feedback dataset. Both the developed models\nand the created datasets are openly available.\n",
