We calculate the correlation functions up to dimension eight\ncondensates at the leading order of $\\alpha_{s}$. The stable QCD Lapalce sum\nrules can be established for the positive-parity $N_{1/2^+}, \\Delta_{3/2^+},\n\\Delta_{1/2^+}$ and negative-parity $N_{1/2^-}, N_{3/2^-}, \\Delta_{1/2^-}$\nchannels to extract their mass spectra. The lowest-lying hybrid baryons are\npredicted to be the negative-parity $N_{1/2^-}$ state around 2.28 GeV and\n$\\Delta_{1/2^-}$ state around 2.64 GeV. These hybrid baryons mainly decay into\nconventional baryon plus meson final states. We propose to search for the light\nhybrid baryons through the $\\chi_{cJ}/\\Upsilon$ decays via the three-gluon\nemission mechanism in BESIII and BelleII experiments. Our studies of the light\nhybrid baryons will be useful for understanding the excited baryon spectrum and\nthe behavior of gluonic degrees of freedom in QCD.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0l4z6CP4OUxtdmRTN2XQMsmt5QYMzuSC-pfI8Ips0Fs","pdfSize":"328783"}
