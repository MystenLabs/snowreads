{"id":"2412.10226","title":"An algebraicity conjecture of Drinfeld and the moduli of $p$-divisible\n  groups","authors":"Zachary Gardner and Keerthi Madapusi","authorsParsed":[["Gardner","Zachary",""],["Madapusi","Keerthi",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2024 15:50:33 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-16","timestamp":1734105033000,"abstract":"  We use the newly developed stacky prismatic technology of Drinfeld and\nBhatt-Lurie to give a uniform, group-theoretic construction of smooth stacks\n$\\mathrm{BT}^{G,\\mu}_{n}$ attached to a smooth affine group scheme $G$ over\n$\\mathbb{Z}_p$ and $1$-bounded cocharacter $\\mu$, verifying a recent conjecture\nof Drinfeld. This can be viewed as a refinement of results of B\\\"ultel-Pappas,\nwho gave a related construction using $(G,\\mu)$-displays defined via rings of\nWitt vectors. We show that, when $G = \\mathrm{GL}_h$ and $\\mu$ is a minuscule\ncocharacter, these stacks are isomorphic to the stack of truncated\n$p$-divisible groups of height $h$ and dimension $d$ (the latter depending on\n$\\mu$). This gives a generalization of results of Ansch\\\"utz-Le Bras, yielding\na linear algebraic classification of $p$-divisible groups over very general\n$p$-adic bases, and verifying another conjecture of Drinfeld.\n  The proofs use derived algebraic geometry, combined with an animated variant\nof Lau's theory of higher frames and displays, and actually show\nrepresentability of a wide range of stacks whose tangent complexes are\n$1$-bounded in a suitable sense. In particular, we also prove algebraicity for\nthe stack of perfect $F$-gauges of Hodge-Tate weights $0,1$ and level $n$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aUFh3fvl5OJxhQ-XRBdNW3aMjbIV-RJPviwVmyeKPYM","pdfSize":"1409249"}
