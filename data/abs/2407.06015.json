Advances in CSL now allow learning of causal graphs in\ndiverse application domains, which has the potential to facilitate data-driven\ncausal decision-making. Real-world CSL performance depends on a number of\n$\\textit{context-specific}$ factors, including context-specific data\ndistributions and non-linear dependencies, that are important in practical\nuse-cases. However, our understanding of how to assess and select CSL methods\nin specific contexts remains limited. To address this gap, we present\n$\\textit{CausalRegNet}$, a multiplicative effect structural causal model that\nallows for generating observational and interventional data incorporating\ncontext-specific properties, with a focus on the setting of gene perturbation\nexperiments. Using real-world gene perturbation data, we show that CausalRegNet\ngenerates accurate distributions and scales far better than current simulation\nframeworks. We illustrate the use of CausalRegNet in assessing CSL methods in\nthe context of interventional experiments in biology.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VKV-28DXNc2T_6ha48JT2ogKsudKVAdO4QHEbcLlAMs","pdfSize":"654262"}
