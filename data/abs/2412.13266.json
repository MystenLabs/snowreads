  "abstract": "  Self-testing refers to the certification of quantum states and measurements\nbased entirely on the correlations exhibited by measurements on separate\nsubsystems. In the bipartite case, self-testing of states has been completely\ncharacterized, up to local isometries, as there exist protocols that self-test\narbitrary pure states of any local dimension. Much less is known in the\nmultipartite case, where an important difference with respect to the bipartite\ncase appears: there exist multipartite states that are not equivalent, up to\nlocal isometries, to their complex conjugate. Thus, any self-testing\ncharacterization must in general be complete up to not only local unitaries,\nbut also complex conjugation. Under these premises, in this work, we give a\ncomplete characterization of self-testing in the multipartite qubit case.\n",
