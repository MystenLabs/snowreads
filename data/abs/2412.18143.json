  "abstract": "  Graphs are the most suitable structures for modeling objects and interactions\nin applications where component inter-connectivity is a key feature. There has\nbeen increased interest in graphs to represent domains such as social networks,\nweb site link structures, and biology. Graph stores recently rose to prominence\nalong the NoSQL movement. In this work we will focus on NOSQL graph databases,\ndescribing their peculiarities that sets them apart from other data storage and\nmanagement solutions, and how they differ among themselves. We will also\nanalyze in-depth two different graph database management systems - AllegroGraph\nand Neo4j that uses the most popular graph models used by NoSQL stores in\npractice: the resource description framework (RDF) and the labeled property\ngraph (LPG), respectively.\n",
