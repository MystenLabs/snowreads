Optical\ntweezers are employed to hold one atom stationary while propelling the other to\na constant velocity. After the tweezers are deactivated, both atoms are excited\nto a Rydberg state by a $\\pi$-pulse. After a collision, a second $\\pi$-pulse is\napplied. If the stationary atom does not experience a significant momentum\ntransfer and is de-excited to its ground state, it can be recaptured when\nreactivating the tweezer. The impact parameter dependent collision probability\nis extracted from the atom loss from the tweezer and used to evaluate the\ncollisional cross section between Rydberg atoms. Quantum and classical\nsimulations of elastic two-body collisions show good agreement with the present\nexperimental data and provide insights into the critical parameter regime where\nquantum effects become important.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"24_TM-JkIgFomDkVPvCRwojCtQ1ncfShTe1Til_mOZI","pdfSize":"8359869"}
