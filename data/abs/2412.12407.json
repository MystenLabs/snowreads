We develop inside-out cross-covariance (IOX) models for\nmultivariate spatial likelihood-based inference. IOX leads to valid\ncross-covariance matrix functions which we interpret as inducing spatial\ndependence on independent replicates of a correlated random vector. The\nresulting sample cross-covariance matrices are \"inside-out\" relative to the\nubiquitous linear model of coregionalization (LMC). However, unlike LMCs, our\nmethods offer direct marginal inference, easy prior elicitation of covariance\nparameters, the ability to model outcomes with unequal smoothness, and flexible\ndimension reduction. As a covariance model for a q-variate Gaussian process,\nIOX leads to scalable models for noisy vector data as well as flexible latent\nmodels. For large n cases, IOX complements Vecchia approximations and related\nprocess-based methods based on sparse graphical models. We demonstrate superior\nperformance of IOX on synthetic datasets as well as on colorectal cancer\nproteomics data.
