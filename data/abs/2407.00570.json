The proposed approach enables the development of controllers capable of\naccommodating differences in real-life model parameters between agents, thereby\nenhancing overall network performance. We compare the performance of the\nadaptive control laws with classical PID controllers for the reference tracking\ntask. Each follower drone has a model reference adaptive controller that\ncontinuously updates its parameters based on real-time feedback and reference\nmodel information. This adaptability ensures an adequate performance that,\ncompared to conventional non-adaptive techniques, can reduce the amount of\nenergy required and consequently increase the operating duration of the drones.\nThe experimental results, particularly in vertical velocity control, underscore\nthe effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving synchronized behavior.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vqRm-IUdafXO1I8z9R34agI6k_gmTFbBcUfbLZODJlQ","pdfSize":"1163873"}
