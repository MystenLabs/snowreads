In particular, the stochastic integration rule, which provides\nasymptotically unbiased estimates of the moments of nonlinearly transformed\nGaussian random variables, is reviewed together with the recently introduced\nstochastic integration filter (SIF). Using SIF, the respective multi-step\nprediction and smoothing algorithms are developed in full and efficient\nsquare-root form. The stochastic-integration-rule-based algorithms are\nimplemented in Python (within the Stone Soup framework) and in MATLAB and are\nnumerically evaluated and compared with the well-known unscented and extended\nKalman filters using the Stone Soup defined tracking scenario.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"aEkA96z2nQxIRtbRvOPslF4cJTpM_p-r0Ur6QvfSO84","pdfSize":"651939"}
