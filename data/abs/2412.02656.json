  "abstract": "  We show that quantum geometry sets a bound on the $q^4$ term in the static\nstructure factor $S(q)$. Bands that saturate this bound satisfy a form of\nLaplace's equation, leading us to refer to them as \\textit{harmonic bands}. We\nprovide some examples of harmonic bands in one- and two-dimensional systems,\nincluding Landau levels.\n",
