Despite not admitting a de Sitter vacuum, the string theory, by the\npower of open-close correspondence, captures the Gibbons-Hawking entropy as the\nentropy of Chan-Paton species on a de Sitter-like state obtained via\n$D$-branes. Moreover, this derivation sheds a new light at the origin of the\narea-form, since the equality takes place for a critical 't Hooft coupling for\nwhich the species entropy of open strings saturates the area-law unitarity\nbound.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vX5WkTfOth56iy5Kx7kZO_yzn07-dzdnYTWHptBTGJ4","pdfSize":"183876"}
