We\nconsider the effect of $T\\bar{T}$-deformation of conformal field theories in\nperturbation theory. We use dimensional regularization scheme to perturbatively\ncalculate the effect of the $T\\bar{T}$-deformation on the correlation functions\nof the CFT's primary fields. We provide the renormalization of the fields for\nthe case of two-point correlation function.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RNF5ECllRsQ5GJEKzFpZY_YAv84iF6IszYq-QiKkf3w","pdfSize":"247035"}
