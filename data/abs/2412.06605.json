Important new features comprise NLO electroweak automation (incl.\nextension to BSM processes like SMEFT), loop-induced processes and new\ndevelopments in the UFO interface. We highlight work in progress and further\nplans, such as the implementation of electroweak PDFs, photon radiation, the\nexclusive top threshold and features for exotic new physics searches.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FwBtIMU_QUHLUFPaPzA8AmT-rHq0xDVYEIQJ-6Hajns","pdfSize":"83337"}
