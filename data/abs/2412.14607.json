We\nexplore the constraints on anisotropic expansion provided by measuring\ndirectional variation in the Hubble constant, $H_0$, derived from differential\nzeropoint measurements of the Tully-Fisher distance estimator. We fit various\nmodels for directional variation in $H_0$ using the Tully-Fisher dataset from\nthe all-sky Cosmicflows-4 catalog. The best-fit dipole variation has an\namplitude of 0.063 $\\pm$ 0.016 mag in the direction ($\\ell,b$) = (142 $\\pm$\n30$^{\\circ}$, 52 $\\pm$ 10$^{\\circ}$). If this were due to anisotropic expansion\nit would imply a 3% variation in $H_0$, corresponding to $\\Delta H_0$ = 2.10\n$\\pm$ 0.53 km/s/Mpc if $H_0$ = 70 km/s/Mpc, with a significance of 3.9$\\sigma$.\nA model that includes this $H_0$ dipole is only weakly favored relative to a\nmodel with a constant $H_0$ and a bulk motion of the volume sampled by\nCosmicflows-4 that is consistent with the standard $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology.\nHowever, we show that with the expected Tully-Fisher data from the WALLABY and\nDESI surveys it should be possible to detect a 1% $H_0$ dipole anisotropy at\n5.8$\\sigma$ confidence and to distinguish it from the typical bulk flow\npredicted by $\\Lambda$CDM over the volume of these surveys.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"otg88fFzhxi90gX1AcChLSRbyOQENH6CkJc8UwZ0isg","pdfSize":"2939290"}
