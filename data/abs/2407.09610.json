The early versions\nof the KadS thermodynamics are briefly discussed, highlighting some of its\nstrong points and shortcomings. Isohomogeneous transformations, a procedure for\ngenerating new thermodynamics, are presented and geometrically interpreted for\nKadS. This tool is used to determine possible KadS thermodynamics that can be\nconstructed to satisfy a Smarr formula, and the validity of the first law in\nthe generated thermodynamics. The connection between new thermodynamic theories\nand early Hawking's approach is considered. In this new framework, the usual\nKadS thermodynamics is complemented with its geometric construction, and\nHawking's proposal, which does not satisfy the first law, is improved to an\nalternative thermodynamic theory. With the quantum statistical relation,\nHawking's and this alternative KadS thermodynamics are also generalized from\nfour to higher dimensions.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UF7Z4hZAn8unGbPd_cTvHZt1e7acNv7ye4Mspxjg2Jw","pdfSize":"302229","objectId":"0x6d9777b4a751faf7c45797b3191600d6faf35490293d4a9de7c61c968973daa5","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
