One way to produce a phylogenetic\nnetwork is to randomly place $k$ arcs between the edges of a rooted binary\nphylogenetic tree with $n$ leaves. The resulting directed graph may fail to be\na phylogenetic network, and even when it is (and thereby a `tree-based'\nnetwork), it may fail to be a tree-child or normal network. In this paper, we\nfirst show that if $k$ is fixed, the proportion of arc placements that result\nin a normal network tends to 1 as $n$ grows. From this result, the asymptotic\nenumeration of normal networks becomes straightforward and provides a\ntransparent meaning to the combinatorial terms that arise. Moreover, the\napproach extends to allow $k$ to grow with $n$ (at the rate\n$o(n^\\frac{1}{3})$), which was not handled in earlier work. We also investigate\na subclass of normal networks of particular relevance in biology (hybridization\nnetworks) and establish that the same asymptotic results apply.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"y2nQ-5E-hXBeRBqmX8KeM0Q3HYrIRi6JJzOpNAVUoec","pdfSize":"1739784"}
