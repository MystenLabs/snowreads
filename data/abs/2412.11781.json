  "abstract": "  The non-isothermal analysis of materials with the application of the\nArrhenius equation involves temperature integration. If the frequency factor in\nthe Arrhenius equation depends on temperature with a power-law relationship,\nthe integral is known as the general temperature integral. This integral which\nhas no analytical solution is estimated by the approximation functions with\ndifferent accuracies. In this article, the rational approximations of the\nintegral were obtained based on the minimization of the maximal deviation of\nbivariate functions. Mathematically, these problems belong to the class of\nquasiconvex optimization and can be solved using the bisection method. The\napproximations obtained in this study are more accurate than all approximates\navailable in the literature.\n",
