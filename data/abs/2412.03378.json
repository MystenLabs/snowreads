However, its splatting-based rendering\nmodel makes several approximations to the rendering equation, reducing physical\naccuracy. We show that splatting and its approximations are unnecessary, even\nwithin a rasterizer; we instead volumetrically integrate 3D Gaussians directly\nto compute the transmittance across them analytically. We use this analytic\ntransmittance to derive more physically-accurate alpha values than 3DGS, which\ncan directly be used within their framework. The result is a method that more\nclosely follows the volume rendering equation (similar to ray-tracing) while\nenjoying the speed benefits of rasterization. Our method represents opaque\nsurfaces with higher accuracy and fewer points than 3DGS. This enables it to\noutperform 3DGS for view synthesis (measured in SSIM and LPIPS). Being\nvolumetrically consistent also enables our method to work out of the box for\ntomography. We match the state-of-the-art 3DGS-based tomography method with\nfewer points.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"83WW-4DaK6OLuMw7PXaeouY6Eq2MYy1YZelMGi1p_14","pdfSize":"45761411"}
