  "abstract": "  The rise of the industrial metaverse has brought digital twins (DTs) to the\nforefront. Blockchain-powered non-fungible tokens (NFTs) offer a decentralized\napproach to creating and owning these cloneable DTs. However, the potential for\nunauthorized duplication, or counterfeiting, poses a significant threat to the\nsecurity of NFT-DTs. Existing NFT clone detection methods often rely on static\ninformation like metadata and images, which can be easily manipulated. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel deep-learning-based solution as a\ncombination of an autoencoder and RNN-based classifier. This solution enables\nreal-time pattern recognition to detect fake NFT-DTs. Additionally, we\nintroduce the concept of dynamic metadata, providing a more reliable way to\nverify authenticity through AI-integrated smart contracts. By effectively\nidentifying counterfeit DTs, our system contributes to strengthening the\nsecurity of NFT-based assets in the metaverse.\n",
