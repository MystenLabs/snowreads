  "abstract": "  Few shot and Chain-of-Thought prompting have shown promise when applied to\nPhysics Question Answering Tasks, but are limited by the lack of mathematical\nability inherent to LLMs, and are prone to hallucination. By utilizing a\nMixture of Experts (MoE) Model, along with analogical prompting, we are able to\nshow improved model performance when compared to the baseline on standard LLMs.\nWe also survey the limits of these prompting techniques and the effects they\nhave on model performance. Additionally, we propose Analogical CoT prompting, a\nprompting technique designed to allow smaller, open source models to leverage\nAnalogical prompting, something they have struggled with, possibly due to a\nlack of specialist training data.\n",
