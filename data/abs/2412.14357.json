  "abstract": "  In this paper, we consider nonparametric estimation over general Dirichlet\nmetric measure spaces. Unlike the more commonly studied reproducing kernel\nHilbert space, whose elements may be defined pointwise, a Dirichlet space\ntypically only contain equivalence classes, i.e. its elements are only unique\nalmost everywhere. This lack of pointwise definition presents significant\nchallenges in the context of nonparametric estimation, for example the\nclassical ridge regression problem is ill-posed. In this paper, we develop a\nnew technique for renormalizing the ridge loss by replacing pointwise\nevaluations with certain \\textit{local means} around the boundaries of\nobstacles centered at each data point. The resulting renormalized empirical\nrisk functional is well-posed and even admits a representer theorem in terms of\ncertain equilibrium potentials, which are truncated versions of the associated\nGreen function, cut-off at a data-driven threshold. We study the global,\nout-of-sample consistency of the sample minimizer, and derive an adaptive upper\nbound on its convergence rate that highlights the interplay of the analytic,\ngeometric, and probabilistic properties of the Dirichlet form. Our framework\nnotably does not require the smoothness of the underlying space, and is\napplicable to both manifold and fractal settings. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first paper to obtain out-of-sample convergence guarantees in the\nframework of general metric measure Dirichlet spaces.\n",
