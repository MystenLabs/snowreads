It distinguishes the semantic types of\ntext by analyzing the position relationship between text nodes and the relation\nbetween text content. The existing document understanding models mainly focus\non entity categories while ignoring the extraction of entity boundaries. We\nbuild a novel hypergraph attention document semantic entity recognition\nframework, HGA, which uses hypergraph attention to focus on entity boundaries\nand entity categories at the same time. It can conduct a more detailed analysis\nof the document text representation analyzed by the upstream model and achieves\na better performance of semantic information. We apply this method on the basis\nof GraphLayoutLM to construct a new semantic entity recognition model\nHGALayoutLM. Our experiment results on FUNSD, CORD, XFUND and SROIE show that\nour method can effectively improve the performance of semantic entity\nrecognition tasks based on the original model. The results of HGALayoutLM on\nFUNSD and XFUND reach the new state-of-the-art results.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dc5IZTZx1XmmWwXMw--IuE78Ey8006XcDBHg8xR831I","pdfSize":"3097156"}
