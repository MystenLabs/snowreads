This\norder is applied in [8] to construct Elnitsky tilings for any finite Coxeter\ngroup. Employing the deletion order, a corresponding normal form of an element\nw of W is defined which is shown to be the same as the normal form of w using\nright to left lexicographic ordering. Further results on the deletion order are\nobtained relating to the property of being Artinian and, when W is finite, its\ninterplay with the longest element of W.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gKG_jF3ucNmU4RmJVPQfFyJpv-Y60ukLBIfhEgmQV0I","pdfSize":"196257"}
