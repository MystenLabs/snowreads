  "abstract": "  We explore the connection between super $\\mathcal{W}$-algebras\n($\\mathcal{SW}$-algebras) and $\\mathrm{G}$-structures with torsion. The former\nare realised as symmetry algebras of strings with $\\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$\nsupersymmetry on the worldsheet, while the latter are associated with generic\nstring backgrounds with non-trivial Neveu-Schwarz flux $H$. In particular, we\nfocus on manifolds featuring $\\mathrm{Spin}(7)$, $\\mathrm{G}_2$,\n$\\mathrm{SU}(2)$, and $\\mathrm{SU}(3)$-structures. We compare the full quantum\nalgebras with their classical limits, obtained by studying the commutators of\nsuperconformal and $\\mathcal{W}$-symmetry transformations, which preserve the\naction of the $(1,0)$ non-linear $\\sigma$-model. We show that, at first order\nin the string length scale $\\ell_s$, the torsion deforms some of the OPE\ncoefficients corresponding to special holonomy through a scalar torsion class.\n",
