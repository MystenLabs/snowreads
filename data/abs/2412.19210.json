Our approach, based on an enhanced version of\nGronwall's lemma and fixed-point arguments, provides an efficient framework for\nanalyzing sweeping processes. In particular, our findings recover all existing\nresults for the class of Volterra sweeping processes and provide new insights\ninto history-dependent sweeping processes. Finally, we apply our theoretical\nresults to establish the well-posedness of a viscoelastic model with long\nmemory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4fiNSALp462Nkm0BQN90POnGyCyZlcM94JFPmgg8CkY","pdfSize":"268651"}
