Here, we introduce a new quality measure that is applicable also in the\npresence of strong electron-electron interactions and that quantifies the\ncloseness to topological protection of finetuned MBSs in short quantum-dot\nchains. We call this measure local distinguishability because it puts a bound\nto the degree an arbitrary local measurement can distinguish between two\nstates. We study the local distinguishability for quantum-dot chains of\ndifferent length. The three-dot chain is studied in detail, and we find that it\nmay not always be an improvement over the two-dot case, a fact that can be\nunderstood within an effective model derived from perturbation theory. For\nlonger chains, the local distinguishability vanishes exponentially, signalling\na transition to a topological phase with two ground states that cannot be\ndistinguished by any local measurement.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"18yZDPqsdM9EPhO-wl1ks_O7y_AI_Iszr5nGXGTeyog","pdfSize":"5406372"}
