We determine all total internal reflection and critical angles\n(Brewster angles) conditions, which are given by strict relations between all\nrelevant electromagnetic quantities of the system and the frequency. For $s$-\nand $p$-polarized incident waves, total internal reflection can occur under\ncertain conditions on the constitutive parameters (for each propagating mode)\nat specific frequency windows and certain incidence angle intervals. All\npossible conditions to define critical angles for null reflection are\ndetermined. This scenario allows polarization changes by reflection.\nConsidering a $p$-polarized incident wave, the frequency and the Brewster\nangle, allowing null reflection for both propagating modes, are determined. The\nGoos-H\\\"anchen shift and the complex Kerr rotation are also evaluated. The Kerr\nellipticity angle presents a frequency-dependent behavior, also reported in\nWeyl semimetals, having maximum values $\\eta_{Kerr}=\\pm \\pi/4$ for specific\nvalues of frequency, which may work as a signature of this axion chiral\ndielectric.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jOr6gdYN68fpWWSUZU-DvRXxO2JeZ2NZ9i1I5u6Q2Jg","pdfSize":"1514729"}
