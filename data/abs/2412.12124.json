This non-perturbative phenomenon is dubbed Effective\nLocality. In a much simpler way than in QCD, the most remarkable and intriguing\naspects of Effective Locality have been presented in a recent letter in the\nYang-Mills theory on Minkowski spacetime. While quickly recalled in the current\npaper, these results are used to calculate the problematic gluonic propagator\nin the Yang-Mills non-perturbative regime.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"S4ac8LHUaQQn0G7-3jtH9vxwzOc_ksos3rIuUps1jG0","pdfSize":"515842"}
