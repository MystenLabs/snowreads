  "abstract": "  Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems struggle with processing\nmultimodal documents of varying structural complexity. This paper introduces a\nnovel multi-strategy parsing approach using LLM-powered OCR to extract content\nfrom diverse document types, including presentations and high text density\nfiles both scanned or not. The methodology employs a node-based extraction\ntechnique that creates relationships between different information types and\ngenerates context-aware metadata. By implementing a Multimodal Assembler Agent\nand a flexible embedding strategy, the system enhances document comprehension\nand retrieval capabilities. Experimental evaluations across multiple knowledge\nbases demonstrate the approach's effectiveness, showing improvements in answer\nrelevancy and information faithfulness.\n",
