  "abstract": "  We present a comprehensive investigation into the physical properties of\nintermetallic ErPd$_2$Si$_2$, a compound renowned for its intriguing magnetic\nand electronic characteristics. We confirm the tetragonal crystal structure of\nErPd$_2$Si$_2$ within the $I4/mmm$ space group. Notably, we observed\nanisotropic thermal expansion, with the lattice constant $a$ expanding and $c$\ncontracting between 15 K and 300 K. This behavior is attributed to lattice\nvibrations and electronic contributions. Heat capacity measurements revealed\nthree distinct temperature regimes: $T_1 \\sim 3.0$ K, $T_\\textrm{N} \\sim 4.20$\nK, and $T_2 \\sim 15.31$ K. These correspond to the disappearance of\nspin-density waves, the onset of an incommensurate antiferromagnetic (AFM)\nstructure, and the crystal-field splitting and/or the presence of short-range\nspin fluctuations, respectively. Remarkably, the AFM phase transition anomaly\nwas observed exclusively in low-field magnetization data (120 Oe) at\n$T_\\textrm{N}$. A high magnetic field ($B =$ 3 T) effectively suppressed this\nanomaly, likely due to spin-flop and spin-flip transitions. Furthermore, the\nextracted effective PM moments closely matched the expected theoretical value,\nsuggesting a dominant magnetic contribution from localized 4$f$ spins of Er.\nAdditionally, significant differences in resistance ($R$) values at low\ntemperatures under applied $B$ indicated a magnetoresistance (MR) effect with a\nminimum value of -4.36\\%. Notably, the measured MR effect exhibited anisotropic\nbehavior, where changes in the strength or direction of the applied $B$ induced\nvariations in the MR effect. A twofold symmetry of $R$ was discerned at 3 T and\n9 T, originating from the orientation of spin moments relative to the applied\n$B$. Intriguingly, above $T_\\textrm{N}$, short-range spin fluctuations also\ndisplayed a preferred orientation along the $c$-axis due to single-ion\nanisotropy.\n",
