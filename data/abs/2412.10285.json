Due to the small mass of ULDM, even minor\nself-interactions can drastically alter these scales in the Thomas-Fermi limit.\nEven in this limit, the characteristic mass can be determined by quantum\npressure rather than by repulsive forces. We suggest that these characteristic\nscales are connected to certain mysteries of observed galaxies such as the\nuniversal acceleration scale or the constant surface density of galaxies.\nOscillation of ULDM field can explain the current cosmological density of dark\nmatter. Many cosmological constraints imply the energy scale $\\tilde{m}$ of\norder of $10~eV$ and a GUT scale phase transition related to ULDM.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hSXguAgQrJ5nO3s76nw6cROHIuE4PWOa6FXqk-kk_nE","pdfSize":"435358"}
