  "abstract": "  The first step in investigating fractional difference maps, which do not have\nperiodic points except fixed points, is to find asymptotically periodic points\nand bifurcation points and draw asymptotic bifurcation diagrams. Recently\nderived equations that allow calculations of asymptotically periodic and\nbifurcation points contain coefficients defined as slowly converging infinite\nsums. In this paper we derive analytic expressions for coefficients of the\nequations that allow calculations of asymptotically periodic and bifurcation\npoints in fractional difference maps.\n",
