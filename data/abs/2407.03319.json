Conveniently, the superposition principle of\nquantum mechanics ensures that, upon absorbing quantum fluctuation, these rich\nlow-energy behaviors can always be effectively described by dressed particles\nwith fully quantized charge, spin, and orbitals structure. Such a powerful and\nsimple description is, however, difficult to access through density functional\ntheory (DFT) calculations, since in terms of bare particles the quantum\nfluctuation would heavily smear the quantized quantities. To address this\ndifficulty, we propose an `interaction annealing' approach to decipher the\ndominant valence and orbital structure by suppressing the charge fluctuation\nthrough enhancing ionic charging energy. Applying this approach to\nferroelectric semi-metal WTe${_2}$ as a demonstration, we identify a dominant\nferro-orbital ordered structure with W ion in a $d^2$ spin-0 configuration. The\nproposed approach is straightforward to implement in standard DFT calculations\nto grant additional access to essential low-energy physics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"X_MEEWfGS7-L9F8kMg6FJ0KMn8VVb_ZlYemlIBebJmM","pdfSize":"692524"}
