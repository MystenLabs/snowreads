Here, we\ndemonstrate a highly flexible and efficient method for designing several\nclasses of compact and low-loss integrated optical devices. By leveraging a\ndata-driven approach, we represent devices in the form of cascaded eigenmode\nscattering matrices, through a data-driven eigenmode expansion method. We\nperform electromagnetic computations using parallel data processing techniques,\ndemonstrating simulation of individual device responses in tens of milliseconds\nwith physical accuracies matching 3D-FDTD. We then couple these simulations\nwith nonlinear optimization algorithms to design silicon-based waveguide\ntapers, power splitters, and waveguide crossings with state-of-the-art\nperformance and near-lossless operation. These three sets of devices highlight\nthe broad computational efficiency of the design methodology shown, and the\napplicability of the demonstrated data-driven eigenmode expansion approach to a\nwide set of photonic design problems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"EMr2FKqN5HmQ5cZV8Dx8j1T2mo89pth7kCfj7E_UCsU","pdfSize":"967486"}
