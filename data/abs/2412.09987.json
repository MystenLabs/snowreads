These methods were generalised by\narXiv:1809.08485, arXiv:2012.00067 to cover Hardy-Sobolev inequalities and\nStein-Weiss inequalities for cocanceling vector fields. We are motivated by\nthese works to study Hardy-Sobolev inequalities with power weights, where the\nweight may grow towards infinity. These inequalities were previously\ninaccessible due to this growth.
