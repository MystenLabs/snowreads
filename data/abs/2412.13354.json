Images were reconstructed using three sensing\naxes, arrays of 16 to 160 magnetometers, and cell sizes ranging from 1 to 18\nmm. Image quality was evaluated visually and with the weighted spatial\nvariance. Single-axis measurements normal to the surface provided the best\nimage quality, and image quality increased with an increase in sensor number\nand size. This study can inform future OPM design, showing the size of the\nvapour cell need not be constrained to that of commercially available OPMs, and\nthat a small array of single-axis, highly sensitive sensors is optimal for\nMDEIT.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EXh01Yw8xUh3bBXqoPZnMiV9YMbRcgg4mKaQJmmeKp4","pdfSize":"2645611"}
