  "abstract": "  Starting from the Izergin-Korepin 19-vertex model in the quadrant, we\nintroduce two families of rational multivariate functions $F_S$ and $G_S$;\nthese are in direct analogy with functions introduced by Borodin in the context\nof the higher-spin 6-vertex model in the quadrant.\n  We prove that $F_S(x_1,\\dots,x_N;z)$ and $G_S(y_1,\\dots,y_M;z)$ are symmetric\nfunctions in their alphabets $(x_1,\\dots,x_N)$ and $(y_1,\\dots,y_M)$, and pair\ntogether to yield a Cauchy identity. Both properties are consequences of the\nYang-Baxter equation of the model.\n  We show that, in an appropriate limit of the spectral parameters $z$, $F_S$\ntends to a stable symmetric function denoted $H_S$. This leads to a simplified\nversion of the Cauchy identity with a fully factorized kernel, and suggests\nself-duality of the functions $H_S$.\n  We obtain a symmetrization formula for the function $F_S(x_1,\\dots,x_N;z)$,\nwhich exhibits its symmetry in $(x_1,\\dots,x_N)$. In contrast to the 6-vertex\nmodel, where $F^{6{\\rm V}}_S(x_1,\\dots,x_N;z)$ is cast as a sum over the\nsymmetric group $\\mathfrak{S}_N$, the symmetrization formula in the 19-vertex\nmodel is over a larger set of objects that we define; we call these objects\n2-permutations.\n  As a byproduct of the proof of our symmetrization formula, we obtain explicit\nformulas for the monodromy matrix elements of the 19-vertex model in a basis\nthat renders them totally spatially symmetric.\n",
