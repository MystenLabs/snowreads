This paper introduces a weighted Hankel-based spectral\nmethod with a reweighting strategy to enhance robustness with regard to noise\nand reduce unreliable acoustic parameter estimates. Additionally, we derive,\nfor the first time in QAM, Cram\\'er-Rao bounds to establish theoretical\nperformance benchmarks for acoustic parameter estimation. Simulations and\nexperimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently\noutperform standard autoregressive approach, particularly under challenging\nconditions. These advancements promise to improve the accuracy and reliability\nof tissue characterization, enhancing the potential of QAM for biomedical\napplications.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"-PHGpLpCIGhukj19U16erTVlTAmM3Mz3cNZoZxcaPPA","pdfSize":"1807817"}
