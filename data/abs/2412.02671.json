It is a compelling question that human beings have confronted\nfor centuries. The search for extraterrestrial life is a broad range of quests\nfor finding simple forms of life up to intelligent beings in the Universe. The\nplausible assumption is that there is a chance that intelligent life will be\nfollowed by advanced civilization equipped or even dominated by artificial\nintelligence (AI). In this work, we categorize advanced civilizations (on an\nequal footing, an AI-dominated civilization) on the Kardashev scale. We propose\na new scale known as the space exploration distance to measure civilization\nadvancement. We propose a relation between this length and the Kardashev scale.\nThen, we suggest the idea that advanced civilizations will use primordial black\nholes (PBHs) as sources of harvesting energy. We calculate the energy harvested\nby calculating the space exploration distance. Finally, we propose an\nobservational method to detect the possibility of extraterrestrial AI using\nDyson sphere-like structures around PBHs in the Milky Way and other galaxies.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/Popular Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"K3E6XDER7g4qKxkZtnA7xVimK6XP-KGe1_ZdSZLdNB4","pdfSize":"517600"}
