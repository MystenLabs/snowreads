Existing studies are\nmainly based on a one-shot approach, which lacks a coherent projection ability\nfrom the RF domain. Additionally, the spatio-temporal patterns have not been\nfully explored for human motion dynamics in HSS. Therefore, we propose a\ntwo-stage Sequential Diffusion Model (SDM) to progressively synthesize\nhigh-quality segmentation jointly with the considerations on motion dynamics.\nCross-view transformation blocks are devised to guide the diffusion model in a\nmulti-scale manner for comprehensively characterizing human related patterns in\nan individual frame such as directional projection from signal planes.\nMoreover, spatio-temporal blocks are devised to fine-tune the frame-level model\nto incorporate spatio-temporal contexts and motion dynamics, enhancing the\nconsistency of the segmentation maps. Comprehensive experiments on a public\nbenchmark -- HIBER demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method\nwith an IoU 0.732.
