However, even for a small\nnumber of blocks, there exist a vast number of possible configurations that are\nplausible, stable, and with varying degree of order. The ability to dynamically\nshift between multi-stable patterns (i.e., reprogram the self-assembly) entails\nnavigating an intractable search space, which remains a challenge. In this\npaper, we engineer the self-assembly of macroscopic magnetic particles to\ncreate metamaterials with dynamically reversible emergent phases. We utilize a\nboundary composed of magnetic hinges to confine free-floating magnetic disks\ninto different stable assemblies. We exploit the non-destructive nature of the\nmagnetic boundaries to create re-programmable two-dimensional metamaterials\nthat morphs from crystalline to quasi-crystalline to disordered assembly using\nthe same number of disks and boundary. Furthermore, we explore their utility to\ncontrol the propagation of sound waves in an effectively undamped media with\nrich nonlinearities. Our findings can expand the metamaterials horizon into\nfunctional and tunable devices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PezIXicRSfJPerOJmUuSznvxr0aMUiP20SaVzrV8Opw","pdfSize":"6981599"}
