When dealing with the thermodynamic quantities and\nthe gap equation, three schemes can be chosen, namely magnetic\nfield-independent regularization, soft cut-off regularization, and\nPauli-Villars regularization. These three regularization schemes have different\ninfluences on the properties of thermomagnetic quark matter, and different\nchoices of regularization schemes will also lead to different effects in the\ncalculation of the properties of thermomagnetic quark matter.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"uOrZrAVa5ws1cizS-yVs9MrwscqFJVGKukvu_YPzh1U","pdfSize":"660862"}
