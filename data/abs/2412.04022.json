  "abstract": "  $2\\times2$ matrix polynomials of the form $P_{n}(z)=\n\\Sigma^{n}_{j=0}\\,\\sigma_{j}\\,z^{j}$, for the cases $n=1,2,3$ are constructed,\nand the nature of PT-symmetry is examined across different points $z=(x,y)$ in\nthe complex plane. The PT-symmetric properties of $P_{n}(z)$ can be\ncharacterized by two functions, denoted by $s(x,y)$ and $h(x,y)$. If the trace\nof the matrix polynomial is real, then the points at which it can exhibit\nPT-symmetry are defined by the family of curves $s(x,y)=0$. Additionally, at\npoints where the function $h(x,y)\\geq 0$, the matrix polynomial exhibits\nunbroken PT-symmetry; otherwise, it exhibits broken PT-symmetry. The\nintersection points of the curves $s(x,y)=0$ and $h(x,y)=k$, for a given $k\\in\n\\mathbb{R}$, are shown to lie on an ellipse, hyperbola, two lines passing\nthrough the origin, or a straight line, depending on the nature of PT-symmetry\nof the matrix polynomial. The PT-symmetric behaviour of $P_{n}(z)$ at the zeros\nof the matrix polynomial is also studied.\n",
