We use\na pointmap-based geometric representation in a multiview image format to\ncoordinate the generation of multiple target views simultaneously. We\nfacilitate correspondence between views by assuming fixed target camera poses\nrelative to the source camera, and constructing a predictable distribution of\ngeometric features per target. Our modular, geometry-driven approach to\nnovel-view synthesis (called \"unPIC\") beats SoTA baselines such as CAT3D and\nOne-2-3-45 on held-out objects from ObjaverseXL, as well as real-world objects\nranging from Google Scanned Objects, Amazon Berkeley Objects, to the Digital\nTwin Catalog.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qHjDo52SgTJj4ThbPmsmwfZ_MbMBNwv0F4bqv0NsMZg","pdfSize":"41997038"}
