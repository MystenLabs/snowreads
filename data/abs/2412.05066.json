Unlike prior works, we do not rely\non a reference grasp, a coarse hand trajectory, or separate modes for grasping\nand articulating. To achieve this, we first generate distance-based contact\nmaps conditioned on the object trajectory with an articulation-aware feature\nrepresentation, revealing rich bimanual patterns for manipulation. The learned\ncontact prior is then used to guide our hand motion generator, producing\ndiverse and realistic bimanual motions for object movement and articulation.\nOur work offers key insights into feature representation and contact prior for\narticulated objects, demonstrating their effectiveness in taming the complex,\nhigh-dimensional space of bimanual hand-object interactions. Through\ncomprehensive quantitative experiments, we demonstrate a clear step towards\nsimplified and high-quality hand-object animations that excel over the\nstate-of-the-art in motion quality and diversity.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Graphics","Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"TDDnkD6_3-QZJgBn_FcCMVdt-3Nn0yg5aqs0Rc0BImY","pdfSize":"43179435"}
