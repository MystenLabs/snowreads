  "abstract": "  We construct a PROP which encodes 2D-TQFTs with a grading. This defines a\ngraded Frobenius algebra as algebras over this PROP. We also give a description\nof graded Frobenius algebras in terms of maps and relations. This structure\nnaturally arises as the cohomology of manifolds, loop homology and Hochschild\nhomology of Frobenius algebras. In addition, we give a comprehensive\ndescription of the signs that arise in suspending algebras over PROPs.\n",
