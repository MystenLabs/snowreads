MIRMOS will perform\nR$\\sim$3700 spectroscopy over a simultaneous wavelength range of 0.886 -\n2.404$\\mu$m (Y,J,H,K bands) in addition to imaging over the range of 0.7 -\n0.886$\\mu$m. The integral field mode of operation for MIRMOS will be achieved\nvia an image slicer style integral field unit (IFU) located on a linear stage\nto facilitate movement into the beam during use or storage while operating in\nmulti-object mode. The IFU will provide a $\\rm \\sim20\"\\times26\"$ field of view\n(FoV) made up of $\\rm0.84\"\\times26\"$ slices. This will be the largest FoV IFS\noperating at these wavelengths from either the ground or space, making MIRMOS\nan ideal instrument for a wide range of science cases including studying the\nhigh redshift circumgalactic medium and emission line tracers from ionized and\nmolecular gas in nearby galaxies. In order to achieve the desired image quality\nand FoV while matching the focal ratio to the multi-object mode, our slicer\ndesign makes use of novel freeform surfaces for the pupil mirrors, which\nrequire the use of high precision multi-axis diamond milling to manufacture. We\npresent here the optical design and predicted performance of the MIRMOS IFU\nalong with a conceptual design for the opto-mechanical system.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8YtQO9Y95i6m2J0bGpJ7M2ogFzm0beh1_EETQ9KY_0M","pdfSize":"2250210","objectId":"0x8a2fba55ff67870ed9e5478b455f5e05146ff2dbb792c6e939dc5743eaabbb4a","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
