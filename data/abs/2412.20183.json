The MscaleFNO consists\nof a series of parallel normal FNOs with scaled input of the function and the\nspatial variable, and their outputs are shown to be able to capture various\nhigh-frequency components of the mapping's image. Numerical methods demonstrate\nthe substantial improvement of the MscaleFNO for the problem of wave scattering\nin the high-frequency regime over the normal FNO with a similar number of\nnetwork parameters.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GWdZV5n9vA1DhDT8N0nugaYC965aZEEG66ldZnfot-c","pdfSize":"1897099"}
