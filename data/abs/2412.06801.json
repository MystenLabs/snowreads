Our design eliminates the need for grating couplers,\ncommonly required for dual-axis beam steering, thereby reducing energy losses\ndue to substrate leakage. It also features the unique capability of achieving a\npositive or negative phase slope profile. This three-dimensional architecture\nenhances output efficiency by emitting light from the device edge, providing\ngreater flexibility and improved performance in beam steering. This approach\nopens up new possibilities for on-chip photonic systems, enabling faster, more\naccurate, and broader beam steering range.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"sWneXEPofSSp5qYBl3A-JcxZQEjsyhP0KpLH6oU9uF8","pdfSize":"791055"}
