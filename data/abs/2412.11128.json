  "abstract": "  For an open quantum system described by the Lindblad equation, full\ncharacterization of its dynamics typically needs the knowledge of the\nLiouvillian spectrum and correlation functions. Solving the Liouvillian\nspectrum and correlation functions are usually formidable tasks, and most\nprevious studies are constrained to simple models and lower-order correlations.\nIn this work, we derive a closed form of dynamical recursion equations for all\neven-order correlation functions associated with the quadratic Liouvillian\nsuperoperator, thus extending the Wick's theorem and enabling the\nreconstruction of the corresponding Liouvillian spectrum. Furthermore, we study\nthe quartic Liouvillian superoperator, establishing the necessary and\nsufficient conditions for the closure of second-order correlation functions.\nBuilding on this, the dynamical expressions for even-order correlation\nfunctions under quadratic dissipation are derived, culminating in a method for\nconstructing the Liouvillian spectrum in this extended framework.\n",
