One way to avoid\nthis bound is to open a new annihilation channel for DM with a scalar field\nthat breaks the lepton number spontaneously. This introduces a physical\nGoldstone boson $a$, which can constitute a light relic and opens up the lepton\nflavor violating channel $\\mu\\rightarrow e a$. In this work, we introduce a\nmodel that contains the new annihilation channel for fermionic dark matter but\navoids the introduction of the Goldstone by using a discrete $\\mathbb{Z}_4$\ninstead of a continuous symmetry. In this way, cosmological constraints on the\nlight relic and experimental limits on lepton flavor violating decays to the\nGoldstone are avoided. We analyze the experimental viability of the model,\nidentifying the region of parameter space where lepton flavor violating\nconstraints are not saturated, DM has the correct relic density, and DM direct\ndetection experiments are sensitive to the DM candidate.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zxoQLSv0A2dYQnpMzmJAGImVbr37EkCsoLhV7tdeWHQ","pdfSize":"3299464","objectId":"0x51f944a86433db438002430d3ae022ed8eb660488e38edc5806fbdf91a2ac6ba","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
