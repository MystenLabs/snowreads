To streamline this process, this paper\nproposes adding a faceted search interface to PubMed. Faceted search is a\ncommon feature on e-commerce websites that allows users to filter search\nresults by selecting different fields. By incorporating this technology, not\nonly can physicians save time and improve the accuracy of their literature\nsearches, but also presenting search results in this way makes patterns emerge,\nwhich can suggest new treatment options for a given pathology (including\npatients with genetically altered tumors).\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Digital Libraries"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"uFjdgLZ_Z1tHv7GqnilcVU3MvLk1DthwRorFwpf0WdA","pdfSize":"608432"}
