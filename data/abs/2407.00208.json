These algebras embrace various generalisations of Leavitt path\nalgebras. A Bergman presentation can be visualised by a Bergman graph, which is\na finite bicoloured hypergraph satisfying two conditions. We define several\nmoves for Bergman graphs and prove that they preserve the isomorphism class\n(respectively the Morita equivalence class) of the corresponding Bergman\nalgebra. One recovers the well-known results, that in the context of finite\ndirected graphs the shift move, outsplitting, insplitting, source elimination\nand collapsing preserve the isomorphism class (respectively the Morita\nequivalence class) of the corresponding Leavitt path algebra. Moreover, we\nmention some connections between Tietze transformations and the moves for\nBergman graphs defined in this paper.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"RdHX-Sf-qj395SxlsX0JRV5Gsh4MwcMnQXm0xqRAFQk","pdfSize":"417381"}
