Along with anti-self-dual Yang-Mills and\nfour-dimensional Chern-Simons, this gives rise to a diamond correspondence of\ntheories. In this work we extend this framework to incorporate models realised\nthrough gaugings. As well as describing a higher-dimensional origin of coset\nCFTs, by choosing the details of the reduction from higher dimensions, we\nobtain rich classes of two-dimensional integrable models including homogeneous\nsine-Gordon models and generalisations that are new to the literature.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wipTuW8SDHTT7KF2rEEQS6plwWq2etxcha56mQb6-Vs","pdfSize":"569103","objectId":"0x2cf6416a927d8b788d667ec75930c7357401bc01dc23328594397edac7829367","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
