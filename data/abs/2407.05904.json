In the spirit of Bergeron and Sottile, we\nuse the Bruhat order to give $(n-1)!$ different combinatorial formulas for the\nSchubert polynomial of a permutation in $S_n$. By work of Lenart and Sottile,\none extreme of the formulas recover the classical Pipedream (PD) formula. We\nprove the other extreme corresponds to Bumpless pipedreams (BPDs). We give two\napplications of this perspective to view BPDs: Using the Fomin-Kirrilov\nalgebra, we solve the problem of finding a BPD analogue of Fomin and Stanley's\nalgebraic construction on PDs; We also establish a bijection between PDs and\nBPDs using Lenart's growth diagram, which conjectually agrees with the existing\nbijection of Gao and Huang.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xcLIMtWX2-XJMTIQe0ycR21vXKdKkhR2HoXvTLD21J4","pdfSize":"443857"}
