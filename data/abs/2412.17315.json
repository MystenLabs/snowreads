GitHub issue resolving is a key challenge among these\ntasks. While recent approaches have made progress on this task, they focus on\ntextual data within issues, neglecting visual data. However, this visual data\nis crucial for resolving issues as it conveys additional knowledge that text\nalone cannot. We propose CodeV, the first approach to leveraging visual data to\nenhance the issue-resolving capabilities of LLMs. CodeV resolves each issue by\nfollowing a two-phase process: data processing and patch generation. To\nevaluate CodeV, we construct a benchmark for visual issue resolving, namely\nVisual SWE-bench. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the\neffectiveness of CodeV, as well as provide valuable insights into leveraging\nvisual data to resolve GitHub issues.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Software Engineering","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fL0jNYt_jJs8Ms14ekrXL7letwtrIbfQSu4nTc6fUvs","pdfSize":"5545522"}
