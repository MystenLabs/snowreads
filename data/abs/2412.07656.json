  "abstract": "  Human interactions and mobility shape epidemic dynamics by facilitating\ndisease outbreaks and their spatial spread across regions. Traditional models\noften isolate commuting and random mobility as separate behaviors, focusing\neither on short, recurrent trips or on random, exploratory movements. Here, we\npropose a unified formalism that allows a smooth transition between commuting\nand exploratory behavior based on travel and return probabilities. We derive an\nanalytical expression for the epidemic threshold, revealing a non-monotonic\ndependence on recurrence rates: while recurrence tends to lower the threshold\nby increasing agent concentration in high-contact hubs, it counterintuitively\nraises the invasion threshold in low-mobility scenarios, suggesting that\nallowing recurrence may foster local outbreaks while suppressing global\nepidemics. These results provide a comprehensive understanding of the interplay\nbetween human mobility patterns and epidemic spread, with implications for\ncontainment strategies in structured populations.\n",
