  "abstract": "  We present certain general structures related to the solutions of Painlev\\'e\nequation II and to the solutions of the differential equation satisfied by the\ncorresponding Hamiltonian equations, together with the tau functions. By taking\nadvantage of the B\\\"acklund transformations we find a linear differential\nequation satisfied by the tau functions and explicit rational expressions\nlinking the solutions of Painlev\\'e equation II, Painlev\\'e equation XXXIV and\nthe Hamiltonians with the tau functions. Also, recursions for the tau functions\nand the Hamiltonians will be given. Through the use of suitable parameters\ninserted into the equations, we consider a degenerate case solvable in terms of\nWeierstrass elliptic functions. The Yablonskii-Vorob'ev polynomials, the\nAiry-type solutions and the more general transcendental case are all described\nin separated Sections. Finally, certain integral relations are given.\n",
