A prevalent approach in the field is to combine graph convolutional\nnetworks and multi-head attention mechanisms for spatio-temporal processing.\nThis paper proposes a wavelet-based temporal attention model, namely a\nwavelet-based dynamic spatio-temporal aware graph neural network (W-DSTAGNN),\nfor tackling the traffic forecasting problem. Benchmark experiments using\nseveral statistical metrics confirm that our proposal efficiently captures\nspatio-temporal correlations and outperforms ten state-of-the-art models on\nthree different real-world traffic datasets. Our proposed ensemble data-driven\nmethod can handle dynamic temporal and spatial dependencies and make long-term\nforecasts in an efficient manner.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XrLF6W9fQdQjYp3k9aHaU66j2hMVnq-g0NJ-6uDUVoo","pdfSize":"450103"}
