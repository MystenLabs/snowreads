  "abstract": "  Let $C_\\ell/\\mathbb Q$ denote the curve with affine model\n$y^\\ell=x(x^\\ell-1)$, where $\\ell\\geq 3$ is prime. In this paper we study the\nlimiting distributions of the normalized $L$-polynomials of the curves by\ncomputing their Sato-Tate groups and distributions. We also provide results for\nthe number of points on the curves over finite fields, including a formula in\nterms of Jacobi sums when the field $\\mathbb F_q$ satisfies $q\\equiv 1\n\\pmod{\\ell^2}$.\n",
