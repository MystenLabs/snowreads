Our\naim is to provide a complete analysis of the continuous dependence of solutions\non the fractional order $\\alpha.$ We first provide optimal estimates for the\nstrong and weak distances between two solutions with different fractional\norders. We then describe the exact asymptotic behavior of these distances.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"wRAwYc4Zj8j3WXQM1pbN203TCb8BPXJg8-5dtDF06Hw","pdfSize":"294797"}
