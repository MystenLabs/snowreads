  "abstract": "  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been successfully utilized in the\nmedical diagnosis of many illnesses. Nevertheless, identifying the optimal\narchitecture and hyperparameters among the available possibilities might be a\nsubstantial challenge. Typically, CNN hyperparameter selection is performed\nmanually. Nonetheless, this is a computationally costly procedure, as numerous\nrounds of hyperparameter settings must be evaluated to determine which produces\nthe best results. Choosing the proper hyperparameter settings has always been a\ncrucial and challenging task, as it depends on the researcher's knowledge and\nexperience. This study will present work done in recent years on the usage of\nmetaheuristic optimization algorithms in the CNN optimization process. It looks\nat a number of recent studies that focus on the use of optimization methods to\noptimize hyperparameters in order to find high-performing CNNs. This helps\nresearchers figure out how to set hyperparameters efficiently.\n",
