Based on\nensembles with three flavours of dynamical domain wall fermions with lattice\nspacings in the range 0.11 -- 0.08 fm, we demonstrate that the mass scale which\ndefines the mSMOM scheme can be chosen such that the extrapolation has\nsignificantly smaller discretisation effects than the SMOM scheme. Converting\nour results to the $\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme we obtain\n$\\overline{m}_c(3\\,\\mathrm{GeV}) = 1.008(13)\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$ and\n$\\overline{m}_c(\\overline{m}_c) = 1.292(12)\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vIyVm0Wvb_2RYv6g2iwBiw0GBvuuV9duH55EBZOEkSY","pdfSize":"1057896","objectId":"0xca90361ba2fbbc7c32e14fc4d40cf501902aa7d798829f91747c0f72d2cf2c9a","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
