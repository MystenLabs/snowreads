Its\nproperties are studied in the context of the moment closure problem arising in\ngas kinetic theory, for which the proposed approach is proven to have multiple\nattractive mathematical properties. Numerical studies are carried out for model\ngas particle distributions and the approach is compared to other moment closure\nmethods, such as Grad's closure and the maximum-entropy method. The proposed\n``Gramian'' closure is shown to provide very accurate results for a wide range\nof distribution functions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XUJdtnU1jY1F0zg8Sh6jPyM5QdTtYvG8nh7hrAANmdA","pdfSize":"1663616"}
