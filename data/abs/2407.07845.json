We identify sufficient conditions\nfor these mechanisms to be incentive-compatible and efficient as the LLM being\na good enough world model and a strong inter-agent information\nover-determination condition. We show situations where these LM-based\nmechanisms can successfully aggregate information in signal structures on which\nprediction markets fail.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"AauZhPheGr8tJ5aZsj3oBq0ZI2c9ArIbb1YfazE1Pnk","pdfSize":"143439"}
