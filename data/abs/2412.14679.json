  "abstract": "  This paper rigorously and concisely defines, in the context of our\n(Elementary) Mathematical Data Model ((E)MDM), the mathematical concepts of\nself-map, composite mapping, totality, one-to-oneness, non-primeness, ontoness,\nbijectivity, default value, (null-)reflexivity, irreflexivity, (null-)symmetry,\nasymmetry, (null-)idempotency, anti-idempotency, (null-)equivalence,\nacyclicity, (null-)representative system mapping, the properties that relate\nthem, and the corresponding corollaries on the coherence and minimality of sets\nmade of such mapping properties viewed as database constraints. Its main\ncontribution is the pseudocode algorithm used by MatBase, our intelligent\ndatabase management system prototype based on both (E)MDM, the relational, and\nthe entity-relationship data models, for enforcing self-map, atomic, and\ncomposite mapping constraint sets. We prove that this algorithm guarantees the\nsatisfiability, coherence, and minimality of such sets, while being very fast,\nsound, complete, and minimal. In the sequel, we also presented the relevant\nMatBase user interface as well as the tables of its metacatalog used by this\nalgorithm.\n",
