  "abstract": "  Digitalization of credit scoring is an essential requirement for financial\norganizations and commercial banks, especially in the context of digital\ntransformation. Machine learning techniques are commonly used to evaluate\ncustomers' creditworthiness. However, the predicted outcomes of machine\nlearning models can be biased toward protected attributes, such as race or\ngender. Numerous fairness-aware machine learning models and fairness measures\nhave been proposed. Nevertheless, their performance in the context of credit\nscoring has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we present a\ncomprehensive experimental study of fairness-aware machine learning in credit\nscoring. The study explores key aspects of credit scoring, including financial\ndatasets, predictive models, and fairness measures. We also provide a detailed\nevaluation of fairness-aware predictive models and fairness measures on widely\nused financial datasets.\n",
