This documents provides a\nhigh-level overview of how the energy footprint of a software system can be\nestimated to support Green Software Development. We introduce basic concepts in\nthe area, highlight methodological issues that must be accounted for when\nconducting experiments, discuss trade-offs associated with different estimation\napproaches, and make some practical considerations. This document aims to be a\nstarting point for researchers who want to begin conducting work in this area.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Performance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"QD8rKd3SuzYlD_lN121SwVhYETSWmC9jM_y9L5pkhm4","pdfSize":"1898016"}
