The AHE and the ferromagnetic spin moment share the\nsame symmetry and hence are usually proportional. However, density functional\ntheory (DFT) calculations find that the AHE exists with negligible\nferromagnetic spin moment for some compounds, whereas it reaches sizable values\nfor other altermagnets. By examining realistic minimal models for\naltermagnetism in which the DFT phenomenology is captured, we uncover a general\nSOC-enabled quasi-symmetry that provides a natural explanation for the\namplitude of the ferromagnetic spin moment across the vast range of different\naltermagnetic materials. Additionally, we derive analytic expressions for the\nmagnetic anisotropy energy, providing a simple means to identify the preferred\nN\\'eel vector orientation for altermagnets.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fovYVubplYhulm4YV6zacoI8Jc2tRJOY4XXO8HHdOG0","pdfSize":"1892429"}
