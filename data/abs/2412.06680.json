The goal is to\nelucidate how electron dynamics affect the kinetic energy, angular\ndistribution, and final velocities of ejected ions. The results indicate that\nquantum effects result in lower kinetic energies all ions, deviating from\nclassical predictions. Furthermore, quantum simulations exhibit broader angular\ndistributions and more diverse ion trajectories, aligning closely with\nexperimental observations. The research also highlights the role of laser\nintensity and the resultant ionization in enhancing quantum effects,\nparticularly in modifying ion velocities and distributions. These findings\nprovide a deeper understanding of the role of electron dynamics in Coulomb\nexplosions, offering valuable insights for both experimental and theoretical\nstudies of molecular fragmentation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dbgQ3RkF61rtf1lnISRcijCEC2L46JIDxKq89zJxMvQ","pdfSize":"9130532"}
