This degradation negatively affects the\nperformance of autonomous underwater vehicles used in marine applications. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a lightweight phase-based transformer\nnetwork with 1.77M parameters for underwater image restoration (UIR). Our\napproach focuses on effectively extracting non-contaminated features using a\nphase-based self-attention mechanism. We also introduce an optimized phase\nattention block to restore structural information by propagating prominent\nattentive features from the input. We evaluate our method on both synthetic\n(UIEB, UFO-120) and real-world (UIEB, U45, UCCS, SQUID) underwater image\ndatasets. Additionally, we demonstrate its effectiveness for low-light image\nenhancement using the LOL dataset. Through extensive ablation studies and\ncomparative analysis, it is clear that the proposed approach outperforms\nexisting state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"-ibUFL4ds3afqT30mywAPQwNpBDVmjcpDGk7dGVhQd8","pdfSize":"12042442"}
