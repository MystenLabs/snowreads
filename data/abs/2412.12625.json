  "abstract": "  MoodCam introduces a novel method for assessing mood by utilizing facial\naffect analysis through the front-facing camera of smartphones during everyday\nactivities. We collected facial behavior primitives during 15,995 real-world\nphone interactions involving 25 participants over four weeks. We developed\nthree models for timely intervention: momentary, daily average, and next day\naverage. Notably, our models exhibit AUC scores ranging from 0.58 to 0.64 for\nValence and 0.60 to 0.63 for Arousal. These scores are comparable to or better\nthan those from some previous studies. This predictive ability suggests that\nMoodCam can effectively forecast mood trends, providing valuable insights for\ntimely interventions and resource planning in mental health management. The\nresults are promising as they demonstrate the viability of using real-time and\npredictive mood analysis to aid in mental health interventions and potentially\noffer preemptive support during critical periods identified through mood trend\nshifts.\n",
