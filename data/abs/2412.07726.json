Experimental flow\nvisualizations are used to assess the spanwise control authority of the array\nand the three-dimensionality of the flow. Numerical simulations provide\ninsights into the flow structures created by the actuation, and how they evolve\nwith different parameters.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hV2dn1qSl9PIB5GN9Dsck8su6fVahEG79SxBN0hkA6M","pdfSize":"7122878"}
