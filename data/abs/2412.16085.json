In this work, we organized the first international\ncompetition dedicated to promptable medical image segmentation, featuring a\nlarge-scale dataset spanning nine common imaging modalities from over 20\ndifferent institutions. The top teams developed lightweight segmentation\nfoundation models and implemented an efficient inference pipeline that\nsubstantially reduced computational requirements while maintaining\nstate-of-the-art segmentation accuracy. Moreover, the post-challenge phase\nadvanced the algorithms through the design of performance booster and\nreproducibility tasks, resulting in improved algorithms and validated\nreproducibility of the winning solution. Furthermore, the best-performing\nalgorithms have been incorporated into the open-source software with a\nuser-friendly interface to facilitate clinical adoption. The data and code are\npublicly available to foster the further development of medical image\nsegmentation foundation models and pave the way for impactful real-world\napplications.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"e84KlN0JN5jyn_GUNNCeo5vvUJH8JEChNLVRmeA9ntk","pdfSize":"20598682"}
