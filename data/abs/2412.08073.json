  "abstract": "  The aim of multispectral image fusion is to combine object or scene features\nof images with different spectral characteristics to increase the perceptual\nquality. In this paper, we present a novel learning-based solution to image\nfusion problem focusing on infrared and visible spectrum images. The proposed\nsolution utilizes only convolution and pooling layers together with a loss\nfunction using no-reference quality metrics. The analysis is performed\nqualitatively and quantitatively on various datasets. The results show better\nperformance than state-of-the-art methods. Also, the size of our network\nenables real-time performance on embedded devices. Project codes can be found\nat \\url{https://github.com/ferhatcan/pyFusionSR}.\n",
