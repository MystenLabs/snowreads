  "abstract": "  This paper explores the relatively underexplored application of Positive\nUnlabeled (PU) Learning and Negative Unlabeled (NU) Learning in the\ncybersecurity domain. While these semi-supervised learning methods have been\napplied successfully in fields like medicine and marketing, their potential in\ncybersecurity remains largely untapped. The paper identifies key areas of\ncybersecurity--such as intrusion detection, vulnerability management, malware\ndetection, and threat intelligence--where PU/NU learning can offer significant\nimprovements, particularly in scenarios with imbalanced or limited labeled\ndata. We provide a detailed problem formulation for each subfield, supported by\nmathematical reasoning, and highlight the specific challenges and research gaps\nin scaling these methods to real-time systems, addressing class imbalance, and\nadapting to evolving threats. Finally, we propose future directions to advance\nthe integration of PU/NU learning in cybersecurity, offering solutions that can\nbetter detect, manage, and mitigate emerging cyber threats.\n",
