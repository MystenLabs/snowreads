An open conjecture of\nNevo and Peeva states that $I(G)^q$ has linear resolution for $q\\gg 0$. We\npresent a promising approach to this challenging conjecture by investigating\nthe stronger property of linear quotients. Specifically, we make the conjecture\nthat if $I(G)^q$ has linear quotients for some integer $q\\geq 1$, then\n$I(G)^{s}$ has linear quotients for all $s\\geq q$. We give a partial solution\nto this conjecture, and identify conditions under which only finitely many\npowers need to be checked. It is known that if $G$ does not contain a cricket,\na diamond, or a $C_4$, then $I(G)^q$ has linear resolution for $q \\geq 2$. We\nconstruct a family of gapfree graphs $G$ containing cricket, diamond, $C_4$\ntogether with $C_5$ as induced subgraphs of $G$ for which $I(G)^q$ has linear\nquotients for $q \\ge 2$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YVPzs77aeDXtnqlsoghCYoo1zxr-9_55ZRlBjbJ-TNM","pdfSize":"318784"}
