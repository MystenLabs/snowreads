Most\nof the past and present models are considering proton or iron as their main\ncourier. Some attention has been paid to the role of the UHECR light nuclei in\nrecent years. We update here the lightest nuclei UHECR model, able to explain\nthe nearest AGN or Star Burst sources with the few observed Hot Spot clustering\nin AUGER and TA array data. Any additional components of the heaviest nuclei\nwith the highest energy, more bent and smeared, may also fit recent AUGER and\nTA homogeneous records at those energy edges.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hk6WPZcBUw6NxsSZjvp2BEyowF1oeh1N1uQrYiguC5A","pdfSize":"4575952"}
