In this work, we show that state-of-the-art techniques\nwork by minimizing an approximation of a one-sided Chamfer distance. This shape\nmetric is not symmetric, as it only ensures that the point cloud is near the\nsurface but not vice versa. As a consequence, existing methods can produce\ninaccurate reconstructions with spurious surfaces. Although one approach\nagainst spurious surfaces has been widely used in the literature, we\ntheoretically and experimentally show that it is equivalent to regularizing the\nsurface area, resulting in over-smoothing. As a more appealing alternative, we\npropose DiffCD, a novel loss function corresponding to the symmetric Chamfer\ndistance. In contrast to previous work, DiffCD also assures that the surface is\nnear the point cloud, which eliminates spurious surfaces without the need for\nadditional regularization. We experimentally show that DiffCD reliably recovers\na high degree of shape detail, substantially outperforming existing work across\nvarying surface complexity and noise levels.
