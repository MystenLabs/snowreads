The spin-projected\nconstrained-unrestricted Hartree-Fock (SPcUHF) method restores the broken spin\nsymmetry inherent in spin-constrained-UHF determinants by employing a\nnon-orthogonal Configuration Interaction (NOCI) projection method. This method\nincludes all possible configurations in spin space compatible with a\nClebsch-Gordon recoupling scheme in a NOCI calculation. The tunable\none-pair-at-a-time characteristics of the symmetry-breaking process in c-UHF\nallow us to reduce the computational costs of full projection. SPcUHF is tested\non 4-, 6-, and 8-electron systems that exhibit dominant static and/or dynamic\ncorrelations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-W26c0E9JYSCG3Ts6zRqM-8VOynaj112db0GtthQi-I","pdfSize":"1257660"}
