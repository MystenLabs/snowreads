It employs a self-supervised learning approach to label radio\nfrequency (RF) data with the locations of blockage-causing objects extracted\nfrom light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, which is then used to train a\ndeep learning model that predicts object`s location only using RF data. Then,\nthe predicted location is utilized to predict blockages, enabling adaptability\nwithout retraining when transmitter-receiver positions change. Evaluations\ndemonstrate up to 74% accuracy in predicting blockage locations in dynamic\nenvironments, showcasing the robustness of the proposed solution.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"kOS7J7TJgDYz1LrPmL0crYEJJ11JZi5XXeK9LOsje-c","pdfSize":"1343258"}
