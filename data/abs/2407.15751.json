It is assumed that the spectrum of ${\\bf P}^\\dagger{\\bf\nQ}{\\bf P}$ lies within the interval $[z^-,z^+]$ for some known $z^+\\leq 1$ and\n$z^-\\geq 0$ and that the actions of the projections ${\\bf Q}$ and ${\\bf P}{\\bf\nP}^\\dagger$ are easy to compute. The series converges in the entire $z$-plane\nexcluding the cut $[z^-,z^+]$. It is obtained using subspace substitution,\nwhere the desired resolvent is tied to a resolvent in a larger space and ${\\bf\nQ}$ gets replaced by a projection $\\underline{{\\bf Q}}$ that is no longer\northogonal. When $z$ is real the rate of convergence of the new method matches\nthat of the conjugate gradient method.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NxuG9ov5RdHiakswORF1aff-CIhMEhgVIG2AoMbeYg4","pdfSize":"234862","objectId":"0x1c48f8fda0825c24bedb67d507750119ced680023b16d31eff44e5cd3b1812ba","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
