Therefore, long-range interactions are not used in 3D to the extent done\nin 2D and the strength of transformers is not realized. We propose a\nmulti-scale transformer-based model based on hierarchical attention blocks\ncombined with carrier tokens at multiple scales to overcome this. Here\ninformation from larger regions at coarse resolution is sequentially carried on\nto finer-resolution regions to predict the super-resolved image. Using\ntransformer layers at each resolution, our coarse-to-fine modeling limits the\nnumber of tokens at each scale and enables attention over larger regions than\nwhat has previously been possible. We experimentally compare our method,\nMTVNet, against state-of-the-art volumetric super-resolution models on five 3D\ndatasets demonstrating the advantage of an increased receptive field. This\nadvantage is especially pronounced for images that are larger than what is seen\nin popularly used 3D datasets.
