  "abstract": "  For many purposes, classical plasma dynamics models can work surprisingly\nwell even for strong electromagnetic fields, approaching the Schwinger critical\nfields, and high frequencies, approaching the Compton frequency. However, the\napplicability of classical models tends to depend rather sensitively on the\ndetails of the problem. In the present paper, we study the specific case of\nplasma oscillations to draw a line between the classical and quantum\nrelativistic regimes. Due to the field geometry of study, mechanisms like\nradiation reaction and Breit-Wheeler pair production, which tend to be\nimportant for electromagnetic fields, are rather effectively suppressed.\nMoreover, we find that the polarization current due to the electron spin is\ngenerally negligible for frequencies below the Compton frequency, compared to\nthe free current, whose magnitude is well-approximated by the classical Vlasov\ntheory. However, we show that pair creation due to the Schwinger mechanism can\nsometimes be important for surprisingly modest field strengths, of the order of\n10 % of the critical field or even smaller. A rough guideline for when the\nclassical Vlasov theory can be applied is given\n",
