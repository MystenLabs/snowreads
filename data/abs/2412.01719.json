Despite their\npotential, the security of smart contracts remains a critical concern due to\ntheir immutability and transparency, which expose them to malicious actors. The\nconnections of contracts further complicate vulnerability detection. This paper\npresents a systematic literature review that explores vulnerabilities in\nEthereum smart contracts, focusing on automated detection tools and benchmark\nevaluation. We reviewed 1,888 studies from five digital libraries and five\nmajor software engineering conferences, applying a structured selection process\nthat resulted in 131 high-quality studies. The key results include a\nhierarchical taxonomy of 101 vulnerabilities grouped into ten categories, a\ncomprehensive list of 144 detection tools with corresponding functionalities,\nmethods, and code transformation techniques, and a collection of 102 benchmarks\nused for tool evaluation. We conclude with insights on the current state of\nEthereum smart contract security and directions for future research.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pHG0ecjBbYTsmt1vvEhqNxlcsorgkig1i-jnNU0F8v0","pdfSize":"1698190"}
