Rooted in the JAX ecosystem, it provides a versatile framework for\nefficiently prototyping real-problems, while easily allowing extensions to\nspecific needs. Furthermore, the implementation leverages existing popular JAX\nlibraries such as equinox and optax for model definition and optimisation,\nbringing a sense of familiarity to the user. Many models are available as\nbaselines, and the documentation provides reference implementations of\ndifferent use-cases along with step-by-step tutorials for extensions to\nspecific needs.
