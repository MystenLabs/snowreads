We discover the stringy\nscaling behavior of these HSSA. It is found that for HSSA with more than 2\ntransverse directions, the degree of stringy scaling dimM2 decreases comparing\nto the degree of stringy scaling dimM1 of the n-1 tachyons and 1 tensor HSSA\ncalculated previously. Moreover, we propose a set of K-identities which is the\nkey to demonstrate the stringy scaling behavior of HSSA. We explicitly prove\nboth the diagonal and off-diagonal K-identities for the 4-point HSSA and give\nnumerical proofs of these K-identities for some higher point HSSA.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"hZrAnlOpHsnknoMNY5glLpx5W6ZRj_2Nx-FfcBFN7UA","pdfSize":"266653"}
