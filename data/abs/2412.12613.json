  "abstract": "  We report pulse energy scaling enabled by the use of Laguerre-Gaussian\nsingle-vortex ($\\text{LG}_{0,l}$) beams for spectral broadening in a sub-40 cm\nlong Herriott-type bulk multi-pass cell. Beams with orders ${l= 1-3}$ are\ngenerated by a spatial light modulator, which facilitates rapid and precise\nreconfiguration of the experimental conditions. 180 fs pulses with 610 uJ pulse\nenergy are post-compressed to 44 fs using an $\\text{LG}_{0,3}$ beam, boosting\nthe peak power of an Ytterbium laser system from 2.5 GW to 9.1 GW. The spatial\nhomogeneity of the output $\\text{LG}_{0,l}$ beams is quantified and the\ntopological charge is spectrally-resolved and shown to be conserved after\ncompression by employing a custom spatio-temporal coupling measurement setup.\n",
