This\nobject corresponds to a simple closed curve under the equivalence between the\nperfect derived category of the graded gentle algebra and the partially wrapped\nFukaya category of the associated graded marked surface, as established by\nHaiden, Katzarkov and Kontsevich.\n  We describe this localization as a recollement that involves the derived\ncategory of a new graded algebra given by quiver and relations. This leads us\nto the introduction of the class of graded pinched gentle algebras, a\ngeneralization of graded gentle algebras. We then show that these algebras are\nin bijection with graded marked surfaces with conical singularities. Moreover,\nunder this correspondence the localization process amounts to the contraction\nof the closed curve.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"W5iusU7oxM6zVLktqE1RhUvJnoNO0cAqUuM9J-hPHeM","pdfSize":"2197824"}
