Although attacks on CMOS dynamic power represent a class of\nstate-of-the-art attacks, many other effects potentially affect the security of\nCMOS chips analogously by affecting mostly static behaviour of the chip,\nincluding aging, ionizing radiation, or non-ionizing illumination of the CMOS.\nVulnerabilities exploiting data dependency in CMOS static power were already\ndemonstrated in practice and the analogous vulnerability exploiting\nlight-modulated static power was demonstrated by simulation. This work confirms\nthe CMOS vulnerability related to the light-modulated data-dependent static\npower experimentally and discusses future work.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"TmVjty6px6kYQ4mXVZS_aNKSfGAxQ2n_D8mnOiS_hVU","pdfSize":"1046263"}
