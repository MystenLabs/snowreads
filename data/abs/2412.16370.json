  "abstract": "  The positional population count operation pospopcnt() counts for an array of\nw-bit words how often each of the w bits was set. Various applications in\nbioinformatics, database engineering, and digital processing exist. Building on\nearlier work by Klarqvist et al., we show how positional population counts can\nbe rapidly computed using SIMD techniques with good performance from the first\nbyte, approaching memory-bound speeds for input arrays of as little as 4 KiB.\nImprovements include an improved algorithm structure, better handling of\nunaligned and very short arrays, as well as faster bit-parallel accumulation of\nintermediate results. We provide a generic algorithm description as well as\nimplementations for various SIMD instruction set extensions, including Intel\nAVX2, AVX-512, and ARM ASIMD, and discuss the adaption of our algorithm to\nother platforms.\n",
