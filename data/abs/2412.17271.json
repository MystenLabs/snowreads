  "abstract": "  Fuzzy Graph Attention Network (FGAT), which combines Fuzzy Rough Sets and\nGraph Attention Networks, has shown promise in tasks requiring robust\ngraph-based learning. However, existing models struggle to effectively capture\ndependencies from multiple perspectives, limiting their ability to model\ncomplex data. To address this gap, we propose the Multi-view Fuzzy Graph\nAttention Network (MFGAT), a novel framework that constructs and aggregates\nmulti-view information using a specially designed Transformation Block. This\nblock dynamically transforms data from multiple aspects and aggregates the\nresulting representations via a weighted sum mechanism, enabling comprehensive\nmulti-view modeling. The aggregated information is fed into FGAT to enhance\nfuzzy graph convolutions. Additionally, we introduce a simple yet effective\nlearnable global pooling mechanism for improved graph-level understanding.\nExtensive experiments on graph classification tasks demonstrate that MFGAT\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring its effectiveness and\nversatility.\n",
