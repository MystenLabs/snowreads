  "abstract": "  The NLLG (Natural Language Learning & Generation) arXiv reports assist in\nnavigating the rapidly evolving landscape of NLP and AI research across cs.CL,\ncs.CV, cs.AI, and cs.LG categories. This fourth installment captures a\ntransformative period in AI history - from January 1, 2023, following ChatGPT's\ndebut, through September 30, 2024. Our analysis reveals substantial new\ndevelopments in the field - with 45% of the top 40 most-cited papers being new\nentries since our last report eight months ago and offers insights into\nemerging trends and major breakthroughs, such as novel multimodal\narchitectures, including diffusion and state space models. Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP; cs.CL) remains the dominant main category in the list of our\ntop-40 papers but its dominance is on the decline in favor of Computer vision\n(cs.CV) and general machine learning (cs.LG). This report also presents novel\nfindings on the integration of generative AI in academic writing, documenting\nits increasing adoption since 2022 while revealing an intriguing pattern:\ntop-cited papers show notably fewer markers of AI-generated content compared to\nrandom samples. Furthermore, we track the evolution of AI-associated language,\nidentifying declining trends in previously common indicators such as \"delve\".\n",
