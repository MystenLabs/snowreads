Despite several challenges, recent models\nhave made remarkable advancements in this task using large language models\n(LLMs). Interestingly, we find that LLM-based models without fine-tuning\nexhibit distinct natures compared to their fine-tuned counterparts, leading to\ninadequacies in current evaluation metrics to accurately convey their\nperformance. Thus, we analyze the two primary metrics, Test Suite Execution\nAccuracy (EXE) and Exact Set Matching Accuracy (ESM), to examine their\nrobustness for this task and address shortcomings. We compare the performance\nof 9 LLM-based models using EXE, the original ESM, and our improved ESM (called\nESM+). Our results show that EXE and ESM have high false positive and negative\nrates of 11.3% and 13.9%, while ESM+ gives those of 0.1% and 2.6% respectively,\nproviding a significantly more stable evaluation. We release the ESM+ script as\nopen-source for the community to contribute, while enjoying a more reliable\nassessment of Text-to-SQL.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"i2KjfhQnh6UHkqKfilra7e1SkET4dMZV_Ml8eZfsHpU","pdfSize":"412765"}
