This paper introduces FedSat,\na novel FL approach designed to tackle various forms of data heterogeneity\nsimultaneously. FedSat employs a cost-sensitive loss function and a prioritized\nclass-based weighted aggregation scheme to address label skewness, missing\nclasses, and quantity skewness across clients. While the proposed\ncost-sensitive loss function enhances model performance on minority classes,\nthe prioritized class-based weighted aggregation scheme ensures client\ncontributions are weighted based on both statistical significance and\nperformance on critical classes. Extensive experiments across diverse\ndata-heterogeneity settings demonstrate that FedSat significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines, with an average improvement of 1.8% over the\nsecond-best method and 19.87% over the weakest-performing baseline. The\napproach also demonstrates faster convergence compared to existing methods.\nThese results highlight FedSat's effectiveness in addressing the challenges of\nheterogeneous federated learning and its potential for real-world applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"xug8Te8fv9_ZZpyEB8V4kBJ6vIfXwjbUVcvQ1PA-NaY","pdfSize":"1682919"}
