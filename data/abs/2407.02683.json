However, event streams, which only encode changes in\nbrightness, do not contain sufficient scene information to support a wide\nvariety of downstream tasks. In this work, we design generalized event cameras\nthat inherently preserve scene intensity in a bandwidth-efficient manner. We\ngeneralize event cameras in terms of when an event is generated and what\ninformation is transmitted. To implement our designs, we turn to single-photon\nsensors that provide digital access to individual photon detections; this\nmodality gives us the flexibility to realize a rich space of generalized event\ncameras. Our single-photon event cameras are capable of high-speed,\nhigh-fidelity imaging at low readout rates. Consequently, these event cameras\ncan support plug-and-play downstream inference, without capturing new event\ndatasets or designing specialized event-vision models. As a practical\nimplication, our designs, which involve lightweight and near-sensor-compatible\ncomputations, provide a way to use single-photon sensors without exorbitant\nbandwidth costs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"w4xorsx_0V9BurGPO1ToXc-gXc95ov-CKq4c1z6dZOE","pdfSize":"37077360"}
