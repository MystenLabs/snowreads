In this work, we propose the Differential\nSpatial-Spectral Transformer (DiffFormer), a novel framework designed to\naddress the inherent challenges of HSIC, such as spectral redundancy and\nspatial discontinuity. The DiffFormer leverages a Differential Multi-Head\nSelf-Attention (DMHSA) mechanism, which enhances local feature discrimination\nby introducing differential attention to accentuate subtle variations across\nneighboring spectral-spatial patches. The architecture integrates\nSpectral-Spatial Tokenization through three-dimensional (3D) convolution-based\npatch embeddings, positional encoding, and a stack of transformer layers\nequipped with the SWiGLU activation function for efficient feature extraction\n(SwiGLU is a variant of the Gated Linear Unit (GLU) activation function). A\ntoken-based classification head further ensures robust representation learning,\nenabling precise labeling of hyperspectral pixels. Extensive experiments on\nbenchmark hyperspectral datasets demonstrate the superiority of DiffFormer in\nterms of classification accuracy, computational efficiency, and\ngeneralizability, compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. In\naddition, this work provides a detailed analysis of computational complexity,\nshowcasing the scalability of the model for large-scale remote sensing\napplications.
