  "abstract": "  We study the modifications to decay amplitudes in heavy to heavy semileptonic\ndecays with multiple hadrons in the final state due to intermediate heavy\nhadrons being off-shell or having a finite width. Combining Heavy Hadron Chiral\nPerturbation Theory (HH$\\chi$PT) with a BCFW on-shell factorization formula, we\nshow that these effects induce $O(1/M)$ corrections to the standard results\ncomputed in the narrow-width approximation and therefore are important in\nextracting form factors from data. A combination of perturbative unitarity,\nanalyticity, and reparameterization invariance fully determine these\ncorrections in terms of known Isgur-Wise functions without the need to\nintroduce new form factors. In doing so, we develop a novel technique to\ncompute the boundary term at complex infinity in the BCFW formula for theories\nwith derivatively coupled scalars. While we have used the $\\bar B\\rightarrow\nD\\pi \\ell\\nu$ decay as an example, these techniques can generally be applied to\neffective field theories with (multiple) distinct reference vectors.\n",
