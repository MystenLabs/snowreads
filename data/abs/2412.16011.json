We study the\nrepresentation of fuzzy surfaces using these techniques. This involves\nconstructing graphs and writing their coordinates and connectivity into\nmatrices. To construct arbitrary graphs and quickly change them, we use 3D\nsoftware. A script generates the three matrices from the graphs. These matrices\nare then processed in Wolfram Mathematica to calculate the zero modes of the\nDirac operator. Our first result shows the quantization of a two-dimensional\nTrefoil knot. Additional examples illustrate various properties and behaviors\nof this process. This helps us to gain a deeper understanding of fuzzy spaces\nand zero-mode surfaces. This work contributes to advancing the understanding of\nvisualization aspects in fuzzy geometry.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"J3wqa3_S1Yo9HhCyDgs7oqIk9fr5criis6F52SYalNg","pdfSize":"1959478"}
