  "abstract": "  The documentation of the Neo-Aramaic dialects before their extinction has\nbeen described as the most urgent task in all of Semitology today. The death of\nthis language will be an unfathomable loss to the descendents of the indigenous\nspeakers of Aramaic, now predominantly diasporic after forced displacement due\nto violence. This paper develops an ASR model to expedite the documentation of\nthis endangered language and generalizes the strategy in a new framework we\ncall NoLoR.\n",
