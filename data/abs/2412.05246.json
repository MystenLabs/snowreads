We show that in a small\ncurvature expansion, properly defined, the amplitudes take the form of a genus\nzero integral given by the Virasoro-Shapiro integrand with the extra insertion\nof single valued multiple polylogarithms. This is the same structure as the one\nfound for the AdS Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude in higher dimensions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Gd2GvBazV06sUA2hQBhnCsuWvDXnbUtFQTvVs7HN9n4","pdfSize":"548715"}
