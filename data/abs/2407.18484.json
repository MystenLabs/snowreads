The continuous model captures the\nongoing interactions between power producers and consumers using differential\nequations, providing insights into long-term trends and steady-state behaviors.\nThe discrete model, suitable for analyzing scenarios where market events occur\nat specific time intervals, incorporates memory effects to account for\nhistorical behaviors and decisions, offering a realistic representation of\nshort-term market dynamics. The fractional-order model introduces fractional\ncalculus to capture memory effects and hereditary properties, enhancing the\nmodel's realism and predictive capability by reflecting the influence of past\nstates on current market behavior.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YpYrl5d9YW9MH4NyYucXZRdZPgXK5y53W5KexwzHAgg","pdfSize":"271095"}
