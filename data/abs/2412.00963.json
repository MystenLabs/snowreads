  "abstract": "  How to handle division in systems that compute with logical formulas\ninvolving what would otherwise be polynomial constraints over the real numbers\nis a surprisingly difficult question. This paper argues that existing\napproaches from both the computer algebra and computational logic communities\nare unsatisfactory for systems that consider the satisfiability of formulas\nwith quantifiers or that perform quantifier elimination. To address this, we\npropose the notion of the fair-satisfiability of a formula, use it to\ncharacterize formulas with divisions that are well-defined, meaning that they\nadequately guard divisions against division by zero, and provide a translation\nalgorithm that converts a formula with divisions into a purely polynomial\nformula that is satisfiable if and only if the original formula is\nfair-satisfiable. This provides a semantics for division with some nice\nproperties, which we describe and prove in the paper.\n",
