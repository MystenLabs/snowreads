The mission is led by the\nEuropean Space Agency (ESA) and SES in collaboration with several European\nNational Space Agencies and private partners. The state-of-the-art QKD system\nwill consist of a payload on board the EAGLE-1 low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite,\noptical ground stations, quantum operational networks, and key management\nsystem. The EAGLE-1 mission represents a major step for next-generation quantum\ncommunication infrastructures, delivering valuable technical results and\nmission data. The Institute of Communications and Navigation (IKN) of the\nGerman Aerospace Center (DLR) is a key partner in the EAGLE-1 mission and is\ninvolved in the research and development of elements in both space and ground\nsegments. Here we report on the development of the QKD transmitter, a vital\npart of the QKD payload, and the customization of the Optical Ground Station\nOberpfaffenhofen (OGS-OP) to conduct the IOT phase of EAGLE-1. For the space\nsegment, DLR-IKN is in charge of the design of the QKD transmitter, including\nthe development of the software and firmware. This transmitter generates\nquantum states which are used to implement a QKD protocol based on an optical\nsignal, that will be transmitted to ground. For the ground segment, The OGS-OP\nwill serve as the in-orbit testing ground station for EAGLE-1. Building upon\nthe expertise with a range of satellites for quantum communication, as well as\nnew implementations, OGS-OP will validate the performance of the payload,\noptical link and QKD system for the first time. We present the main\ndevelopments of OGS-OP for the mission, which includes the implementation of an\nupgraded adaptive optics system to correct for atmospheric distortions and\noptimize the coupling of the incoming light into a single mode optical fiber.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fkdH7JAD4CTwpoLMMQxx9pReqdmoJHE7Wx8far3z75U","pdfSize":"8715490"}
