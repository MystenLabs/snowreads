We compare the BLMMSE with the\noptimal minimum mean squared error (MMSE) channel estimator, which is generally\nnon-linear, and we develop a novel framework based on the orthant probability\nof a multivariate normal distribution to compute the MMSE channel estimate.\nThen, we analyze the equivalence of the MMSE and BLMMSE channel estimators\nunder specific assumptions on the channel correlation or pilot symbols.\nInterestingly, the BLMMSE channel estimator turns out to be optimal in several\nspecific cases. Our study culminates with the presentation of a necessary and\nsufficient condition for the BLMMSE channel estimator to be optimal.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0wZK6TyuHgo7VrbBIAQW8DgcZcS1RpcB3U5xTQsqvXI","pdfSize":"199137"}
