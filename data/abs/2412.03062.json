We are carrying out the Galactic Plane Pulsar Snapshot survey (GPPS)\nby using the the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST).\nHere we present the Keplerian parameters for 116 newly discovered pulsars in\nthe FAST GPPS survey, and obtain timing solutions for 29 pulsars. Companions of\nthese pulsars are He white dwarfs, CO/ONe white dwarfs, neutron stars, main\nsequence stars and ultra light objects or even planets. Our observations\nuncover eclipses of 8 binary systems. The optical counterpart for the companion\nof PSR J1908+1036 is identified. The Post-Keplerian parameter $\\dot{\\omega}$\nfor the double neutron star systems PSR J0528+3529 and J1844-0128 have been\nmeasured, with which the total masses of the binary systems are determined.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"3fSg7STXIkqOCeRVSzRrZxoDrGtk2kTtvWBjnRmnn8w","pdfSize":"4863392"}
