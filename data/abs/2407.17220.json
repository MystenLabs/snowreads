In this work, we investigate the weighted degree and connection\nlength distributions of the KKI-113 and KKI-18 human connectomes, the fruit\nfly, and of the mouse retina. We found that the node strength (weighted degree)\ndistribution behavior differs depending on the considered scale. On the global\nscale, the distributions are found to follow a power-law behavior, with a\nroughly universal exponent close to 3. However, this behavior breaks at the\nlocal scale as the node strength distributions of the KKI-18 follow a stretched\nexponential, and the fly and mouse retina follow the log-normal distribution,\nrespectively which are indicative of underlying random multiplicative processes\nand underpins non-locality of learning in a brain close to the critical state.\nHowever, for the case of the KKI-113 and the H01 human (1mm$^3$) datasets, the\nlocal weighted degree distributions follow an exponentially truncated\npower-law, which may hint at the fact that the critical learning mechanism may\nhave manifested at the node level too.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Physics/Biological Physics","Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dFn898hKW5kcZFJdp3bUHKVhDb_JsoWJSnBOs5b_q2I","pdfSize":"5630523"}
