This exponentially enhances the formation\nrate of primordial black holes. However, this sensitivity to the equation of\nstate is the same that primordial black hole abundances show to the primordial\ncurvature power spectrum amplitude. In this paper, we investigate peaked power\nspectra and show the challenges associated with motivating populations of\nprimordial black holes with standard model enhancements. The parametrisation of\ndifferent power spectra plays an important role in this discussion. The allowed\nparameter space consistent with a large QCD phase transition impact on the\nprimordial black hole abundance differs greatly. This is particularly evident\nfor wider spectra.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MJ1QHyNFM2EKHWVC89oTZNAWBj98BtNJ1bB_ZF0Y3-E","pdfSize":"2459562"}
