Lepton mixing is predicted with the\nhelp of the flavour symmetries Delta (3 n^2) and Delta (6 n^2) combined with\nCP. In the neutral lepton sector, the non-trivial flavour structure is only\nencoded in the Dirac neutrino Yukawa matrix (the coupling relating left-handed\nlepton doublets and gauge singlets Ni). Current experimental bounds on the\nprocesses mu -> e gamma, mu -> 3 e, mu-e conversion in nuclei and the tau\nlepton decays tau -> l gamma and tau -> 3 l, l=e, mu, do not constrain the\nconsidered parameter space of this scenario. Prospective limits on the decay mu\n-> 3 e and mu-e conversion in aluminium instead can markedly reduce the\navailable parameter space. We also comment on the effects of the heavy sterile\nstates on light neutrino masses and lepton mixing.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BTgUlixX8pVHBQ8pZdBhrH4teghsDW9dPU_ZS_ccSL8","pdfSize":"8606440","objectId":"0x94d2797888d281b21646864839d24ad255394249fb1716116e34baa138501da4","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
