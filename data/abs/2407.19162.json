The early detection and mitigation systems help in\nalleviating the destruction with reduced resource utilization. A Genetic\nAlgorithm-based Routing and Scheduling with Time constraints (GARST) is\nproposed to find the shortest schedule route to mitigate the fires as Single\nUAV Tasks (SUT). The objective of GARST is to compute the route and schedule of\nthe UAVs so that the UAVS reach the assigned fire locations before the fire\nbecomes a Multi UAV Task (MUT) and completely quench the fire using the\nextinguisher. The fitness function used for the genetic algorithm is the total\nquench time for mitigation of total fires. The selection, crossover, mutation\noperators, and elitist strategies collectively ensure the exploration and\nexploitation of the solution space, maintaining genetic diversity, preventing\npremature convergence, and preserving high-performing individuals for the\neffective optimization of solutions. The GARST effectively addresses the\nchallenges posed by the NP-complete problem of routing and scheduling for\ngrowing tasks with time constraints. The GARST is able to handle infeasible\nscenarios effectively, contributing to the overall optimization of the wildfire\nmanagement system.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"vLN7iGizCvPaNZzflzfiPqO681m16GBhkoNc9E0bRnw","pdfSize":"745341"}
