  "abstract": "  Enterprise conversational AI systems are becoming increasingly popular to\nassist users in completing daily tasks such as those in marketing and customer\nmanagement. However, new users often struggle to ask effective questions,\nespecially in emerging systems with unfamiliar or evolving capabilities. This\npaper proposes a framework to enhance question suggestions in conversational\nenterprise AI systems by generating proactive, context-aware questions that try\nto address immediate user needs while improving feature discoverability. Our\napproach combines periodic user intent analysis at the population level with\nchat session-based question generation. We evaluate the framework using\nreal-world data from the AI Assistant for Adobe Experience Platform (AEP),\ndemonstrating the improved usefulness and system discoverability of the AI\nAssistant.\n",
