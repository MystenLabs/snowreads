  "abstract": "  Designs, structures connected to averaging with respect to a given measure\nusing finite sets of points, have proven themselves as invaluable tools across\nthe field of quantum information, finding their uses in state and process\ntomography, key distribution and others. In this work, we introduce a new\nconcept of pushforward designs, which allows us to obtain new structures from\nalready existing ones by mapping them between the spaces, with specific\nexamples including simplex designs and mixed state designs from complex\nprojective designs. Based on the general concept, we put forward a structure\ncalled channel $[t,k]$-design, allowing for averaging over space of quantum\nchannels for systems in contact with an environment of dimension $k$. Based on\nthis notion, we introduce the concept of effective environment dimensionality\n$k^*$, which we estimate for the IBM Kyoto quantum computer to be below $2.2$\nfor times up to $350\\mu\\text{s}$.\n",
