  "abstract": "  We numerically construct the spectrum of the Laplacian on Page's\ninhomogeneous Einstein metric on $\\mathbb{CP}^2 \\# \\overline{\\mathbb{CP}}^2$ by\nreducing the problem to a (singular) Sturm-Liouville problem in one dimension.\nWe perform a perturbative analysis based upon a closely related, exactly\nsolvable problem that strongly supports our results. We also study the spectrum\nof the Lichnerowicz Laplacian on symmetric traceless transverse two-tensors.\nThe method relies on both the isometries of the Page metric and pseudospectral\nmethods to numerically solve the resulting ODEs.\n",
