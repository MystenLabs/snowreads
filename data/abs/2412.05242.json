Previous studies showed that AGN\nvariability does not have strong redshift evolution, and scales with their\nbolometric luminosity and BH mass, making it a powerful probe to identify\nlow-mass, low-luminosity AGNs at high redshift. JWST has discovered a new\npopulation of high-redshift galaxies likely hosting moderate accreting BHs\n($10^6\\,M_\\odot$) -- the little red dots (LRDs, $z=4-10$). In this paper, we\nstudy the variability of a sample of 21 LRDs with V-shaped SEDs in three JWST\ndeep fields that also have reliable HST observations in closely paired filters\nat 1-2 um (rest-frame UV), with the time difference between 6 and 11 years.\nThis LRD sample covers a redshift range of $3<z<8$ with median\n-21.3$<M_\\mathrm{UV}<$-18.4. Based on both photometry and imaging difference\nanalyses, we find a mean magnitude difference of 0.12$\\pm$0.24 mag, with none\nof the LRDs showing photometric variability at 3$\\sigma$ significance.\nExtrapolation of SDSS quasar variability predicts a magnitude change of order\n0.3 mag for our LRD sample. This suggests an upper limit of about 30\\% AGN\ncontribution to the total observed UV light in our sample of LRDs.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"P2IrWOG3yRdfkumsqtyvoDDlBDYaMIHjb3rofpZTwEM","pdfSize":"547381"}
