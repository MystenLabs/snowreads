Expert\nsystems (ESs) offer the chance to overcome this challenge by automatically\nidentifying potential energy efficiency improvements and thereby playing a\nsignificant role in reducing electricity consumption. This paper systematically\nreviews state-of-the-art approaches of ESs aimed at improving energy efficiency\nin industry, with a focus on manufacturing. The literature search yields 1692\nresults, of which 54 articles published between 1987 and 2023 are analyzed in\ndepth. These publications are classified according to the system boundary,\nmanufacturing type, application perspective, application purpose, ES type, and\nindustry. Furthermore, we examine the structure, implementation, utilization,\nand development of ESs in this context. Through this analysis, the review\nreveals research gaps, pointing toward promising topics for future research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1c5XqdX5fj1-7kfPkWRMSCh-Fvl51sla9t-0loN5s9Y","pdfSize":"1354570"}
