To address this challenge, we propose RowDetr, an\nend-to-end neural network that utilizes smooth polynomial functions to\ndelineate crop boundaries in image space. A novel energy-based loss function,\nPolyOptLoss, is introduced to enhance learning robustness, even with noisy\nlabels. The proposed model demonstrates a 3% improvement over Agronav in key\nperformance metrics while being six times faster, making it well-suited for\nreal-time applications. Additionally, metrics from lane detection studies were\nadapted to comprehensively evaluate the system, showcasing its accuracy and\nadaptability in various scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"NL1V_ByN-e-R2_oWFKuPd0U8K1bwLqBlsexRJBZ4Ixk","pdfSize":"19703562"}
