  "abstract": "  Multi-Access Point Coordination (MAPC) and Artificial Intelligence and\nMachine Learning (AI/ML) are expected to be key features in future Wi-Fi, such\nas the forthcoming IEEE 802.11bn (Wi-Fi 8) and beyond. In this paper, we\nexplore a coordinated solution based on online learning to drive the\noptimization of Spatial Reuse (SR), a method that allows multiple devices to\nperform simultaneous transmissions by controlling interference through Packet\nDetect (PD) adjustment and transmit power control. In particular, we focus on a\nMulti-Agent Multi-Armed Bandit (MA-MAB) setting, where multiple decision-making\nagents concurrently configure SR parameters from coexisting networks by\nleveraging the MAPC framework, and study various algorithms and reward-sharing\nmechanisms. We evaluate different MA-MAB implementations using Komondor, a\nwell-adopted Wi-Fi simulator, and demonstrate that AI-native SR enabled by\ncoordinated MABs can improve the network performance over current Wi-Fi\noperation: mean throughput increases by 15%, fairness is improved by increasing\nthe minimum throughput across the network by 210%, while the maximum access\ndelay is kept below 3 ms.\n",
