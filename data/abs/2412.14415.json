We\nmodel driving as a sequential decision-making task, and learn a transformer\nmodel to predict future agent states as tokens in an autoregressive fashion. We\nscale up our model parameters and training data by multiple orders of\nmagnitude, enabling us to explore the scaling properties in terms of dataset\nsize, model parameters, and compute. We evaluate DriveGPT across different\nscales in a planning task, through both quantitative metrics and qualitative\nexamples, including closed-loop driving in complex real-world scenarios. In a\nseparate prediction task, DriveGPT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and\nexhibits improved performance by pretraining on a large-scale dataset, further\nvalidating the benefits of data scaling.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"z_CM5rWuuUSJIV95S0avTFQKuG0K4UDSK04uzw7kB6M","pdfSize":"4621330"}
