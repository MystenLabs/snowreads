We consider the toric\nring $R_{\\Gamma}=K[{\\bf x}_Ft:F\\in \\Gamma]$ and the Rees algebra of the facet\nideals $I(\\Gamma^{[i]})$ of pure skeletons of $\\Gamma$. We show that these\nalgebras are Koszul, normal Cohen-Macaulay domains. Moreover, we study the\nGorenstein property, the canonical module, and the $a$-invariant of the normal\ndomain $R_{\\Gamma}$ by investigating its divisor class group. Finally, it is\nshown that any $d$-flag sortable simplicial complex is vertex decomposable,\nwhich provides a characterization of the Cohen-Macaulay property of such\ncomplexes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"KsfyEvtvUpb6tLGQdfT2tQaBlN9-8oPV_gwtCAPaqio","pdfSize":"252885"}
