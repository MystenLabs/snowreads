While the precise mechanisms by which\nthe brain encodes and decodes information, and learns diverse skills, remain\nelusive, memorization undoubtedly plays a pivotal role in this process. In this\narticle, we delve into the implementation and application of an\nautoencoder-inspired hippocampus network in a multi-functional system. We\npropose an autoencoder-based memorization method for policy function's\nparameters. Specifically, the encoder of the autoencoder maps policy function's\nparameters to a skill vector, while the decoder retrieves the parameters via\nthis skill vector. The policy function is dynamically adjusted tailored to\ncorresponding tasks. Henceforth, a skill vectors graph neural network is\nemployed to represent the homeomorphic topological structure of subtasks and\nmanage subtasks execution.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tPwiHYw8QtCcLHdCOcQeSPZ3k7fsKhfi1jFbBnEw31Q","pdfSize":"12437117"}
