These\nfamilies are exhaustive -- every orthogonally-equivariant submanifold model of\nthe lowest dimension for any of these manifolds is necessarily a member of the\nrespective family, with a small number of exceptions. They have several\ncomputationally desirable features. The orthogonal equivariance allows one to\nobtain, for various differential geometric objects and operations, closed-form\nanalytic expressions that are readily computable with standard numerical linear\nalgebra. The minimal dimension aspect translates directly to a speed advantage\nin computations. And having an exhaustive list of all possible matrix models\npermits one to identify the model with the lowest matrix condition number,\nwhich translates to an accuracy advantage in computations. As an interesting\naside, we will see that the family of models for the Stiefel manifold is\nnaturally parameterized by the Cartan manifold, i.e., the positive definite\ncone equipped with its natural Riemannian metric.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qkZxyo9hZZNtUIwiwlrg7hWjzs-cebXLRlr88JS8RZ4","pdfSize":"270896"}
