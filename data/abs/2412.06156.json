  "abstract": "  In many unconventional superconductors the pairing interaction is believed to\nbe mediated by a fluctuating order. Although this is typically taken to be\nmagnetic in origin, the role of other fluctuating orders has recently been\nconsidered. In this work we examine the weak-coupling pairing interaction\nproduced by a general fluctuating order, and seek to identify the leading\npairing instability. For a given pairing channel, we show that the\nsuperconducting fitness with the associated static order appears prominently in\nthe expression for the coupling constant. We consequently argue that fit gaps\n(for which the static order is not pair-breaking) should have an attractive\ninteraction, whereas unfit gaps (for which the static order is pair-breaking)\nhave a repulsive interaction. We propose a simple heuristic test for the\ntendency of a given pairing state to have an attractive interaction. We show\nthe validity of this test in the case of pairing caused by fluctuating\ndensity-wave order, and use it to probe the superconducting state generated by\na fluctuating noncolinear magnetic order on the pyrochlore lattice.\n",
