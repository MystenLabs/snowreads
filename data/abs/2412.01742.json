For any $t\\in T$ of finite order and any\nirreducible representation $V(\\lambda)$ of $G$ of highest weight $\\lambda$, we\ndetermine the character $ch(t, V(\\lambda))$ by using the Lefschetz Trace\nFormula due to Atiyah-Singer and explicitly determining the connected\ncomponents and their normal bundles of the fixed point subvariety\n$(G/P)^t\\subset G/P$ (for any parabolic subgroup $P$). This together with\nWirtinger's theorem gives an asymptotic formula for $ch(t, V(n\\lambda))$ when\n$n$ goes to infinity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"S_73ymPS9mxy_1Sbbs10Jo4rUHx-J4-VZsP7m6DkIQY","pdfSize":"140168"}
