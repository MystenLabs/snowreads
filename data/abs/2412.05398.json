  "abstract": "  Despite calls for reform to enhance forensic science, insufficient attention\nhas been paid to the potential errors arising from exclusions. Often based on\nintuitive judgment rather than empirical evidence, exclusions can lead to\nsignificant errors. Additionally, exclusions can imply inclusions, especially\nwhen ancillary information narrows the pool of suspects in an investigation.\nWithout empirical evidence demonstrating that class characteristics alone can\nconsistently be used for comparison with high repeatability, replicability, and\naccuracy, these characteristics should not be employed for exclusions. Errors\nin exclusions require the same scrutiny as errors in inclusions. Validity\nstudies and reports of the accuracy of a forensic method must include both\nfalse positive rates and false negative rates, since only focusing on false\npositive rates can lead, and has led, to errors and subsequent miscarriages of\njustice.\n",
