Recently, it has been found that the postmeasurement information\nabout the subensemble containing the prepared state can annihilate or create\nnonlocality in quantum state discrimination. Here, we show that annihilation or\ncreation of nonlocality in quantum state discrimination can depend on the\nchoice of subensembles provided by postmeasurement information. We establish\nsufficient conditions that annihilating or creating nonlocality depends on the\nchoice of subensembles provided by postmeasurement information. We further\nprovide bipartite quantum state ensembles satisfying these conditions to\nillustrate our results.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rmW1Ywxvgs3dB_PEh0Zi8qm5Vt5y5s7oZKW5x9n21bQ","pdfSize":"215758"}
