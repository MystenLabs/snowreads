Such word can be cut into parts that can be arranged into two identical\nwords. The minimum number of cuts needed is called the \\emph{cut number} of a\ntangram. For example, the word $\\mathtt{\\color{red}{0102}\\color{blue}{0102}}$\nis a tangram with cut number one, while the word\n$\\mathtt{\\color{red}{01}\\color{blue}{01023}\\color{red}{023}}$ is a tangram with\ncut number two. Clearly, tangrams with cut number one coincide with the well\nknown family of words, known as \\emph{squares}, having the form $UU$ for some\nnonempty word $U$.\n  A word $W$ \\emph{avoids} a word $T$ if it is not possible to write $W=ATB$,\nfor any words $A$ and $B$ (possibly empty). The famous 1906 theorem of Thue\nasserts that there exist arbitrarily long words avoiding squares over alphabet\nwith just \\emph{three} letters. Given a fixed number $k\\geqslant 1$, how many\nletters are needed to avoid tangrams with the cut number at most $k$? Let\n$t(k)$ denote the minimum size of an alphabet needed for that purpose. By\nThue's result we have $t(1)=3$, which easily implies $t(2)=3$. Curiously, these\nare currently the only known exact values of this function.\n  In our main result we prove that $t(k)=\\Theta(\\log_2k)$. The proof uses\n\\emph{entropy compression} argument and \\emph{Zimin words}. By using a\ndifferent method we prove that $t(k)\\leqslant k+1$ for all $k\\geqslant 4$,\nwhich gives more exact estimates for small values of $k$. The proof makes use\nof \\emph{Dejean words} and a curious property of \\emph{Gauss words}, which is\nperhaps of independent interest.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VovuFhgPtdlR-aFm34AVDF_ooQguX6xnj5RMq7kaW5I","pdfSize":"568348"}
