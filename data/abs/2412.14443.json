  "abstract": "  Energetic or \"hot\" electrons and holes generated from the decay of localized\nsurface plasmons in metallic nanoparticles have great potential for\napplications in photocatalysis, photovoltaics, and sensing. Here, we study the\ngeneration of hot carriers in brick-shaped gold nanoparticles using a recently\ndeveloped modelling approach that combines a solution to Maxwell's equation\nwith large-scale tight-binding simulations to evaluate Fermi's Golden Rule. We\nfind that hot-carrier generation depends sensitively on the aspect ratio of the\nnanobricks with flatter bricks producing a large number of energetic electrons\nirrespective of the light polarization. In contrast, the hot-carrier generation\nrates of elongated nanobricks exhibits a strong dependence on the light\npolarization. The insights resulting from our calculations can be harnessed to\ndesign nanobricks that produce hot carriers with properties tailored to\nspecific device applications.\n",
