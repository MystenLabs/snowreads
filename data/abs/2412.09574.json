Initial shuttling\nresults are encouraging; however, long shuttling trajectories are guaranteed to\nencounter regions of low conduction-band valley energy splittings, due to the\npresence of random-alloy disorder in Si/SiGe quantum wells. Here, we\ntheoretically explore two schemes for avoiding valley-state excitations at\nthese valley minima, by allowing the electrons to detour around them. The\nmultichannel shuttling scheme allows electrons to tunnel between parallel\nchannels, while a two-dimensional (2D) shuttler provides full omnidirectional\ncontrol. Through simulations, we estimate shuttling fidelities for these two\nschemes, obtaining a clear preference for the 2D shuttler. Based on these\nencouraging results, we propose a full qubit architecture based on 2D\nshuttling, which enables all-to-all connectivity within qubit plaquettes and\nhigh-fidelity communication between plaquettes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"coYl1ylC15PfdEzfcC_x5jK1_rneYGEar6jq1osiwHI","pdfSize":"5084055"}
