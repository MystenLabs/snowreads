Space-based very long\nbaseline interferometry (VLBI) offers the capability for studying a larger and\nmore diverse sample of black holes. We identify a number of nearby supermassive\nblack holes as prime candidates for horizon-scale imaging at millimeter\nwavelengths, and use source characteristics such as angular size, sky\ndistribution, and variability timescales to shape the design of a space-based\narray. We identify specific metrics that serve as key predictors of image\nfidelity and scientific potential, providing a quantitative basis for\noptimizing mission design parameters. Our analysis demonstrates that the\noptimal configuration requires two space-based elements in high Earth orbits\n(HEO) that are not coplanar and are apparently counter-rotating. Our results\ndelineate the key requirements for a space-based VLBI mission, enabling\ndetailed studies of black hole shadows, plasma dynamics, and jet formation,\nadvancing black hole astrophysics beyond the current capabilities of the EHT.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"YOr__SnKhCtFO5TWyL2JyfXUJmokR0t16TDZNBjVgN4","pdfSize":"5764175"}
