This paper\nintroduces a novel method for model-based clustering specifically designed for\nbounded data. Building on the transformation-based approach to Gaussian mixture\ndensity estimation introduced by Scrucca (2019), we extend this framework to\ndevelop a probabilistic clustering algorithm for data with bounded support that\nallows for accurate clustering while respecting the natural bounds of the\nvariables. In our proposal, a flexible range-power transformation is employed\nto map the data from its bounded domain to the unrestricted real space, hence\nenabling the estimation of Gaussian mixture models in the transformed space.\nThis approach leads to improved cluster recovery and interpretation, especially\nfor complex distributions within bounded domains. The performance of the\nproposed method is evaluated through real-world data applications involving\nboth fully and partially bounded data, in both univariate and multivariate\nsettings. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our\napproach over traditional and advanced model-based clustering techniques that\nemploy distributions with bounded support.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_BCfvkaYvDGTU8rWMKU4vTBE_UnJvnXO_JAJ89biifE","pdfSize":"1963452"}
