Unlike their\nmicrophone counterpart, loudspeaker constraints are often heterogeneous due to\narrayed transducers with varying operating ranges in frequency,\nacoustic-electrical sensitivity, efficiency, and directivity. This work\nproposes a frequency-regularization method for generalized Rayleigh quotient\ndirectivity specifications and two novel beamformer designs that optimize for\nmaximum efficiency constant directivity (MECD) and maximum sensitivity constant\ndirectivity (MSCD). We derive fast converging and analytic solutions from their\nquadratic equality constrained quadratic program formulations. Experiments\noptimize generalized directivity index constrained beamformer designs for a\nfull-band heterogeneous array.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qbMj3h6CcJ2SaJC8BuGaC0gdQfuj861uTlpeeCC6BXQ","pdfSize":"6556759"}
