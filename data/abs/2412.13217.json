We carry out evaluations in\nterms of the visual quality of the channel charts, the dimensionality reduction\nperformance measures trustworthiness (TW) and connectivity (CT), as well as the\nexecution time of the algorithms. We find that although the Bartlett's\nalgorithm, MVDR, and Minimum Norm algorithms have sufficiently close\nperformance to techniques we studied earlier, the Minimum Norm algorithm has\nsignificantly higher computational complexity than the other two. Previously,\nwe found that the use of the MUSIC algorithm for estimation of both $\\theta$\nand $\\rho$ has a very high performance. In this paper, we investigated and\nquantified the performance of the Bartlett algorithm in its use for estimating\nboth $\\theta$ and $\\rho$, similar to the our previously introduced technique of\nusing MUSIC for estimating both.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computer Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"tvTh4uM3YHV_74JuKJ5Eg4WarNKno9gUAM5b99nlI7Y","pdfSize":"9242665"}
