For example, the classification\nof conformal nets in the discrete series. In this paper, however, we study\n$\\alpha$-induction of graded local conformal nets. The main difference lies\nbetween locality in the conformal net cases and graded locality in the graded\nlocal conformal net cases. We show that the inclusions of graded local\nconformal nets give braided subfactors. We check that the $\\alpha$-induction is\nstill valid in terms of graded local conformal nets. Moreover, the simple\ncurrent extension originally defined in terms of conformal nets still works for\ngraded local conformal nets. Consequently, we give a shorter proof of\nclassification of $N=2$ superconformal nets in the discrete series according to\nGannon's list.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JoH_vMLfzsnNEag3xI5EGjnwmCLf4g0ss4y4Ed9a4lY","pdfSize":"199033"}
