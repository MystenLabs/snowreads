Despite graphene's\nsuperior transport and electronic properties compared to other semiconductors,\nachieving nanoscale confinement remains challenging due to its gapless nature.\nIn this study, we explore the unique transport properties along nanowrinkles in\nmonolayer graphene. We demonstrate the creation of a one-dimensional conduction\nchannel by alternating pseudo-magnetic fields along the nanowrinkle, enabling\nballistic Dirac fermion transport without leakage. This suggests a feasible\nmethod for secure quantum information transfer over long distances.\nFurthermore, we extend our analysis to bent nanowrinkles, showcasing\nwell-guided Dirac fermion propagation unless the bent angle is sufficiently\nlarge. Our demonstration of the nanowrinkle waveguide in graphene introduces a\nnovel approach to controlling Dirac fermion transport through strain\nengineering, for quantum information technology applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4sZMf88vIDnGm-BWKHvgJ5sFlaevbM7cV_NXGXWniI0","pdfSize":"6115546"}
