  "abstract": "  We use antistatic-antistatic potentials computed with lattice QCD and a\ncoupled-channel Born-Oppenheimer approach to explore the existence of a\n$\\bar{b} \\bar{b} u d$ tetraquark resonance with quantum numbers $I(J^P) =\n0(1^-)$. A pole in the $\\mbox{T}$ matrix signals a resonance with mass $m = 2\nm_B + 94.0^{+1.3}_{-5.4} \\, \\text{MeV}$ and decay width $\\Gamma =\n140^{+86}_{-66} \\, \\text{MeV}$, i.e. very close to the $B^\\ast B^\\ast$\nthreshold. We also compute branching ratios, which clearly indicate that this\nresonance is mainly composed of a $B^\\ast B^\\ast$ meson pair with a\nsignificantly smaller $B B$ contribution. By varying the potential matrix\nresponsible for the coupling of the $B B$ and the $B^\\ast B^\\ast$ channel as\nwell as the $b$ quark mass, we provide additional insights and understanding\nconcerning the formation and existence of the resonance. We also comment on the\nimportance of our findings and the main takeaways for a possible future full\nlattice QCD investigation of this $I(J^P) = 0(1^-)$ $\\bar{b} \\bar{b} u d$\ntetraquark resonance.\n",
