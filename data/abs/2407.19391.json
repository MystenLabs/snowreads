For each model, we study the problems such as\ncomputing a committee with the highest probability of satisfying axioms such as\njustified representation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ol1uN2BssvGeVxQM4J9YcxYU4yepeDV5acNh-ApVjTY","pdfSize":"271105"}
