  "abstract": "  A commonly held opinion is that left-handed tennis players are\noverrepresented compared to the percentage of left-handers within the general\npopulation. This study provides the domain insights supported by data analysis\nthat could help inform the decision of parents and coaches considering whether\na child should start playing tennis as left- or right-handed when there is no\nstrong arm-handed dominance. Compared to the commonly cited figure of about 10%\nof left-handed male population, data analysis from the official ATP web site\nfor the top 100 ranked tennis players over the past decades (1985-2016) shows\nevidence of overrepresentation of left-handed elite tennis players (about 15%).\nThe insights and data analysis can inform the handedness decision, advance\ncoaching and strategic game concepts, enhance media coverage/analytics,\nleft-handed facts and statistics, and inform tennis equipment manufacturing.\n",
