  "abstract": "  The functionality of a graph $G$ is the minimum number $k$ such that in every\ninduced subgraph of $G$ there exists a vertex whose neighbourhood is uniquely\ndetermined by the neighborhoods of at most $k$ other vertices in the subgraph.\nThe functionality parameter was introduced in the context of adjacency labeling\nschemes, and it generalises a number of classical and recent graph parameters\nincluding degeneracy, twin-width, and symmetric difference. We establish the\nfunctionality of a random graph $G(n,p)$ up to a constant factor for every\nvalue of $p$.\n",
