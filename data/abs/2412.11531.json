{"id":"2412.11531","title":"Investigating triply heavy tetraquark states through QCD sum rules","authors":"Wen-Shuai Zhang and Liang Tang","authorsParsed":[["Zhang","Wen-Shuai",""],["Tang","Liang",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2024 08:09:48 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-17","timestamp":1734336588000,"abstract":"  We apply the method of QCD sum rules to study the \\(QQ\\bar{Q}\\bar{q}\\) and\n\\(QQ\\bar{Q}\\bar{s}\\) tetraquark states, where $Q=c,b$ and $q=u,d$, with the\nquantum number \\(J^P = 0^{+}\\). We consider the contributions of vacuum\ncondensates up to dimension-9 in the operator product expansion, and use the\nenergy scale formula \\(\\mu = \\sqrt{M_{X}^2 - (i\\mathbb{M}_c + j\\mathbb{M}_b)^2}\n- k\\mathbb{M}_s\\) to determine the optimal energy scales for the QCD spectral\ndensities. Our results indicate that triply charm tetraquark states\n\\(cc\\bar{c}\\bar{q}\\) and \\(cc\\bar{c}\\bar{s}\\) have masses in the ranges of\n$5.38-5.84\\,\\text{GeV}$ and $5.66-6.16\\,\\text{GeV}$, respectively. In the\nbottom sector, triply bottom tetraquark states \\(bb\\bar{b}\\bar{q}\\) and\n\\(bb\\bar{b}\\bar{s}\\) have masses in the ranges of $14.89-15.55\\,\\text{GeV}$ and\n$14.95-15.66\\,\\text{GeV}$, respectively. This study could help distinguish\nthese states in upcoming high-energy nuclear and particle experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5VIRPhIar_6G7liSB5UHI9EztaDW_mt-InCg0eNHpc8","pdfSize":"401935"}
