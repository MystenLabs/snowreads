In this\nframework, dependence between $X$ and $Y$ in $D$, denoted $B(X,Y|D)$, is\nquantified as $P(H_1|D)$, the posterior probability for the model of dependence\ngiven $D$, or any strictly increasing function thereof. It is therefore a\nmeasure of the evidence for dependence between $X$ and $Y$ as modeled by $H_1$\nand observed in $D$. We review several statistical models and reconsider\nstandard results in the light of $B(X,Y|D)$ as a measure of dependence. Using\nsimulations, we focus on two specific issues: the effect of noise and the\nbehavior of $B(X,Y|D)$ when $H_1$ has a parameter coding for the intensity of\ndependence. We then derive some general properties of $B(X,Y|D)$, showing that\nit quantifies the information contained in $D$ in favor of $H_1$ versus $H_0$.\nWhile some of these properties are typical of what is expected from a valid\nmeasure of dependence, others are novel and naturally appear as desired\nfeatures for specific measures of dependence, which we call inferential. We\nfinally put these results in perspective; in particular, we discuss the\nconsequences of using the Bayesian framework as well as the similarities and\ndifferences between $B(X,Y|D)$ and mutual information.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Machine Learning","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6NOmkGxcpaGwi3CcRdrGB_bqZJX4QLsmnJ7uIU0wwws","pdfSize":"925472"}
