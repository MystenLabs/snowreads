Bayesian individual-based models such as spatial\ncapture-recapture (SCR) models provide opportunities to study density\ndependence at the individual level, but such an approach remains to be\ndeveloped and evaluated. In this study, we developed a SCR model that links\nhabitat use to apparent survival and recruitment through density dependent\nprocesses at the individual level. Using simulations, we found that the model\ncan properly inform habitat use, but tends to underestimate the effect of\ndensity dependence on apparent survival and recruitment. The reason for such\nunderestimations is likely due to the fact that SCR models have difficulties in\nidentifying the locations of unobserved individuals while assuming they are\nuniformly distributed. How to accurately estimate the locations of unobserved\nindividuals, and thus density dependence, remains a challenging topic in\nspatial statistics and statistical ecology.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NTWBf3-NKR2McOwJ49lOGgbVATM1RC-kXlRMFBIiPqc","pdfSize":"713995"}
