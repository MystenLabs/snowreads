These\nscales are determined from a tree-level improved definition of the static force\non the lattice, which we measure using Wilson loops. Our analysis involves\nvarious continuum and chiral extrapolations of data that cover pion masses\nbetween 134 MeV and 420 MeV and five lattice spacings down to 0.039 fm. We\ncompare the potential scales to gradient flow scales by forming corresponding\nratios. We find $r_0=0.4757(64)$ fm at the physical point. As a byproduct of\nour analysis we express the $N_{\\rm f}=3$ QCD Lambda parameter determined by\nthe ALPHA Collaboration in units of the scale $r_0$ and obtain $r_0\n\\Lambda^{(3)}_{\\overline{\\rm{MS}}} = 0.820(28)$. Furthermore we present results\nfor the second derivative of the potential to study its shape and compare it to\nphenomenological potential models.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AGVKqG7vABxA_4u9JoWCm00s8yMnGtX3gkQ5vgKLNIE","pdfSize":"7976741"}
