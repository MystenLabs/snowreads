Here we propose a universally applicable\nmechanism that can generate the superbunching light with ultrastrong\nsecond-order and higher-order correlations hitherto unreachable. This mechanism\narises from the combined effect of electron shelving and time integral of\nfluorescence based on a cascaded quantum system comprising an emitter and a\nfilter or a cavity QED system, and has high experimental feasibility according\nto current experimental techniques. Besides, both the correlation degrees and\nthe frequency of the light can be flexibly varied over broad ranges. Both the\nresearch and technological applications on strong correlations can be\nextensively facilitated due to this readily accessible and manipulated\nmechanism for generating photon correlation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EP8po8hymWwdtPEjlZVQYeej3jRDRdQuvVy2KG_id8c","pdfSize":"3092221"}
