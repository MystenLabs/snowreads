Scanning electron microscopy and mechanical tests showed\nthat initial monomer concentration strongly affects both hydrogel\nmicrostructure and resulted mechanical properties. The hydrogels demonstrated\nself-healing ability through hydrogen bonding at the temperatures above upper\ncritical solubility temperature, excellent mechanical properties (0.9 MPa),\nlarge stretchability (1300 %) and cut resistance. Next, as active material for\nelectrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLC) carbonized and ethanol/KOH\nactivated polypyrrole nanotubes (acPPyNTs) were prepared. Symmetric\nself-healable supercapacitor employing p(NAGA-co-VTZ) hydrogel, acPPyNTs and\naqueous 3M KCl solution was assembled. Cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic\ncharge-discharge measurements showed that the prepared device gave a specific\ncapacitance of 282.62 F g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 and high areal capacitance of 316.86\nmF cm-2 at scan rate of 10 mV s-1. The supercapacitor operates over wide\nvoltage window (0-1.2 V) and provides excellent cyclic performance with\ncapacitance retention of 97 % after 10 000 cycles and 94 % after self-healing.\nOverall, the prepared self-healable supercapacitor appears to have considerable\npotential as high-performance energy storage device.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LTkIL5xCklXr6O88P2hw58HlAmEqREvrZszmgO9SOGA","pdfSize":"1896786"}
