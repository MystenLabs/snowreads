  "abstract": "  A fine abundance analysis of a recently discovered hydrogen-deficient carbon\n(HdC) star, A 980, is presented. Based on the observed high-resolution optical\nspectrum, we ascertain that A 980 is a cool extreme helium (EHe) star and not\nan HdC. Singly-ionized germanium Ge II lines are identified in A 980's optical\nspectrum. These are the first-ever detections of germanium lines in an EHe's\nobserved spectrum, and provide the first measurements of germanium abundance in\nan EHe star. The overabundance of germanium in A 980's atmosphere provides us\nwith evidence for the synthesis of germanium in EHe stars. Among the known cool\nEHe stars, A 980 exhibits a maximum enhancement of the s-process elements based\non significant number of transitions. The measured elemental abundances reveal\nsigns of H-burning, He-burning, and specifically the nucleosyntheses of the key\nelements: Ge, Sr, Y, Zr, and Ba. The nucleosyntheses of these key elements are\ndiscussed in light of asymptotic giant branch evolution and the expectation\nfrom the accretion of an He white dwarf by a C-O white dwarf or by a neutron\nstar.\n",
