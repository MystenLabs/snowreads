Simultaneously, these\nsystems become more susceptible to different aging mechanisms such as\nnegative-bias temperature instability (NBTI), hot carrier injection (HCI), and\nthermal cycling (TC), as well as the electromigration (EM) phenomenon. In this\npaper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based task mapping method to\nimprove the reliability of manycore systems considering the aforementioned\naging mechanisms, which consists of three steps including bin packing,\ntask-to-bin mapping, and task-to-core mapping. In the initial step, a\ndensity-based spatial application with noise (DBSCAN) clustering method is\nemployed to compose some clusters (bins) based on the cores temperature. Then,\nthe Q-learning algorithm is used for the two latter steps, to map the arrived\ntask on a core such that the minimum thermal variation is occurred among all\nthe bins. Compared to the state-of-the-art works, the proposed method is\nperformed during runtime without requiring any parameter to be calculated\noffline. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is evaluated on 16, 32,\nand 64 cores systems using SPLASH2 and PARSEC benchmark suite applications. The\nresults demonstrate up to 27% increase in the mean time to failure (MTTF)\ncompared to the state-of-the-art task mapping techniques.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"F194740IA4RvuLluwzZi3rggO31R26cgWIMPS4GZD3Y","pdfSize":"885204"}
