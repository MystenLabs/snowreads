We determine $T_c$ as well as the critical\nexponents $\\beta,\\gamma$ and $\\nu$, based on finite-size scaling and histogram\nreweighting techniques. In addition, we study a ``dimensionally reduced''\nscenario where $N_z$ is kept fixed (e.g. at 2, 4, 8), while the limit\n$N_{x,y}\\to\\infty$ is taken. For each fixed $N_z$ we determine $T_c$ as well as\n$\\beta,\\gamma,\\nu$. For $T_c$ we find a smooth transition curve which connects\nthe well known critical temperatures of the 2D and the 3D Ising model.\nRegarding $\\beta,\\gamma,\\nu$ our data suggest that the ``dimensionally\nreduced'' Ising model is in the same universality class as the 2D Ising model,\nregardless of $N_z$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"EK50ZrvmM-ot9eEx3_ybhPXSBjCs-rkIG6TEXrJ-YjU","pdfSize":"628970"}
