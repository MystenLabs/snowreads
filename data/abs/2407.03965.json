In this paper, we introduce our new\nsoundness-checking tool that can instantaneously identify errors in BPMN\nmodels, make them comprehensible for modelers, and even suggest corrections to\nresolve them automatically. We demonstrate that our tool's soundness checking\nis instantaneous, i.e., it takes less than 500ms, by benchmarking our tool\nagainst synthetic BPMN models with increasing size and state space complexity,\nas well as realistic models provided in the literature. Moreover, the tool\ndirectly displays possible soundness violations in the model and provides an\ninteractive counterexample visualization of each violation. Additionally, it\nprovides fixes to resolve the violations found, which are not currently\navailable in other tools. The tool is open-source, modular, extensible, and\nintegrated into a popular BPMN modeling tool.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"z_wV9hiyccZGJNc3Za5KBi37nPc65lNpll5QOcZqGHk","pdfSize":"788205"}
