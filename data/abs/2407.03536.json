It is important to assess the influence of different\ntypes of biases embedded in LLMs to ensure fair use in sensitive fields.\nAlthough there have been extensive works on bias assessment in English, such\nefforts are rare and scarce for a major language like Bangla. In this work, we\nexamine two types of social biases in LLM generated outputs for Bangla\nlanguage. Our main contributions in this work are: (1) bias studies on two\ndifferent social biases for Bangla (2) a curated dataset for bias measurement\nbenchmarking (3) two different probing techniques for bias detection in the\ncontext of Bangla. This is the first work of such kind involving bias\nassessment of LLMs for Bangla to the best of our knowledge. All our code and\nresources are publicly available for the progress of bias related research in\nBangla NLP.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"sr_ERTFsRrp8goa8cCcsGyNScOx-uSbs3aKDi4qtr9c","pdfSize":"823421"}
