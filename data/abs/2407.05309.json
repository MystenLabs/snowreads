The main focus is on how the linearity and\nnonlinearity of the fast variables in system influence the emergence of the\nbreathing pulses when the slow variables are linear and the bifurcation\nparameter is around the Hopf bifurcation point. By applying the matching\nprinciple to the fast and slow changing quantities and using the relevant\ntheory of singular perturbation, we obtain explicit expressions for the\nstationary pulses. Then, the normal form theory and the center manifold theory\nare applied to give Hopf normal form expressions. Finally, one of these\nexpressions is verified by the numerical simulation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IflkW6MGqxHykxegIoBJY36l9oty4YVuvbKySfOWaw0","pdfSize":"656795"}
