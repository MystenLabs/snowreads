  "abstract": "  Many approaches to program synthesis perform a combinatorial search within a\nlarge space of programs to find one that satisfies a given specification. To\ntame the search space blowup, previous works introduced probabilistic and\nneural approaches to guide this combinatorial search by inducing heuristic cost\nfunctions. Best-first search algorithms ensure to search in the exact order\ninduced by the cost function, significantly reducing the portion of the program\nspace to be explored. We present a new best-first search algorithm called\nEcoSearch, which is the first constant-delay algorithm for pre-generation cost\nfunction: the amount of compute required between outputting two programs is\nconstant, and in particular does not increase over time. This key property\nyields important speedups: we observe that EcoSearch outperforms its\npredecessors on two classic domains.\n",
