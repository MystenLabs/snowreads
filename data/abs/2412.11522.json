In this approach projections are\ncomputed via appropriately chosen reproducing kernels instead of orthogonal\nbases. This approach eases the bookkeeping and leads to pleasing formulas.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Gl5tg15QJMzUPRtwjSlXaHT1M55WSOP_tfxU-dxOPcw","pdfSize":"385049"}
