  "abstract": "  The scalar tetraquarks $T_{b}$ and $T_{c}$ with asymmetric contents $bb\n\\overline{b}\\overline{c}$ and $cc \\overline{c}\\overline{b}$ are explored using\nthe QCD sum rule method. These states are modeled as the diquark-antidiquarks\ncomposed of the axial-vector components. The masses and current couplings of\n$T_{b}$ and $T_{c}$ are calculated using the two-point sum rule approach. The\npredictions obtained for the masses of these four-quark mesons prove that they\nare unstable against the strong two-meson fall-apart decays to conventional\nmesons. In the case of the tetraquark $ T_{b}$ this is the decay\n$T_{\\mathrm{b}}\\to \\eta _{b}B_{c}^{-}$. The processes\n$T_{\\mathrm{c}}\\rightarrow \\eta _{c}B_{c}^{+}$ and $J/\\psi B_{c}^{\\ast +}$ are\nkinematically allowed decay modes of the tetraquark $ T_{c}$. The widths of\ncorresponding processes are evaluated by employing the QCD three-point sum rule\napproach which are necessary to estimate strong couplings at the\ntetraquark-meson-meson vertices of interest. The mass $ m=(15697 \\pm\n95)~\\mathrm{MeV}$ and width $\\Gamma[T_b]=(36.0 \\pm 10.2)~ \\mathrm{MeV}$ of the\ntetraquark $T_{b}$ as well as the parameters $ \\widetilde{m}=(9680 \\pm\n102)~\\mathrm{MeV}$ and $\\Gamma[T_c]=(54.7 \\pm 9.9)~ \\mathrm{MeV}$ in the case\nof $T_{c}$ provide useful information to search for and interpret new exotic\nstates.\n",
