  "abstract": "  Large enterprise databases can be complex and messy, obscuring the data\nsemantics needed for analytical tasks. We propose a semantic layer in-between\nthe database and the user as a set of small and easy-to-interpret database\nviews, effectively acting as a refined version of the schema. To discover these\nviews, we introduce a multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) simulation where\nLLM agents collaborate to iteratively define and refine views with minimal\ninput. Our approach paves the way for LLM-powered exploration of unwieldy\ndatabases.\n",
