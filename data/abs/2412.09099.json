  "abstract": "  We study the relation between simply and universally interpolating sequences\nfor the holomorphic Hardy spaces $H^p(\\mathbb{D}^d)$ on the polydisc. In\ndimension $d=1$ a sequence is simply interpolating if and only if it is\nuniversally interpolating, due to a classical theorem of Shapiro and Shields.\nIn dimension $d\\ge2$, Amar showed that Shapiro and Shields' theorem holds for\n$H^p(\\mathbb{D}^d)$ when $p \\geq 4$. In contrast, we show that if $1\\leq p \\leq\n2$ there exist simply interpolating sequences which are not universally\ninterpolating.\n",
