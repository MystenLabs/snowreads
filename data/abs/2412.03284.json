We review the phenomenology of the Higgs inflation model,\nextending the Standard Model to include a non-minimal coupling to gravity; as\nrecently shown [1], even configurations that would be metastable in the\nStandard Model, become viable for inflation if the non-minimal coupling is\nlarge enough to flatten the Higgs potential at field values below the barrier\nbetween the minima.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vtcV9cFldYlz2i1RSdZYF8VMtCrHBSIaYOkY86Tnt1c","pdfSize":"574925"}
