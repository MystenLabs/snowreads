  "abstract": "  We present the analysis of a comprehensive sample of 352 early-type galaxies\nusing public data, to investigate the correlations between CO luminosities and\nmid-infrared luminosities observed by \\textit{Wide-field Infrared Survey\nExplorer} (\\textit{WISE}). We find strong correlations between both CO (1-0)\nand CO (2-1) luminosities and 12 \\micron\\ luminosity, boasting a correlation\ncoefficient greater than 0.9 and an intrinsic scatter smaller than 0.1 dex. The\nconsistent slopes observed for the relationships of CO (1-0) and CO (2-1)\nsuggest that the line ratio R21 lacks correlation with mid-infrared emission in\nearly-type galaxies, which is significantly different from star-forming\ngalaxies. Moreover, the slopes of $L_{\\rm CO (1-0)}$--$L_{\\mbox{12\\micron}}$\nand $L_{\\rm CO (2-1)}$--$L_{\\mbox{12\\micron}}$ relations in early-type galaxies\nare steeper than those observed in star-forming galaxies. Given the absence of\ncorrelation with color, morphology or sSFR, the correlation between deviations\nand the molecular gas mass surface density could be eliminated by correcting\nthe possible 12 \\micron\\ emission from old stars or adopting a systematically\ndifferent $\\alpha_{\\rm CO}$. The latter, on average, is equivalent to adding an\nconstant CO brightness density, specifically\n${2.8{_{-0.6}}\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!^{+0.8}}~[\\mathrm{K~km~s^{-1}}]$ and\n${4.4{_{-1.4}}\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!^{+2.2}}~[\\mathrm{K~km~s^{-1}}]$ for CO (1-0)\nand (2-1) respectively. These explorations will serve as useful tools for\nestimating the molecular gas content in gas-poor galaxies and understanding\nassociated quenching processes.\n",
