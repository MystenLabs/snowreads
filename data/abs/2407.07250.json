Our\nmethodology successfully finds all optimized approximated solutions for Boolean\nproblems, after converting them from Boolean oracles (in different structures)\ninto Phase oracles, and then into the Hamiltonians of QAOA. From such a\nconversion, we noticed that the total utilized numbers of qubits and quantum\ngates are dramatically minimized for the final quantum circuits of\nHamiltonians. In this paper, arbitrary classical Boolean problems are examined\nby successfully solving them with our proposed methodology, using structures\nbased on various logic synthesis methods, an IBM quantum computer, and a\nclassical optimization minimizer. Accordingly, this methodology will provide\nbroad opportunities to solve many classical Boolean problems as Hamiltonians,\nfor the practical engineering applications of several algorithms, robotics,\nmachine learning, just to name a few, in the hybrid classical-quantum domain.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xyhEE4CgP9dy9onGSOjU_NjUzIdaq74tdtSuLk1SR9o","pdfSize":"685463"}
