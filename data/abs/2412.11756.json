  "abstract": "  We provide a novel sharp-interface analysis via Gamma-convergence for a\nnon-local and non-homogeneous diffuse-interface model for phase transitions,\nfeaturing an interplay between a non-local interaction kernel and a spatially\ndependent double-well potential. This interaction requires the development of\nnew strategies both for the Gamma-liminf inequality and for the construction of\nrecovery sequences. A key element of our approach is an asymptotic calibration,\nused to establish the Gamma-liminf lower bound. The study of the optimality of\nthe lower bound hinges upon a novel analysis of the regularity dependence of\none-dimensional optimal profiles on a family of parameters. In particular, we\nshow how such regularity is influenced by the singularity of the interaction\nkernel at the origin, providing a precise and previously unexplored link\nbetween the two. Our results rely solely on the assumption of H\\\"older\ncontinuity for the moving wells, and also account for the compactness of\nsequences with equibounded energies.\n",
