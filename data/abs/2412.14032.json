  "abstract": "  One of the challenges in diagrammatic simulations of nonequilibrium phenomena\nin lattice models is the large memory demand for storing momentum-dependent\ntwo-time correlation functions. This problem can be overcome with the recently\nintroduced quantics tensor train (QTT) representation of multivariable\nfunctions. Here, we demonstrate nonequilibrium $GW$ simulations with high\nmomentum resolution, up to times which exceed the capabilities of standard\nimplementations and are long enough to study, e.g., thermalization dynamics and\ntransient Floquet physics during multi-cycle electric field pulses. The\nself-consistent calculation on the three-leg Kadanoff-Baym contour employs only\nQTT-compressed functions, and input functions which are either generated\ndirectly in QTT form, or obtained via quantics tensor cross interpolation.\n",
