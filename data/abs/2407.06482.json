The magnitude of the peculiar acceleration is too large to be explained\nby disequilibrium effects of the Milky Way interacting with orbiting dwarf\ngalaxies ($\\sim$1 mm/s/yr), and too small to be caused by period variations due\nto the pulsar being a redback. We identify and examine two plausible causes for\nthe anomalous acceleration: a stellar flyby, and a long-period orbital\ncompanion. We identify a main-sequence star in \\textit{Gaia} DR3 and Pan-STARRS\nDR2 with the correct mass, distance, and on-sky position to potentially explain\nthe observed peculiar acceleration. However, the star and the pulsar system\nhave substantially different proper motions, indicating that they are not\ngravitationally bound. However, it is possible that this is an unrelated star\nthat just happens to be located near J2043+1711 along our line of sight (chance\nprobability of 1.6\\%). Therefore, we also constrain possible orbital parameters\nfor a circumbinary companion in a hierarchical triple system with J2043+1711;\nthe changes in the spindown rate of the pulsar are consistent with an outer\nobject that has an orbital period of 80 kyr, a companion mass of 0.3 $M_\\odot$\n(indicative of a white dwarf or low-mass star), and a semi-major axis of 2000\nAU. Continued timing and/or future faint optical observations of J2043+1711 may\neventually allow us to differentiate between these scenarios.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4HxuJqmzM94rh2uD8yUUpJP-ctScKKfXzh-J8NGx5T4","pdfSize":"1040735"}
