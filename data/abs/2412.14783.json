In this work, we propose to use a parametrized Gaussian\nBoson Sampler (GBS) with threshold detectors to address such problems. We map\ngeneral PUBO instance onto a quantum Hamiltonian and optimize the Conditional\nValue-at-Risk of its energy with respect to the GBS ansatz. In particular, we\nobserve that, when the algorithm reduces to standard Variational Quantum\nEigensolver, the cost function is analytical. Therefore, it can be computed\nefficiently, along with its gradient, for low-degree polynomials using only\nclassical computing resources. Numerical experiments on 3-SAT and Graph\nPartitioning problems show significant performance gains over random guessing,\nproviding a first proof of concept for our proposed approach.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"B9tfP9WMUM6lIicaGEFD96FX9nHI8EbBgE10IZ_60ow","pdfSize":"1270362"}
