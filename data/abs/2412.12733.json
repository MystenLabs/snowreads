  "abstract": "  Event relation detection is a fundamental NLP task, leveraged in many\ndownstream applications, whose modeling requires datasets annotated with event\nrelations of various types. However, systematic and complete annotation of\nthese relations is costly and challenging, due to the quadratic number of event\npairs that need to be considered. Consequently, many current event relation\ndatasets lack systematicity and completeness. In response, we introduce\n\\textit{EventFull}, the first tool that supports consistent, complete and\nefficient annotation of temporal, causal and coreference relations via a\nunified and synergetic process. A pilot study demonstrates that EventFull\naccelerates and simplifies the annotation process while yielding high\ninter-annotator agreement.\n",
