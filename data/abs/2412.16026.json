We describe entropy maximizers\nfor fixed mass and energy; our framework is very general, being valid in any\ndimension, for any dispersion relation, and even including the quantum kinetic\nwave equation. Of particular interest is the presence of condensation in\ncertain regimes which we characterize.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"F6dYof6nzY6d7Va45GT-D2X6xE2FF6QXlJxY5-awYRU","pdfSize":"210990"}
