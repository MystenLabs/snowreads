  "abstract": "  We investigate the (axial) quasinormal modes of black holes embedded in\ngeneric matter profiles. Our results reveal that the axial QNMs experience a\nredshift when the black hole is surrounded by various matter environments,\nproportional to the compactness of the matter halo. Our calculations\ndemonstrate that for static black holes embedded in galactic matter\ndistributions, there exists a universal relation between the matter environment\nand the redshifted vacuum quasinormal modes. In particular, for dilute\nenvironments the leading order effect is a redshift $1+U$ of frequencies and\ndamping times, with $U \\sim -{\\cal C}$ the Newtonian potential of the\nenvironment at its center, which scales with its compactness ${\\cal C}$.\n",
