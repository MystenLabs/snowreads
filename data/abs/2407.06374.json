In this article, we investigate a model of correlated\nBrownian motion in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, where the individual components are not\nnecessarily independent. We explore various statistical properties of the\nprocess under consideration, going beyond the conventional analysis of the\nsecond moment. Our particular focus lies on investigating the distribution of\nturning angles. This distribution reveals particularly interesting\ncharacteristics for processes with dependent components that are relevant to\napplications in diverse physical systems. Theoretical considerations are\nsupported by numerical simulations and analysis of two real-world datasets: the\nfinancial data of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard and Poor's\n500, and trajectories of polystyrene beads in water. Finally, we show that the\nmodel can be readily extended to trajectories with correlations that change\nover time.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-IzPd1VR22kzMZeu9wuv9kXt0sHgve0UT0-QValwzBQ","pdfSize":"2171113"}
