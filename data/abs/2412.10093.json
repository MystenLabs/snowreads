In\nastrophysics, AI has become essential, transforming the classification of\ncelestial sources, data modeling, and the interpretation of observations. In\nthis review, I highlight examples of AI applications in astrophysics, including\nsource classification, spectral energy distribution modeling, and discuss the\nadvancements achievable through generative AI. However, the use of AI\nintroduces challenges, including biases, errors, and the \"black box\" nature of\nAI models, which must be resolved before their application. These issues can be\naddressed through the concept of Human-Guided AI (HG-AI), which integrates\nhuman expertise and domain-specific knowledge into AI applications. This\napproach aims to ensure that AI is applied in a robust, interpretable, and\nethical manner, leading to deeper insights and fostering scientific excellence.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gsGY_WlBQuLzkQ95bALwpY-qZzZT1qhFh8pCKZTnmZM","pdfSize":"2202058"}
