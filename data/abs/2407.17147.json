It can be divided into four parts: The first part is an introduction to\nthe theory of monomorphism categories, including a short survey on some\nrepresentation theoretic results. The second part is a summary of some recent\nresults on monomorphism categories based on joint work with Nan Gao, Julian\nK\\\"ulshammer and Chrysostomos Psaroudakis. It also includes a new result,\nnamely a classification of all monomorphism categories of finite type over\ncyclic abelian groups. The third part concerns the relationship between\nsubmodule categories and $p$-valuated abelian groups. The last part contains a\nproof of wildness of a certain monomorphism category, rectifying a statement in\nthe literature.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CcN3AzL-_TiWL0Om2S70ZmLkkphMUamKKASexo2M43U","pdfSize":"516537"}
