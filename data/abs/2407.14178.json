It leverages interference, a cornerstone of quantum\ncomputing algorithms, to enable parallel computations. In this work, we\ninterweave quantum computing with classical structured light by formulating the\nprocess of photonic matrix multiplication using quantum mechanical principles\nsuch as state superposition and subsequently demonstrate a well known\nalgorithm, namely the Deutsch-Jozsa's algorithm. This is accomplished by\nelucidating the inherent tensor product structure within the Cartesian\ntransverse degrees of freedom of light, which is the main resource for optical\nvector-matrix multiplication. To this end, we establish a discrete basis using\nlocalized Gaussian modes arranged in a lattice formation and demonstrate the\noperation of a Hadamard Gate. Leveraging the reprogrammable and digital\ncapabilities of spatial light modulators, coupled with Fourier transforms by\nlenses, our approach proves adaptable to various algorithms. Therefore our work\nadvances the use of structured light for quantum information processing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pm9mcpCTnSzidg_VLvWKbaozSIfp8azX2tv-1tn9ivI","pdfSize":"7327749"}
