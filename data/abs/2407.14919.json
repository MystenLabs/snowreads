Here, a description of superfluid\nweight for zero-energy flat bands in proximity to other high-energy bands is\npresented, where they together form a singular band gap system. When the\nsingular band gap closes, the geometric and conventional contributions to the\nsuperfluid weight as a function of the superconducting gap exhibit different\ncrossover behaviors. The scaling behavior of superfluid weight with the band\ngap is studied in detail, and the effect on the Berezinskii-KosterlitzThouless\n(BKT) transition temperature is explored. It is discovered that tuning the\nsingular band gap provides a unique mechanism for enhancing the supercurrent\nand critical temperature of two-dimensional (2D) superconductors.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Egebp7yHqEVX1m8jJ0e7i7uWAXTsrOOrK9knrwe8PbU","pdfSize":"6147149"}
