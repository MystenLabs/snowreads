The excited states in the\nhydrogen atom are modelled with the help of a partition function, which\naccounts the internal degrees of freedom of the composed particle. A\ntemperature-dependent partition function with an asymptotic cut-off tail is\ndeduced from a solution of the quantum mechanical problem of the hydrogen atom\nin the plasma. We present a numerical simulation of hydrogen ionization,\ncalculated with two expressions for the partition function, Planck-Larkin (PL)\nand Starostin-Roerich (SR), respectively. The Hydrogen ionization is shifted\ntoward higher temperature in the SR-case compared to the PL-case. Different\nmodels for excited states of the hydrogen atom may change $\\Gamma_1$ by as much\nas $10^{-2}$. The behavior of the $\\Gamma_1$ profiles for pure hydrogen\nresembles `twisted ropes' for the two considered models. This significantly\naffects the helium ionization and the position of the helium hump. This\nentanglement of H and He effect gives us a chance to study a role of excited\nstates in the solar plasma.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"a7oi4JL79CyBrsGg-9SsZOlYHx9uJ0akJHkn8z-TH6M","pdfSize":"1049065"}
