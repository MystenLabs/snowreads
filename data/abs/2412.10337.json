We provide a comprehensive overview of\ngenerative AI use cases for clinicians, patients, clinical trial organizers,\nresearchers, and trainees. We then discuss the many challenges -- including\nmaintaining privacy and security, improving transparency and interpretability,\nupholding equity, and rigorously evaluating models -- which must be overcome to\nrealize this potential, and the open research directions they give rise to.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Computers and Society","Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cLrWdvGmqGtwSRSN7PiPGR2gAWDUOBqx6FJd1v3TmfA","pdfSize":"1218334"}
