Bras. Ens. F\\'is. vol. 45, 2023], the absence of the\nCognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML) in the curricula of Physics\nteacher education programs at Brazilian public universities was highlighted.\nConsidering this gap, the present study investigates whether, even without any\nformal prior knowledge of CTML principles (Coherence, Signaling, Spatial\nContiguity, Segmentation, Multimedia, and Personalization), Physics teacher\ntrainees and educators tend to choose, among two formats of multimedia\nmaterials - one aligned with a given CTML principle and the other not - the\nmaterials aligned with these principles. The findings of this case study\nrevealed that, although most participants generally selected materials aligned\nwith the mentioned principles, a significant portion did not. These results\nunderscore the importance of Brazilian universities considering the inclusion\nof CTML in Physics teacher education curricula.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eGJslWvIKu4iWPZm882eJJB2_MnXvoOjIcXeoos9olY","pdfSize":"1035250"}
