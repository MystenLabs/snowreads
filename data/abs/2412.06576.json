Long-lived nuclear spin states could serve\nas qubits addressed via coherent optical transitions. In order to realize an\nefficient spin-photon interface, we couple the emission from a single\nnanoparticle to a fiber-based microcavity under cryogenic conditions. The\nspatial and spectral tunability of the cavity permits us to place individual\nnanoparticles in the cavity, to measure the inhomogeneous linewidth of the\nions, and to show a multi-modal Purcell-enhancement of two transition in\nEu$^{\\text{3+}}$. A halving of the free-space lifetime to 1.0 ms is observed,\ncorresponding to a 140-fold enhancement of the respective transition.\nFurthermore, we observe a narrow optical linewidth of 3.3 MHz for a few-ion\nensemble in the center of the inhomogeneous line. The results represent an\nimportant step towards the efficient readout of single Eu$^{\\text{3+}}$ ions, a\nkey requirement for the realization of single-ion-level quantum processing\nnodes in the solid state.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"A4ZICVli4asD1UK4AbLXzXpSMtJHM72SKW3DLWNIcmA","pdfSize":"835977"}
