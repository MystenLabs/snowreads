The method is a variant of the Deterministic Information Bottleneck\nalgorithm which optimally compresses the data while retaining relevant\ninformation about the underlying structure. We compare the performance of the\nproposed method to that of three well-established clustering methods (KAMILA,\nK-Prototypes, and Partitioning Around Medoids with Gower's dissimilarity) on\nsimulated and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed\napproach represents a competitive alternative to conventional clustering\ntechniques under specific conditions.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tPflDH908xYlWU4-3V4TqkLYHcBFqo--rVXhjoWsYXM","pdfSize":"275660"}
