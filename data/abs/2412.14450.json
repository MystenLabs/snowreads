In particular, the sensitivity of axion dark matter\nexperiments using metamaterial plasmas (tunable plasma haloscopes) to\ngravitational waves has not been explored in detail. Here we perform a full\nanalysis of gravitational wave detection in plasma haloscopes, showing that the\nbaseline design of experiments such as ALPHA is several orders of magnitude\nless sensitive than previously thought. We show how simple changes to the\nexperiment can recover that sensitivity and lead to a powerful gravitational\nwave detector in the order of $(10-50)$ GHz frequency range.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Jtfitgt4kt8pt7RSF7CLSTpC5VvlxGx0FTzzxWvAawc","pdfSize":"1137502"}
