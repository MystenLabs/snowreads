We formulate and\nprove the generalizations of Friedman's Free Set and Thin Set theorems and of\nRainbow Ramsey's theorem to colorings of the Schreier barrier. We analyze the\nstrength of these theorems from the point of view of Computability Theory and\nReverse Mathematics. Surprisingly, the exactly $\\omega$-large counterparts of\nthe Thin Set and Free Set theorems can code $\\emptyset^{(\\omega)}$, while the\nexactly $\\omega$-large Rainbow Ramsey theorem does not code the halting set.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AD5ktBEE1K6RNUKTxTQbP3Xx6hg62L-yP30nnrvU2_o","pdfSize":"366460"}
