To compensate for the dead time effects, the\nphoton registration distribution is typically modeled based on the Markov chain\nself-excitation process. However, this is a discrete process and it is\ncomputationally expensive, thus hindering potential neural network applications\nand fast simulations. In this paper, we overcome the modeling challenge by\nproposing a continuous parametric model. We introduce a Gaussian-uniform\nmixture model (GUMM) and periodic padding to address high noise floors and\nnoise slopes respectively. By deriving and implementing a customized\nexpectation maximization (EM) algorithm, we achieve accurate histogram matching\nin scenarios that were deemed difficult in the literature.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"LZxUgy0CyDFHMI31-Da0DMwC9WikwC9rDDn7EIFepJc","pdfSize":"1970768"}
