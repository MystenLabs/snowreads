We used\nthe \\texttt{emcee} code for fitting CC data, a custom Markov Chain Monte Carlo\nimplementation for SNe and QSOs, and Anderson-Darling tests for normality on\nnormalized residuals for model comparison. Best-fit parameters are presented,\nconstrained by data within redshift ranges $z\\leq 2$ for CCs, $z\\leq 2.3$ for\nSNe, and $z\\leq 7.54$ for QSOs. Coasting models, particularly the flat coasting\nmodel, are generally favored over the flat $\\Lambda$CDM model. The overfitting\nof the flat $\\Lambda$CDM model to Pantheon+ SNe and the large intrinsic scatter\nin QSO data suggest a need to refine error estimates in these datasets. We also\nhighlight the seemingly fine-tuned nature of either the CC data or\n$\\Omega_{\\mathrm{m},0}$ in the flat $\\Lambda$CDM model to an ${H_1=H_0}$\ncoincidence when fitting ${H(z)=H_1z+H_0}$, a natural feature of coasting\nmodels.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"r9aL0_fqHy-i-lXbAcCP_kLmWhfnBynjuEWRscMD8k4","pdfSize":"804100"}
