Here, we examine the behavior of\nnarrow UV absorption lines seen in HST/COS spectra, both during the campaign\nand in other epochs extending over 14 years. We conclude that while the narrow\nabsorption outflow system (at -3750 km/s with FWHM=177 km/s) responds to the\nvariations of the UV continuum as modified by the X-ray obscurer, its total\ncolumn density (logNH =19.5 cm-2) did not change across all epochs. The\nadjusted ionization parameter (scaled with respect to the variations in the\nHydrogen ionizing continuum flux) is log UH =-1.0. The outflow is located at a\ndistance smaller than 38 parsecs from the central source, which implies a\nhydrogen density of nH > 3000 cm-3. The absorption outflow system only covers\nthe continuum emission source and not the broad emission line region, which\nsuggests that its transverse size is small (< 1e16 cm), with potential cloud\ngeometries ranging from spherical to elongated along the line of sight.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"o-JKoweG_cjtrTJXDV6XORW9Ztwe3qVAsLOY5eVoFyI","pdfSize":"2014298"}
