We report on\nlaser cooling and trapping of radium-225 ions and hyperfine splitting\nmeasurements of the ion's $7s$ $^2S_{1/2}$, $7p$ $^2P_{1/2}$, and $6d$\n$^2D_{3/2}$ states. We measured the ground state hyperfine constant,\n$A(^2S_{1/2}) = -27.684511056(9)\\ \\mathrm{GHz}$, and the quadratic Zeeman\ncoefficient, $C_2 = 142.3(10)\\ \\mathrm{Hz\\ G}^{-2}$, of the $^2S_{1/2} (F=0,\nm_F = 0) \\leftrightarrow~^2S_{1/2} (F=1, m_{F} = 0)$ transition. We also\nmeasured the hyperfine constants of the $^2P_{1/2}$ state, $A(^2P_{1/2}) =\n-5.447(4)\\ \\mathrm{GHz}$, and the $^2D_{3/2}$ state, $A(^2D_{3/2}) =\n-619.7(11)\\ \\mathrm{MHz}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bNQGXHUqmS50rq7QK_aX7G-MIEZ__A04UrpqAjofU4s","pdfSize":"671387"}
