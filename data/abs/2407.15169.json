Despite the availability of numerous\ntechniques for detecting manipulated images captured by conventional cameras,\ntheir applicability to medical images is limited. This limitation stems from\nthe distinctive forensic characteristics of medical images, a result of their\nimaging process.\n  In this work we propose a novel anomaly detector for medical imagery based on\ndiffusion models. Normally, diffusion models are used to generate images.\nHowever, we show how a similar process can be used to detect synthetic content\nby making a model reverse the diffusion on a suspected image. We evaluate our\nmethod on the task of detecting fake tumors injected and removed from CT and\nMRI scans. Our method significantly outperforms other state of the art\nunsupervised detectors with an increased AUC of 0.9 from 0.79 for injection and\nof 0.96 from 0.91 for removal on average.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"uA0H6-1-QtXCNugX38TlGSmBZyddHH7uEflnw3SAPgs","pdfSize":"940737"}
