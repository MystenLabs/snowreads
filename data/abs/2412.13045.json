Baryon acoustic\noscillation (BAO) observations released by the DESI survey, allow us to\ndetermine $H_0$ from the first principles. Our method is purely data-driven and\nrelies on unanchored luminosity distances reconstructed from SN Ia data and\n$H(z)$ reconstruction from cosmic chronometers. Thus it circumvents\ncalibrations related to the value of the sound horizon size at the baryon drag\nepoch or intrinsic luminosity of SN Ia. We find $H_0=68.4^{+1.0}_{-0.8}~{\\rm\nkm~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ at 68% C.L., which provides the Hubble constant at an\naccuracy of 1.3% with minimal assumptions. Our assessments of this fundamental\ncosmological quantity using the BAO data spanning the redshift range\n$z=0.51-2.33$ agree very well with Planck's results and TRGB results within\n$1\\sigma$. This result is still in a $4.3\\sigma$ tension with the results of\nthe Supernova H0 for the Equation of State (SH0ES).\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9B5ykQkjqqebue77AJPN--03D8TTK7GCjDogiLuPUjo","pdfSize":"1799174"}
