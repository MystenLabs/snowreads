These models often rely on weighted averaging\ntechniques over time intervals. However, real-world time series data is seldom\nisolated and is frequently influenced by non-numeric factors. For instance,\nstock price fluctuations are impacted by daily random events in the broader\nworld, with each event exerting a unique influence on price signals.\nPreviously, forecasts in financial markets have been approached in two main\nways: either as time-series problems over price sequence or sentiment analysis\ntasks. The sentiment analysis tasks aim to determine whether news events will\nhave a positive or negative impact on stock prices, often categorizing them\ninto discrete labels. Recognizing the need for a more comprehensive approach to\naccurately model time series prediction, we propose a collaborative modeling\nframework that incorporates textual information about relevant events for\npredictions. Specifically, we leverage the intuition of large language models\nabout future changes to update real number time series predictions. We\nevaluated the effectiveness of our approach on financial market data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"79m7OJipGIK7k9qYP4eGDHfIpLdTvqK0SkW_z2JnJmI","pdfSize":"437150"}
