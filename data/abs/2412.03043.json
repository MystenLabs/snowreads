  "abstract": "  We theoretically introduce synthetic non-Abelian gauge fields for topological\nquantum walks. The photonic mesh lattice configuration is generalized with\npolarization multiplexing to achieve a four-dimensional Hilbert space, based on\nwhich we provide photonic building blocks for realizing various quantum walks\nin non-Abelian gauge fields. It is found that SU(2) gauge fields can lead to\nPeierls substitution in both momenta and quasienergy. In one and two\ndimensions, we describe detailed photonic setups to realize topological quantum\nwalk protocols whose Floquet winding numbers and Rudner-Lindner-Berg-Levin\ninvariants can be effectively controlled by the gauge fields. Finally, we show\nhow non-Abelian gauge fields facilitate convenient simulation of entanglement\nin conjunction with polarization-dependent and spatial-mode-dependent coin\noperations. Our results shed light on the study of synthetic non-Abelian gauge\nfields in photonic Floquet systems.\n",
