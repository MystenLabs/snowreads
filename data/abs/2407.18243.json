To\nfacilitate developing technologies that can help preserve privacy, we introduce\nBIV-Priv-Seg, the first localization dataset originating from people with\nvisual impairments that shows private content. It contains 1,028 images with\nsegmentation annotations for 16 private object categories. We first\ncharacterize BIV-Priv-Seg and then evaluate modern models' performance for\nlocating private content in the dataset. We find modern models struggle most\nwith locating private objects that are not salient, small, and lack text as\nwell as recognizing when private content is absent from an image. We facilitate\nfuture extensions by sharing our new dataset with the evaluation server at\nhttps://vizwiz.org/tasks-and-datasets/object-localization.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dE0MV8bWi7mbTEiY2fF-Us_oKbJ5jU-6-BuMcQJ48oU","pdfSize":"5165134"}
