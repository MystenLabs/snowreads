  "abstract": "  A crossover involving three-fermion clusters is relevant to the hadron-quark\ncrossover, which, if occurring in a neutron star, could naturally reproduce the\ndense-matter equation of state recently deduced from simultaneous observations\nof neutron-star masses and radii. To understand the crossover mechanism, we\nexamine the role of tripling fluctuations induced by the formation of\nthree-fermion clusters. The phase-shift representation of fluctuations\nmanifests an interplay of bound and scattering states, leading to non-monotonic\nmomentum distributions of baryon-like clusters and peaked sound speed at finite\ndensities. We demonstrate them by applying our approach to a nonrelativistic\nsystem of one-dimensional three-color fermions analogous to the hadron-quark\nmatter.\n",
