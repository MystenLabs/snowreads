  "abstract": "  The inert doublet model (IDM), a minimal extension of the Standard Model\n(SM), provides a scalar dark matter (DM) candidate that belongs to the\nadditional Higgs doublet. The model faces challenges in achieving the correct\nrelic abundance for compressed spectra and DM masses in the high-mass range. In\nthis work we introduce a $Z_2$-odd singlet vector-like quark (VLQ) into the IDM\nframework that helps us alleviate these issues and provide new channels of\ncontributions to the relic abundance. The VLQ not only enhances the DM relic\nabundance for masses above $~550$ GeV but also eases constraints from direct\ndetection experiments by enabling smaller couplings between the inert scalars\nand the SM Higgs. We analyze the impact of the VLQ on DM phenomenology,\nincluding relic density, direct and indirect detection constraints. The results\ndemonstrate that the extended IDM framework not only resolves existing\nlimitations in the compressed spectrum but also offers exciting prospects for\ndetection in current and future collider experiments.\n",
