This kinematic\nregion has a smaller particle density and may undergo different nuclear effects\nbefore and after the hard process when compared to mid-rapidity production. The\nlatest PHENIX runs contain a large data set which allows, for the first time,\nthe study of heavy flavor and $J/\\psi$ flow at the large rapidity region in\nAu$+$Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=$200 GeV. This measurement has the\npotential to reveal a medium evolution distinct from that known at\nmid-rapidity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OYuJIegkbMMNXXuZkzzIUCwz-aonL6dHjkLHaSms0MU","pdfSize":"2316002"}
