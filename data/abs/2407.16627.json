This result is in contrast to the\nquestion of finding \\emph{a} solution to the same problem, where efficient (and\nstable) algorithms are known to succeed at sufficiently low density. This\nresult suggests that the solutions found efficiently -- whenever this task is\npossible -- must be highly atypical, and therefore provides an example of a\nproblem where search is efficiently possible but approximate sampling from the\nset of solutions is not, at least within these two classes of algorithms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Cs4BtJeadECAE4s2snXbVo6O6786IZ6eXnafRe0gjbI","pdfSize":"233452"}
