  "abstract": "  The linear stability of miscible displacement for radial source flow at\ninfinite P\\'eclet number in a Hele-Shaw cell is calculated theoretically. The\naxisymmetric self-similar flow is shown to be unstable to viscous fingering if\nthe viscosity ratio $m$ between ambient and injected fluids exceeds $3\\over2$\nand to be stable if $m<{3\\over2}$. If $1<m<{3\\over2}$ small disturbances decay\nat rates between $t^{-3/4}$ and $t^{-1}$ relative to the $t^{1/2}$ radius of\nthe axisymmetric base-state similarity solution; if $m<1$ they decay faster\nthan $t^{-1}$. Asymptotic analysis confirms these results and gives physical\ninsight into various features of the numerically determined relationship\nbetween the growth rate and the azimuthal wavenumber and viscosity ratio.\n",
