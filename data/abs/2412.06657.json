  "abstract": "  In this paper we derive a Hamilton-Jacobi equation with obstacle from a\ndiscrete linear integro-differential model in population dynamics, with\nexponentially decaying mutation kernel. The fact that the kernel has\nexponential decay leads to a modification of the classical Hamilton-Jacobi\nequation obtained previously from continuous models in \\cite{BMP}. We consider\na population parameterized by a scaling parameter $K$ and composed of\nindividuals characterized by a quantitative trait, subject to selection and\nmutation. In the regime of large population $K\\rightarrow +\\infty,$ small\nmutations and large time we prove that the WKB transformation of the density\nconverges to the unique viscosity solution of a Hamilton-Jacobi equation with\nobstacle.\n",
