Early models showed\nthat they can be created through sustained eccentricity damping driving a slow\nseparation of the orbits, but this picture is inconsistent with elevated\neccentricities measured through Transit Timing Variations. We argue that any\nsource of divergent migration (tides, planet-disk interactions etc.) will cause\nplanets that encounter an MMR to both jump over it (piling up wide of\nresonance) and get a kick to their free eccentricity. We find that the jumps in\neccentricity expected from slow MMR crossings are sufficient (but mostly too\nlarge) to explain the free eccentricities measured through TTVs. We argue that\nthis mechanism can be brought in line with observations if MMR crossings are\nnot adiabatic and/or through residual eccentricity damping.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XD7K7XyrXKk9VeP4eqty8NWK1CUkltc94eB6-LQ7v68","pdfSize":"967368"}
