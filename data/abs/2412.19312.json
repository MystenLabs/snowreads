Each term, students must choose among\nmany thousands of offerings, spanning dozens of subject areas, a handful of\ncourses to take. The curricular environment is also dynamic, and poor\ncommunication and search functions on campus can limit a student's ability to\ndiscover new courses of interest. To support both students and their advisers\nin such a setting, we explore a novel Large Language Model (LLM) course\nrecommendation system that applies a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\nmethod to the corpus of course descriptions. The system first generates an\n'ideal' course description based on the user's query. This description is\nconverted into a search vector using embeddings, which is then used to find\nactual courses with similar content by comparing embedding similarities. We\ndescribe the method and assess the quality and fairness of some example\nprompts. Steps to deploy a pilot system on campus are discussed.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Information Retrieval","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MnHUBJKl2nWvs5xM4pRm3Iu1M4k97Iqy9RQZ605Pqts","pdfSize":"2023493"}
