Although insightful, such approaches\nlimit the knowledge captured in textual representations of the spoken language.\nTo overcome this limitation, we investigate the potential of the Featural\nInfoWaveGAN model to learn iterative long-distance vowel harmony using raw\nspeech data. We focus on Assamese, a language known for its phonologically\nregressive and word-bound vowel harmony. We demonstrate that the model is adept\nat grasping the intricacies of Assamese phonotactics, particularly iterative\nlong-distance harmony with regressive directionality. It also produced\nnon-iterative illicit forms resembling speech errors during human language\nacquisition. Our statistical analysis reveals a preference for a specific\n[+high,+ATR] vowel as a trigger across novel items, indicative of feature\nlearning. More data and control could improve model proficiency, contrasting\nthe universality of learning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"On9-MTgV30aPo5k3-wVrEKfDifsCQF40LC39sCyu9k8","pdfSize":"2644526"}
