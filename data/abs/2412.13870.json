However, the nature of the emitted radiation\nfrom heavy metal~/~antiferromagnet heterostructures has sparked debates and\ncontroversies in the literature. Here, we unambiguously separate spin and\ncharge contributions from Pt~/~NiO heterostructures by introducing an\nunprecedented methodology combining high external magnetic fields with a\nsymmetry analysis of the emitted terahertz polarization. We observe two\ndistinct mechanisms of terahertz emission which we identify as optical\ndifference frequency generation and ultrafast laser-induced quenching of the\nmagnetization. We emphasize the absence of spin transport effects and\nsignatures of coherent magnons. Overall, our work provides a general\nexperimental methodology to separate spin and charge contributions to the\nlaser-induced terahertz emission from heterostructures comprising a\nmagnetically ordered material thus holding great potential for advancing\nterahertz spintronics and establishing terahertz orbitronics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GC6CQ0o7WPJsDljynKQkDqvTjb0g-CIW4jNTWKuEl5k","pdfSize":"1137631"}
