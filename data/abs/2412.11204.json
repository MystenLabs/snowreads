We model the resulting linear interaction of the condensate with\nthe atomic gas as a quenched disorder. Using the distributional zeta function\nmethod, we obtained a representation for the quenched free energy as a series\nof integral moments of the partition function. Assuming that the Bose-Einstein\ncondensate is confined between two planar surfaces, we show that random surface\nfields generate non-local terms in the effective action. The non-local effects\nin this condensed matter system define an analog model for Euclidean wormhole.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9RjkKQT9kpt2k3PzGEYwwQRzfoSjGdJVnh3JRnR4j5A","pdfSize":"432559"}
