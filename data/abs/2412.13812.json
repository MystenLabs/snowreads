By their construction, these characteristic elements are realized\nas elements in an appropriate localized $K_1$-group. In this paper, we will\nintroduce a notion of modulo $p$ for these elements and study some of their\nproperties. As an application, we study the Greenberg Selmer group of a tensor\nproduct of modular forms, where $p$ is an Eisenstein prime for one of these\nforms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wQFpE_Od_MpmKhcIAZ2mH5d8_6m0c1A5lJwAw4b_tuo","pdfSize":"299632"}
