This\nnew tensorial formulation of the theory of quanta -- basically, an extension of\nHeisenberg's matrix mechanics -- allows not only to escape the many problems\npresent in the current account of multi-partite entanglement grounded on the\nDirac-Von Neumann Standard formulation of Quantum Mechanics (SQM) but, more\nimportantly, to consistently represent entanglement phenomena when considering\na multiplicity of different screens and detectors.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GnW1QZtELiQLy1lDPnuqExVs-5QqU9XeZ2QmQvjNmMo","pdfSize":"475786"}
