  "abstract": "  Let $M$ be an $n\\times n$ real symmetric matrix. The spread of $M$ is defined\nas the difference between its largest and smallest eigenvalue. When considering\nthe spread of graph-related matrices, this topic has attracted significant\nattention, resulting in a substantial collection of findings. In this paper, we\nstudy a general spread problem regarding $A_{\\alpha}$-matrix of graphs. The\n$A_{\\alpha}$-matrix of a graph $G$, introduced by Nikiforov in 2017, is a\nconvex combinations of its diagonal degree matrix $D(G)$ and adjacency matrix\n$A(G)$, defined as $A_{\\alpha} (G) = \\alpha D(G) + (1-\\alpha) A(G)$. Let\n$\\lambda_1^{(\\alpha)} (G)$ and $\\lambda_n^{(\\alpha)} (G)$ denote the largest\nand least eigenvalues of $A_{\\alpha} (G)$, respectively. We determined the\nunique graph that maximizes $\\lambda^{(\\alpha)}_1 (G) -\n\\beta\\cdot\\lambda^{(\\gamma)}_n (G)$ among all connected $n$-vertex graphs for\nsufficiently large $n$, where $0 \\leq \\alpha < 1$, $1/2\\leq \\gamma < 1$ and\n$0<\\beta\\gamma\\leq 1$. As applications, we confirm a conjecture proposed by\nLin, Miao, and Guo [Linear Algebra Appl. 606 (2020) 1--22], and derive a new\nfinding.\n",
