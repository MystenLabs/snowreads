In this research, we propose an efficient tool wear\nsegmentation approach based on Segment Anything Model, which integrates U-Net\nas an automated prompt generator to streamline the processes of tool wear\ndetection. Our evaluation covered three Point-of-Interest generation methods\nand further investigated the effects of variations in training dataset sizes\nand U-Net training intensities on resultant wear segmentation outcomes. The\nresults consistently highlight our approach's advantage over U-Net, emphasizing\nits ability to achieve accurate wear segmentation even with limited training\ndatasets. This feature underscores its potential applicability in industrial\nscenarios where datasets may be limited.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"qrk2m0Rai_3RN8wib7U1LZgHxttZ4jLwGNvs79z7Vvc","pdfSize":"740022"}
