  "abstract": "  The differential probability of the process of Compton ionization of a\nhydrogen atom by a cylindrical electromagnetic wave is calculated taking into\naccount the finite size of the target, which resulted in the appearance of a\ndependence of this value on the angular momentum of the cylindrical wave. It is\nshown that the use of a cylindrical wave instead of a plane wave does not lead\nto new angular distributions of the reaction products.\n",
