The new approach avoids the artifact of superfluous damping\ninherent in underdamped spectral densities. We show that the new HEOM is a\nuseful model for intramolecular vibrations in condensed phase molecules.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"k7YSrJRrmNunZ5snb8_t0IQvfZRZwnGpTDXk9BGBX9s","pdfSize":"445746"}
