  "abstract": "  This research presents a three-step causal inference framework that\nintegrates correlation analysis, machine learning-based causality discovery,\nand LLM-driven interpretations to identify socioeconomic factors influencing\ncarbon emissions and contributing to climate change. The approach begins with\nidentifying correlations, progresses to causal analysis, and enhances decision\nmaking through LLM-generated inquiries about the context of climate change. The\nproposed framework offers adaptable solutions that support data-driven\npolicy-making and strategic decision-making in climate-related contexts,\nuncovering causal relationships within the climate change domain.\n",
