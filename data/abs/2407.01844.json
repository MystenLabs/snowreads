{"id":"2407.01844","title":"An Efficient and Sybil Attack Resistant Voting Mechanism","authors":"Jeremias Lenzi","authorsParsed":[["Lenzi","Jeremias",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2024 22:58:27 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-03","timestamp":1719874707000,"abstract":"  Voting mechanisms are widely accepted and used methods for decentralized\ndecision-making. Ensuring the acceptance of the voting mechanism's outcome is a\ncrucial characteristic of robust voting systems. Consider this scenario: A\ngroup of individuals wants to choose an option from a set of alternatives\nwithout requiring an identification or proof-of-personhood system. Moreover,\nthey want to implement utilitarianism as their selection criteria. In such a\ncase, players could submit votes multiple times using dummy accounts, commonly\nknown as a Sybil attack (SA), which presents a challenge for decentralized\norganizations. Is there a voting mechanism that always prevents players from\nbenefiting by casting votes multiple times (SA-proof) while also selecting the\nalternative that maximizes the added valuations of all players (efficient)?\nOne-person-one-vote is neither SA-proof nor efficient. Coin voting is SA-proof\nbut not efficient. Quadratic voting is efficient but not SA-proof. This study\nuses Bayesian mechanism design to propose a solution. The mechanism's structure\nis as follows: Players make wealth deposits to indicate the strength of their\npreference for each alternative. Each player then receives an amount based on\ntheir deposit and the voting outcome. The proposed mechanism relies on two main\nconcepts: 1) Transfers are influenced by the outcome in a way that each\nplayer's optimal action depends only on individual preferences and the number\nof alternatives; 2) A player who votes through multiple accounts slightly\nreduces the expected utility of all players more than the individual benefit\ngained. This study demonstrates that if players are risk-neutral and each\nplayer has private information about their preferences and beliefs, then the\nmechanism is SA-proof and efficient. This research provides new insights into\nthe design of more robust decentralized decision-making mechanisms.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vSrhWdL4AWIZ1eNoJspE3YfPEQDo4Sh2HmkXximmCVg","pdfSize":"152574"}
