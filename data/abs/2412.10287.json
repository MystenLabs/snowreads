But the performance of\n2-RPQs on real-world graphs is still a bottleneck for wider adoption. A new\nsingle-source 2-RPQ algorithm based on linear algebra is proposed. Utilization\nof high-performance sparse linear algebra libraries for the algorithm\nimplementation allows one to achieve significant speedup over competitors on\nreal-world data and queries. Our implementation demonstrates better performance\non average on Wikidata and the respective query log in comparison with\nMillenniumDB, FalkorDB, and the algorithm of Diego Arroyuelo et al.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HoIg-0ThlSDCw4Ix5aNlOl6W-ZwJ_paCyiljPjqrcd4","pdfSize":"1797540"}
