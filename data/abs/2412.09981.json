  "abstract": "  Image forgery localization (IFL) is a crucial technique for preventing\ntampered image misuse and protecting social safety. However, due to the rapid\ndevelopment of image tampering technologies, extracting more comprehensive and\naccurate forgery clues remains an urgent challenge. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce a novel information-theoretic IFL framework named\nSUMI-IFL that imposes sufficiency-view and minimality-view constraints on\nforgery feature representation. First, grounded in the theoretical analysis of\nmutual information, the sufficiency-view constraint is enforced on the feature\nextraction network to ensure that the latent forgery feature contains\ncomprehensive forgery clues. Considering that forgery clues obtained from a\nsingle aspect alone may be incomplete, we construct the latent forgery feature\nby integrating several individual forgery features from multiple perspectives.\nSecond, based on the information bottleneck, the minimality-view constraint is\nimposed on the feature reasoning network to achieve an accurate and concise\nforgery feature representation that counters the interference of task-unrelated\nfeatures. Extensive experiments show the superior performance of SUMI-IFL to\nexisting state-of-the-art methods, not only on in-dataset comparisons but also\non cross-dataset comparisons.\n",
