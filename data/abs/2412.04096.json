The vector components along the line of sight were\nrestored from the spatially resolved spectral analysis of the Doppler shifts of\nSi XIII and S XV lines. The components in the plane of the sky were derived\nfrom analysis of the proper motion of the remnant's edge at different azimuths.\nThis has been done by using the data of X-ray observations from Chandra\nobservatory as well as the radio data from the Very Large Array.\n  Differences in Doppler velocities over the Tycho's SNR are of the order of\nthousands of km/s. The speed of the ejecta on the opposite sides of the remnant\nas a three-dimensional object differs on 20-30%. There are asymmetries and\ndifferences in the spatial distributions between the Si-reach and S-reach\nejecta components. Namely, the level of isotropy is higher in Si while the\nvector components directed outward of the observer are larger in S. This puts\nlimitations on the level of deviation of the internal structure of the\nprogenitor star from the ideal layered structure as well as on the level of\nasymmetries in supernova explosion.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iVnFuzm2kWb461-fCL5BAAokkeTQACFNRTNGVxn_xhs","pdfSize":"8772582"}
