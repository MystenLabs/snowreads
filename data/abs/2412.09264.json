  "abstract": "  The MAP problem in Bayesian networks is notoriously intractable, even when\napproximated. In an earlier paper we introduced the Most Frugal Explanation\nheuristic approach to solving MAP, by partitioning the set of intermediate\nvariables (neither observed nor part of the MAP variables) into a set of\nrelevant variables, which are marginalized out, and irrelevant variables, which\nwill be assigned a sampled value from their domain. In this study we explore\nwhether knowledge about which variables are relevant for a particular query\n(i.e., domain knowledge) speeds up computation sufficiently to beat both exact\nMAP as well as approximate MAP while giving reasonably accurate results. Our\nresults are inconclusive, but also show that this probably depends on the\nspecifics of the MAP query, most prominently the number of MAP variables.\n",
