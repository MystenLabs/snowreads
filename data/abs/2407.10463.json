Through the derived wavefunction solution, we\nillustrate the dynamics of slowing, stopping, reversing, fragmentation,\ncollapse, and revival of droplets. Additionally, the solutions reveal a\ncrystalline order with a superfluid background, indicative of supersolid\nbehavior in various parameter domains. Notably, one-third of the constant\nbackground matches the lowest residual condensate. These findings hold\npotential applications in matter-wave interferometry and quantum information\nprocessing.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"chpE_BAJArFcFRK5AU_KAtmkyc-d76jaaX2dtO6ERVg","pdfSize":"1980601"}
