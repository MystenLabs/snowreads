Given an ideal $I$ in the polynomial ring $K[x_1,\\dots,x_n]$\nover a field $K$, this method searches for tuples $Z=(z_1,\\dots,z_s)$ of\nindeterminates with the property that $I$ contains polynomials of the form $f_i\n= z_i - h_i$ for $i=1,\\dots,s$ such that no term in $h_i$ is divisible by an\nindeterminate in $Z$. As there are frequently many candidate tuples $Z$, the\ntask addressed by this paper is to efficiently check whether a given tuple $Z$\nhas this property. We construct fast algorithms which check whether the vector\nspace spanned by the generators of $I$ or a somewhat enlarged vector space\ncontain the desired polynomials $f_i$. We also extend these algorithms to\nBoolean polynomials and apply them to cryptoanalyse round reduced versions of\nthe AES cryptosystem faster.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"mSO6lSWlOeaMT4IW9-eHmRax9SsQHu0lz7OGYTcHE4U","pdfSize":"836132"}
