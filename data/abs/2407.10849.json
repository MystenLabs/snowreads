Establishing quantitative\nstability for this equation usually refers to finding a nonnegative function\n$F$ such that the following estimate \\begin{equation*}\n  \\inf_{\\substack{U_i\\in\\mathcal{M}\n  1\\leq i\\leq\\nu}}\\norm*{u-\\sum_{i=1}^\\nu U_i}_{D_a^{1,2}(\\R^n)}\\leq\nC(a,b,n)F(\\norm*{H(u)}_{D_a^{-1,2}(\\R^n)}) \\end{equation*} holds for any\nnonnegative function $u$ satisfying \\begin{equation*}\n  \\left(\\nu-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)S(a,b,n)^{\\frac{p}{p-2}}\\leq\\int_{\\R^n}|x|^{-2a}|\\nabla\nu|^2\\mathrm{d}x\\leq \\left(\\nu+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)S(a,b,n)^{\\frac{p}{p-2}}.\n\\end{equation*} Here $\\nu\\in\\N_+$ and $\\mathcal{M}$ denotes the set of positive\nsolutions to this equation. When $(a,b)$ falls above the Felli-Schneider curve,\nWei and Wu \\cite{Wei} found an optimal $F$. Their proof relies heavily on the\nfact that $\\mathcal{M}$ is non-degenerate. When $(a,b)$ falls on the\nFelli-Schneider curve, due to the absence of the non-degeneracy condition, it\nbecomes complicated and technical to find a suitable $F$. In this paper, we\nfocus on this case. When $\\nu=1$, we obtain an optimal $F$. When $\\nu\\geq2$ and\n$u$ is not too degenerate, we also derive an optimal $F$. To our knowledge, the\nresults in this paper provide the first instance of degenerate stability in the\ncritical point setting. We believe that our methods will be useful in other\nworks on degenerate stability.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BTVXzdl3LcfstzzvfqeKT2ZH5iLuJPx4MvVySHUEWsc","pdfSize":"359289"}
