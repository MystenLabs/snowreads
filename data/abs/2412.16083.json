We introduce DP-Fed-FinDiff framework, a novel integration\nof Differential Privacy, Federated Learning and Denoising Diffusion\nProbabilistic Models designed to generate high-fidelity synthetic tabular data.\nThis framework ensures compliance with stringent privacy regulations while\nmaintaining data utility. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DP-Fed-FinDiff on\nmultiple real-world financial datasets, achieving significant improvements in\nprivacy guarantees without compromising data quality. Our empirical evaluations\nreveal the optimal trade-offs between privacy budgets, client configurations,\nand federated optimization strategies. The results affirm the potential of\nDP-Fed-FinDiff to enable secure data sharing and robust analytics in highly\nregulated domains, paving the way for further advances in federated learning\nand privacy-preserving data synthesis.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"j92VX1OrRB4wbONxWB6Zlpk985yNOS35YUjWChbRZfI","pdfSize":"8930419"}
