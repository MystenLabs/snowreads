Expanding on this established framework, we explore a\nnovel regime characterized by a low reheating temperature that offers an\nalternative to the conventional thermal relic paradigm. This approach opens new\npossibilities for understanding the dynamics of the dark sector, encompassing\nboth the dark matter particles (fermion, scalar and vector) and the spin-two\nmediators. Our analysis examines the constraints imposed by the relic abundance\nof DM, collider experiments, and direct detection searches, spanning a wide\nmass range for the dark sector, from very light to extremely heavy states. This\nwork opens new possibilities for the phenomenology of GMDM.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"p_uOftnl4Cw3IwRIiI9k9XH_wM6chByVCWX0bzq1GKA","pdfSize":"2510543"}
