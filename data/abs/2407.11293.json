We use a Fisher\nmatrix analysis and consider for each source the averaged detection accuracy\nover a realistic range of parameters. We find that on average TianQin obtains\nmore accurate parameter estimation for DWDs and light IMRIs, LISA for heavy\nIMRIs, EMRIs, MBHBs, and the galactic foreground of the SGWB, and both\ncontribute similarly to the detection of SBHBs and the extra-galactic SGWB.\nNevertheless, for all sources joint detection allows setting tighter\nconstraints on most parameters highlighting its importance for future\ndetection.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"ErvwXN0qS0n4NjlX-f0FvfTiD9PiVhv7qIi7jzVbIxc","pdfSize":"459404","objectId":"0x19d06e04887890280e5d3cf97e696c65f0ea5628bf516f619ffc0b311b5bc3aa","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
