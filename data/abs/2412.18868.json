  "abstract": "  Starting in 2003 when the first MWE workshop was held with ACL in Sapporo,\nJapan, this year, the joint workshop of MWE-UD co-located with the LREC-COLING\n2024 conference marked the 20th anniversary of MWE workshop events over the\npast nearly two decades. Standing at this milestone, we look back to this\nworkshop series and summarise the research topics and methodologies researchers\nhave carried out over the years. We also discuss the current challenges that we\nare facing and the broader impacts/synergies of MWE research within the CL and\nNLP fields. Finally, we give future research perspectives. We hope this\nposition paper can help researchers, students, and industrial practitioners\ninterested in MWE get a brief but easy understanding of its history, current,\nand possible future.\n",
