  "abstract": "  In this article we introduce an original model in order to study the\nemergence of chaos in a reaction diffusion system in the presence of self- and\ncross-diffusion terms. A Fourier Spectral Method is derived to approximate\nequilibria and orbits of the latter. Special attention is paid to accuracy, a\nnecessary condition when one wants to catch periodic orbits and to perform\ntheir linear stability analysis via Floquet multipliers. Bifurcations with\nrespect to a single control parameter are studied in four different regimes of\ndiffusion: linear diffusion, self-diffusion for each of the two species, and\ncross-diffusion. Key observations are made: development of original Turing\npatterns, Hopf bifurcations leading to oscillating patterns and period doubling\ncascades leading to chaos. Eventually, original strange attractors are reported\nin phase space.\n",
