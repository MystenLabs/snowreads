  "abstract": "  Membrane proteins often need to be inserted into or attached on the cell\nmembrane to perform their functions. Understanding their transmembrane topology\nand conformational dynamics during insertion is crucial for elucidating their\nroles. However, it remains challenging to monitor nanoscale changes in\ninsertion depth of individual proteins in membranes. Here, we introduce two\nsingle molecule imaging methods, SIFA and LipoFRET, designed for in vitro\nobservation of the nanoscale architecture of membrane proteins within\nmembranes. These methods have demonstrated their efficacy in studying\nbiomolecules interacting with bio-membranes with sub-nanometer precision.\n",
