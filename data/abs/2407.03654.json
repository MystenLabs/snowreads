Our approach\nemploys a mean-teacher framework with domain generalization to integrate\nheterogeneous training data, while preserving the SED model performance across\nthe datasets. Specifically, we first apply mixstyle to the frequency dimension\nto adapt the mel-spectrograms from different domains. Next, we use the adaptive\nresidual normalization method to generalize features across multiple domains by\napplying instance normalization in the frequency dimension. Lastly, we use the\nsound event bounding boxes method for post-processing. Our approach integrates\nfeatures from bidirectional encoder representations from audio transformers and\na convolutional recurrent neural network. We evaluate the proposed approach on\nDCASE 2024 Challenge Task 4 dataset, measuring polyphonic SED score (PSDS) on\nthe DESED dataset and macro-average pAUC on the MAESTRO dataset. The results\nindicate that the proposed DG-based method improves both PSDS and macro-average\npAUC compared to the challenge baseline.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CJKcPNB2XOuq5iv8Yul2TEaxlnP8AEWmvQWAjxX7DpU","pdfSize":"494682"}
