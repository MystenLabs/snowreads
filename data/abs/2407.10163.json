The momentum is sought in an $H(\\mathrm{div})$-conforming\nspace, ensuring exact pointwise mass conservation at the discrete level. We use\nan explicit discontinuous Galerkin-based discretization for the convective\nterms, while treating the pressure and viscous terms implicitly, so that the\nCFL condition depends only on the fluid velocity. To handle shocks and damp\nspurious oscillations in the compressible regime, we incorporate an a\nposteriori limiter that employs artificial viscosity and is based on a discrete\nmaximum principle. By using hybridization, the final algorithm requires solving\nonly symmetric positive definite linear systems. As the Mach number approaches\nzero and the density remains constant, the method converges to an\n$H(\\mathrm{div})$-based discretization of the incompressible Navier-Stokes\nequations in the vorticity-velocity-pressure formulation. Several numerical\ntests validate the proposed method.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"xVSiHpT242c1YR1CbRTXDIoPMPyB5hMptQcI9lOmPBI","pdfSize":"11092308"}
