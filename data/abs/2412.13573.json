Recent theory has shown that seeking\nthe deep models, whose parameters lie in the flat minima of the loss landscape,\ncan significantly reduce the out-of-domain generalization error. However,\nexisting methods often neglect the consistency of loss landscapes in different\ndomains, resulting in models that are not simultaneously in the optimal flat\nminima in all domains, which limits their generalization ability. To address\nthis issue, this paper proposes an iterative Self-Feedback Training (SFT)\nframework to seek consistent flat minima that are shared across different\ndomains by progressively refining loss landscapes during training. It\nalternatively generates a feedback signal by measuring the inconsistency of\nloss landscapes in different domains and refines these loss landscapes for\ngreater consistency using this feedback signal. Benefiting from the consistency\nof the flat minima within these refined loss landscapes, our SFT helps achieve\nbetter out-of-domain generalization. Extensive experiments on DomainBed\ndemonstrate superior performances of SFT when compared to state-of-the-art\nsharpness-aware methods and other prevalent DG baselines. On average across\nfive DG benchmarks, SFT surpasses the sharpness-aware minimization by 2.6% with\nResNet-50 and 1.5% with ViT-B/16, respectively.
