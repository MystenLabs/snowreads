We describe the\ndynamics of the multivariate process of constituents with a copula model and\npropose an efficient method to extract the dependency structure from the\nmarket. The proposed method generates coherent sets of samples of the\nconstituents process through systematic sampling rearrangement. These samples\nare then utilized to calibrate a local volatility model (LVM) of the basket\nprocess, which is used to price basket derivatives. We show that the method is\ncapable of efficiently pricing basket options based on a large number of basket\nconstituents, accomplishing the calibration process within a matter of seconds,\nand achieving near-perfect calibration to the index options of the market.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance","Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"B4NVFJIv1zZqpnzzKvRz4On0Ir2LcGyaX3euOuTMP2k","pdfSize":"5086501","objectId":"0xb42901c2077ba5b90efc793a16249d82a7c3e0e03d4fc82f0200087c19813b69","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
