The diameter of the $k$-recolouring graph,\n$\\textrm{diam}~\\mathcal{C}_k(G)$, is the maximum over all pairs $\\alpha$ and\n$\\beta$ of the minimum length of a recolouring sequence from $\\alpha$ to\n$\\beta$. Much previous work has focused on determining the asymptotics of\n$\\textrm{diam}~\\mathcal{C}_k(G)$: Is it $\\Theta(|G|)$? Is it $\\Theta(|G|^2)$?\nOr even larger? Here we focus on graphs for which\n$\\textrm{diam}~\\mathcal{C}_k(G)=\\Theta(|G|)$, and seek to determine more\nprecisely the multiplicative constant implicit in the $\\Theta()$. In\nparticular, for each $k\\ge 3$, for all positive integers $p$ and $q$ we exactly\ndetermine $\\textrm{diam}~\\mathcal{C}_k(K_{p,q})$, up to a small additive\nconstant. We also sharpen a recolouring lemma that has been used in multiple\npapers, proving an optimal version. This improves the multiplicative constant\nin various prior results. Finally, we investigate plausible relationships\nbetween similar reconfiguration graphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3-c1EO4BRQjufkch_xRfp2WcQBr2xNMWf2HkXplNrPI","pdfSize":"305326"}
