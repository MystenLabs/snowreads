Options range from taking carbon out of the atmosphere through carbon\nsinks and brightening clouds to increasing the planet's albedo through the\nrelease of reflective particles into the atmosphere. While still controversial,\ngeoengineering has been proposed by some as a promising and low-cost way of\ncombating climate change. In particular, so-called 'moderate' geoengineering is\nclaimed to be achievable with few potential side effects or other\nramifications. However, this paper argues that the effect of moderate\ngeoengineering can easily be nullified by 'counter-geoengineering,' and any\nimpactful geoengineering would require a global governance framework to prevent\ncountries which benefit from warming temperatures from deploying\ncounter-geoengineering. In this paper, we take Russia as an example due to its\npotential interest in counteracting geoengineering and its significant ability\nto release a great amount of methane, a viable counter-geoengineering pathway\nin the short term.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Economics/General Economics","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lTtJMdWt1DG7kYADNsTGcwf-tN_p5PZcU5XqqNZa2rs","pdfSize":"445825"}
