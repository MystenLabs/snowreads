There is an imminent need to develop NLP and ML techniques for\nautomatically processing and understanding legal documents to streamline the\nlegal system. However, evaluating and comparing various NLP models designed\nspecifically for the legal domain is challenging. This paper addresses this\nchallenge by proposing IL-TUR: Benchmark for Indian Legal Text Understanding\nand Reasoning. IL-TUR contains monolingual (English, Hindi) and multi-lingual\n(9 Indian languages) domain-specific tasks that address different aspects of\nthe legal system from the point of view of understanding and reasoning over\nIndian legal documents. We present baseline models (including LLM-based) for\neach task, outlining the gap between models and the ground truth. To foster\nfurther research in the legal domain, we create a leaderboard (available at:\nhttps://exploration-lab.github.io/IL-TUR/) where the research community can\nupload and compare legal text understanding systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"YfBN61wlG6E-Dg1COEeiDvHKWAyqcl_4I0_OeaVv0pk","pdfSize":"1000738"}
