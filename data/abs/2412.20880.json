  "abstract": "  We study the femtoscopic correlation functions of meson-baryon pairs in the\nstrangeness $S=-1$ sector, employing unitarized s-wave scattering amplitudes\nderived from the chiral Lagrangian up to next-to-leading order. For the first\ntime, we deliver predictions on the $\\pi^-\\Lambda$ and $K^+\\Xi^-$ correlation\nfunctions which are feasible to be measured at the Large Hadron Collider. We\nalso demonstrate that the employed model is perfectly capable of reproducing\nthe $K^-p$ correlation function data measured by the same collaboration,\nwithout the need to modify the coupling strength to the $\\bar{K}^0n$ channel,\nas has been recently suggested. In all cases, the effects of the source size on\nthe correlation are tested. In addition, we present detailed analysis of the\ndifferent coupled-channel contributions, together with the quantification of\nthe relative relevance of the different terms in the interaction.\n",
