The \"long-tail\" concept,\noriginally used to explain trends in digital consumer goods, was first applied\nto scientific data in 2007 to refer to a vast array of smaller, heterogeneous\ndata collections that cumulatively represent a substantial portion of\nscientific knowledge. However, these datasets, often referred to as \"long-tail\ndata,\" are frequently mismanaged or overlooked due to inadequate data\nmanagement practices and institutional support. This paper examines the\nchanging landscape of discussions about long-tail data over time, situated\nwithin broader ecosystems of research data management and the natural interplay\nbetween \"big\" and \"small\" data. The review also bridges discussions on data\ncuration in Library & Information Science (LIS) and domain-specific contexts,\ncontributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the long-tail concept's\nutility for effective data management outcomes. The review aims to provide a\nmore comprehensive understanding of this concept, its terminological diversity\nin the literature, and its utility for guiding data management, overall\ninforming current and future information science research and practice.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Digital Libraries","Computer Science/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qquhLS1ElvLGuKJJSO8qBUH4LPUQO_GrJKFh5gwV9bM","pdfSize":"646660"}
