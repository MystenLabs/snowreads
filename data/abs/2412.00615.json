  "abstract": "  This paper examines the impact of racial discrimination in hiring on\nemployment, wage, and wealth disparities between black and white workers. Using\na labor search-and-matching model with racially prejudiced and non-prejudiced\nfirms, we show that labor market frictions sustain discriminatory practices as\nan equilibrium outcome. These practices account for 44% to 52% of the average\nwage gap and 16% of the median wealth gap. Discriminatory hiring also amplifies\nunemployment and wage volatility for black workers, increasing their labor\nmarket risks over business cycles. Eliminating prejudiced firms reduces these\ndisparities and improves black workers' welfare, though it slightly decreases\noverall economic welfare.\n",
