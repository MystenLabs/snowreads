  "abstract": "  The majority of most luminous quasars during the epoch of reionization\naccrete near or above the Eddington limit, marking the vigorous growth of\nprimitive supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, their subsequent evolution\nand environmental impact remain poorly characterized. We present JWST/NIRSpec\nprism IFU observations of HSC J2239+0207, a low-luminosity quasar at\n$z\\sim6.25$ likely in a late stage of mass assembly with an overmassive SMBH\nrelative to its host galaxy. Using H$\\beta$ and H$\\alpha$ broad emission lines,\nwe estimate an SMBH mass $M_{\\rm BH}\\sim3\\times10^8~M_{\\odot}$ and confirm its\nsub-Eddington accretion at $\\lambda_{\\rm Edd}\\sim0.4$. Strong FeII emission and\na proximity zone of typical size suggest a metal-rich, highly evolved system.\nIn the far-UV, this quasar presents strong broad-absorption-line features,\nindicative of high-velocity winds ($\\nu\\sim10^4~{\\rm km/s}$). Meanwhile,\nminimal dust reddening is inferred from the quasar continuum and broad-line\nBalmer decrement, suggesting little dust along the polar direction. Most\ninterestingly, we identify a gas companion $\\sim$5 kpc from the quasar with a\nhigh [OIII]/H$\\beta$ ratio ($\\gtrsim10$), likely representing outflowing gas\nblown away by AGN feedback. These results highlight HSC J2239+0207 as a likely\nfading quasar in transition, providing rare insights into SMBH evolution, AGN\nfeedback, and AGN-galaxy interactions in the early Universe.\n",
