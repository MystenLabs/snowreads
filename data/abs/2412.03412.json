The dynamics of the ultrafast electronic funneling\nbetween the first two excited electronic states in the asymmetrically\nmeta-substituted PPE oligomer with two rings on one branch and three rings on\nthe other side, with a shared ring in between, is treated with 93-dimensional\nab initio vibronic-coupling Hamiltonian (VCH) models, either linear or with\nbilinear and quadratic terms. The linear VCH model is also used to model an\nopen quantum system. The linear-response absorption and emission spectra are\nsimulated with both the ML-MCTDH and HEOM methods. The latter is further used\nto explore the nonlinear response regime and the expected EET fingerprint in\nthe time-resolved transient absorption (TA) spectra and excited stimulated\nemission (ESE) with delta-like impulsive laser pulses.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6nSZ26djRj2TDr4TFGLR_Eb3GgqVNuGHi9sR1ymPE_0","pdfSize":"7229931"}
