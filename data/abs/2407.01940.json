The core\nformula is an equation of poles. Although it also calculates large deviations\nof counting statistics of the same variables, the degrees of the equation are\ndistinct with respect to the two statistics. Because the former is usually\nlower than the latter in the quantum case, analytical solutions for the first\npassage time statistics are possible. We illustrate these results via a driven\ntwo-level quantum system and apply them to explore quantum violations of the\nclassical kinetic and thermodynamic uncertainty relations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"tat920dhGr591Wim-PXW02rAKXVTLpGztlRVZhLjskI","pdfSize":"279479"}
