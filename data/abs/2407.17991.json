In particular, a series of experiments\nwere performed to extract information about properties of static magnetic\nfields from absorption profiles of light passing through an atomic gas target.\nIn the present work, we propose an extension to this method for oscillating\nmagnetic fields. To investigate this scenario, we carried out theoretical\nanalysis based on the time-dependent density matrix theory. We found that\nabsorption profiles, even when averaged over typical observation times, are\nindeed sensitive to both strength and frequency of the time-dependent field,\nthus opening the prospect for a powerful diagnostic technique. To illustrate\nthis sensitivity, we performed detailed calculations for the $5s \\;\\,\n{}^2S_{1/2}$ ($F=1$) $-$ $5p \\;\\, {}^2 P_{3/2}$ ($F=0$) transition in rubidium\natoms, subject to a superposition of an oscillating (test) and a static\n(reference) magnetic field.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"t4QtTAg38G7KOb2k-n8I9vGbkZs72v0Ka0VBqEvZ7s8","pdfSize":"3766825","objectId":"0x9b1ad244a6828409868374ef3f73fd002a60a74a146d6ef7dce544a084f22693","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
