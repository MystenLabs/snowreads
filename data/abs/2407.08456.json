However, if only one parameter is modulated, which is more\nrealistic, this convective term disappears and one recovers a standard\ndiffusion equation with effective homogeneous parameters; this does not\ndescribe the non-reciprocity and the propagation of the field observed from\nexact dispersion diagrams. This inconsistency is corrected here by considering\nsecond-order homogenization which results in a non-reciprocal propagation term\nthat is proved to be non-zero for any laminate and verified via numerical\nsimulation. The same methodology is also applied to the case when the density\nis modulated in the heat equation, leading therefore to a corrective advective\nterm which cancels out non-reciprocity at the leading order but not at the\nsecond order.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tc8khPdfof4IvdXCw3LDZa-X5lMgl-hIFk7Q7bMPfm0","pdfSize":"1592930","objectId":"0x9138cde98b458ea8d00f553475416055c04c52c99dc637edc01aa482fea9268a","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
