The dual-band\nconditions are established based on the electrical nature of the coupler and\ndual-band C-section coupled lines/ T-structure/ $\\Pi$-structures instead of\nusing the dual-band equivalent transmission lines. It has been shown here that\nthe same design equations can be utilized in the design of the rat-race coupler\nand Gysel power divider. The design equations are solved numerically to obtain\nthe electrical parameters of the proposed coupler and power divider. The\npossible application of dual-band different power division ratios is presented\nfor dual-band polarization controlled by a patch antenna. A design tool has\nbeen developed to obtain the coupler and power divider's design parameters and\ncircuit analysis results. A design example of the coupler has been provided to\nvalidate the proposed concept.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"w53PfKalQB7DXLGQXN6Qu6fFJhBPGxClr6BTWqqgy7c","pdfSize":"2697352"}
