Our heuristic applies to smooth surfaces defined by cubic polynomials\nthat are log K3, but it can also be adjusted to handle singular cubic surfaces.\nWe compare our heuristic to Heath-Brown's prediction for sums of three cubes,\nas well as to asymptotic formulae in the literature around Zagier's work on the\nMarkoff cubic surface, and work of Baragar and Umeda on further surfaces of\nMarkoff-type. We also test our heuristic against numerical data for several\nfamilies of cubic surfaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1whg4cRW7pO4153WzhwjpfNCdNLamwXblvsnGyE8RlQ","pdfSize":"6527306"}
