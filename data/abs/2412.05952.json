  "abstract": "  This work investigates a dynamical system functioning as a nonsmooth\nadaptation of the continuous Newton method, aimed at minimizing the sum of a\nprimal lower-regular and a locally Lipschitz function, both potentially\nnonsmooth. The classical Newton method's second-order information is extended\nby incorporating the graphical derivative of a locally Lipschitz mapping.\nSpecifically, we analyze the existence and uniqueness of solutions, along with\nthe asymptotic behavior of the system's trajectories. Conditions for\nconvergence and respective convergence rates are established under two distinct\nscenarios: strong metric subregularity and satisfaction of the\nKurdyka-Lojasiewicz inequality.\n",
