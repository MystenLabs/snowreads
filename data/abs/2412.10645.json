The unique aspect of these data are the highly\nresolved measurements across the outer region of a physically thick boundary\nlayer, enabling accurate detection of turbulent/non-turbulent interfaces\n(TNTI). The present dataset is used to detect the TNTI of an adverse pressure\ngradient turbulent boundary layer and compare its characteristics with that for\na zero-pressure gradient boundary layer, at a nominally similar friction\nReynolds number. It is found that the TNTI exists across a broader range of\nwall-normal distance in presence of an adverse pressure gradient, as compared\nto the zero-pressure gradient case. Implications on conditionally averaged\nturbulence statistics are discussed based on detection of the TNTI.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"zIQ0owbRCWEqu277xbMaFpTvhHOPRep0KFKvmlyrXHM","pdfSize":"4209122"}
