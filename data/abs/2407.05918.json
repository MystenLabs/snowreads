Underlying this development\nis the technical maturity of generating scalable optical beams, enabled by\nactive components and high numerical aperture objective. However, such a\ncomplex combination of bulk optics outside the vacuum chamber is very sensitive\nto any vibration and drift. Here we demonstrate the generation of 3*3 static\ntweezer array with a single chip-scale multifunctional metasurface element in\nvacuum, replacing the meter-long free space optics. Fluorescence counts on the\ncamera validates the successfully trapping of the atomic ensemble array.\nFurther, we discuss the strategy to achieve low scattering and crosstalk, where\na metasurface design featuring dual-wavelength independent control is included.\nOur results, together with other recent development in integrated photonics for\ncold atoms, could pave the way for compact and portable quantum sensors and\nsimulators in platforms of neutral atom arrays.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"K4M0-9Gbngr_b4lWVuQDe0nsSu-Ctv2aVYIC0yd9-UM","pdfSize":"18324069"}
