To ensure that the models agree on cause and effect, frameworks\nfor causal abstractions define notions of consistency. Two distinct methods for\ncausal abstraction are common in the literature: (i) graphical abstractions,\nsuch as Cluster DAGs, which relate models on a structural level, and (ii)\nfunctional abstractions, like $\\alpha$-abstractions, which relate models by\nmaps between variables and their ranges. In this paper we will align the\nnotions of graphical and functional consistency and show an equivalence between\nthe class of Cluster DAGs, consistent $\\alpha$-abstractions, and constructive\n$\\tau$-abstractions. Furthermore, we extend this alignment and the expressivity\nof graphical abstractions by introducing Partial Cluster DAGs. Our results\nprovide a rigorous bridge between the functional and graphical frameworks and\nallow for adoption and transfer of results between them.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UtmlrJh6V7XeavzgJjABshmM-GFFEpGlfjTBEMkNa9g","pdfSize":"281541"}
