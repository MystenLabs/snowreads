We propose a novel two-stage\npenalized regression approach, the penalized covariate-mediator selection\noperator (PCM Selector), to estimate the causal effects in such scenarios.\nUnlike existing penalized regression analyses, when a set of intermediate\nvariables is available, PCM Selector provides a consistent or less biased\nestimator of the causal effect. In addition, PCM Selector provides a variable\nselection procedure for intermediate variables to obtain better estimation\naccuracy of the causal effects than does the back-door criterion.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"MZvUcyHtjJGPZun178FR7c1p6WAgqvrktwvVjaG6RZc","pdfSize":"5674255"}
