A key limitation to their wider adoption is their\ninability to grasp larger payloads due to objects slipping out of grasps. We\nhave overcome this limitation by introducing a torsionally rigid strain\nlimiting layer (TR-SLL). This reduces out-of-plane bending while maintaining\nthe gripper's softness and in-plane flexibility. We characterize the design\nspace of the strain limiting layer and Handed Shearing Auxetic (HSA) actuators\nfor a soft gripper using simulation and experiment. The inclusion of the TR-SLL\nwith HSAs enables HSA grippers to be made with a single digit. We found that\nthe use of our TR-SLL HSA gripper enabled pinch grasping of payloads over 1 kg.\nWe demonstrate a lifting capacity of 5 kg when loading using the TR-SLL. We\nalso demonstrate a peak pinch grasp force of 5.8 N, and a peak planar caging\nforce of 14.5 N. Finally, we test the TR-SLL gripper on a suite of 43 YCB\nobjects. We show success on 37 objects demonstrating significant capabilities.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"qK4OkTKE5CAtUrzP9R1XnRJ3q2OOur2FHWxq_LNIj4s","pdfSize":"18449381"}
