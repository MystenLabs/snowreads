We\nconsider a `reference market maker' who monitors her inventory and the\naggregated inventory of the competing market makers. We assume that the\ncompeting market makers use a `rule of thumb' to determine their posted depths,\ndepending linearly on their inventory. By contrast, the reference market maker\noptimises over her posted depths, and we assume that her fill probability\ndepends on the difference between her posted depths and the competition's\ndepths in an exponential way. For a linear-quadratic goal functional, we show\nthat this model admits an approximate closed-form solution. We illustrate the\nfeatures of our model and compare against alternative ways of solving the\nproblem either via an Euler scheme or state-of-the-art reinforcement learning\ntechniques.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"n5EYgFMKS9GJU5u_HXr68sRjCCuM23SKAR9dHPd5qBY","pdfSize":"662173"}
