  "abstract": "  Thermoelectric effects in $p-n$ junctions are widely used for energy\ngeneration with thermal gradients, creation of compact Peltier refrigerators\nand, most recently, for sensitive detection of infrared and terahertz\nradiation. It is conventionally assumed that electrons and holes creating\nthermoelectric current are in equilibrium and share the common quasi-Fermi\nlevel. We show that lack of interband equilibrium results in an anomalous sign\nand magnitude of thermoelectric voltage developed across the $p-n$ junction.\nThe anomalies appear provided the diffusion length of minority carriers exceeds\nthe size of hot spot at the junction. Normal magnitude of thermoelectric\nvoltage is partly restored if interband tunneling at the junction is allowed.\nThe predicted effects can be relevant to the cryogenically cooled\nphotodetectors based on bilayer graphene and mercury cadmium telluride quantum\nwells.\n",
