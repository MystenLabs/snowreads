From\ndistributive laws between functors they construct pairs of sorting algorithms\nusing both folds and unfolds. Pairs of sorting algorithms arising this way\ninclude insertion/selection sort and quick/tree sort.\n  We extend this work to define intrinsically correct variants in cubical Agda.\nOur key idea is to index our data types by multisets, which concisely captures\nthat a sorting algorithm terminates with an ordered permutation of its input\nlist. By lifting bialgebraic semantics to the indexed setting, we obtain the\ncorrectness of sorting algorithms purely from the distributive law.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Logic in Computer Science","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gi3jx7MA8CLRRr3-RVxLd7RPye-nGWDYCoU-isC3oc8","pdfSize":"346263"}
