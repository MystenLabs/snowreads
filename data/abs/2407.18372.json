The\nGE-GNN architecture ensures thermodynamic consistency by predicting the molar\nexcess Gibbs free energy and using thermodynamic relations to obtain activity\ncoefficients. As these are differential, automatic differentiation is applied\nto learn the activity coefficients in an end-to-end manner. Since the\narchitecture is based on fundamental thermodynamics, we do not require\nadditional loss terms to learn thermodynamic consistency. As the output is a\nfundamental property, we neither impose thermodynamic modeling limitations and\nassumptions. We demonstrate high accuracy and thermodynamic consistency of the\nactivity coefficient predictions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Zj1rcjzJqH3HSDafigQeXU9kH3aEA5RUiZNA129F-uk","pdfSize":"735532"}
