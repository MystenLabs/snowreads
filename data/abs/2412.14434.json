  "abstract": "  We discuss a large class of non-relativistic continuum field theories where\nthe Euclidean spatial symmetry of the classical theory is violated in the\nquantum theory by an Adler-Bell-Jackiw-like anomaly. In particular, the\ncontinuous translation symmetry of the classical theory is broken in the\nquantum theory to a discrete symmetry. Furthermore, that discrete symmetry is\nextended by an internal symmetry, making it non-Abelian. This presentation\nstreamlines and extends the discussion in [1]. In an Appendix, we present an\nelementary introduction to 't Hooft and Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomalies using a\nwell-known system.\n",
