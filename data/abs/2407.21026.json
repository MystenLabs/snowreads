These\nsystems just recently began utilizing machine learning algorithms due to the\ndevelopment and growth of the artificial intelligence research community. This\nproject aspires to transform how eCommerce platforms communicate with their\nusers. We have created a model that can customize product recommendations and\noffers for each unique customer using cutting-edge machine learning techniques,\nwe used PCA to reduce features and four machine learning algorithms like\nGaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR),\nDecision Tree (DT), the Random Forest algorithms achieve the highest accuracy\nof 99.6% with a 96.99 r square score, 1.92% MSE score, and 0.087 MAE score. The\noutcome is advantageous for both the client and the business. In this research,\nwe will examine the model's development and training in detail and show how\nwell it performs using actual data. Learning from machines can change of\neCommerce world.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bMvqyZm0tBkwkFTn0RnWBSD5kfSGLUPuMRZNfbDLHaI","pdfSize":"363064","objectId":"0xcc2a67da9d2bd72da902d03e01ab479f73a49b48fd177854f56aad61d87f59a0","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
