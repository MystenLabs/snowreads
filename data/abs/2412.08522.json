  "abstract": "  Articulated object manipulation is a challenging task, requiring constrained\nmotion and adaptive control to handle the unknown dynamics of the manipulated\nobjects. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely employed to tackle\nvarious scenarios and types of articulated objects, the complexity of these\ntasks, stemming from multiple intertwined objectives makes learning a control\npolicy in the full task space highly difficult. To address this issue, we\npropose a Subspace-wise hybrid RL (SwRL) framework that learns policies for\neach divided task space, or subspace, based on independent objectives. This\napproach enables adaptive force modulation to accommodate the unknown dynamics\nof objects. Additionally, it effectively leverages the previously underlooked\nredundant subspace, thereby maximizing the robot's dexterity. Our method\nenhances both learning efficiency and task execution performance, as validated\nthrough simulations and real-world experiments.
