The rapidly exploring random tree\n(RRT) algorithms are popular in multi-robot motion planning. However,\ngenerating the graph configuration space and searching in the composite tensor\nconfiguration space is computationally expensive for large number of sample\npoints. In this paper, we propose a new evolutionary-based algorithm using a\nparametric lattice-based configuration and the discrete-based RRT for\ncollision-free multi-robot planning at intersections. Our computational\nexperiments using complex planning intersection scenarios have shown the\nfeasibility and the superiority of the proposed algorithm compared to seven\nother related approaches. Our results offer new sampling and representation\nmechanisms to render optimization-based approaches for multi-robot navigation.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Robotics","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"4DLx4eZLJ2A5m_c0FS-ZwjGajFBvCKfIZoZQNu6XChM","pdfSize":"1480564"}
