{"id":"2407.04476","title":"Rethinking Data Input for Point Cloud Upsampling","authors":"Tongxu Zhang","authorsParsed":[["Zhang","Tongxu",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2024 12:53:34 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-08","timestamp":1720184014000,"abstract":"  In recent years, point cloud upsampling has been widely applied in fields\nsuch as 3D reconstruction and surface generation. However, existing point cloud\nupsampling inputs are all patch based, and there is no research discussing the\ndifferences and principles between point cloud model full input and patch based\ninput. In order to compare with patch based point cloud input, this article\nproposes a new data input method, which divides the full point cloud model to\nensure shape integrity while training PU-GCN. This article was validated on the\nPU1K and ABC datasets, but the results showed that Patch based performance is\nbetter than model based full input i.e. Average Segment input. Therefore, this\narticle explores the data input factors and model modules that affect the\nupsampling results of point clouds.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rl99Nn0edw-tlZ5qyXWyj-IqHZpig5E8uIuUvpPoKcI","pdfSize":"21262301"}
