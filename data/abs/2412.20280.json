  "abstract": "  In this work, development of the new Laser and Ion Beam Induced Luminescence\n(LIBIL) experimental end-station has been presented. To systematically test the\ncapabilities and limitations of the newly developed setup, ionoluminescence\n(IL) and iono-photoluminescence (IPL) measurements were performed on a type IIa\noptical grade and a type Ib nitrogen rich diamond. By comparing and analyzing\nthe obtained spectra, it was shown that the speed of luminescence quenching has\na non-trivial dependence on the ion beam current. Additionally, it was\ndemonstrated that some spectral features characteristic of the negatively\ncharged nitrogen-vacancy color center (i.e. NV$^-$ zero-phonon line) have been\nobserved only during IPL measurements. This demonstrates that the unification\nof two separate steps, ion implantation and optical characterization, could\nyield new insights into dynamics of color center formation.\n",
