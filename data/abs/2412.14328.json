  "abstract": "  This article is about Semantic Role Labeling for English partitive nouns\n(5%/REL of the price/ARG1; The price/ARG1 rose 5 percent/REL) in the NomBank\nannotated corpus. Several systems are described using traditional and\ntransformer-based machine learning, as well as ensembling. Our highest scoring\nsystem achieves an F1 of 91.74% using \"gold\" parses from the Penn Treebank and\n91.12% when using the Berkeley Neural parser. This research includes both\nclassroom and experimental settings for system development.\n",
