  "abstract": "  When electrically stimulated, electroactive polymers (EAPs) respond with\nmechanical deformation. The goal of this work is to design electrode and EAP\nlayouts simultaneously in structures by using density-based, multi-material\ntopology optimization. In this novel approach the layout of electrodes and EAP\nmaterial are not given a priori but is a result from the topology optimization.\nMaterial interpolation based on exponential functions is introduced, allowing a\nlarge flexibility to control the material interpolation. The electric field in\nthe surrounding free space is modeled using a truncated extended domain method.\nNumerical examples that demonstrates the method's ability to design arbitrary\nEAP and electrode layouts are presented. In these optimized structures,\nelectrode material is continuously connected from the electrical sources to\nopposite sides of the EAP material and thereby concentrating the electric field\nto the EAP material which drives the deformation.\n",
