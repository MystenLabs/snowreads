  "abstract": "  We study the electron-positron to muon--anti-muon cross-section in the\nasymptotically safe Standard Model. In particular, we include the graviton\ncontributions to the scattering amplitude, which is computed from\nmomentum-dependent time-like one-particle-irreducible correlation functions.\nSpecifically, we employ reconstruction techniques for the graviton spectral\nfunctions. We find that the full asymptotically safe quantum cross section\ndecreases in the ultraviolet with the centre-of-mass energy, and is compatible\nwith unitarity bounds. Importantly, our findings provide non-trivial evidence\nfor the unitarity of the asymptotically safe Standard Model.\n",
