  "abstract": "  We investigate the fermionic properties of a dyonic Gubser-Rocha model in the\ncontext of gauge/gravity duality. This model incorporates both a magnetic field\nand momentum relaxation. We have derived this model's scaling exponent,\nrevealing the influence of the magnetic field and momentum relaxation on\nlow-energy physics. As the magnetic field strength and momentum relaxation\nincrease, the spectral function of the dual field changes significantly.\nSpecifically, we observe variations in the scaling exponent, Fermi momentum,\nand dispersion relations as the magnetic field increases, highlighting the\nsystem's transition from a Fermi liquid to a non-Fermi liquid, and eventually\nto an insulating state. Our analysis of the magneto-scattering rate reveals\nthat it is nearly zero in the Fermi liquid region, increases significantly in\nthe non-Fermi liquid region, and ultimately arrives at a maximum value in the\ninsulating state.\n",
