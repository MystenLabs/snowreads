It exhibits `kinetic boundary\nlayers', nonmonotonous distribution, violation of Fourier's law, diffusion\nfacilitated current reversal and optimisation on tuning dynamical parameters,\nand a Seebeck-like effect in the steady state. The spatial and internal degrees\nof freedom together possess a symmetry, using which we find the eigenspectrum\nfor large systems. The eigenvalues are arranged in two bands which can mix in\ncertain conditions resulting in a crossover in the relaxation. The late time\ndistribution for large systems is obtained analytically; it retains a strong\nand often dominant `active' contribution in the bulk rendering an effective\npassive-like description inadequate. A nontrivial `Milne length' also emerges\nin the dynamics. Finally, a novel universality is proposed in the absorbing\nboundary problem for dynamics with short-ranged colored noise. Active particles\ndriven by active reservoirs may thus provide a common physical ground for\ndiverse and new nonequilibrium phenomena.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Xo7i4k2b3ao0VGvpHec97QMobbxkpW1iqvFCtBkhq_s","pdfSize":"820003"}
