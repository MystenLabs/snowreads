However, such properties would be desirable for different\napplications, such as distributed neural network architectures where the order\nof execution cannot be guaranteed or parts of the network can fail during\ninference. In this work, we address these issues through a number of proposed\ntraining approaches for vision transformers whose most important component is\nrandomizing the execution order of attention modules at training time. We show\nthat with our proposed approaches, vision transformers are indeed capable to\nadapt to arbitrary layer execution orders at test time assuming one tolerates a\nreduction (about 20\\%) in accuracy at the same model size. We also find that\nour trained models can be randomly merged with each other resulting in\nfunctional (\"Frankenstein\") models without loss of performance compared to the\nsource models. Finally, we layer-prune our models at test time and find that\ntheir performance declines gracefully.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-lSdN9r4s1LDm3xS5KX2i8rhifeqonZZ39J3oVTTQRU","pdfSize":"459278"}
