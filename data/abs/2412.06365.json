The key idea is to extract semantically rich vectors from any\ninput patch, allowing for the use of simple subsequent classification networks\npotentially reducing the required amounts of labeled data, and increasing\ndomain robustness. In this work, we investigate to which degree this also holds\nfor mitotic figure classification. Utilizing two popular public mitotic figure\ndatasets, we compared linear probing of five publicly available FMs against\nmodels trained on ImageNet and a simple ResNet50 end-to-end-trained baseline.\nWe found that the end-to-end-trained baseline outperformed all FM-based\nclassifiers, regardless of the amount of data provided. Additionally, we did\nnot observe the FM-based classifiers to be more robust against domain shifts,\nrendering both of the above assumptions incorrect.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"r5mYgvwzovrVnqKjiEeGgfQIU2-RXSdlZ1MwjXsVa-8","pdfSize":"305766"}
