Using optical pump-terahertz (THz) probe\nspectroscopy, we study the dynamics of valley polarization in bulk Si(001) at\nroom temperature. Linearly polarized pump pulses excite electrons and holes\nwith asymmetric distributions in momentum space, leading to in-plane\nanisotropic conductivity. By varying the polarization directions of the pump\nlight relative to the in-plane crystalline axes, the valley polarization of\nelectrons and the momentum asymmetry of holes are separately probed through\nobserving the polarization rotation of THz pulses. We demonstrate that the\nvalley relaxation time of electrons near the conduction band minimum exceeds\n1.5 ps at room temperature, in good agreement with theoretically calculated\nintervalley phonon scattering with f-process. This work paves the way for\nSi-based room-temperature valleytronics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TnLmNOUcOjxZmHsrAnIvGXpe5RnSrPbpXX1KaVbvHKk","pdfSize":"763835"}
