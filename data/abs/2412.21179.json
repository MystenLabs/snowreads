This bidirectional exchange is achieved by performing\nBell measurements on the qubit pairs of Alice and Bob, ensuring the successful\nteleportation of the quantum state for both parties. We demonstrate the\nproposed protocol by designing a teleportation circuit that incorporates the\nnecessary quantum gates. The fidelity of the teleportation process is evaluated\nthrough simulations, confirming the accuracy and reliability of the proposed\nscheme. The protocol restores teleported states without requiring CNOT\noperations or auxiliary qubits, offering a significant advantage in resource\nefficiency(utilization). A comparative analysis of the intrinsic efficiency\nwith previous approaches establishes that the proposed protocol brings forth an\nefficient approach for achieving two-way quantum teleportation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"W39LnHQc6gzzud9p00UbHqlbM8WWxv940z7SWpbX2Ck","pdfSize":"3404659"}
