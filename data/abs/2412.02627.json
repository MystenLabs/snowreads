  "abstract": "  We introduce a novel continual learning problem: how to sequentially update\nthe weights of a personalized 2D and 3D generative face model as new batches of\nphotos in different appearances, styles, poses, and lighting are captured\nregularly. We observe that naive sequential fine-tuning of the model leads to\ncatastrophic forgetting of past representations of the individual's face. We\nthen demonstrate that a simple random sampling-based experience replay method\nis effective at mitigating catastrophic forgetting when a relatively large\nnumber of images can be stored and replayed. However, for long-term deployment\nof these models with relatively smaller storage, this simple random\nsampling-based replay technique also forgets past representations. Thus, we\nintroduce a novel experience replay algorithm that combines random sampling\nwith StyleGAN's latent space to represent the buffer as an optimal convex hull.\nWe observe that our proposed convex hull-based experience replay is more\neffective in preventing forgetting than a random sampling baseline and the\nlower bound.\n",
