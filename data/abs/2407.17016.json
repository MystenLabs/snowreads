They generalize the polynomials orthogonal on the multinomial\ndistribution introduced by R. Griffiths fifty years ago. They also correspond\nto a $q$-deformation of the Griffiths polynomials of Racah type introduced\npreviously by the authors and collaborators. The latter are recovered from the\nformer by a $q\\to1$ limit. We show that these new polynomials are bispectral\nand biorthogonal. We also exhibit some symmetry relations that are essential in\nthe proof of the bispectrality property.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"klv6uuqcxAIa1Ki9FQeuituDnB1gjarfPWQq_MvbhB0","pdfSize":"435863"}
