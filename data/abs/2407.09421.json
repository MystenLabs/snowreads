Here we begin an analysis of higher-order\ncorrections in such models by setting up a renormalization scheme with full\non-shell conditions on the lepton self energies, masses and fields. A minimal\nset of fundamental parameters is renormalized in the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$\nscheme. We provide a detailed discussion of lepton mixing and redundancies at\nhigher orders, show how the relevant counterterms can be obtained from the\nrenormalization conditions, and determine the $\\beta$-functions corresponding\nto the scheme. As a first application we calculate the one-loop effective\nmuon--Higgs coupling and analyse its correlation with the muon anomalous\nmagnetic moment $\\Delta a_\\mu^{\\text{VLL}}$. In the interesting case of large\nmasses and opposite-sign coupling, the lowest-order correlation implies a fixed\nvalue of $\\Delta a_\\mu^{\\text{VLL}}$ around $22.5\\times 10^{-10}$, while the\nhigher-order corrections significantly reduce this value to the interval\n$(10...18)\\times 10^{-10}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"m1NbvjLQ8B0pHQgvVpDq7xpDBk1QYlNa1xlJoHJ94Ec","pdfSize":"7933186"}
