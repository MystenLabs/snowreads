In\nparticular, we derive an infinite family of ``triangular number\" recurrences\nfor the $3$-colored partition function. Our proofs are inspired by the recent\nwork of Gomez, Ono, Saad, and Singh on the ordinary partition function and make\nextensive use of $q$-series identities for $(q;q)_{\\infty}$ and\n$(q;q)_{\\infty}^3.$\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"o93gFZPoXi9qMN1Mj2Eg7zHLQm9MwssQtGUNxc3Z12o","pdfSize":"206491"}
