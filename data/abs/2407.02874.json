The system's dynamics reveal that an initially dense, fully\nrandomized, soliton gas evolves into a coherent macroscopic state identified as\na soliton condensate through nonlinear spectral analysis. The emergence of the\nsoliton condensate is driven by the spatial rearrangement of the systems's\neigenmodes and by the proliferation of new solitonic states due to nonadiabatic\neffects, a phenomenon not accounted for by the existing hydrodynamic theories.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YEJz_WrQxU8zeASt1-hyDRvX0cBgSpnGInYAro5141s","pdfSize":"6945959"}
