This result is\npublished in CCS 2022, however, the description there is less clear because it\nuses the terminology of the full asynchronous Bullshark. The CCS version ties\nthe description of the asynchronous and partially synchronous versions of\nBullshark since it targets an academic audience. Due to the recent interest in\nDAG-based BFT protocols, we provide a separate and simple description of the\npartially synchronous version that targets a more general audience. We focus\nhere on the DAG ordering logic. For more details about the asynchronous\nversion, garbage collection, fairness, proofs, related work, evaluation, and\nefficient DAG implementation please refer to the fullpaper. An intuitive\nextended summary can be found in the \"DAG meets BFT\" blogpost.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"U_yO7svLZrW6L2Ib6UcpQ0DMrV_g7ZAd_eRThfbmji8","pdfSize":"1546621"}
