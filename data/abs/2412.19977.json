  "abstract": "  The current series of papers is concerned with stochastic stability of\nmonotone dynamical systems by identifying the basic dynamical units that can\nsurvive in the presence of noise interference. In the first of the series, for\nthe cooperative and irreducible systems, we will establish the stochastic\nstability of a dynamical order, that is, the zero-noise limit of stochastic\nperturbations will be concentrated on a simply ordered set consisting of\nLyapunov stable equilibria. In particular, we utilize the Freidlin--Wentzell\nlarge deviation theory to gauge the rare probability in the vicinity of\nunordered chain-transitive invariant set on a nonmonotone manifold. We further\napply our theoretic results to the stochastic stability of classical positive\nfeedback systems by showing that the zero-noise limit is a convex combination\nof the Dirac measures on a finite number of asymptotically stable equilibria\nalthough such system may possess nontrivial periodic orbits.\n",
