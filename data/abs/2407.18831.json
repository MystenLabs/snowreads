By using SVMs trained on a dataset obtained from the\nanalysis of the dynamics of the double pendulum Hamiltonian system, we aim at\nreducing the complexity of this process. Our trained SVM models demonstrate\nhigh accuracy when it comes to classifying trajectories in diverse Hamiltonian\nsystems, such as for example in the four-well Hamiltonian, the H\\'enon-Heiles\nsystem and the Chirikov Standard Map. The results indicate that SVMs, when\ncombined with Lagrangian descriptors, offer a robust and efficient method for\nchaos classification across different dynamical systems. Our approach not only\nsimplifies the classification process but also is highlighting the potential of\nMachine Learning algorithms in the study of nonlinear dynamics and chaos.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WUlU4teJTetBll0YCaGyST4J_X9qoKF2XfqNbTtF1mE","pdfSize":"4562050"}
