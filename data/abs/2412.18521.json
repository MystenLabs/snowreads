  "abstract": "  Covariant integral quantization is implemented for systems whose phase space\nis $Z_{d} \\times Z_{d}$, i.e., for systems moving on the discrete periodic set\n$Z_d= \\{0,1,\\dotsc d-1$ mod$ d\\}$. The symmetry group of this phase space is\nthe periodic discrete version of the Weyl-Heisenberg group, namely the central\nextension of the abelian group $Z_d \\times Z_d$. In this regard, the phase\nspace is viewed as the left coset of the group with its center. The non-trivial\nunitary irreducible representation of this group, as acting on $L^2(Z_{N})$, is\nsquare integrable on the phase phase. We derive the corresponding covariant\nintegral quantizations from (weight) functions on the phase space, and display\ntheir phase space portrait.\n",
