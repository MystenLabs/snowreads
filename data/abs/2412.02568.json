  "abstract": "  Coronary artery disease stands as one of the primary contributors to global\nmortality rates. The automated identification of coronary artery stenosis from\nX-ray images plays a critical role in the diagnostic process for coronary heart\ndisease. This task is challenging due to the complex structure of coronary\narteries, intrinsic noise in X-ray images, and the fact that stenotic coronary\narteries appear narrow and blurred in X-ray angiographies. This study employs\nfive different variants of the Mamba-based model and one variant of the Swin\nTransformer-based model, primarily based on the U-Net architecture, for the\nlocalization of stenosis in Coronary artery disease. Our best results showed an\nF1 score of 68.79% for the U-Mamba BOT model, representing an 11.8% improvement\nover the semi-supervised approach.\n",
