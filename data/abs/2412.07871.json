  "abstract": "  In this study, we considered the optical wavelength of Gaia DR3 to analyze\npoorly studied three newly open star clusters namely OCSN 203, OCSN 213, and\nOCSN 244 clusters with ASTECA code. Here, we identified candidates of 227, 200,\nand 551 with highly probable ($P \\geq 50\\%$) members. Fitting King's profile\nwithin RDPs allows us to estimate inner stellar structures like core (0.190\n$\\le r_{\\rm c}$ (pc) $\\le$ 1.284) and the limiting (0.327 $\\le r_{\\rm cl}$ (pc)\n$\\le 1.302$) radii. Constructing CMDs fitted with suitable log age (yr) between\n(log t; 6.52 - 7.05) and metallicities (Z; 0.01308-0.01413) isochrones.\nTherefore, the estimated photometric parameters with CMDs, reflect the\nheliocentric distances are 332 $\\pm$ 18, 529 $\\pm$ 23, and 506 $\\pm$ 23 (pc)\nfor OCSN 203, OCSN 213, and OCSN 244, respectively. Furthermore, the collective\nmass ($M_{\\rm C}$) in solar mass units calculated with MLR as 67 $\\pm$ 8.19, 91\n$\\pm$ 9.54, and 353 $\\pm$ 18.79. Additionally, LF determined that the mean\nabsolute magnitudes are 9.54 $\\pm$ 3.09, 8.52 $\\pm$ 2.92, and 7.60 $\\pm$ 2.76\nfor these clusters, respectively. The overall mass function reflects the slopes\n($\\alpha$) for Salpeter within the uncertainty are ($\\alpha_{OCSN203}$ = 2.41\n$\\pm$ 0.06), ($\\alpha_{OCSN213}$ = 2.13 $\\pm$ 0.07), and ($\\alpha_{OCSN244}$ =\n2.28 $\\pm$ 0.07). The results of this study which employed a dynamical analysis\nover varying timescales indicate that OCSN 203 and OCSN 244 are clusters that\nhave undergone significant relaxation, with a dynamical evolution parameter\n($\\tau$) that is much greater than one. In contrast, OCSN 213 exhibits\ncharacteristics of a non-relaxed cluster. A kinematic analysis of these open\nclusters was carried out, encompassing aspects of their apex position\n($A_o,D_o$) using the AD diagrams. At the end, we found that the three OCSN\nclusters are young stellar disc members using dynamic orbit parameters.\n",
