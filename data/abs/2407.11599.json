While TinyML offers real-time\ndata analysis and swift responses critical for diverse applications, its\ndevices' intrinsic resource limitations expose them to security risks. This\nresearch delves into the adversarial vulnerabilities of AI models on\nresource-constrained embedded hardware, with a focus on Model Extraction and\nEvasion Attacks. Our findings reveal that adversarial attacks from powerful\nhost machines could be transferred to smaller, less secure devices like ESP32\nand Raspberry Pi. This illustrates that adversarial attacks could be extended\nto tiny devices, underscoring vulnerabilities, and emphasizing the necessity\nfor reinforced security measures in TinyML deployments. This exploration\nenhances the comprehension of security challenges in TinyML and offers insights\nfor safeguarding sensitive data and ensuring device dependability in AI-powered\nedge computing settings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"PLaMggnB9alklxbudrjkuF4sF7gO6pNvMVP-36Hd_X0","pdfSize":"3589961"}
