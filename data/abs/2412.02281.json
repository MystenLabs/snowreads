As an application, we\ncompute $q$-Stokes matrices of a special confluent hypergeometric\n$q$-difference system with an irregular singularity. We show that by letting\n$q\\rightarrow 1$, the $q$-Stokes matrices recover the known expressions of the\nStokes matrices of the corresponding confluent hypergeometric differential\nsystem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-KJYNfPUZDp31fKyrh-eLh0aEYJ7TWQV-LfOXqkGfqU","pdfSize":"454470"}
