  "abstract": "  By analytically solving the quantum Rabi model, we investigate the photonic\nproperties of its ground eigenstate. In particular, we find that in the deep\nstrong coupling regime, where the coupling strength $g$ exceeds the mode\nfrequency $\\omega$, the photonic state is effectively squeezed in one of its\nquadratures. The squeezing reaches its maximum at the curve corresponding to\nthe quantum phase transition of the quantum Rabi system, and decreases rapidly\non both sides of the phase transition. Notably, for $g/\\omega\\approx 3$, which\nis experimentally testable in existing trapped-ion platforms, the achievable\nsqueezing parameter can reach approximately $r\\approx 0.8$. Intriguingly, the\nphotonic state is squeezed while its number distribution follows a\nsuper-Poissonian distribution, with the largest deviation from Poissonian\nbehavior occurring at the phase transition between the normal and superradiant\nphases. In other words, the ground state of the quantum Rabi model contains\nsuper-Poissonian quantum squeezed photons.\n",
