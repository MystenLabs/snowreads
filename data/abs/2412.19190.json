This study aims to develop an improved model by introducing the\nvehicle dimensions into the driving risk potential field framework. Vehicles\nare categorized based on size into standard-sized vehicles, medium-sized\nvehicles, and large-sized vehicles. And the interactions between two vehicles\nand the force field excited by the driving risk potential field are\ninvestigated in this paper. Our analysis of the risk field contours at various\nvehicle speeds and sizes reveals that larger and faster vehicles generate more\nintense and expansive risk fields, necessitating increased following distances.\nFor larger vehicles, the risk field extends into adjacent lanes. Force field\nanalysis demonstrates that vehicles traveling in adjacent lanes undergo changes\nin their motion state due to the influence of the force field emanating from\nthe neighboring larger vehicles. The model effectively points out that, for\nadjacent lanes, the regions surrounding the tail and head of high-speed\nvehicles represent highly risky zones.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"dAK4KrCFgqkJiORy6cQg-3IlvtyEOc2dgDmUPD2i-0Y","pdfSize":"2784576"}
