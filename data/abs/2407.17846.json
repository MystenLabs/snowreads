Previous solutions in Entangled Relativity required\nblack-holes to be charged for the matter field to be defined everywhere. This\nis because the theory precludes the existence of vacuum solutions, thereby\nsatisfying Einstein's definition of Mach's Principle. The current black-hole\nsolutions represent the first exact and neutral black-hole solutions of\nEntangled Relativity discovered to date. The Schwarzschild black-hole of\nGeneral Relativity emerges as a limit of these solutions when the background\nfield approaches zero, whereas the Melvin solution of General Relativity does\nnot emerge as a limit when the black hole's size approaches zero. This finding\nsuggests that astrophysical black-holes in Entangled Relativity are\nindistinguishable from those in General Relativity, given the generally weak\ninterstellar density of matter fields.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CF2S0hA2nlrRP0dJiTXP3wsQS_U_Y9UcmHW4ZU49lko","pdfSize":"161980"}
