The existence and uniqueness of the mild solution are proved. By\ngeneralizing the stochastic Fubini theorem under sublinear expectations, we\ndemonstrate that the mild solution also qualifies as a weak solution.\nAdditionally, we derive moment estimates for the solutions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Zz2FTsbqgfbCpgzJD3UDBoiLCwh3QJ-b2gDtVmwGLUg","pdfSize":"369230"}
