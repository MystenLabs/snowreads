We find that these equations admit only\nthe Gaussian fixed point with a UV-attractive and a UV-repulsive\neigendirection, and that there is no sign of the non-trivial UV-attractive\nfixed point of the asymptotic safety scenario. Crucial to our analysis is a\ncareful treatment of the measure in the path integral that defines the running\naction and a proper introduction of the physical running scale $k$. We also\nshow why and how in usual implementations of the RG equations the\naforementioned UV-attractive fixed point is generated.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"CcGczm6SachC_EsMK22lrYUJHCPCnqHfc_PD8SO8wBY","pdfSize":"1689240"}
