Requiring formal\nprivacy guarantees, such as differential privacy, could be helpful for\ndata-driven projects to comply with data protection. However, deploying\ndifferential privacy in consumer use cases raises the need to explain its\nunderlying mechanisms and the resulting privacy guarantees. In this paper, we\nthoroughly review and extend an existing privacy metric. We show how to compute\nthis risk metric efficiently for a set of basic statistical queries. Our\nempirical analysis based on an extensive, real-world scientific data set\nexpands the knowledge on how to compute risks under realistic conditions, while\npresenting more challenges than solutions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"XFf_RR4sruEnlRSE51uT4CFgXes73lNU4JT54dYzecc","pdfSize":"356712"}
