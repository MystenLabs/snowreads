This paper uses twisted Reidemeister torsion to obtain\na second proof of Morifuji's result that is closer in appearance to Torres'\noriginal formula.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vWZqPxL5xQcIjorxnuj4bHP2W6v4SygOv3qBh4QIiH8","pdfSize":"180844"}
