This research starts by investigating the current state of\nsustainability consideration within the software engineering industry through a\nsurvey. The results highlight a lack of progress in practically integrating\nsustainability considerations into software development activities. To address\nthis gap, a case study with an industry partner is conducted to demonstrate how\nsustainability concerns and effects can be integrated into agile software\ndevelopment. The findings of this case study demonstrate practical approaches\nto integrating sustainability into software development practices. Reflecting\non the findings from the survey and the case study, we note some insights on\nscaling up the adoption of sustainability consideration into the daily practice\nof agile software development.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ezpeqi7lFDTaLIbIYpICqBoIcP6tIroTmD1FQjQAAe4","pdfSize":"877633"}
