As the interest in agile software development grows, there\nis an increasing focus on investigating sustainability within this field. This\nstudy aimed to explore sustainability within agile software development in the\nFinnish software industry and, through gathered experiences, contribute to the\nsoftware engineering roadmap 2030. Using an interview approach, we conducted an\nempirical study within the Finnish software industry to achieve this goal. The\nfindings indicate a growing interest among experts in integrating\nsustainability into agile software development. The results show that the Scrum\nmethodology is the most popular approach in the Finnish software industry, and\naddressing different sustainability dimensions can have a ripple effect on each\nother. The study proposes three key elements to be considered in the software\nengineering roadmap 2030: integrating sustainability into software engineering\neducation, creating sustainability tools and frameworks, and assessing the\nenergy efficiency of libraries used in software development.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rF2AWB-oQe8TrGt8nsuwAGTjgsy9oZGGsAiJSzF7K-U","pdfSize":"1590970"}
