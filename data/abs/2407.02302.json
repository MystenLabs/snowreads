Current paraphrase evaluations of language\nmodels primarily use binary approaches, offering limited interpretability of\nspecific text changes. Atomic paraphrase types (APT) decompose paraphrases into\ndifferent linguistic changes and offer a granular view of the flexibility in\nlinguistic expression (e.g., a shift in syntax or vocabulary used). In this\nstudy, we assess the human preferences towards ChatGPT in generating English\nparaphrases with ten APTs and five prompting techniques. We introduce APTY\n(Atomic Paraphrase TYpes), a dataset of 500 sentence-level and word-level\nannotations by 15 annotators. The dataset also provides a human preference\nranking of paraphrases with different types that can be used to fine-tune\nmodels with RLHF and DPO methods. Our results reveal that ChatGPT can generate\nsimple APTs, such as additions and deletions, but struggle with complex\nstructures (e.g., subordination changes). This study contributes to\nunderstanding which aspects of paraphrasing language models have already\nsucceeded at understanding and what remains elusive. In addition, our curated\ndatasets can be used to develop language models with specific linguistic\ncapabilities.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"P5B4iMMR2K62Ht_UfPyCLmkKjp2qt8smVp4co0Vzbso","pdfSize":"1765644"}
