As there are no approved plans to follow up this program with more\nadvanced neutrino oscillation experiments, we consider here one option that had\ngained considerable interest more than a decade ago: a neutrino factory. Such\nan experiment uses stored muons in a racetrack configuration with extremely\nwell characterized decays reducing systematic uncertainties and providing for\nmore oscillation channels. Such a machine could also be one step towards a high\nenergy muon collider program. We consider a long-baseline configuration to SURF\nusing the DUNE far detectors or modifications thereof, and compare the expected\nsensitivities to the three-flavor oscillation parameters to the anticipated\nresults from DUNE and HK. We find that a neutrino factory can improve our\nunderstanding of CP violation and also aid in disentangling the complicated\nflavor puzzle.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"n4V9pH9GqIjNmGknT_P7kAPfXdEUmFBCI47x96TVgvg","pdfSize":"801340"}
