Since human A/B testing\nis commonly used, we assume commercial systems improve over time, which enables\nus to evaluate machine translation (MT) metrics based on their preference for\nmore recent translations. Our study confirms several previous findings in MT\nmetrics research and demonstrates the dataset's value as a testbed for metric\nevaluation.
