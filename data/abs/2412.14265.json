In this framework, inflation is driven by a de\nSitter space-time (dS), where tensor metric fluctuations (i.e., gravitational\nwaves) naturally arise from quantum vacuum oscillations, and scalar\nfluctuations are generated via second-order tensor effects. We compute the\npower spectrum of such scalar fluctuations and show it to be consistent with\nnear scale-invariance. We derive the necessary conditions under which scalar\nperturbations become significant and much larger than the tensor modes, and we\nidentify a natural mechanism to end inflation via a transition to a\nradiation-dominated phase. Our proposed mechanism could remove the need for a\nmodel-dependent scenario: the choice of a scalar field, as the inflaton, to\ndrive inflation.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jzcgMyw4LaDbtq0XYRddC_wG1uETaFlmd-Na0OEH7AA","pdfSize":"124898"}
