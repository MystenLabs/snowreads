Our\nmethod harnesses the capabilities of latent diffusion models, enriched with\nextensive pre-trained knowledge, to regularize the matting process. We present\nnovel architectural innovations that empower our model to produce mattes with\nsuperior resolution and detail. The proposed method is versatile and can\nperform both guidance-free and guidance-based image matting, accommodating a\nvariety of additional cues. Our comprehensive evaluation across three benchmark\ndatasets demonstrates the superior performance of our approach, both\nquantitatively and qualitatively. The results not only reflect our method's\nrobust effectiveness but also highlight its ability to generate visually\ncompelling mattes that approach photorealistic quality.
