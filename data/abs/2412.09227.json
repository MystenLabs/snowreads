  "abstract": "  In this article, we discuss the notion of partition of elements in an\narbitrary Coxeter system $(W,S)$: a partition of an element $w$ is a subset\n$\\mathcal P\\subseteq W$ such that the left inversion set of $w$ is the disjoint\nunion of the left inversion set of the elements in $\\mathcal P$. Partitions of\nelements of $W$ arises in the study of the Belkale-Kumar product on the\ncohomology $H^*(X,\\mathbb Z)$, where $X$ is the complete flag variety of any\ncomplex semi-simple algebraic group. Partitions of elements in the symmetric\ngroup $\\mathcal S_n$ are also related to the {\\em Babington-Smith model} in\nalgebraic statistics or to the simplicial faces of the Littlewood-Richardson\ncone.\n  We state the conjecture that the number of right descents of $w$ is the sum\nof the number of right descents of the elements of $\\mathcal P$ and prove that\nthis conjecture holds in the cases of symmetric groups (type $A$) and\nhyperoctahedral groups (type $B$).\n",
