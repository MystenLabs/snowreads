  "abstract": "  Equilibrium probes have been widely used in various noisy quantum metrology\nschemes. However, such an equilibrium-probe-based metrology scenario severely\nsuffers from the low-temperature-error divergence problem in the weak-coupling\nregime. To circumvent this limit, we propose a strategy to eliminate the\nerror-divergence problem by utilizing the strong coupling effects, which can be\ncaptured by the reaction-coordinate mapping. The strong couplings induce a\nnoncanonical equilibrium state and greatly enhance the metrology performance.\nIt is found that our metrology precision behaves as a polynomial-type scaling\nrelation, which suggests the reduction of temperature can be used as a resource\nto improve the metrology performance. Our result is sharply contrary to that of\nthe weakcoupling case, in which the metrology precision exponentially decays as\nthe temperature decreases. Paving a way to realize a high-precision noisy\nquantum metrology at low temperatures, our result reveals the importance of the\nnon-Markovianity in quantum technologies.\n",
