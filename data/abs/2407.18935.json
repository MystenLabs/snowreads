However, due to complex\ninteractions, catalyst design has long relied on trial-and-error, a costly and\nlabor-intensive process leading to scarce data that is heavily biased towards\nundesired, low-yield catalysts. Despite the rise of ML in this field, most\nefforts have not focused on dealing with the challenges presented by such\nexperimental data. To address these challenges, we introduce a robust machine\nlearning and explainable AI (XAI) framework to accurately classify the\ncatalytic yield of various compositions and identify the contributions of\nindividual components. This framework combines a series of ML practices\ndesigned to handle the scarcity and imbalance of catalyst data. We apply the\nframework to classify the yield of various catalyst compositions in oxidative\nmethane coupling, and use it to evaluate the performance of a range of ML\nmodels: tree-based models, logistic regression, support vector machines, and\nneural networks. These experiments demonstrate that the methods used in our\nframework lead to a significant improvement in the performance of all but one\nof the evaluated models. Additionally, the decision-making process of each ML\nmodel is analyzed by identifying the most important features for predicting\ncatalyst performance using XAI methods. Our analysis found that XAI methods,\nproviding class-aware explanations, such as Layer-wise Relevance Propagation,\nidentified key components that contribute specifically to high-yield catalysts.\nThese findings align with chemical intuition and existing literature,\nreinforcing their validity. We believe that such insights can assist chemists\nin the development and identification of novel catalysts with superior\nperformance.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"yT12FThl7le60QqdHPb70uwEyg5R6PSOU7U4jBVJKAs","pdfSize":"15728284"}
