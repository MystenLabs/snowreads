Hull, is discussed in loop space with focus on its\nbosonic sector. Pursuing an analogy to the loop space version of the system of\na two form B and its field strength H, we show that the exotic linearised\ngravitational potential C and curvature G can be reinterpreted as an\nultra-local (linearised) metric and curvature on loop space.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WrHojpsk0-lXvUc8W-5BEHxVtG0CbOhyGn-uDrxP6rk","pdfSize":"144522"}
