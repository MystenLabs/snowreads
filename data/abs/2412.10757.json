Here, we\nreport a compact, vertically integrated/stratified field-effect transistor\n(VSFET) consisting of a 2D non-ferroelectric MoS$_2$ FET channel stacked on a\n2D ferroelectric In$_2$Se$_3$ FET channel. Electrostatic coupling between the\nferroelectric and non-ferroelectric semiconducting channels results in\nhysteretic transfer and output characteristics of both FETs. The\ngate-controlled MoS$_2$ memtransistor is shown to emulate homosynaptic\nplasticity behavior with low nonlinearity, low epoch, and high accuracy\nsupervised (ANN - artificial neural network) and unsupervised (SNN - spiking\nneural network) on-chip learning. Further, simultaneous measurements of the\nMoS$_2$ and In$_2$Se$_3$ transistor synapses help realize complex\nheterosynaptic cooperation and competition behaviors. These are shown to mimic\nadvanced sensorimotor neural network-controlled gill withdrawal reflex\nsensitization and habituation of a sea mollusk (Aplysia) with ultra-low power\nconsumption. Finally, we show logic reconfigurability of the VSFET to realize\nBoolean gates thereby adding significant design flexibility for advanced\ncomputing technologies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"agVCosJ9VWMz_sX6cy0Qbqsba6LvBZw4qhTO3NYm3hA","pdfSize":"13399560"}
