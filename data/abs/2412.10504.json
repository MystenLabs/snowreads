  "abstract": "  Foundation models are deep learning models pre-trained on large amounts of\ndata which are capable of generalizing to multiple datasets and/or downstream\ntasks. This work demonstrates how data collected by the CMS experiment at the\nLarge Hadron Collider can be useful in pre-training foundation models for HEP.\nSpecifically, we introduce the AspenOpenJets dataset, consisting of\napproximately 180M high $p_T$ jets derived from CMS 2016 Open Data. We show how\npre-training the OmniJet-$\\alpha$ foundation model on AspenOpenJets improves\nperformance on generative tasks with significant domain shift: generating\nboosted top and QCD jets from the simulated JetClass dataset. In addition to\ndemonstrating the power of pre-training of a jet-based foundation model on\nactual proton-proton collision data, we provide the ML-ready derived\nAspenOpenJets dataset for further public use.\n",
