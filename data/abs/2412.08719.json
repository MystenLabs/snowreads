  "abstract": "  Simulating the dynamics of complex quantum systems is a central application\nof quantum devices. Here, we propose leveraging the power of measurements to\nsimulate short-time quantum dynamics of physically prepared quantum states in\nclassical post-processing using a truncated Taylor series approach. While\nlimited to short simulation times, our hybrid quantum-classical method is\nequipped with rigorous error bounds. It is extendable to estimate low-order\nTaylor approximations of smooth, time-dependent functions of tractable linear\ncombinations of measurable operators. These insights can be made use of in the\ncontext of Hamiltonian learning and device verification, short-time imaginary\ntime evolution, or the application of intractable operations to sub-universal\nquantum simulators in classical post-processing.\n",
