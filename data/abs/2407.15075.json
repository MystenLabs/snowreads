In this article, we investigate the mapping classes\nof the diffeomorphisms $F_n, n\\ge 8$. These diffeomorphisms are reducible with\nunique invariant irreducible curves, and we determine the mapping classes of\ntheir restrictions, $\\hat F_n, n \\ge 8$, on the cut surfaces, showing that they\nare pseudo-Anosov and do not arise from Penner's construction. For $n=8$,\nLehmer's number is realized as the stretch factor of $\\hat F_8$, a\npseudo-Anosov map on a once-punctured genus $5$ orientable surface. The\ndiffeomorphism $\\hat F_8$ is a new geometric realization of a Lehmer's number.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mAqopqvo7pthMMg2ppF13VMsPE8Dp4XWf1IAnbTsxq4","pdfSize":"1239213"}
