  "abstract": "  In this work we explore utilizing LLMs for data augmentation for\nmanufacturing task guidance system. The dataset consists of representative\nsamples of interactions with technicians working in an advanced manufacturing\nsetting. The purpose of this work to explore the task, data augmentation for\nthe supported tasks and evaluating the performance of the existing LLMs. We\nobserve that that task is complex requiring understanding from procedure\nspecification documents, actions and objects sequenced temporally. The dataset\nconsists of 200,000+ question/answer pairs that refer to the spec document and\nare grounded in narrations and/or video demonstrations. We compared the\nperformance of several popular open-sourced LLMs by developing a baseline using\neach LLM and then compared the responses in a reference-free setting using\nLLM-as-a-judge and compared the ratings with crowd-workers whilst validating\nthe ratings with experts.\n",
