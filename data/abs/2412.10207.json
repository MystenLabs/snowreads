  "abstract": "  Open-domain semantic parsing remains a challenging task, as models often rely\non heuristics and struggle to handle unseen concepts. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) for this task and\nintroduce Retrieval-Augmented Semantic Parsing (RASP), a simple yet effective\napproach that integrates external lexical knowledge into the parsing process.\nOur experiments not only show that LLMs outperform previous encoder-decoder\nbaselines for semantic parsing, but that RASP further enhances their ability to\npredict unseen concepts, nearly doubling the performance of previous models on\nout-of-distribution concepts. These findings highlight the promise of\nleveraging large language models and retrieval mechanisms for robust and\nopen-domain semantic parsing.\n",
