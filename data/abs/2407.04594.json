The purpose of deploying the network was to\ncollect soil temperature data and investigate the impact of global warming on\n(sub)Arctic climate and subsequent carbon release. Functional networks from\nthree sites with no direct access to power and the internet have been providing\nresearchers with insight into the warming impacts since 2021. The network\nemploys low-power wireless sensor nodes equipped with DASH7 communication\nprotocol, providing real-time data and remote access to sensors and instruments\ndeployed in the field. In addition to discussing the architecture and\ndeployment of the network, we conduct a primary analysis using models and\nmethods to demonstrate the feasibility of harvesting energy from the\ntemperature gradient between geothermally active soil and air.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"HmKu3dpLg2IHQ8sQ8YxtEEAWrVx8Jp-6T3_lTpWGhDY","pdfSize":"2510254"}
