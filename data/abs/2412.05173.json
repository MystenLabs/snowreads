In this work, we introduce the Quantum Laplace Transform\n(QLT), which enables the implementation of $N\\times N$ discrete Laplace\ntransforms on quantum states encoded in $\\lceil \\log_2(N)\\rceil$-qubits. In\nmany cases, the associated quantum circuits have a depth that scales with $N$\nas $O(\\log(\\log(N)))$ and a size that scales as $O(\\log(N))$, requiring\nexponentially fewer operations and double-exponentially less computational time\nthan their classical counterparts. These efficient scalings open the\npossibility of developing a new class of quantum algorithms based on Laplace\ntransforms, with potential applications in physics, engineering, chemistry,\nmachine learning, and finance.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"GjVmVCaOYuRWe8uTVP553s0ax75qlUZtzau3_eeJgsU","pdfSize":"595970"}
