These were subsequently proved by\nWatson (1938) and Atkin (1967). In 2009 Choi, Kang, and Lovejoy proved\ncongruences modulo powers of $5$ for the crank parity function. The generating\nfunction for the analogous rank parity function is $f(q)$, the first example of\na mock theta function that Ramanujan mentioned in his last letter to Hardy.\nRecently we proved congruences modulo powers of $5$ for the rank parity\nfunction, and here we extend these congruences for powers of $7$. We also show\nhow these congruences imply congruences modulo powers of $5$ and $7$ for the\ncoefficients of the related third order mock theta function $\\omega(q)$, using\nAtkin-Lehner involutions and transformation results of Zwegers. Finally we a\nprove a family of congruences modulo powers of $7$ for the crank parity\nfunction.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kyzd3-kIFNyHwLy5Qes9f6Bm_eU5PS111soIri93dZk","pdfSize":"398592"}
