The CogSimulator employs Wasserstein-1 distance and\ncoordinates search optimization for hyperparameter tuning, enabling precise\nfew-shot predictions in new game scenarios. Comparative experiments with the\nWordle dataset illustrate that our model surpasses most conventional machine\nlearning models in mean Wasserstein-1 distance, mean squared error, and mean\naccuracy, showcasing its efficacy in cognitive enhancement through tailored\ngame design.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"l42VD5CIbbmAgGBF9wE8HeJmQ3_uOMpOgjEoncAlpsI","pdfSize":"12466246"}
