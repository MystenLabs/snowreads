However, ensuring the optimized\ndesigns comply with fabrication constraints imposed by semiconductor foundries\nremains a challenge. This work presents a TO framework that guarantees designs\nsatisfy fabrication criteria, particularly minimum feature size and separation.\nLeveraging recent advancements in machine learning and feature mapping methods,\nour approach constructs components by transforming shapes from a predefined\nlibrary, simplifying constraint enforcement. Specifically, we introduce a\nConvo-implicit Variational Autoencoder to encode the discrete shape library\ninto a differentiable space, enabling gradient-based optimization. The efficacy\nof our framework is demonstrated through the design of several common photonic\ncomponents.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"N-KXqnDi9xIdAx0oyDUOSYFF3A8zRZM-e1Up-QedcSQ","pdfSize":"5060533"}
