The crystal structure of this new platinate and its\ncomposition, Nd10.67Pt4O24 , are here reported for the first time. The compound\nis synthesized either by a direct reaction using PtO2(g) or by the citric acid\nchemical route. Based on 3-dimensional electron diffraction data and Rietveld\nrefinement of high-resolution synchrotron and neutron powder diffraction data,\nwe accurately describe its crystal structure in space group I41/a. The compound\nis structurally related to the Ln11-xSrxIr4O24 (Ln = La, Pr, Nd, Sm) phases\nwith a double-perovskite (A2BB'O6) like crystal structure and A-site\ncation-deficiency. Owing to the fixed oxidation state of Pt(IV), two of the\nfour Nd-sites are partly occupied to provide charge neutrality, with the Nd4\nsite taking a split position. On heating, Nd10.67Pt4O24 decomposes into Nd2O3\nand Pt. A plateau in the thermogravimetric curves measured in 33 vol. % O2 in\nN2 indicates the presence of an intermediate Pt(II) phase at around 960\n{\\deg}C, probably isostructural with La4PtO7.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"w0BlJ3F8jvH8FrmBuo5MrnJc4-rUiRCnsL7-85il354","pdfSize":"2450061"}
