  "abstract": "  Electron scattering cross section, as well as proton scattering cross\nsection, observes the point-proton and the point-neutron distributions, but\nboth cross sections are not able to determine them separately. If they are\nanalyzed consistently with each other, there is a possibility to determine them\nwith less ambiguity.The consistency can be examined through the moments of the\ncharge distribution, which linearly depend on the moments of the point-proton\nand -neutron distributions.\n",
