  "abstract": "  Jacobi's theta relations among quartic products of theta functions are\ngeneralized to those of arbitrary $n$ products. Igusa's procedure of derivation\nis extended to prove such general theta relations, from which we obtain general\naddition formulas and theta constants identities. To complete the proof, the\nconcept of {\\it cycle number $\\lambda$} is essential. The case of $n=3$ is\ndiscussed and examined explicitly.\n",
