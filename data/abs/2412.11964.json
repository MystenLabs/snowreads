  "abstract": "  Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for conducting inference on\ngraph data but are often seen as \"black boxes\" due to difficulty in extracting\nmeaningful subnetworks driving predictive performance. Many interpretable GNN\nmethods exist, but they cannot quantify uncertainty in edge weights and suffer\nin predictive accuracy when applied to challenging graph structures. In this\nwork, we proposed BetaExplainer which addresses these issues by using a\nsparsity-inducing prior to mask unimportant edges during model training. To\nevaluate our approach, we examine various simulated data sets with diverse\nreal-world characteristics. Not only does this implementation provide a notion\nof edge importance uncertainty, it also improves upon evaluation metrics for\nchallenging datasets compared to state-of-the art explainer methods.\n",
