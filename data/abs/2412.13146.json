  "abstract": "  The Kyrgyz language, as a low-resource language, requires significant effort\nto create high-quality syntactic corpora. This study proposes an approach to\nsimplify the development process of a syntactic corpus for Kyrgyz. We present a\ntool for transferring syntactic annotations from Turkish to Kyrgyz based on a\ntreebank translation method. The effectiveness of the proposed tool was\nevaluated using the TueCL treebank. The results demonstrate that this approach\nachieves higher syntactic annotation accuracy compared to a monolingual model\ntrained on the Kyrgyz KTMU treebank. Additionally, the study introduces a\nmethod for assessing the complexity of manual annotation for the resulting\nsyntactic trees, contributing to further optimization of the annotation\nprocess.\n",
