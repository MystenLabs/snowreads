By integrating the trained motion masks\nand modeling the static scene as Gaussian splats with dynamics-aware\noptimization, our method achieves more accurate background reconstruction\nresults than previous works. Our proposed method is termed DAS3R, an\nabbreviation for Dynamics-Aware Gaussian Splatting for Static Scene\nReconstruction. Compared to existing methods, DAS3R is more robust in complex\nmotion scenarios, capable of handling videos where dynamic objects occupy a\nsignificant portion of the scene, and does not require camera pose inputs or\npoint cloud data from SLAM-based methods. We compared DAS3R against recent\ndistractor-free approaches on the DAVIS and Sintel datasets; DAS3R demonstrates\nenhanced performance and robustness with a margin of more than 2 dB in PSNR.\nThe project's webpage can be accessed via \\url{https://kai422.github.io/DAS3R/}\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AjXE72zCK0v-bMGKHTHRZ7-ymU_iTUZzW3jEFlEIpc0","pdfSize":"2147698"}
