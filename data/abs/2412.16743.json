  "abstract": "  We construct a one-parameter family of pairwise non-isometric metrics\n$h_{\\rho}, \\rho > 0,$ on any closed Sasakian manifold $M^{4k+1}$ such that\n$\\pi_1({\\rm Isom}(M, h_\\rho))$ is infinite. On $S^{4k+1}$, $h_0$ is the\nstandard metric, so $\\pi_1({\\rm Isom}(S^{4k+1}, h_\\rho)) = {\\mathbb Z}_2$ is\nfinite only at $\\rho = 0.$ We also give a new proof that $\\pi_1({\\rm\nDiff}_{\\eta,str} (S^{4k+1}))$ is infinite, where ${\\rm Diff}_{\\eta,str}\n(S^{4k+1})$ is the infinite dimensional group of diffeomrophisms which are\nstrict contact transformations of the standard contact structure on $S^{4k+1}.$\n",
