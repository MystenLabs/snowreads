In settings with many competing optima, marginal ones tend to\nattract algorithms and physical dynamics. Often, the important family of\nmarginal attractors are a vanishing minority compared with nonmarginal optima\nand other unstable stationary points. We introduce a generic technique for\nconditioning the statistics of stationary points in random landscapes on their\nmarginality, and apply it in three isotropic settings with qualitatively\ndifferent structure: in the spherical spin-glasses, where the energy is\nGaussian and its Hessian is GOE; in multispherical spin glasses, which are\nGaussian but non-GOE; and in sums of squared spherical random functions, which\nare non-Gaussian. In these problems we are able to fully characterize the\ndistribution of marginal optima in the landscape, including when they are in\nthe minority.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LiJapUvbXBJ50XIrV5bMnnDfXX730pd_sMqPI9E4k0Q","pdfSize":"650229"}
