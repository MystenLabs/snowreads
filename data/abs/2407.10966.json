It sets up a method for estimating the\nphase value at arbitrary uncertainty. This strategy is global, since it\nrequires no prior information, and it achieves the Heisenberg bound\nindependently of the output statistics. We provide simulations and a\ncharacterization of this architecture.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BIVg0av-fhegswusFPTtYVZDIFcANV65Lj0rUb7AzC4","pdfSize":"537716","objectId":"0xcda9f4807281af958cce1085b21d5ba23bc694a1222605c29341b7814e3e2690","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
