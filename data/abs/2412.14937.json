  "abstract": "  This paper presents a new $\\tau$-lepton reconstruction and identification\nprocedure at the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider, which leads to\nsignificantly improved performance in the case of physics processes where a\nhighly boosted pair of $\\tau$-leptons is produced and one $\\tau$-lepton decays\ninto a muon and two neutrinos ($\\tau_{\\mu}$), and the other decays into hadrons\nand one neutrino ($\\tau_{had}$). By removing the muon information from the\nsignals used for reconstruction and identification of the $\\tau_{had}$\ncandidate in the boosted pair, the efficiency is raised to the level expected\nfor an isolated $\\tau_{had}$. The new procedure is validated by selecting a\nsample of highly boosted $Z\\rightarrow\\tau_{\\mu}\\tau_{had}$ candidates from the\ndata sample of $140$ ${fb}^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at $13$ TeV\nrecorded with the ATLAS detector. Good agreement is found between data and\nsimulation predictions in both the $Z\\rightarrow\\tau_{\\mu}\\tau_{had}$ signal\nregion and in a background validation region. The results presented in this\npaper demonstrate the effectiveness of the $\\tau_{had}$ reconstruction with\nmuon removal in enhancing the signal sensitivity of the boosted\n$\\tau_{\\mu}\\tau_{had}$ channel at the ATLAS detector.\n",
