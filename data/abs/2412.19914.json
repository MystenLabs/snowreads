An unconstrained, concave, variational principle\nis designed for solving the resulting mathematical problem. Cases when the\nSecond Law becomes an over-constraint on the mechanical model, as well as when\nit serves as a necessary constraint, are discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CVINkz4kJM2IcWJyD0uzVNTsZizrHANimPxywIky0AU","pdfSize":"178725"}
