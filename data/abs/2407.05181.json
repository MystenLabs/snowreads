We present a range of AI-based exercises that enable novel forms of\npractice and application including simulations, mentoring, coaching, and\nco-creation. For each type of exercise, we provide prompts that instructors can\ncustomize, along with guidance on classroom implementation, assessment, and\nrisks to consider. We also provide blueprints, prompts that help instructors\ncreate their own original prompts. Instructors can leverage their content and\npedagogical expertise to design these experiences, putting them in the role of\nbuilders and innovators. We argue that this instructor-driven approach has the\npotential to democratize the development of educational technology by enabling\nindividual instructors to create AI exercises and tools tailored to their\nstudents' needs. While the exercises in this paper are a starting point, not a\ndefinitive solutions, they demonstrate AI's potential to expand what is\npossible in teaching and learning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lUTT1cKdE5BvyhDNzwVjuWepnb-F03ttonxPiDFW07U","pdfSize":"8257918"}
