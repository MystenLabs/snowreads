We establish\ncommutativity conditions that extend classical results from prime rings to the\ngraded setting. In particular, we show that under certain conditions on\nhomogeneous derivations, the ring must be commutative. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that these results cannot be extended to gr-semiprime rings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XjVNzqD2CMtoJEpdfJfNuXb0wayVsxHXkRBVsgGuxls","pdfSize":"113479"}
