  "abstract": "  The hardware security community relies on databases of known vulnerabilities\nand open-source designs to develop formal verification methods for identifying\nhardware security flaws. While there are plenty of open-source designs and\nverification tools, there is a gap in open-source properties addressing these\nflaws, making it difficult to reproduce prior work and slowing research. This\npaper aims to bridge that gap.\n  We provide SystemVerilog Assertions for four common designs: OR1200, Hack@DAC\n2018's buggy PULPissimo SoC, Hack@DAC 2019's CVA6, and Hack@DAC 2021's buggy\nOpenPiton SoCs. The properties are organized by design and tagged with details\nabout the security flaws and the implicated CWE. To encourage more property\nreporting, we describe the methodology we use when crafting properties.\n",
