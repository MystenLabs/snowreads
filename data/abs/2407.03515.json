Recent introduction of Shapley values for individualized feature\ncontributions, accompanied with several fast computing algorithms for predicted\nvalues, shows intriguing results. However, individualizing coefficients of\ndetermination, aka $R^2$, for each feature is challenged by the underlying\nquadratic losses, although these coefficients allow us to comparatively assess\nsingle feature's contribution to tree ensembles. Here we propose an efficient\nalgorithm, Q-SHAP, that reduces the computational complexity to polynomial time\nwhen calculating Shapley values related to quadratic losses. Our extensive\nsimulation studies demonstrate that this approach not only enhances\ncomputational efficiency but also improves estimation accuracy of\nfeature-specific coefficients of determination.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UhLUYtb3cMKFqQYc6gZjBOfKVIYIzH7qY6enVeKgUPU","pdfSize":"1517571"}
