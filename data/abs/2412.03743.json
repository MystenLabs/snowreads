Simpler\nLinear Inverse Models (LIMs) trained on the much shorter observational record\nalso make skillful ENSO predictions but do not capture predictable nonlinear\nprocesses. This motivates a hybrid approach, combining the LIMs modest data\nneeds with a deep-learning non-Markovian correction of the LIM. For O(100 yr)\ndatasets, our resulting Hybrid model is more skillful than the LIM while also\nexceeding the skill of a full deep-learning model. Additionally, while the most\npredictable ENSO events are still identified in advance by the LIM, they are\nbetter predicted by the Hybrid model, especially in the western tropical\nPacific for leads beyond about 9 months, by capturing the subsequent asymmetric\n(warm versus cold phases) evolution of ENSO.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"4HYGHWKs9-8zRIJkIA1Qs5ZCrSkv8uoIw048CJUR8oM","pdfSize":"8333376"}
