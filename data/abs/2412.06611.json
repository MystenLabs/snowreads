  "abstract": "  This study demonstrates the application of quantum computing based quantum\nannealing to seismic traveltime inversion, a critical approach for inverting\nhighly accurate velocity models. The seismic inversion problem is first\nconverted into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problem, which the\nquantum annealer is specifically designed to solve. We then solve the problem\nvia quantum annealing method. The inversion is applied on a synthetic velocity\nmodel, presenting a carbon storage scenario at depths of 1000-1300 meters. As\nan application example, we also show the capacity of quantum computing to\nhandle complex, noisy data environments. This work highlights the emerging\npotential of quantum computing in geophysical applications, providing a\nfoundation for future developments in high-precision seismic imaging.\n",
