  "abstract": "  Linkage between core-collapse supernovae (SNe) and their progenitors is not\nfully understood and ongoing effort of searching and identifying the\nprogenitors is needed. $\\mathrm{SN\\,2024abfl}$ is a recent Type II supernova\nexploded in the nearby star-bursting galaxy $\\mathrm{NGC\\,2146}$, which is also\nthe host galaxy of $\\mathrm{SN\\,2018zd}$. From archival Hubble Space Telescope\n(HST) data, we have found a red source ($\\mathrm{m_{F814W} \\sim 25}$) near the\nlocation (angular distance $\\leq 0.2\"$) of $\\mathrm{SN\\,2024abfl}$ before its\nexplosion. With F814W and F606W photometry, we found that the properties of\nthis source matched a typical red supergiant (RSG) moderately reddened by\ninterstellar dust at the distance of the host galaxy. We conclude that the\n$\\mathrm{SN\\,2024abfl}$ had an RSG progenitor with initial mass of\n$\\mathrm{10M_{\\odot}}$--$\\mathrm{16\\,M_{\\odot}}$.\n",
