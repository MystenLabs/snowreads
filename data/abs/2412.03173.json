Traditional on-road autonomous\nmethods struggle with dynamic terrains, leading to poor vehicle control on\noff-road. Recent deep-learning models have used perception sensors along with\nkinesthetic feedback for navigation on such terrains. However, this approach\nhas out-of-domain uncertainty. Factors like change in weather and time of day\nimpacts the performance of the model. We propose a multi modal fusion network\nFuseIsPath capable of using LWIR and RGB images to provide robustness against\ndynamic weather and light conditions. To aid further works in this domain, we\nalso open-source a day-night dataset with LWIR and RGB images along with\npseudo-labels for traversability. In order to co-register the two images we\ndeveloped a novel method for targetless extrinsic calibration of LWIR, LiDAR\nand RGB cameras with translation accuracy of 1.7cm and rotation accuracy of\n0.827degree.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Robotics","Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"BV4lkjJjQ4HdQMZdy96XOZA5sivt7-ZCz5VXkBdZ-eg","pdfSize":"19557294"}
