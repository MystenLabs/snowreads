  "abstract": "  This paper investigated the impact of Egypt's accession to the BRICS bloc by\nstudying the participation rate of BRICS countries in Egypt, as well as the\nexposure rate and the ratio of foreign investment of BRICS countries in Egypt\nto the total foreign investment in Egypt, as well as Egypt's export\nopportunities in the BRICS markets and the impact of these variables on the\nratio of foreign assets in Egypt during the period from 2000 to 2024, In order\nto predict the impact of Egypt's accession to the BRICS bloc in the coming\nyears as well. The study used the ARDL model to determine the impact of the\nfour independent variables on the dependent variable (foreign assets), which is\nthe ratio of foreign assets. It also used automatic ARIMA model to predict the\nvalues of the study variables during the period from 2024 to 2030.\n",
