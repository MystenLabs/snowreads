These effects are derived\nby averaging the influence of a proposed global quantum fluctuation in position\nand velocity. While $QT^\\ast$ is initially conceived as a conceptual framework\n- a ``toy theory\" - to demonstrate the internal consistency of specific\nperspectives in the measurement process debate, it also exhibits physical\nfeatures worthy of serious consideration. The introduced decoherence effects\ncreate a distinction between micro- and macrosystems, determined by a\ncharacteristic mass-dependent decoherence timescale, $\\tau(m)$. For\nmacrosystems, $QT^\\ast$ can be approximated by classical statistical mechanics\n(CSM), while for microsystems, the conventional quantum theory $QT$ remains\napplicable. The quantum measurement process is analyzed within the framework of\n$QT^\\ast$, where Galilean decoherence enables the transition from entangled\nstates to proper mixtures. This transition supports an ignorance-based\ninterpretation of measurement outcomes, aligning with the ensemble\ninterpretation of quantum states. To illustrate the theory's application, the\nStern-Gerlach spin measurement is explored. This example demonstrates that\ninternal consistency can be achieved despite the challenges of modeling\ninteractions with macroscopic detectors.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tv25HOIkeuaMoseBk6hFtjsn4vqdI5DMO7EFags9tao","pdfSize":"421595"}
