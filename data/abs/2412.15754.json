This paper presents the first demonstration of Transverse\nOrientation-Patterned gallium phosphide (TOP-GaP) waveguides showing\nhigh-efficiency second harmonic generation. In such devices, first order modal\nphase matching is unlocked and optimized through the inversion of the nonlinear\nsusceptibility along the vertical direction. We discuss here the theory behind\nmodal phase matching in TOP structures, describe the fabrication process, and\npresent linear and nonlinear characterizations of the TOP-GaP waveguides.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3Gg6cvlkPHpnVaJdc6fcrD6iTC1wChGqdhH7OSCucpA","pdfSize":"537069"}
