We propose a theoretical model to study\ncooperative vibrational strong coupling in an open quantum system. The\nnon-equilibrium stochastic molecular dynamics in an optical cavity with an\nauxiliary ensemble is investigated. It shows that coupling with a cavity mode\nintroduces an additional colored noise and a negative feedback, both of which\nenable control over thermalization rates (i.e. the lifetime of excitation) of\nreactive molecules. Our work offers a pathway to steer stability of chemical\nbonds for chemical reactivity under cooperative vibrational strong coupling.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XjbJBjNJ6sBykBNtDGe2YtfsOX3JGVVV3oAYSkCnJSY","pdfSize":"2347210"}
