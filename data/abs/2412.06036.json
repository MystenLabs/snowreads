  "abstract": "  We report the detection of Raman-scattered C II lines at 7023 and 7054\\r{A}\nin the symbiotic star V366 Carinae using GHOST at Gemini South. These faint\nfeatures, originating from the C II doublet at ${\\lambda}{\\lambda}$ 1036 and\n1037\\r{A}, are rare and have been detected in only two other symbiotic stars:\nV1016 Cygni and RR Telescopii. Our findings showcase the exceptional\nsensitivity of GHOST to detect subtle spectral features and open the door to\ncomparative studies of Raman-scattered C II features across these systems.\n",
