We find asymptotics of the critical probability\nof percolation for $r=2,3$. In the deterministic setting, we obtain several\nresults for the size of the smallest percolating set for $k\\ge 2$, including\nthe exact values for $k=2$ and $2\\le r\\le 6$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bmZpwnt-0K8ToI-pd70_WGRp1IAzrAk5Nw-5yhwEShs","pdfSize":"207712"}
