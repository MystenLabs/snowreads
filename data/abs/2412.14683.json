We prove that in the diffusive regime,\nthe correct limit is not reached, in agreement with known results for\nfirst-order LSFE. A diffusive scaling is introduced that can be applied to\novercome this, again in full agreement with theoretical results for LSFE. We\nprovide numerical results in the case of slab geometry that support our\ntheoretical findings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"weg8WI-noWgHJpG5t_WDV9c1RNZhPOabkWUKiuSwbZQ","pdfSize":"677885"}
