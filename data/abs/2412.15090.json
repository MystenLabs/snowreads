  "abstract": "  The high-luminosity phase of LHC operations (HL-LHC), will feature a large\nincrease in simultaneous proton-proton interactions per bunch crossing up to\n200, compared with a typical leveling target of 64 in Run 3. Such an increase\nwill create a very challenging environment in which to perform charged particle\ntrajectory reconstruction, a task crucial for the success of the ATLAS physics\nprogram, and will exceed the capabilities of the current ATLAS Inner Detector\n(ID). A new all-silicon Inner Tracker (ITk) will replace the current ID in time\nfor the start of the HL-LHC. To ensure successful use of the ITk capabilities\nin Run 4 and beyond, the ATLAS tracking software has been successfully adapted\nto achieve state-of-the-art track reconstruction in challenging high-luminosity\nconditions with the ITk detector. This paper presents the expected tracking\nperformance of the ATLAS ITk based on the latest available developments since\nthe ITk technical design reports.\n",
