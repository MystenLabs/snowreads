  "abstract": "  Machine-type communications (MTC) are crucial in the evolution of mobile\ncommunication systems. Within this context, we distinguish the so-called\nmassive MTC (mMTC), where a large number of devices coexist in the same\ngeographical area. In the case of sensors, a high correlation in the collected\ninformation is expected. In this letter, we evaluate the impact of correlation\non the entropy of a set of quantized Gaussian sources. This model allows us to\nexpress the sensed data with the data correlation matrix. Given the nature of\nmMTC, these matrices may be well approximated as rank deficient. Accordingly,\nwe exploit this singularity to design a technique for switching off several\nsensors that maximizes the entropy under power-related constraints. The\ndiscrete optimization problem is transformed into a convex formulation that can\nbe solved numerically.\n",
