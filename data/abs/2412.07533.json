We\nshow that the non-minimal coupling originates an (anisotropic) pressure able to\ncounteract gravity and to allow the formation of regular, horizonless\nultra-compact objects of dark matter (NMC-UCOs). We then analyze the orbits of\nmassive and massless particles in the gravitational field of NMC-UCOs,\nproviding some specific example and a general discussion in terms of phase\nportraits. Finally, we study the gravitational lensing effects around NMC-UCOs,\nand effectively describe these in terms of a pseudo-shadow.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"SxAr3j5tbk_jQl2zAWMQpeQDfaURUWY-Nps13ygQhv8","pdfSize":"1846302"}
