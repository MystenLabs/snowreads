In many cases, the homology of a diagram algebra can be\nidentified with the homology of a group. In this paper we have two main aims.\nFirstly, we study the (co)homology of new families of diagram algebras such as\nthe blob algebras and the walled Brauer algebras, both of which exhibit new\nphenomena in the field. Secondly, we show that in the cases where the homology\nof a diagram algebra can be identified with group homology one can also\nidentify the cohomology of the algebra with the cohomology of a group. We use\nthis to establish an integer-graded cohomology theory for these diagram\nalgebras and identify this with the Tate cohomology of a group.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SKnAshQgQHBffJ3GvKkiEcU8TG7F7qZ7IvbLaNe_VzQ","pdfSize":"449603"}
