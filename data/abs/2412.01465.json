  "abstract": "  Multi-objective unconstrained combinatorial optimization problems (MUCO) are\nin general hard to solve, i.e., the corresponding decision problem is NP-hard\nand the outcome set is intractable. In this paper we explore special cases of\nMUCO problems that are actually easy, i.e., solvable in polynomial time. More\nprecisely, we show that MUCO problems with up to two ordinal objective\nfunctions plus one real-valued objective function are tractable, and that their\ncomplete nondominated set can be computed in polynomial time. For MUCO problems\nwith one ordinal and a second ordinal or real-valued objective function we\npresent an even more efficient algorithm that applies a greedy strategy\nmultiple times.\n",
