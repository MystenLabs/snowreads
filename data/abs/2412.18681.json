  "abstract": "  I discuss here the progress made in the last decade on few of the key open\nproblems in GRB physics. These include: (1) the nature of GRB progenitors, and\nthe outliers found to the collapsar/merger scenarios; (2) Jet structures, whose\nexistence became evident following GRB/GW170817; (3) the great progress made in\nunderstanding the GRB jet launching mechanisms, enabled by general-relativistic\nmagneto-hydrodynamic (GR-MHD) codes; (4) recent studies of magnetic\nreconnection as a valid energy dissipation mechanism; (5) the early afterglow,\nwhich may be highly affected by a wind bubble, as well as recent indication\nthat in many GRBs, the Lorentz factor is only a few tens, rather than few\nhundreds. I highlight some recent observational progress, including major\nbreakthrough in detecting TeV photons and the on-going debate about their\norigin, polarization measurements, as well as the pair annihilation line\nrecently detected in GRB 221009A, and its implications on the prompt emission\nphysics. I point into some open questions that I anticipate would be at the\nforefront of GRB research in the next decade.\n",
