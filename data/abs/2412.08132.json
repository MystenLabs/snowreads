  "abstract": "  The exact-exchange relativistic density functional theory (Ex-RDFT) of atomic\nnuclei has been solved in three-dimensional lattice space for the first time.\nThe exchange energy is treated within the framework of the orbital-dependent\nrelativistic Kohn-Sham density functional theory, wherein the local Lorentz\nscalar and vector potentials are derived using the relativistic optimized\neffective potential method. The solutions of binding energies, charge radii,\nand density distributions are benchmarked against the traditional relativistic\nHartree-Fock approach for spherical and axially deformed nuclei. Furthermore,\nthe triaxial neutron-rich $^{104-120}\\text{Ru}$ isotopes are investigated with\nthe exchange correlations, which is beyond the current capacity of the\ntraditional relativistic Hartree-Fock approach. The results notably indicate\nthe $\\gamma$-softness of these neutron-rich nuclei, which is consistent with\nexperimental observations. This novel approach establishes a foundation for the\nstudy of nuclei without imposing any symmetry restrictions employing\nrelativistic density functional with exchange correlations.\n",
