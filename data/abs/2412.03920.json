While numerous\nstudies have explored these agents in such settings, there is a lack of a\ncomprehensive survey summarizing the current progress. To address this gap, we\nsystematically review existing research on LLM-based social agents within\ngame-theoretic scenarios. Our survey organizes the findings into three core\ncomponents: Game Framework, Social Agent, and Evaluation Protocol. The game\nframework encompasses diverse game scenarios, ranging from choice-focusing to\ncommunication-focusing games. The social agent part explores agents'\npreferences, beliefs, and reasoning abilities. The evaluation protocol covers\nboth game-agnostic and game-specific metrics for assessing agent performance.\nBy reflecting on the current research and identifying future research\ndirections, this survey provides insights to advance the development and\nevaluation of social agents in game-theoretic scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CYyfGYWWvVGghX7drqVbdBVPLczUOxOeSunsR43elN0","pdfSize":"1406229"}
