The boundary conditions cover different types of reflections from\nthe boundary as well as integral operators with delays. In the first step we\nuse a Lyapunov approach to derive sufficient conditions for the robust\nexponential stability of the boundary value problems for a linear(ized)\nhomogeneous problem. Under those conditions and a number of non-resonance\nconditions, in the second step we prove the existence and uniqueness of smooth\ntime-periodic solutions to the corresponding linear nonhomogeneous problems. In\nthe third step, we prove a perturbation theorem stating that the periodic\nsolutions survive under small perturbations of all coefficients of the\nhyperbolic system. In the last step, we apply the linear results to construct\nsmall and smooth time-periodic solutions to the quasilinear problems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1MN9MmyUxsfDkyuFL4S90DfOpnsMqj5vHU6oOF_osD8","pdfSize":"306919","objectId":"0xb8620afd1d0d909ab9a7c98e5e71bac016004af64e39705c480723a23ce97e0c","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
