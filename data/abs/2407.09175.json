CuInP2S6 (CIPS) is a well-known vdW ferroelectric that has been\nintegrated with graphene for memory devices. Here we demonstrate FeDs with\nself-rectifying, hysteretic current-voltage characteristics based on vertical\nheterostructures of 10-nm-thick CIPS and graphene. By using vdW indium-cobalt\ntop electrodes and graphene bottom electrodes, we achieve high\nelectroresistance (on- and off-state resistance ratios) of ~10^6, on-state\nrectification ratios of ~2500 for read/write voltages of 2 V/0.5 V and maximum\noutput current densities of 100 A/cm^2. These metrics compare favourably with\nstate-of-the-art FeDs. Piezoresponse force microscopy measurements show that\nstabilization of intermediate net polarization states in CIPS leads to stable\nmulti-bit data retention at room temperature. The combination of two-terminal\ndesign, multi-bit memory, and low-power operation in CIPS-based FeDs is\npotentially interesting for compute-in-memory and neuromorphic computing\napplications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wwstJqzIbeygB89XVJAFuiO9BwGLkant899JlgdulXE","pdfSize":"636544"}
