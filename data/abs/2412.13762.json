The paper proposes a novel island-based coevolutionary\nalgorithm (ICoEvoRDF) for constructing robust decision tree ensembles. The\nalgorithm operates on multiple islands, each containing populations of decision\ntrees and adversarial perturbations. The populations on each island evolve\nindependently, with periodic migration of top-performing decision trees between\nislands. This approach fosters diversity and enhances the exploration of the\nsolution space, leading to more robust and accurate decision tree ensembles.\nICoEvoRDF utilizes a popular game theory concept of mixed Nash equilibrium for\nensemble weighting, which further leads to improvement in results. ICoEvoRDF is\nevaluated on 20 benchmark datasets, demonstrating its superior performance\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods in optimizing both adversarial accuracy\nand minimax regret. The flexibility of ICoEvoRDF allows for the integration of\ndecision trees from various existing methods, providing a unified framework for\ncombining diverse solutions. Our approach offers a promising direction for\ndeveloping robust and interpretable machine learning models\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oJxcDfskFt4QbuR6_-6guGd6R_32UU8P8t3xsV1zoxc","pdfSize":"822914"}
