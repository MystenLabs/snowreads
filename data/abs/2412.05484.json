The seminal work\nof Kitaev and Preskill~\\cite{preskill-kitaev-tee} and simultaneously by Levin\nand Wen~\\cite{levin-wen-tee} proposed information quantities that can probe the\nTEE. In the present work, we explain why the subtraction schemes in the\nproposed information quantities~\\cite{levin-wen-tee,preskill-kitaev-tee} work\nfor the computation of TEE and generalize them for arbitrary number of\nsubregions by explicitly noting the necessary conditions for an information\nquantity to capture TEE. Our conditions differentiate the probes defined by\nKitaev-Preskill and Levin-Wen into separate classes. While there are infinitely\nmany possible probes of TEE, we focus particularly on the cyclic quantities\n$Q_{2n+1}$ and multi-information $I_n$. We also show that the holographic\nentropy inequalities are satisfied by the quantum entanglement entropy of the\nnon-degenerate ground state of a topologically ordered two-dimensional medium\nwith a mass gap.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AQwePHLRXEk4-X6Lgba3omZi5fLKcyjEOiCEM8XV4CI","pdfSize":"1697130"}
