  "abstract": "  Bumblebee is a foundation model for particle physics discovery, inspired by\nBERT. By removing positional encodings and embedding particle 4-vectors,\nBumblebee captures both generator- and reconstruction-level information while\nensuring sequence-order invariance. Pre-trained on a masked task, it improves\ndileptonic top quark reconstruction resolution by 10-20% and excels in\ndownstream tasks, including toponium discrimination (AUROC 0.877) and initial\nstate classification (AUROC 0.625). The flexibility of Bumblebee makes it\nsuitable for a wide range of particle physics applications, especially the\ndiscovery of new particles.\n",
