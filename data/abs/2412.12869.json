The approach is\nbased on an integrable lattice regularization of the quantum field theory. The\nexact $g$-function is encoded in the overlap of the integrable boundary state\nand the ground state on the lattice, which can be computed exactly by Bethe\nansatz. In the continuum limit, after subtracting the contribution proportional\nto the volume of the closed channel, we obtain the exact $g$-function, given in\nterms of the counting function which is the solution of a nonlinear integral\nequation. The resulting $g$-function contains two parts, the scalar part, which\ndepends on the boundary parameters and the ratio of Fredholm determinants,\nwhich is universal. This approach bypasses the difficulties of dealing with\nmagnetic excitations for non-diagonal scattering theories in the framework of\nthermodynamic Bethe ansatz. We obtain numerical and analytical results of the\nexact $g$-function for the prototypical sine-Gordon theory with various\nintegrable boundary conditions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3mWZcnA-1du3Y8NzOf8Ry0DajmgRC56mes_OvKxhSDY","pdfSize":"773122"}
