We show that there are two WFR-invariant\nquantities, and the renormalization (RG) equations may be written entirely in\nterms of these quantities. The same set of RG equations can be obtained whether\nwe fix the vacuum energy or Newton coupling along the RG trajectory. The flow\nof the Newton constant and the vacuum energy is also discussed in detail. In\nparticular we discuss how the vacuum energy behaves near the singular barrier\nin the low energy.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Hw5fywlowUKprWoSjFC55sLieNXfd8wc908nhD6jxTU","pdfSize":"249535"}
