Validity intervals serve as the standard means to\nspecify freshness requirements in real-time databases. In this paper, we bring\nattention to significant drawbacks of validity intervals that have largely been\nunnoticed and introduce a new definition of data freshness, while discussing\nfuture research directions to address these limitations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0XHGYdepMF3YRMEBP9iCe6ZiNJMdwIiDBEOsXVYCS1c","pdfSize":"93102"}
