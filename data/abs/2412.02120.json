Here, we present a comprehensive\nstudy of this method applied for estimating $n$-qubit states in a circuit-based\nquantum computer, including numerical simulations and experiments carried out\non an IBM superconducting quantum processor. The intermediate projections are\nimplemented through Pauli measurements on one qubit at a time, which sets the\nnumber of ptychographic circuits to $3n$ (in contrast to the $3^n$ circuits for\nstandard Pauli tomography); the final projective measurement in the\ncomputational basis is preceded by the quantum Fourier transform (QFT). Due to\nthe large depth and number of two-qubit gates of the QFT circuit, which is\nunsuitable for noisy devices, we also test the approximate QFT (AQFT) and\nseparable unitary operations. Using the QFT and AQFT of degree $2$, we obtained\nhigh estimation fidelities in all tests with separable and entangled states for\nup to three and four qubits, respectively; on the other hand, the separable\nunitaries in this scenario provided good estimations only for separable states,\nin general. Our results compare favorably with recent results in the literature\nand we discuss further alternatives to make the ptychographic method scalable\nfor the current noisy devices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"z4VF6ktrGIU-m_fc-u-5eczT9TV1w7aGEQ6kXd_nQ18","pdfSize":"828712"}
