We consider two variants depending on whether an\nedge is blocked. In the locally-informed variant, the traveller learns if an\nedge is blocked upon reaching one of its endpoints, while in the uninformed\nvariant, they discover this only when the edge is supposed to appear. We\nprovide a polynomial algorithm for each shortest path variant in the uninformed\ncase. This algorithm also solves the case of directed acyclic non-temporal\ngraphs.\n  In the locally-informed case, we prove that finding a winning strategy is\nPSPACE-complete. Moreover, we establish that the problem is polynomial-time\nsolvable when $k=1$ but NP-hard for $k\\geq 2$.\n  Additionally, we show that the standard (non-temporal) Canadian Traveller\nProblem is NP-hard when there are $k\\geq 4$ blocked edges, which is, to the\nbest of our knowledge, the first hardness result for CTP for a constant number\nof blocked edges.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yj9Ws4OgjVOPym-nZUNiXVp9Ej1I8ZbaE5Bn2POO5q0","pdfSize":"814108"}
