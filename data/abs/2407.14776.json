Here, we benchmark a\nnew monthly time series of inter-industrial flows of funds, constructed from\naggregated and anonymised real-time payments between UK businesses, covering\n5-digit SIC codes industries for the period 08/2015 to 12/2023, against\nestablished economic indicators, including GDP, input-output tables (IOTs), and\nstylised facts of granular firm- and industry-level production networks. We\nsupplement the quantitative analyses with conceptual discussions, explaining\nthe caveats of bottom-up collected payment data and their differences to\nnational account tables. The results reveal strong GDP correlations, some\nqualitative consistency with official IOTs and stylised facts. We guide on the\ninterpretation of the data and areas that require special attention for\nreliable quantitative research.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eb5S3AvfHLi-nvCohXKci5B4DcJqkTFUoKoZiA5SyR8","pdfSize":"802072"}
