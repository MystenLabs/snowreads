  "abstract": "  One explanation for how people can plan efficiently despite limited cognitive\nresources is that we possess a set of adaptive planning strategies and know\nwhen and how to use them. But how are these strategies acquired? While previous\nresearch has studied how individuals learn to choose among existing strategies,\nlittle is known about the process of forming new planning strategies. In this\nwork, we propose that new planning strategies are discovered through\nmetacognitive reinforcement learning. To test this, we designed a novel\nexperiment to investigate the discovery of new planning strategies. We then\npresent metacognitive reinforcement learning models and demonstrate their\ncapability for strategy discovery as well as show that they provide a better\nexplanation of human strategy discovery than alternative learning mechanisms.\nHowever, when fitted to human data, these models exhibit a slower discovery\nrate than humans, leaving room for improvement.\n",
