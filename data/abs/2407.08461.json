Here we\nconsider scale-invariant power-law potentials $V(x)\\sim |x|^m$, where $m>0$,\nand employ the optimal fluctuation method (OFM) to determine the large-$|x|$\ntails of the steady-state probability distribution $\\mathcal{P}(x)$ of the\nparticle position. The calculations involve finding the optimal (that is, the\nmost likely) path of the particle, which determines these tails, via a\nminimization of the exact action functional for this system, which has recently\nbecome available. Exploiting dynamical scale invariance of the model in\nconjunction with the OFM ansatz, we establish the large-$|x|$ tails of $\\ln\n\\mathcal{P}(x)$ up to a dimensionless factor $\\alpha(H,m)$, where $0<H<1$ is\nthe Hurst exponent. We determine $\\alpha(H,m)$ analytically (i) in the limits\nof $H\\to 0$ and $H\\to 1$, and (ii) for $m=2$ and arbitrary $H$, corresponding\nto the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (fOU) process. Our results for the fOU\nprocess are in agreement with the previously known exact $\\mathcal{P}(x)$ and\nautocovariance. The form of the tails of $\\mathcal{P}(x)$ yields exact\nconditions, in terms of $H$ and $m$, for the particle confinement in the\npotential. For $H\\neq 1/2$, the tails encode the non-equilibrium character of\nthe steady state distribution, and we observe violation of time reversibility\nof the system except for $m=2$. To compute the optimal paths and the factor\n$\\alpha(H,m)$ for arbitrary permissible $H$ and $m$, one needs to solve an (in\ngeneral nonlinear) integro-differential equation. To this end we develop a\nspecialized numerical iteration algorithm which accounts analytically for an\nintrinsic cusp singularity of the optimal paths for $H<1/2$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tXFi8a0DhB8WrdJHPEnDuSds2V1zDm3GUS2h0iwJEMU","pdfSize":"682726"}
