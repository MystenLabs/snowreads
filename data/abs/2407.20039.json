The model includes five\nstates and all twenty-one vibrations, with potential surfaces calculated at the\ncomplete active space with second-order perturbation (CASPT2) level of theory.\nThe model includes terms up to seventh-order to describe the diabatic\npotentials. The resulting spectrum is in excellent agreement to the\nexperimentally measured spectrum of Holland et al [PCCP (2014) 16: 21629]. The,\nuntil now not understood, spectral features are assigned, with a combination of\nstrongly coupled vibrations and vibronic coupling between the states giving\nrise to a progression of triplets on the rising edge of the broad spectrum. The\nanalysis of the underlying dynamics indicates that population transfer between\nall states takes place on a sub-100 fs timescale, with ring-opening occurring\nat longer times. The model thus provides a starting point for further\ninvestigations into the complicated photo-excited dynamics of this key\nhetero-aromatic molecule.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wdEB1z67XeSKolADENgCy9G_F2NCfaWRJvZ8PwDFq7Q","pdfSize":"22747499"}
