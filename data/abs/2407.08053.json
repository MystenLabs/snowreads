It examines the\nuniformity of these theories through an algebraic lens. The paper compares the\nuniformity of terms and predicates within axiom schemas. It demonstrates the\nconnection between such theories and both field theory and measure theory. The\nwork proposes a novel interpretation of elements as automorphisms of the sets\nthat include them. Additionally, it introduces a method for the localization of\nelements in relation to one another.
