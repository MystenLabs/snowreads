Such a chain complex is called\nrealisable. Wall studied this problem in the 60's and reduced it to a problem\ninvolving only the second differential $d_2$, now known as the relation lifting\nproblem. We show that if $G$ is right orderable and $d_2$ is given by a matrix\nof a certain form, then $A_*$ is realisable. As a special case, we solve the\nrelation lifting problem for right orderable groups with cyclic relation\nmodule.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"utCnl9tjOp0GkI0NvcE88YjzdwJAI5GcDH1sWvJRYjY","pdfSize":"389444"}
