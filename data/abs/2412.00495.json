  "abstract": "  This paper explores the application of large language models (LLMs) in\ndesigning strategic mechanisms -- including auctions, contracts, and games --\nfor specific purposes in communication networks. Traditionally, strategic\nmechanism design in telecommunications has relied on human expertise to craft\nsolutions based on game theory, auction theory, and contract theory. However,\nthe evolving landscape of telecom networks, characterized by increasing\nabstraction, emerging use cases, and novel value creation opportunities, calls\nfor more adaptive and efficient approaches. We propose leveraging LLMs to\nautomate or semi-automate the process of strategic mechanism design, from\nintent specification to final formulation. This paradigm shift introduces both\nsemi-automated and fully-automated design pipelines, raising crucial questions\nabout faithfulness to intents, incentive compatibility, algorithmic stability,\nand the balance between human oversight and artificial intelligence (AI)\nautonomy. The paper discusses potential frameworks, such as retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG)-based systems, to implement LLM-driven mechanism design in\ncommunication networks contexts. We examine key challenges, including LLM\nlimitations in capturing domain-specific constraints, ensuring strategy\nproofness, and integrating with evolving telecom standards. By providing an\nin-depth analysis of the synergies and tensions between LLMs and strategic\nmechanism design within the IoT ecosystem, this work aims to stimulate\ndiscussion on the future of AI-driven information economic mechanisms in\ntelecommunications and their potential to address complex, dynamic network\nmanagement scenarios.\n",
