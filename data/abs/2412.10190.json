  "abstract": "  The flavor and aroma development in fermented foods is intricately tied to\nthe mixing dynamics during fermentation. This review explores how variations in\nmixing influence the physical, chemical, and microbial interactions within\nfermentation systems, ultimately affecting sensory characteristics such as\nflavor and aroma. Factors like rheology, shear forces, and fluid flow patterns\nare critical in mass transfer, microbial activity, and the release of volatile\ncompounds, contributing to fermented products' sensory profile. Examples from\ncommon fermented foods -- including bread, yogurt, beer, wine, and cheese --\nhighlight how controlled mixing can optimize the release of desirable flavor\ncompounds, improve biosynthesis yields, and reduce technological complexity.\nUnderstanding these physical interactions is essential for advancing\nfermentation processes in the food industry, leading to higher product quality,\nbetter flavor retention, and enhanced consumer satisfaction.\n",
