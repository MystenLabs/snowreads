Six individual lines from the\nQ-branch of the $\\nu_4$ band were clearly detected with a S/N ratio up to 10.\nSpectral intervals around 8.0 $\\mu$m (745 cm$^{-1}$) and 13.4 $\\mu$m (1247\ncm$^{-1}$) containing acetylene (C$_2$H$_2$) and methane (CH$_4$) lines\nrespectively, were observed during the same run to constrain the disk-averaged\nC$_2$H$_2$ abundance profile and temperature profile. Cassini observations with\nthe Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) were used to improve the flux\ncalibration and help to constrain the atmospheric model. The measured D/H ratio\nin acetylene, derived from the C$_2$HD/C$_2$H$_2$ abundance ratio, is\n(1.22$^{+0.27}_{-0.21})$ $\\times$ 10$^{-4}$, consistent with that in methane\nobtained in previous studies. Possible sources of fractionation at different\nsteps of the acetylene photochemistry are investigated.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XzrhO3P5f0JwreLBz5fn1LNW5ndpoJ2FPgBs-_TruYo","pdfSize":"852800"}
