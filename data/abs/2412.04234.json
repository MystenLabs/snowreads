  "abstract": "  We introduce DEIM, an innovative and efficient training framework designed to\naccelerate convergence in real-time object detection with Transformer-based\narchitectures (DETR). To mitigate the sparse supervision inherent in one-to-one\n(O2O) matching in DETR models, DEIM employs a Dense O2O matching strategy. This\napproach increases the number of positive samples per image by incorporating\nadditional targets, using standard data augmentation techniques. While Dense\nO2O matching speeds up convergence, it also introduces numerous low-quality\nmatches that could affect performance. To address this, we propose the\nMatchability-Aware Loss (MAL), a novel loss function that optimizes matches\nacross various quality levels, enhancing the effectiveness of Dense O2O.\nExtensive experiments on the COCO dataset validate the efficacy of DEIM. When\nintegrated with RT-DETR and D-FINE, it consistently boosts performance while\nreducing training time by 50%. Notably, paired with RT-DETRv2, DEIM achieves\n53.2% AP in a single day of training on an NVIDIA 4090 GPU. Additionally,\nDEIM-trained real-time models outperform leading real-time object detectors,\nwith DEIM-D-FINE-L and DEIM-D-FINE-X achieving 54.7% and 56.5% AP at 124 and 78\nFPS on an NVIDIA T4 GPU, respectively, without the need for additional data. We\nbelieve DEIM sets a new baseline for advancements in real-time object\ndetection. Our code and pre-trained models are available at\nhttps://github.com/ShihuaHuang95/DEIM.\n",
