  "abstract": "  The emerging field of the Science of Cities has unveiled previously\nundiscovered facets of urban life. Contrary to the expectation of chaotic\nbehaviour influenced solely by cultural and geographic factors, cities globally\nexhibit universal power-law trends in urban scaling. Leveraging recent advances\nin mathematical descriptions of urban dynamics, this study investigates the\ninterplay among fundamental allometry, fractal dimension, and the number of\nclose contacts within cities. Through a dynamic exploration of these factors, a\ncausal relationship is established, shedding light on the intricate dynamics\nthat shape urban environments. Remarkably, our analysis suggests that the Big\nFive personality traits play a pivotal role in determining the fractal aspects\nof urban life. This research contributes to the understanding of urban scaling\nand proposes a novel connection between human personality traits and the\nstructural patterns observed in cities, opening avenues for further\ninterdisciplinary exploration.\n",
