  "abstract": "  Let $q$ be an odd prime power, and $G=\\text{Sp}(2n,q)$ the finite symplectic\ngroup. We give an expression for the total Stiefel-Whitney Classes (SWCs) for\northogonal representations $\\pi$ of $G$, in terms of character values of $\\pi$\nat elements of order $2$. We give \"universal formulas'' for the fourth and\neighth SWCs. For $n=2$, we compute the subring of the mod $2$ cohomology\ngenerated by the SWCs $w_k(\\pi)$.\n",
