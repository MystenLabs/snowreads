  "abstract": "  The rapid rise of AI in science presents a paradox. Analyzing 67.9 million\nresearch papers across six major fields using a validated language model\n(F1=0.876), we explore AI's impact on science. Scientists who adopt AI tools\npublish 67.37% more papers, receive 3.16 times more citations, and become team\nleaders 4 years earlier than non-adopters. This individual success correlates\nwith concerning on collective effects: AI-augmented research contracts the\ndiameter of scientific topics studied, and diminishes follow-on scientific\nengagement. Rather than catalyzing the exploration of new fields, AI\naccelerates work in established, data-rich domains. This pattern suggests that\nwhile AI enhances individual scientific productivity, it may simultaneously\nreduce scientific diversity and broad engagement, highlighting a tension\nbetween personal advancement and collective scientific progress.\n",
