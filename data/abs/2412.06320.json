The resulting approach turns out to be a\nqubit-by-qubit gauging procedure for standard stabilizers, which could involve\ndiscrete or continuous gauge parameters. We take examples from many-body\nphysics and quantum chemistry to show such a procedure leads to an improvement\nof the performance.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"nEO3UkN036QK4ceavBqOt-sf6iCQqtk4A6S6HuG7z-Y","pdfSize":"102137"}
