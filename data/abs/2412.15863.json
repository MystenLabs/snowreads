Traditional BO assumes that the\nlearner has full control over all query variables without additional\nconstraints. However, in many real-world scenarios, controlling certain query\nvariables may incur costs. Therefore, the learner needs to balance the\nselection of informative subsets for targeted learning against leaving some\nvariables to be randomly sampled to minimize costs. This problem is known as\nBayesian Optimization with cost-varying variable subsets (BOCVS). While the\ngoal of BOCVS is to identify the optimal solution with minimal cost, previous\nworks have only guaranteed finding the optimal solution without considering the\ntotal costs incurred. Moreover, these works assume precise knowledge of the\ncost for each subset, which is often unrealistic. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel algorithm for the extension of the BOCVS problem with random and unknown\ncosts that separates the process into exploration and exploitation phases. The\nexploration phase will filter out low-quality variable subsets, while the\nexploitation phase will leverage high-quality ones. Furthermore, we\ntheoretically demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a sub-linear rate in both\nquality regret and cost regret, addressing the objective of the BOCVS problem\nmore effectively than previous analyses. Finally, we show that our proposed\nalgorithm outperforms comparable baselines across a wide range of benchmarks.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RbRCiOsCSDAJFFctNYNjA7h2eStJTVyNvkvjMOQNBwQ","pdfSize":"1451981"}
