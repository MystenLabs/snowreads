Thanks to the use of the game engine and a\nholistic methodology, it was possible to help Physics students implement said\nserious game during a semester of an introductory Physics course.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"uHKh3X0svUnC4v3c0nkdy0ABkZyl0SzcTb1zK3cn0Po","pdfSize":"1549513"}
