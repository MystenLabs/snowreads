We combine Topological Data Analysis\nwith Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to assess district boundaries' impact on\ncommunity integrity. Using Iowa as a case study, we generate and refine\ndistricting plans using KMeans clustering and stochastic rebalancing. Our\nmethod produces plans with fewer cut edges and more compact shapes than the\nofficial Iowa plan under relaxed conditions. The low likelihood of finding\nplans as disruptive as the official one suggests potential inefficiencies in\nexisting boundaries. Gaussian Mixture Model analysis reveals three distinct\ndistributions in the districting landscape. This framework offers a more\naccurate reflection of community interactions for fairer political\nrepresentation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GIxCahhNJ6wRahhJpwGlbWIgt8nmNRvWUYnbvwREwQM","pdfSize":"5750015"}
