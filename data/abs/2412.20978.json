  "abstract": "  The molecular dynamics (MD) simulation technique has been widely used in\ncomplex systems, but the time scale is limited due to the small timestep. Here,\nwe propose a novel method, named Exploratory dynamics Sampling with recursion\n(EdSr), which is inspired by Langevin dynamics, Stochastic Differential\nEquation and Taylor expansion formula, can be used in MD simulation with\nflexible timestep. By setting up four groups of experiments including simple\nfunction, ideal physical model, all-atom simulation and coarse-grained\nsimulation, we demonstrate that EdSr can dynamically and flexibly adjust the\nsimulation timestep according to requirements during simulation period, and can\nwork with larger timestep than the widely used velocity-Verlet integrator.\nAlthough this method can not perform perfectly at flexible timestep with all\nsimulation systems, we believe that it will be a promising approach in the\nfuture.\n",
