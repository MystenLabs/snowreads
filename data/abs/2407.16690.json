Using\narchival GALEX FUV imagery and H$\\alpha$+[NII] narrowband images obtained with\nthe Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope, we detect a total of 1335\n(FUV-selected) and 1474 (H$\\alpha$-selected) regions of recent high-mass star\nformation, respectively. We find the H$\\alpha$-to-FUV SFR ratios tend to be\nlower primarily for FUV-selected regions, where SFR$_{H\\alpha}$ generally\nunderestimates the SFR by an average factor of 2-3, for SFR $<$ 10$^{-4}$\nM$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. In contrast, the SFRs are generally observed to be\nconsistent for H$\\alpha$-selected regions. This discrepancy arises from\nmorphological differences between the two indicators. Extended FUV morphologies\nand larger areas covered by FUV-only regions, along with decreasing overlap\nbetween FUV clumps and compact HII regions with $R/R_{25}$ suggest that\nstochastic sampling of the initial mass function may be more pronounced in the\nouter regions of galaxies. Our observed H$\\alpha$-to-FUV SFR ratios are also\nconsistent with stochastic star formation model predictions. However, using\nlarger apertures that include diffuse FUV emission results in an offset of 1\ndex between SFR$_{H\\alpha}$ and SFR$_{UV}$. This suggests that the observed low\nH$\\alpha$-to-FUV SFR ratios in galaxies are likely caused by diffuse FUV\nemission, which can contribute $\\sim$60-90\\% to the total FUV flux.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"e5KPKQ9xgYxKbolZlrNCRBP80FAyxK8HEaRpz0vzaFU","pdfSize":"13626615"}
