  "abstract": "  Analytical results are presented for the structure of networks that evolve\nvia a preferential-attachment-random-deletion (PARD) model in the regime of\noverall network growth and in the regime of overall contraction. The phase\ntransition between the two regimes is studied. At each time step a node\naddition and preferential attachment step takes place with probability $P_{\\rm\nadd}$, and a random node deletion step takes place with probability $P_{\\rm\ndel} = 1 - P_{\\rm add}$. The balance between growth and contraction is captured\nby the parameter $\\eta = P_{\\rm add} - P_{\\rm del}$, which in the regime of\noverall network growth satisfies $0 < \\eta \\le 1$ and in the regime of overall\nnetwork contraction $-1 \\le \\eta < 0$. Using the master equation and computer\nsimulations we show that for $-1 < \\eta < 0$ the time-dependent degree\ndistribution $P_t(k)$ converges towards a stationary form $P_{\\rm st}(k)$ which\nexhibits an exponential tail. This is in contrast with the power-law tail of\nthe stationary degree distribution obtained for $0 < \\eta \\le 1$. Thus, the\nPARD model has a phase transition at $\\eta=0$, which separates between two\nstructurally distinct phases. At the transition, for $\\eta=0$, the degree\ndistribution exhibits a stretched exponential tail. While the stationary degree\ndistribution in the phase of overall growth represents an asymptotic state, in\nthe phase of overall contraction $P_{\\rm st}(k)$ represents an intermediate\nasymptotic state of a finite life span, which disappears when the network\nvanishes.\n",
