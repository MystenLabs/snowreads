Governments of many countries disclose government-related\nstatistics as open data. Some of these data are provided as CSV files. However,\nsince CSV files are plain texts, we cannot ensure the integrity of a downloaded\nCSV file. A popular way to prove the data's integrity is a digital signature;\nhowever, it is difficult to embed a signature into a CSV file. This paper\nproposes a method for embedding a digital signature into a CSV file using a\ndata hiding technique. The proposed method exploits a redundancy of the CSV\nformat related to the use of double quotes. The experiment revealed we could\nembed a 512-bit signature into actual open data CSV files.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"7v9NMZUA1Az76rixwDkWD425Xv5vqzuHUVB-lEjiGZI","pdfSize":"132653"}
