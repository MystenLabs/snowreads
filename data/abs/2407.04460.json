In this work, we introduce\n\\textbf{\\emph{AFIND+}}, a simple yet efficient algorithm for sampling and\naggregating neighbors in DFL, with the aim of leveraging collaboration to\nimprove clients' model performance. AFIND+ identifies helpful neighbors,\nadaptively adjusts the number of selected neighbors, and strategically\naggregates the sampled neighbors' models based on their contributions.\nNumerical results on real-world datasets with diverse data partitions\ndemonstrate that AFIND+ outperforms other sampling algorithms in DFL and is\ncompatible with most existing DFL optimization algorithms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"i7jtBBfbJTbrO1SWG7d0brzVCLQl628IFhfMUwxGdA0","pdfSize":"1385060"}
