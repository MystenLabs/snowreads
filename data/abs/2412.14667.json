  "abstract": "  A mathematical modeling process for phenomena with a single state variable\nthat attempts to be realistic must be given by a scalar nonautonomous\ndifferential equation $x'=f(t,x)$ that is concave with respect to the state\nvariable $x$ in some regions of its domain and convex in the complementary\nzones. This article takes the first step towards developing a theory to\ndescribe the corresponding dynamics: the case in which $f$ is concave on the\nregion $x\\ge b(t)$ and convex on $x\\le b(t)$, where $b$ is a $C^1$ map, is\nconsidered. The different long-term dynamics that may appear are analyzed while\ndescribing the bifurcation diagram for $x'=f(t,x)+\\lambda$. The results are\nused to establish conditions on a concave-convex map $h$ and a nonnegative map\n$k$ ensuring the existence of a value $\\rho_0$ giving rise to the unique\ncritical transition for the parametric family of equations\n$x'=h(t,x)-\\rho\\,k(t,x)$, which is assumed to approach $x'=h(t,x)$ as time\ndecreases, but for which no conditions are assumed on the future dynamics. The\ndeveloped theory is justified by showing that concave-convex models fit\ncorrectly some laboratory experimental data, and applied to describe a\npopulation dynamics model for which a large enough increase on the peak of a\ntemporary higher predation causes extinction.\n",
