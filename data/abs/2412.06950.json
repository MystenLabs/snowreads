  "abstract": "  A mechanism of baryogenesis and dark matter production via $B$-meson\noscillations and decays has recently been proposed to explain the observed dark\nmatter abundance and matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. This\nmechanism introduces a light dark sector particle ($\\psi_D$) with a non-zero\nbaryonic charge. We present a search for this new state in $B^+ \\to \\Lambda_c^+\n\\, \\psi_D$ decays using data collected at the $\\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance by the\nBABAR detector at SLAC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $431.0\n\\rm{~fb}^{-1}$. The search leverages the full reconstruction of the $B^-$ meson\nin $\\Upsilon(4S) \\to B^+B^-$ decays, accompanied by the reconstruction of a\n$\\Lambda_c^+$, to infer the presence of $\\psi_D$. No significant signal is\nobserved, and limits on the $B^+ \\to \\Lambda_c^+ \\, \\psi_D$ branching fraction\nare set at the level of $1.6 \\times 10^{-4}$ at 90% confidence level for $0.94\n< m_{\\psi_D} < 2.99$ GeV. These results set strong constraints on the parameter\nspace allowed by $B$-meson baryogenesis.\n",
