  "abstract": "  A magnetic impurity with a larger $S=1$ spin remains partially screened by\nthe Kondo effect when embedded in a metal. However, when placed within an\n$s$-wave superconductor, the interplay between the superconducting energy gap\n$\\Delta$ and the Kondo temperature $T_K$ induces a quantum phase transition\nfrom an underscreened doublet Kondo to an unscreened triplet phase, typically\noccurring when $\\Delta/T_K\\approx 1$. We investigate the Kondo compensation of\nthe impurity spin resulting from this partial screening across the quantum\nphase transition, which together with the spin-spin correlation function serves\nas a measure of the Kondo cloud's integrity. Deep within the unscreened triplet\nphase, $\\Delta/T_K\\gg 1$, the compensation vanishes, signifying complete\ndecoupling of the impurity spin from the environment, while in the partially\nscreened doublet phase, $\\Delta/T_K\\ll 1$, it asymptotically approaches $1/2$,\nindicating that half of the spin is screened. Notably, there is a universal\njump in the compensation precisely at the phase transition, which we accurately\ncalculate. The spin-spin correlation function exhibits an oscillatory pattern\nwith an envelope function decaying as $\\sim 1/x$ at short distances. At larger\ndistances, the superconducting gap induces an exponentially decaying behavior\n$\\sim \\exp(-x/\\xi_\\Delta)$ governed by the superconducting correlation length\n$\\xi_\\Delta$, irrespective of the phase, without any distinctive features\nacross the transition. Furthermore, the spectral functions of some relevant\noperators are evaluated and discussed. In terms of the methods used, a\nconsistent description is provided through the application of multiplicative,\nnumerical and density matrix renormalization group techniques.\n",
