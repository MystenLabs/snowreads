Such emission is further enhanced by stacking thin crystal layers\nof half-wavelength thickness. Based on these findings, we propose a novel\nmethod for generating and detecting axions in terrestrial experiments,\nachieving up to a two-order-of-magnitude increase in transition probability\ncompared to light-shining-through-wall (LSW) experiments with the same\ninteraction region size. For an experimental length of 10 meters, this setup\ncould lower the exclusion limit to\n$g_{a\\gamma\\gamma}\\gtrsim1.32\\times10^{-11}\\textrm{GeV}^{-1}$ with currently\navailable laser technologies.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"loeW6tUJfczDVsudbJsFxcKx7C6W1NnNV-_nbCFzaxI","pdfSize":"1397970"}
