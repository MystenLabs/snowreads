Their significance is\nparticularly evident in microbiome analysis, where microbial communities are\nclassified at various taxonomic levels along the phylogenetic tree. In light of\nthis trend, the R/Bioconductor community has established a reproducible\nanalytical framework for hierarchical data, which relies on the highly generic\nand optimised TreeSummarizedExperiment data container. However, using this\nframework requires basic proficiency in programming.\n  $\\textbf{Results:}$ To reduce the entry requirements, we developed iSEEtree,\nan R shiny app which provides a visual interface for the analysis and\nexploration of TreeSummarizedExperiment objects, thereby expanding the\ninteractive graphics capabilities of related work to hierarchical structures.\nThis way, users can interactively explore several aspects of their data without\nthe need for extensive knowledge of R programming. We describe how iSEEtree\nenables the exploration of hierarchical multi-table data and demonstrate its\nfunctionality with applications to microbiome analysis.\n  $\\textbf{Availability and Implementation:}$ iSEEtree was implemented in the R\nprogramming language and is available on Bioconductor at\nhttps://bioconductor.org/packages/iSEEtree under an Artistic 2.0 license.\n  $\\textbf{Contact:}$ giulio.benedetti@utu.fi or leo.lahti@utu.fi.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Mathematical Software","Computer Science/Graphics","Quantitative Biology/Genomics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"ncMF8yhMZJQn5_GiGSehnzWiYLa4upnJAVjr0scSCUk","pdfSize":"700780"}
