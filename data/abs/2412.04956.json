While the\nmodel is effective in these contexts, its application becomes computationally\nchallenging in large, high-dimensional settings. To overcome this, we propose a\nreformulated iterative estimation procedure that leverages Generalized Linear\nArray Models, enabling the disaggregation and smooth estimation of latent\ndistributions in multidimensional data. Through applications to\nhigh-dimensional mortality datasets, we demonstrate the model's capability to\ncapture fine-grained patterns while comparing its computational performance to\nthe conventional algorithm. The proposed methodology offers notable\nimprovements in computational speed, storage efficiency, and practical\napplicability, making it suitable for a wide range of fields where\nhigh-dimensional data are provided in grouped formats.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"CpEN6cL03kU-wjhWftU8xCjCp08IiwcQ0-6xpvSg75s","pdfSize":"894172"}
