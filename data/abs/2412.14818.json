  "abstract": "  In this paper, we consider the problem of fair division of indivisible goods\nwhen the allocation of goods impacts society. Specifically, we introduce a\nsecond valuation function for each agent, determining the social impact of\nallocating a good to the agent. Such impact is considered desirable for the\nsociety -- the higher, the better. Our goal is to understand how to allocate\ngoods fairly from the agents' perspective while maintaining society as happy as\npossible. To this end, we measure the impact on society using the utilitarian\nsocial welfare and provide both possibility and impossibility results. Our\nfindings reveal that achieving good approximations, better than linear in the\nnumber of agents, is not possible while ensuring fairness to the agents. These\nimpossibility results can be attributed to the fact that agents are completely\nunconscious of their social impact. Consequently, we explore scenarios where\nagents are socially aware, by introducing related fairness notions, and\ndemonstrate that an appropriate definition of fairness aligns with the goal of\nmaximizing the social objective.\n",
