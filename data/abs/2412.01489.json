  "abstract": "  The symmetric inclusion process (SIP) models particles diffusing on a graph\nwith mutual attraction. We recently showed that, in the log-concave regime\n(where diffusivity dominates interaction), the spectral gap of the conservative\nSIP matches that of a single particle. In this paper, our main result\ndemonstrates that this identity generally fails outside this regime, but always\nholds for the non-conservative SIP, regardless of the interaction strength.\nWhen this one-particle spectral gap identity breaks down, we derive sharp\nbounds for the gap in terms of diffusivity, and reveal a two-particle spectral\ngap identity in the vanishing diffusivity limit. Our approach leverages the\nrigid eigenstructure of SIP, refined comparisons of Dirichlet forms for\narbitrary diffusivity and particle numbers, and techniques from slow-fast\nsystem analysis. These findings extend to the dual interacting diffusion known\nas Brownian energy process, and shed some light on the spectral gap behavior\nfor related Dirichlet-reversible systems on general, non-mean-field,\ngeometries.\n",
