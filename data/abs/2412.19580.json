Additionally, we present a model for\nprobing Lorentz-violating coefficients within the Standard Model Extension\nframework using the fine structure measurement in the presence and absence of a\nweak external magnetic field, enabling novel tests of CPT and Lorentz symmetry.\nUsing Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate that a precision of $\\sim\n10\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$ on the isolated $2S_{1/2}, F=1 - 2P_{3/2}, F=1$ transition\ncould be achievable employing Ramsey's separate oscillatory fields (SOF)\ntechnique. Collecting the required statics will become feasible with the\nupcoming High-Intensity Muon Beam (HiMB) at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI)\nin Switzerland. These advancements will enable precise tests of radiative QED\ncorrections and nuclear self-energy contributions, while also providing tests\nof new physics and sensitivity to unconstrained coefficients for Lorentz\nviolation within the Standard Model Extension framework.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HFtNbGMpRHUR3TaxG_y7jvXoB9YK_Zy9ux3_BCb-pEo","pdfSize":"707416"}
