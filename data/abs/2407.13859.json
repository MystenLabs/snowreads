We prove that for itineraries of a certain form, the\nset of all points sharing the given itinerary, together with the point at\ninfinity, is an indecomposable continuum in the Riemann sphere. These\nitineraries contain infinitely many blocks of zeros whose lengths increase, and\nthey may be unbounded. We prove that in every such continuum, there exists\nexactly one point whose $\\omega$-limit set contains the repelling fixed point\nof $E_\\lambda$. For every other point, the $\\omega$-limit set is equal either\nto the point at infinity, or to the forward orbit of $0$ together with the\npoint at infinity. Thus, we generalize the results of R. Devaney and X. Jarque\nconcerning indecomposable continua for bounded itineraries.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"fyyrJXNP9lCsbvrAIF78vOOexjzKdncSYLwNClnzVGM","pdfSize":"362135"}
