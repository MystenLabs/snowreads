  "abstract": "  A complication in the treatment of any strongly charged particle is the SU(3)\ncolor structure. For the standard model quarks antiquarks and gluons there are\nvarious well-known strategies for dealing with the color structure, including\northogonal multiplet bases. For exotic representations, beyond triplets,\nantitriplets and octets, non-orthogonal bases have been systematically worked\nout only recently. In this letter we demonstrate how to construct orthogonal\nmultiplet bases also for processes including exotic representations.\n",
