The\nWaveFunctionCollapse (WFC) algorithm has proven effective in generating content\nby learning patterns from example data. In this research, we adapt WFC to\ngenerate terrain height maps using Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)\ndata. Instead of directly using raw height values, we use slopes to better\ncapture structural features and preserve terrain patterns. Statistical\ncomparisons, including histogram analysis, as well as evaluations of the mean,\nmedian, and standard deviation of input and output data, demonstrate that the\nalgorithm effectively retains the input's structural characteristics while\ngenerating new terrain. the results show that WFC, with slope-based input and\nheight-level transformations, can generate realistic terrain patterns for\napplications in game development and beyond.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"RcqTkgNchogC3Ph8MNxIw-m6YvIezQo5yYty8znfYqQ","pdfSize":"2642353"}
