In particular, we show that if\ntwo regions (subspaces) of Hilbert space are separated by a region that has\nvery low weight in the channel's steady state, then states initialized on one\nside of this barrier will take a long time to relax, putting a lower bound on\nthe mixing time in terms of an appropriately defined \"quantum bottleneck\nratio\". Importantly, this bottleneck ratio involves not only the probabilities\nof the relevant subspaces, but also the size of off-diagonal matrix elements\nbetween them. For low-temperature quantum many-body systems, we use the\nbottleneck theorem to bound the performance of any quasi-local Gibbs sampler.\nThis leads to a new perspective on thermally stable quantum phases in terms of\na decomposition of the Gibbs state into multiple components separated by\nbottlenecks. As a concrete application, we show rigorously that weakly\nperturbed commuting projector models with extensive energy barriers (including\ncertain classical and quantum expander codes) have exponentially large mixing\ntimes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GCxNUhnEWJ_tyi9GyN1_LXWgeg-jfHOartB-hblVpr0","pdfSize":"496454"}
