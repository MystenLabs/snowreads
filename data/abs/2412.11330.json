Our approach captures a wide range of\ngradient, projection, proximal iterations through affine or piecewise affine\nconstraints. We derive tight polyhedral convex hull formulations of the\nconstraints representing the algorithm iterations. To improve the scalability,\nwe develop a custom bound tightening technique combining interval propagation,\noperator theory, and optimization-based bound tightening. Numerical examples,\nincluding linear and quadratic programs from network optimization and sparse\ncoding using Lasso, show that our method provides several orders of magnitude\nreductions in the worst-case fixed-point residuals, closely matching the true\nworst-case performance.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"D-vOazE7twQfY68wJDJuiroLBVyULLKaJmubGXAmCPY","pdfSize":"733041"}
