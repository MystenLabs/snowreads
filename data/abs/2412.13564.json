The model captures the multi-dimensional nature\nof the economic sectors or industries in each economic system, the\ninterdependencies among industries within an economic system and across\ndifferent economic systems, and the influence of demand. To determine the\nequilibrium price structure of the model, a matrix-weighted updating algorithm\nis proposed. We prove that the equilibrium price structure can be globally\nasymptotically achieved given that certain joint conditions on the\nmatrix-weighted graph and the input-output matrices are satisfied. The\ntheoretical results are then supported by numerical simulations.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computer Science/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sPEtC7k_FZ3oDrMYyapXLI0Cbcb2dvGFx-vgJIZyTG0","pdfSize":"369122"}
