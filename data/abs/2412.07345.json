  "abstract": "  This article presents and discusses the results from visitors' interactions\nwith two audio augmented reality experiences containing audio augmented\nobjects; physical, real-world objects to which virtual audio sources have been\nattached. It then proceeds to discusses the commonly identified themes arising\nfrom the observation of visitors' behaviour within these experiences and the\nanalysis of their verbal and written feedback. The curatorial potential of\naudio augmented objects is discussed and, by way of conclusion, their\nfunctionality as interfaces to digital audio archival content is proposed,\nalong with their ability to reframe, re-contextualise and create renewed\nexperiences with existing collections of silenced museum exhibits.\n",
