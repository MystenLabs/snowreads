In contrast to norms, antinorms\nare not defined on the entire space $R^d$ but on a cone $K\\subset R^d$. They\nare applied in the matrix analysis, optimal control, and dynamical systems.\nTheir level sets are called conic bodies and (in case of piecewise-linear\nantinorms) conic polyhedra. The basic facts and notions of the \"concave\nanalysis\" of antinorms such as separation theorems, duality, polars, Minkowski\nfunctionals, etc., are similar to those from the standard convex analysis.\nThere are, however, some significant differences. One of them is the existence\nof many self-dual objects. We prove that there are infinitely many families of\nautopolar conic bodies and polyhedra in the cone $K=R^d_+$. For $d=2$, this\ngives a complete classification of self-dual antinorms, while for $d\\ge 3$,\nthere are counterexamples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"SQBoArW9VecL6WgYbS57tfbPUk6blCVIl9obRfg0dCU","pdfSize":"771572"}
