The EMODM is based on a two-state\nGaussian mixture model and demonstrates strong performance in probability\nanomaly detection working on real-time raw data rather than using special prior\ndistribution information. We confirm this using the synthetic data from two\nnumerical cases. For the real-world data, we have detected the short circuit\npattern of the circuit system using EMODM by the current and voltage output of\na three-phase inverter. The EMODM also found an abnormal period due to COVID-19\nin the insured unemployment data of 53 regions in the United States from 2000\nto 2024. The application of EMODM to these two real-life datasets demonstrated\nthe effectiveness and accuracy of our algorithm.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RoZGmN-QGXTM305LeOXfJWFfj56h76dSvEM5Dw6v0Sk","pdfSize":"11340793"}
