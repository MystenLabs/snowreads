  "abstract": "  Data privacy is a major concern in industries such as healthcare or finance.\nThe requirement to safeguard privacy is essential to prevent data breaches and\nmisuse, which can have severe consequences for individuals and organisations.\nFederated learning is a distributed machine learning approach where multiple\nparticipants collaboratively train a model without compromising the privacy of\ntheir data. However, a significant challenge arises from the differences in\nfeature spaces among participants, known as non-IID data. This research\nintroduces a novel federated learning framework employing fuzzy cognitive maps,\ndesigned to comprehensively address the challenges posed by diverse data\ndistributions and non-identically distributed features in federated settings.\nThe proposal is tested through several experiments using four distinct\nfederation strategies: constant-based, accuracy-based, AUC-based, and\nprecision-based weights. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the\napproach in achieving the desired learning outcomes while maintaining privacy\nand confidentiality standards.\n",
