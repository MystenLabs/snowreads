Such a\nresonance is characterized by an infinite scattering length and a large and\nnegative effective range $r_0$. We argue that any number $N\\ge3$ of bosons can\nform a self-bound cluster with the binding energy per particle increasing as\n$N^2$ for $1\\ll N\\ll (-r_0/a_\\text{bg})^{1/2}$, where $a_\\text{bg}$ is the\nbackground scattering length (between atoms and molecules). In the opposite\nlimit $N\\gg (-r_0/a_\\text{bg})^{1/2}$, bosons form droplets with binding energy\nper particle saturating to a constant value independent of the particle number.\nThe stability of clusters and droplets when the interaction is detuned from the\nresonance is also studied.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"26lsEAMhT26o3B9IrT2dzRVVi8IS1HL7r9fktmDYEIU","pdfSize":"827761"}
