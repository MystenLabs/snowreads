Our approach is the first *bottom-up* hierarchical construction, in\ncontrast to previous *top-down* approaches including that of Racke, Shah, and\nTaubig (SODA 2014), the only other construction achieving polylogarithmic\nquality that is implementable in nearly-linear time (Peng, SODA 2016). Similar\nto Racke, Shah, and Taubig, our construction at each hierarchical level\nrequires calls to an approximate max-flow/min-cut subroutine. However, the main\nadvantage to our bottom-up approach is that these max-flow calls can be\nimplemented directly *without recursion*. More precisely, the previously\ncomputed levels of the hierarchy can be converted into a\n*pseudo-congestion-approximator*, which then translates to a max-flow algorithm\nthat is sufficient for the particular max-flow calls used in the construction\nof the next hierarchical level. As a result, we obtain the first non-recursive\nalgorithms for congestion-approximator and approximate max-flow that run in\nnearly-linear time, a conceptual improvement to the aforementioned algorithms\nthat recursively alternate between the two problems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ROc427YKNNVEE0P2ejj9I9a1Qc3MFY8yCmOnGX2WnKk","pdfSize":"759408"}
