In this\nwork, we study the signature in radio-frequency (RF) spectroscopy for both the\n1D-to-3D and the 2D-to-3D crossovers, in spin-polarized Fermi gases. We solve\nthe two-body scattering T-matrix in the presence of strong harmonic confinement\nand use it to evaluate the two-body bound state and the RF spectroscopy\ntransfer rate in the high frequency limit, covering both the\nquasi-low-dimensional and 3D limits. We find that in order to understand the\ndimensional crossover for spin-polarized Fermi gases with p-wave interactions,\none needs to take into account an emergent s-wave interaction.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lzH3_MBzA1rSamGkJXPS2ToTjdPHT-E4Sh-KPxX8RHE","pdfSize":"1105529"}
