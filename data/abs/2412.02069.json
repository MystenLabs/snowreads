By\ncombining TESS lightcurves with ground-based photometric and spectroscopic\nfollow-up observations we confirm the planetary nature of the observed transits\nand radial velocity variations. TOI-6628~$b$ has a mass of\n0.75$\\pm$0.06~$M_\\mathrm{J}$, a radius of 0.98$\\pm$0.05~$R_J$ and is orbiting a\nmetal-rich star with a period of 18.18424$\\pm{0.00001}$ days and an\neccentricity of 0.667$\\pm0.016$, making it one of the most eccentric orbits of\nall known warm giants. TOI-3837~$b$ has a mass of 0.59$\\pm$0.06~$M_\\mathrm{J}$,\na radius of 0.96$\\pm$0.05~$R_J$ and orbits its host star every\n11.88865$\\pm$0.00003~days, with a moderate eccentricity of\n0.198$^{+0.046}_{-0.058}$. With a mass of 2.01$\\pm$0.13~$M_\\mathrm{J}$ and a\nradius of 0.99$^{+0.07}_{-0.12}$ $R_J$, TOI-5027~$b$ orbits its host star in an\neccentric orbit with $e$~=~0.395$^{+0.032}_{-0.029}$ every\n10.24368$\\pm{0.00001}$~days. TOI-2328~$b$ is a Saturn-like planet with a mass\nof 0.16$\\pm$0.02~$M_\\mathrm{J}$ and a radius of 0.89$\\pm$0.04~$R_J$, orbiting\nits host star in a nearly circular orbit with $e$~=~0.057$^{+0.046}_{-0.029}$\nat an orbital period of 17.10197$\\pm{0.00001}$ days.\n  All four planets have orbital periods above 10 days, and our planet interior\nstructure models are consistsent a rocky-icy core with a H/He envelope,\nproviding evidence supporting the core accretion model of planet formation for\nthis kind of planets.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"j4alH5Yzam1y01q8EOMYcDIkQgXFmWzs08kKx6pTlGk","pdfSize":"5518545"}
