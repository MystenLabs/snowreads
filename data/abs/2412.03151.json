  "abstract": "  Artificial intelligence has, so far, largely automated routine tasks, but\nwhat does it mean for the future of work if Large Language Models (LLMs) show\ncreativity comparable to humans? To measure the creativity of LLMs\nholistically, the current study uses 13 creative tasks spanning three domains.\nWe benchmark the LLMs against individual humans, and also take a novel approach\nby comparing them to the collective creativity of groups of humans. We find\nthat the best LLMs (Claude and GPT-4) rank in the 52nd percentile against\nhumans, and overall LLMs excel in divergent thinking and problem solving but\nlag in creative writing. When questioned 10 times, an LLM's collective\ncreativity is equivalent to 8-10 humans. When more responses are requested, two\nadditional responses of LLMs equal one extra human. Ultimately, LLMs, when\noptimally applied, may compete with a small group of humans in the future of\nwork.\n",
