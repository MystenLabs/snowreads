Our objective is to identify orphan afterglows in\nRubin LSST data, by using the characteristic features of their light curves. In\nthis work, we generated a population of short GRBs based on the Swift SBAT4\ncatalogue, and we simulated their off-axis afterglow light curves with\nafterglowpy. We then used the rubin_sim package to simulate observations of\nthese orphan afterglows with Rubin LSST and proceeded with the characterisation\nof orphan light curves by extracting a number of parameters. The same\nparameters are computed for the ELAsTiCC (Extended LSST Astronomical\nTime-series Classification Challenge) data set, a simulated alert stream of the\nRubin LSST data. We then started to develop a machine learning filter able to\ndiscriminate orphan-like events among all the variable objects. We present here\nthe performance of our filter as implemented in the Fink broker and tested on\nthe ELAsTiCC data set and our own Rubin pseudo-observation simulations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"d2PjmGgNlzccNYSmESDTLD21OCPKXlZ1V0dL2pwuCr0","pdfSize":"540243"}
