First, we present a simple greedy algorithm for this problem that\nreturns a guard set of size at most OPT + 1, where OPT is the number of guards\nin an optimal solution. Then, we present a polynomial-time exact algorithm.\nWhile the algorithm is not complicated, its correctness proof is rather\ninvolved. This result is interesting in the sense that guarding problems are\ntypically NP-hard and, in particular, it is NP-hard to minimize the number of\nguards to see the boundary of a simple polygon, without the contiguous boundary\nguarding constraint.\n  From the combinatorial point of view, we show that any $n$-vertex polygon can\nbe guarded by at most $\\lfloor \\frac{n-2}{2}\\rfloor$ guards. This bound is\ntight because there are polygons that require this many guards.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computational Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7OVQG3dEEsAhCPvVkPCa7hmE6KEaPTOzeLYLoRtkWk4","pdfSize":"1001418"}
