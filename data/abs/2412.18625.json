A80, 2370248.],\nafter one cycle of calculation, the single-atom R1 (sR1) method required a user\nto intelligently determine a partial structure to start the next cycle. In this\npaper, a lottery scheme has been designed to randomly split a parent model into\ntwo child models. This allows the calculation to be carried out in care-free\nmanner. By chance, one child model may have higher amounts of \"good\" atoms than\nthe parent model. Thus, its expansion in the next cycle favors an improved\nmodel. These \"lucky\" results are carried onto the next cycles. while \"unlucky\"\nresults in which no improvements occur are discarded. Furthermore, unchanged\nmodels are carried onto the next cycles in those \"unlucky\" occasions. On\naverage a child model has the same fraction of \"good\" atoms as the parent. Only\na substantial statistical fluctuation results in appreciable deviation. This\nlottery scheme works because such fluctuations do happen. Indeed, test\napplications with the computing power accessibly by the author have\ndemonstrated that the designed scheme can drive an sR1 calculation to or close\nto reaching a correct structure solution.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SIHePukPN20D4iA32zXuoOAwXHTvv6Su_gvC5GtVAdg","pdfSize":"3340753"}
