Whether this\nability reflects a learning-independent inference mechanism applicable to any\nnovel unlearned problem or whether it is a manifestation of extensive training\nthroughout life is an open question. Addressing this question in humans is\nchallenging because it is impossible to control their prior training. However,\nassuming a similarity between the cognitive processing of Artificial Neural\nNetworks (ANNs) and humans, the extent to which training is required for ANNs'\nabstract reasoning is informative about this question in humans. Previous\nstudies demonstrated that ANNs can solve abstract reasoning tests. However,\nthis success required extensive training. In this study, we examined the\nlearning-independent abstract reasoning of ANNs. Specifically, we evaluated\ntheir performance without any pretraining, with the ANNs' weights being\nrandomly-initialized, and only change in the process of problem solving. We\nfound that naive ANN models can solve non-trivial visual reasoning tests,\nsimilar to those used to evaluate human learning-independent reasoning. We\nfurther studied the mechanisms that support this ability. Our results suggest\nthe possibility of learning-independent abstract reasoning that does not\nrequire extensive training.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"tQYxul3INfPTL-uAmAR-ynWS1Yq2XriGNeTbgiUNaQk","pdfSize":"9842625"}
