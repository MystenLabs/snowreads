{"id":"2412.10992","title":"Reflectionless operators and automorphic Herglotz functions","authors":"Christian Remling","authorsParsed":[["Remling","Christian",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Dec 2024 23:12:09 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-17","timestamp":1734217929000,"abstract":"  I am interested in canonical systems and Dirac operators that are\nreflectionless on an open set. In this situation, the half line $m$ functions\nare holomorphic continuations of each other and may be combined into a single\nfunction. By passing to the universal cover of its domain, we then obtain a\none-to-one correspondence of these operators with Herglotz functions that are\nautomorphic with respect to the Fuchsian group of covering transformations. I\ninvestigate the properties of this formalism, with particular emphasis given to\nthe measures that are automorphic in a corresponding sense. This will shed\nlight on the reflectionless operators as a topological space, on their extreme\npoints, and on how the heavily studied smaller space of finite gap operators\nsits inside the (much) larger space.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Spectral Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ssoTlBYe5Y_HKlJ3AxxnHVGOtG5gtmiUK9tlQOm4KSY","pdfSize":"328038"}
