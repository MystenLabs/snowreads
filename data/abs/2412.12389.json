Instead, adaptivity\nshould be regular, constant, and progressive. To assess these requirements, we\npresent Taoist, a hidden Markov model-based approach and software environment\nthat seek the longest repeating action subsequences in a task model. The\ninteraction state space is discretely produced from a task model and the\ninteraction observations are dynamically generated from a categorical\ndistribution exploiting the subsequences. Parameters governing adaptivity and\nits results are centralized to support two scenarios: intra-session for the\nsame user and inter-session for the same or any other user, even new ones. The\nend-user can control the adaptivity when initiated by accepting, declining,\nmodifying, postponing,or reinitiating the process before propagating it to the\nnext iteration. We describe the Taoist implementation and its algorithm for\nadaptivity. We illustrate its application with examples, including the W3C\nreference case study. We report the results of an experiment that evaluated\nTaoist with a representative group of ten practitioners who assessed the\nregular, constant, and progressive character of adaptivity after four\nintra-session iterations of the same task.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7N1tGG3TYXWB4Ys-y8Q9goaIDu2cNTWcNf8s4AtyfUg","pdfSize":"7662766"}
