  "abstract": "  This document reports the design, implementation and testing of a small\nsilicon resource usage, very flexible arbitrary percentile finding scheme\ncalled the Tiny Median Filter. It can be used not only as a median filter in\nimage processing with square filtering windows, but also for applications of\nany percentile filter or maximum or minimum finder with any size of data set as\nlong as the number of bits of the data is finite. It opens possibilities for\nimage processing tasks with non-square or irregular filter windows. In this\nscheme, data swapping or data bit manipulating are avoided and high functional\nefficiency of the logic components is applied to save silicon resources. Some\nlogic functions are absorbed into other functions to further reduce the\ncomplexity. The combinational logic paths are designed to be sufficiently short\nso that the firmware can be compiled to the maximum operating frequency allowed\nby the block memories of the FPGA devices. The Tiny Median Filter receives,\nprocesses and output data in non-stop manner with no irregular timing which\nhelps to simplify design of surrounding stages.\n",
