The spin-paired order\n($\\cdots{+}{+}{-}{-}\\cdots$) in LC requires an alternation of the ferromagnetic\nand antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions, while analogous spin-paired order in\nRT can be stable even for all magnetic exchange interactions being AFM. The\nrock-salt structure of CrN evokes clear magnetic frustration since Cr atoms in\nface-centered cubic lattice form links to twelve nearest neighbors all\nequivalent and AFM. Nonetheless, the magnetostructural transition to an\northorhombically distorted phase below $T_\\text{N} = 287~\\text{K}$ leads to a\ndiversification of Cr-Cr links, which suppresses the frustration and allows for\nstable double-layered AFM order of CrN. Based on $\\textit{ab initio}$\ncalculated exchange parameters, the magnon spectra and temperature evolution of\nordered magnetic moments are derived.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Z70Spgsng6l8U4QnIgsSJnZ3Dz-kGC8kk8YHhpQnWJ0","pdfSize":"473045"}
