However, with the exception of Trotter-based\nmethods which suffer from suboptimal scaling with respect to simulation\nprecision, existing simulation techniques are for the most part too intricate\nto implement on early fault-tolerant quantum hardware. We propose a quantum\nHamiltonian dynamics simulation algorithm that aims to be both straightforward\nto implement and at the same time have near-optimal scaling in simulation\nprecision.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MQDD1BcRl9aPyopaeoBrbn-rbE99o2GmMETr8-wBBoA","pdfSize":"444905"}
