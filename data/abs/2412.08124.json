We first introduce a stochastic Lie-Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman\n(SL-HJB) equation on SO(3), which theoretically provides an optimality\ncondition for the global optimal control strategy of the stochastic attitude\nkinematics. Then we propose a novel numerical method, the Successive\nWigner-Galerkin Approximation (SWGA) method, to solve the SL-HJB equation on\nSO(3). The SWGA method leverages the Wigner-D functions to represent the\nGalerkin solution of the SL-HJB equation in a policy iteration framework,\nproviding a computationally efficient approach to derive a global optimal\ncontrol strategy for systems on SO(3). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nSWGA method through numerical simulation on stochastic attitude stabilization.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NlK8YZQSgbiA3KvjxE1CgUaGpQ2I6syXywOBUBF07bc","pdfSize":"1704750"}
