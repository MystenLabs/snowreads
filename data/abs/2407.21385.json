It is\ninspired by the fact that a positive mood can lead to improved cognitive\ncapabilities including classification tasks. The network is hence presented in\na first phase with smileys and an encouraging loss function is defined to bias\nit into a good mood. SmileyNet is then used to forecast the flipping of a coin\nbased on an established method of Tasseology, namely by reading tea leaves.\nTraining and testing in this second phase are done with a high-fidelity\nsimulation based on real-world pixels sampled from a professional tea-reading\ncup. SmileyNet has an amazing accuracy of 72% to correctly predict the flip of\na coin. Resnet-34, respectively YOLOv5 achieve only 49%, respectively 53%. It\nis then shown how multiple SmileyNets can be combined to win the lottery.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"j5_dbe8GOIlSIg38vqCTIaJwJfWOE6CeMKne1DLP9zE","pdfSize":"815933"}
