We express the limits $\\lim_n f(m,n)^{1/n}$ for $m = 4$\nand $m=5$ in terms of certain systems of Fredholm integral equations on\ngenerating functions (the case $m\\le3$ was treated in a previous paper).\nSolving these equations numerically, we compute approximate values of these\nlimits with a rather high precision.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nRjMq2IUDAz8JnJpGXK0cWVNmzPZHGLfmGeuuefPv1c","pdfSize":"347859"}
