It is shown that under uniaxial\ncompression the nanosheet can transition into several stable wrinkled states:\nthe most energetically favorable one is a linear wrinkle of infinite length.\nHigher energy states include wrinkles of finite length aligned along the same\nline where their ends partially overlap. Under biaxial compression, the\ngraphene nanosheet can contain one linear wrinkle or two linear\nnon-intersecting or intersecting wrinkles corresponding to weak, medium and\nstrong compression, respectively. There are several nanosheet states with\nintersecting wrinkles that differ in structure of intersection area. The effect\nof external hydrostatic pressure on the shape of wrinkles has been studied. It\nis shown that there is a critical pressure value at which the wrinkle either\ncompletely flattens (disappears) or collapses into a vertical two-layer fold\n(the first scenario is possible only with weak compression of the sheet).\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"_7mbLbNO1jjDBCo3RmuzoFN-h9ebo_pRzMdhtEloUqI","pdfSize":"3527716"}
