This\ncapability is crucial for mobile robots to have reliable navigation, build\naccurate maps, and have precise behaviors around human collaborators. This\npaper focuses on the development of robust short-term relocalization\ncapabilities for mobile robots using a monocular camera system. A novel\nmultimodal keyframe descriptor is introduced, that contains semantic\ninformation of objects detected in the environment and the spatial information\nof the camera. Using this descriptor, a new Keyframe-based Place Recognition\n(KPR) method is proposed that is formulated as a multi-stage keyframe filtering\nalgorithm, leading to a new relocalization pipeline for MKVSLAM systems. The\nproposed approach is evaluated over several indoor GPS denied datasets and\ndemonstrates accurate pose recovery, in comparison to a bag-of-words approach.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"i02zT2i2WxlNuAFD20jLIezBPyWZBzKKQ-1iWmSS-h8","pdfSize":"1011430"}
