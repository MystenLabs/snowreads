  "abstract": "  The classic lattice XY model is one of the universal models of statistical\nmechanics appearing in a broad variety of optical and condensed matter systems.\nOne of its possible realizations is a system of tunnel-coupled spinor polariton\ncondensates, where phases of individual condensates play a role of the\ntwo-dimensional spins. We show that the account of the polarization degree of\nfreedom of cavity polaritons adds a new twist to the problem, modifying in\nparticular the structure of the ground state. We formulate the corresponding\nclassical spin Hamiltonian, which couples phase and polarization dynamics, and\nconsider several particular geometries, demonstrating the principal differences\nbetween the scalar and spinor cases. Possible analog of spin Meissner effect\nfor coupled condensates is discussed.\n",
