  "abstract": "  We present an analysis of three near-infrared (NIR; 1.0-2.4 $\\mu$m) spectra\nof the SN 2003fg-like/\"super-Chandrasekhar\" type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) SN\n2009dc, SN 2020hvf, and SN 2022pul at respective phases +372, +296, and +294~d\nrelative to the epoch of $B$-band maximum. We find that all objects in our\nsample have asymmetric, or \"tilted\", [Fe~II] 1.257 and 1.644 $\\mu$m profiles.\nWe quantify the asymmetry of these features using five methods: velocity at\npeak flux, profile tilts, residual testing, velocity fitting, and comparison to\ndeflagration-detonation transition models. Our results demonstrate that, while\nthe profiles of the [Fe II] 1.257 and 1.644 $\\mu$m features are widely varied\nbetween 2003fg-likes, these features are correlated in shape within the same\nSN. This implies that line blending is most likely not the dominant cause of\nthe asymmetries inferred from these profiles. Instead, it is more plausible\nthat 2003fg-like SNe have aspherical chemical distributions in their inner\nregions. These distributions may come from aspherical progenitor systems, such\nas double white dwarf mergers, or off-center delayed-detonation explosions of\nChandrasekhar-mass Carbon-Oxygen white dwarfs. Additional late-phase NIR\nobservation of 2003fg-like SNe and detailed 3-D NLTE modeling of these two\nexplosion scenarios are encouraged.\n",
