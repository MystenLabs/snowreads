Torons are a\nsophisticated class of 3D chiral polar topological structures with both\nskyrmionic quasiparticle textures and monopole point defects, so far only\nobserved in liquid crystal nonpolar models. Here, we experimentally construct\ntorons with the photonic spin of vector structured light and demonstrate the\ntopological phase transitions among diverse topological states: torons,\nhopfions, skyrmioniums and monopole pairs. We can also continually tune the\ntoron's chirality and the helical spin textures of emerging monopole pairs. The\nbirth of photonic torons and tunable monopoles opens a flexible platform for\nstudying nontrivial light-matter interaction and topological informatics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"tUKtkaKaEXcIcBv9Z1FylyAwlgSiZe8wq8hoyhtoNEw","pdfSize":"3000314"}
