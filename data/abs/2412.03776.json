These characterisations are achieved through Sol\\`er's theorem, a\nresult which shows that certain orthomodularity conditions on a Hermitian space\nover an involutive division ring result in a Hilbert space with the division\nring being either the reals, complexes or quaternions. The characterisation by\nHeunen and Kornell makes use of a monoidal structure, which in turn excludes\nthe category of quaternionic Hilbert spaces. We provide an alternative\ncharacterisation without the assumption of monoidal structure on the category.\nThis new approach not only gives a new characterisation of the categories of\nreal and of complex Hilbert spaces, but also the category of quaternionic\nHilbert spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QoTyjwcyvuQ5pnayeENjyqoxZMVG2v36l7ZCxS8PRJ0","pdfSize":"235832"}
