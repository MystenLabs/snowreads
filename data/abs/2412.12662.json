Contrary to this expectation, we discover that the resonant DC\nthermal noise (DTN) in photocurrents not only persists at $T=0$ but also\nexhibits a divergence proportional to $1/T$. This thermal noise\n\\textit{anomaly} arises from the unique electron-photon interactions near the\nFermi surface, manifesting as the interplay between the inherent Fermi-surface\nproperty and the resonant optical selection rules of DTN, and thereby\nrepresents an unexplored noise regime. Notably, we reveal that this\n\\textit{anomalous} DTN, especially in time-reversal-invariant systems, is\nintrinsically linked to the quantum metric. We illustrate this\n\\textit{anomalous} DTN in massless Dirac materials, including two-dimensional\ngraphene, the surfaces of three-dimensional topological insulators, and\nthree-dimensional Weyl semimetals, where the quantum metric plays a pivotal\nrole. Finally, we find that the total noise spectrum at low temperatures, which\nincludes both the DC shot noise and the \\textit{anomalous} DTN, will\nuniversally peak at $\\omega_p=2|\\mu|$ with $\\omega_p$ the frequency of light\nand $\\mu$ the chemical potential of the bulk crystals.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"C52BanSxA62Btm6E80mWLvIy9PsTvPH5_2MUyTIAKMw","pdfSize":"530380"}
