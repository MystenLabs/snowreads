  "abstract": "  Let $\\Gamma_k(V)$ be the Grassmann graph whose vertex set is formed by all\n$k$-dimensional subspaces of an $n$-dimensional vector space $V$ over the\nfinite field $F_q$ consisting of $q$ elements. We discuss its subgraph\n$\\Pi(n,k)_q$ formed by projective codes. We show that there are precisely two\ntypes of maximal cliques in $\\Pi(n,k)_q$: stars and tops. We give a complete\ndescription of stars, i.e., maximal cliques consisting of all $k$-dimensional\nprojective codes containing a certain $(k-1)$-dimensional subspace of $V$.\n",
