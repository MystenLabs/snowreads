  "abstract": "  We build upon a recent theoretical breakthrough by employing novel algorithms\nto accurately compute the fractions $F_p$ of all closed walks on the infinite\nsquare lattice whose the last erased loop corresponds is any one of the $762,\n207, 869, 373$ self-avoiding polygons $p$ of length at most 38. Prior to this\nwork, only 6 values of $F_p$ had been calculated in the literature. The main\ncomputational engine uses efficient algorithms for both the construction of\nself-avoiding polygons and the precise evaluation of the lattice Green's\nfunction. Based on our results, we propose two conjectures: one regarding the\nasymptotic behavior of sums of $F_p$, and another concerning the value of $F_p$\nwhen $p$ is a large square. We provide strong theoretical arguments supporting\nthe second conjecture. Furthermore, the algorithms we introduce are not limited\nto the square lattice and can, in principle, be extended to any\nvertex-transitive infinite lattice. In establishing this extension, we resolve\ntwo open questions related to the triangular lattice Green's function.\n",
