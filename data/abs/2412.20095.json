In particular,\nif this group with previous conditions has at most two conjugacy classes of\neach size, then G is isomorphic to PSL(2, 11).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"jgHmxobtmy6SR4ovpeOE5NYDLJlVu3XnDkBh2nvsb_k","pdfSize":"134235"}
