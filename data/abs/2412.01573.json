  "abstract": "  Due to their quantum nature, single-photon emitters generate individual\nphotons in bursts or streams. They are paramount in emerging quantum\ntechnologies such as quantum key distribution, quantum repeaters, and\nmeasurement-based quantum computing. Many such systems have been reported in\nthe last three decades, from Rubidium atoms coupled to cavities to\nsemiconductor quantum dots and color centers implanted in waveguides. This\nreview article highlights different material systems with deterministic and\ncontrolled single photon generation. We discuss and compare the performance\nmetrics, such as purity and indistinguishability, for these sources and\nevaluate their potential for different applications. Finally, a new potential\nsingle-photon source, based on the Rydberg exciton in solid state metal oxide\nthin films, is introduced, briefly discussing its promising qualities and\nadvantages in fabricating quantum chips for quantum photonic applications.\n",
