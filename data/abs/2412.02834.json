Although AI offers immense\npotential for innovation and problem solving, its integration also raises\nsignificant ethical concerns, such as privacy and bias. This paper delves into\nkey considerations for developing AI policies within institutions. We explore\nthe importance of interpretability and explainability in AI elements, as well\nas the need to mitigate biases and ensure privacy. Additionally, we discuss the\nenvironmental impact of AI and the importance of energy-efficient practices.\nThe culmination of these important components is centralized in a generalized\nframework to be utilized for institutions developing their AI policy. By\naddressing these critical factors, institutions can harness the power of AI\nwhile safeguarding ethical principles.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"dBGiK9-crNUUZ0o0eS6W0sqwXEwiU20h8Sl7R4D46YI","pdfSize":"270368"}
