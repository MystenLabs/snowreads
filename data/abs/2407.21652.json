The You Only Look\nOnce (YOLO) model is an effective single-shot detector. However, YOLO faces\nchallenges in cluttered or partially occluded scenes and can struggle with\nsmall, low-contrast objects. We propose a new method that integrates spatial\ntransformer networks (STNs) into YOLO to improve performance. The proposed\nSTN-YOLO aims to enhance the model's effectiveness by focusing on important\nareas of the image and improving the spatial invariance of the model before the\ndetection process. Our proposed method improved object detection performance\nboth qualitatively and quantitatively. We explore the impact of different\nlocalization networks within the STN module as well as the robustness of the\nmodel across different spatial transformations. We apply the STN-YOLO on\nbenchmark datasets for Agricultural object detection as well as a new dataset\nfrom a state-of-the-art plant phenotyping greenhouse facility. Our code and\ndataset are publicly available.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ReNqJWRMX320cJWDT3QJkb9oSorqOKvnEWftVln0B34","pdfSize":"18302751"}
