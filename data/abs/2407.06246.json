In the proposed work,\nto obtain coordinates of all vertices mentioned polyhedron, a modification of\nH.Uzawa's method is used, which is obtained by replacing vectors and matrices\nwith functions defined on finite sets of a special type.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Cbts3BOVU9W3e5b4bhNnydcEKRYGPWna-Me9rAK8zTA","pdfSize":"1041661"}
