We find that the\ndominant excited state contamination in the nucleon three-point function with a\nscalar current is due to the transition between the nucleon and a S-wave\nscattering state of a nucleon and a scalar (sigma) meson. In this\nproof-of-concept study, we analyse a single $N_f=3$ ensemble with the\nunphysically large pion mass $M_\\pi=429$ MeV. Excited state contamination is\nsubstantially reduced compared to the standard method when employing\nnucleon-sigma type interpolating operators within a generalised eigenvector\nanalysis.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UOyOnNHkkL6-ZobhVRGG254ANFdhC5-jllTiBKdpwEE","pdfSize":"1233602"}
