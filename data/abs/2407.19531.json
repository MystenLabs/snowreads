First, we reformulate the partition function of the Ising\nmodel on the square, triangular and honeycomb lattices in terms of the Mahler\nmeasure of a Laurent polynomial whose variety's projective closure defines an\nelliptic curve. Next, we obtain hypergeometric formulas for the partition\nfunctions on the triangular and honeycomb lattices and review the known series\nfor the square lattice. Finally, at specific temperatures we express the free\nenergy in terms of a Hasse-Weil $L$-function of an elliptic curve. At the\ncritical point of the phase transition on all three lattices, we obtain the\nfree energy more simply in terms of a Dirichlet $L$-function. These findings\nsuggest that the connection between statistical mechanics and analytic number\ntheory may run deeper than previously believed.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sspzEyaXvRJfiaTXUtKZyokr6nZib2yo82--PdMwxck","pdfSize":"874943"}
