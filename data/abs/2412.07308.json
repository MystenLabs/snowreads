Given an elliptic curve $ E/\\mathbb{Q} $ with good\nordinary reduction at $ 2 $ and $ \\lambda_2(E/\\mathbb{Q}) = 0 $, we use\nMatsuno's Kida-type formula to construct quadratic twists $ E^{(d)} $ such that\n$ \\lambda_2(E^{(d)}/\\mathbb{Q}) $ remains unchanged or increases by $ 2 $. When\nthe root number of $E^{(d)}$ is $-1$ and the Tate-Shafarevich group\n$Sha(E^{(d)}/\\mathbb{Q})[2^\\infty] $ is finite, this yields quadratic twists\nwith Mordell--Weil rank $ 1 $. These results support the conjectural\nexpectation that, on average, half of the quadratic twists in a family have\nrank $ 0 $ and half have rank $ 1 $. In the cases we consider we obtain\nasymptotic lower bounds for the number of twists by squarefree numbers $d\\leq\nX$ which match with the conjectured value up to an explicit power of $\\log X$.\nThey complement recent groundbreaking results of Smith on Goldfeld's\nconjecture.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"c4eG8Kx3pGwcTC9-Js8aaX5_zMpKN5nNDC43uAtm0RQ","pdfSize":"331784"}
