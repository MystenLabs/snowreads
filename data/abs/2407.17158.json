Using Landau singularity analysis and\nexisting analytic results, we study the appearance of such regions in\nwide-angle and forward scattering and discuss how they can be exposed in both\nthe momentum and parametric representations. We demonstrate that in the strict\non-shell limit such integrals contain Landau singularities that prevent their\ndirect numerical evaluation in parameter space and describe how they can be\nre-parameterised and dissected to circumvent this problem.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mNpfFzsy67BaZWLqrOZffLfzXDkxhgTK5xLydbQqYBg","pdfSize":"198493"}
