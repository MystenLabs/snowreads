  "abstract": "  Violence detection in surveillance videos is a critical task for ensuring\npublic safety. As a result, there is increasing need for efficient and\nlightweight systems for automatic detection of violent behaviours. In this\nwork, we propose an effective method which leverages human skeleton key-points\nto capture inherent properties of violence, such as rapid movement of specific\njoints and their close proximity. At the heart of our method is our novel\nDynamic Interaction Feature Extraction Module (DIFEM) which captures features\nsuch as velocity, and joint intersections, effectively capturing the dynamics\nof violent behavior. With the features extracted by our DIFEM, we use various\nclassification algorithms such as Random Forest, Decision tree, AdaBoost and\nk-Nearest Neighbor. Our approach has substantially lesser amount of parameter\nexpense than the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employing deep\nlearning techniques. We perform extensive experiments on three standard\nviolence recognition datasets, showing promising performance in all three\ndatasets. Our proposed method surpasses several SOTA violence recognition\nmethods.\n",
