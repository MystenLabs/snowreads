  "abstract": "  Abstract The standard-model can be equivalently represented with its fields\nin a spin-extended basis, departing from fermion degrees of freedom. The common\nHiggs operator connects the electroweak and Yukawa sectors, restricting the top\nand bottom quark masses[Phys. Rev. D 99, 073001, 2019]. Using second\nquantization, within the heavy-particle sector, electroweak vectors, the Higgs\nfield, and symmetry operators are expanded in terms of bilinear combinations of\ntop and bottom quark operators, considering discrete degrees of freedom and\nchirality. This is interpreted as either a basis choice or as a description of\ncomposite models. The vacuum expectation value is calculated quantum\nmechanically, which relates to the common mass-generating scalar operator and\nit reproduces the vector and quark-doublet masses. This also links the\ncorresponding scalar-vector and Yukawa vertices, and restricts the t- and\nb-quark masses in a hierarchy relation.\n",
