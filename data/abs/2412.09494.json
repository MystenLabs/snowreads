Our\nanalysis is supported by evidence showing the equivalence of the thermodynamic\ntopology of K-R AdS black holes in the Gibbs-Boltzmann (GB) statistical\nframework and K-R flat black holes in the Renyi statistical framework. We begin\nby exploring the thermodynamic topology of K-R black holes in flat spacetimes,\nfocusing on the topological characteristics and phase transition behavior in\nboth statistical frameworks. We find that K-R flat black holes in Renyi\nstatistics exhibit equivalent global and local topological properties to K-R\nAdS black holes in GB statistics. This equivalence points to a potential\nconnection between the cosmological constant and the Renyi parameter. We derive\nan approximate relationship between the Renyi parameter and the cosmological\nconstant, which is consistent with similar findings in the literature from a\ncosmological perspective.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QcKgS1ZXsf8Mndg77QN6S2Ae1B0P1wNXI8JNtCnaPGo","pdfSize":"981789"}
