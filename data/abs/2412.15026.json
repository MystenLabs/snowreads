To this end, we develop the theory of multilinear\nsingular integrals taking values in tensor products of finite dimensional\nHilbert spaces. On the one hand, we establish quantitative bounds in terms of\nmultilinear Muckenhoupt matrix weight characteristics and scalar Fujii-Wilson\nconditions of a tensor product analogue of the convex body sparse operator, of\na convex-set valued tensor product analogue of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal\noperator, and of a multilinear analogue of the Christ-Goldberg maximal\noperator. These bounds recover the sharpest known bounds in the linear case.\nMoreover, we define a notion of directional nondegeneracy for multilinear\nCalder\\'on-Zygmund operators, which is new even in the scalar case. The\nnoncommutavity of matrix multiplication, the absence of duality, and the\nnatural presence of quasinorms in the multilinear setting present several new\ndifficulties in comparison to previous works in the scalar or in the linear\ncase. To overcome them, we use techniques inspired from convex combinatorics\nand differential geometry.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uPzt7SkiDZuPKKVOWyg1qQmAu518YH_2fs8fxJEHi1Q","pdfSize":"616089"}
