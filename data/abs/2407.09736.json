To this end, we analyze proprietary data from the first-person action\nvideo game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, published by Activision. To\novercome causal identification problems, we implement an instrumental variables\nestimation strategy. Our findings confirm that exposure to toxic language\nsignificantly affects player engagement and the probability that players use\nsimilar language. Accordingly, video game publishers have a vested interest in\naddressing toxic language. Further, we demonstrate that this effect varies\nsignificantly depending on whether toxic language originates from opponents or\nteammates, whether it originates from teammates in the same party or a\ndifferent party, and the match's outcome. This has meaningful implications\nregarding how resources for addressing toxicity should be allocated.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"i3qTH0-1leznntkD-BB-BjoCMQsjHHkW0z9epAs32cI","pdfSize":"502311"}
