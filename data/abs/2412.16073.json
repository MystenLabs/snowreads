Previously, eigenvalue bounds were obtained in the case of $K=1$\nand $K=N-1$ by A.V. Sobolev. The purpose of the current work is to obtain\nbounds in the case of $2 \\le K \\le N-2$. For such $K$ we label the eigenvalues\nof the positive, trace class operators $\\Gamma^{(K)}$ by\n$\\lambda_n(\\Gamma^{(K)})$ for $n=1,2,\\dots$, and obtain the bounds\n$\\lambda_n(\\Gamma^{(K)}) \\le Cn^{-\\alpha_K}$ for all $n$, where $\\alpha_K = 1 +\n7/(3L)$ and $L = \\min\\{K,N-K\\}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2uA4i3VY-1kjZvhAjvUgLlU-W5sW6hfkKTIRnGvw0Cc","pdfSize":"284430"}
