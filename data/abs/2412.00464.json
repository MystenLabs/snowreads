  "abstract": "  This work proposes a mathematical approach that (re)defines a property of\nMachine Learning models named stability and determines sufficient conditions to\nvalidate it. Machine Learning models are represented as functions, and the\ncharacteristics in scope depend upon the domain of the function, what allows us\nto adopt topological and metric spaces theory as a basis. Finally, this work\nprovides some equivalences useful to prove and test stability in Machine\nLearning models. The results suggest that whenever stability is aligned with\nthe notion of function smoothness, then the stability of Machine Learning\nmodels primarily depends upon certain topological, measurable properties of the\nclassification sets within the ML model domain.\n",
