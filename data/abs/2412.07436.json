We show\nthat there is an associated structure of a graded Lie-Rinehart algebra on the\nvector fields of a differentiable stack over its smooth functions that is\nMorita invariant in an appropriate sense. Furthermore, we show that associated\nVan-Est type maps are compatible with those module structures. We also present\nseveral examples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"fRgqRkgE58Jv7qqUi54waOOv6v5o9LXEkhAv_TuVP3w","pdfSize":"412300"}
