  "abstract": "  We introduce and study module structures on both the dgla of multiplicative\nvector fields and the graded algebra of functions on Lie groupoids. We show\nthat there is an associated structure of a graded Lie-Rinehart algebra on the\nvector fields of a differentiable stack over its smooth functions that is\nMorita invariant in an appropriate sense. Furthermore, we show that associated\nVan-Est type maps are compatible with those module structures. We also present\nseveral examples.\n",
