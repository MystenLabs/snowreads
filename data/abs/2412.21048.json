  "abstract": "  Given a bounded domain $\\O$ and $f$ of zero integral, the existence of a\nvector fields $\\u$ vanishing on $\\partial\\O$ and satisfying $\\d\\u=f$ has been\nwidely studied because of its connection with many important problems. It is\nknown that for $f\\in L^p(\\O)$, $1<p<\\infty$, there exists a solution $\\u\\in\nW^{1,p}_0(\\O)$, and also that an analogous result is not true for $p=1$ or\n$p=\\infty$. The goal of this paper is to prove results for Hardy spaces when\n$\\frac{n}{n+1}<p\\le 1$, and in the other limiting case, for bounded mean\noscillation and Lipschitz spaces. As a byproduct of our analysis we obtain a\nKorn inequality for vector fields in Hardy-Sobolev spaces.\n",
