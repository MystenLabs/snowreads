The results show that our framework provides fine-grained,\ninterpretable metrics suited for literary translation and obtains a higher\ncorrelation with human judgment than traditional machine translation metrics.\nNonetheless, it still fails to match inter-human agreement, especially in\nmetrics like Korean Honorifics. We also observe that LLMs tend to favor\ntranslations generated by other LLMs, and we highlight the necessity of\ndeveloping more sophisticated evaluation methods to ensure accurate and\nculturally sensitive machine translation of literary works.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"_jSi3Oo7mO8La2pCob-qSGb5yJfrz8JRsjbD5qhXHak","pdfSize":"3972779"}
