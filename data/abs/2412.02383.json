  "abstract": "  We investigate the multiplicity of solutions for a Hamiltonian system\ncoupling two systems associated with mixed boundary conditions. Corresponding\nto the first system, we impose periodic boundary conditions and assume the\ntwist assumption commonly used for the Poincar\\'e--Birkhoff theorem, while for\nthe second one, we consider a two-point boundary conditions of Neumann type.\n",
