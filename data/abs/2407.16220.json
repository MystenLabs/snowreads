This paper proposes a novel take on RL, which is\nused to learn the policy of another agent, to allow real-time recognition of\nthat agent's goals. Goal Recognition (GR) has traditionally been framed as a\nplanning problem where one must recognize an agent's objectives based on its\nobserved actions. Recent approaches have shown how reinforcement learning can\nbe used as part of the GR pipeline, but are limited to recognizing predefined\ngoals and lack scalability in domains with a large goal space. This paper\nformulates a novel problem, \"Online Dynamic Goal Recognition\" (ODGR), as a\nfirst step to address these limitations. Contributions include introducing the\nconcept of dynamic goals into the standard GR problem definition, revisiting\ncommon approaches by reformulating them using ODGR, and demonstrating the\nfeasibility of solving ODGR in a navigation domain using transfer learning.\nThese novel formulations open the door for future extensions of existing\ntransfer learning-based GR methods, which will be robust to changing and\nexpansive real-time environments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"2rM9jMjj9iymWGiObD-Kl_jXc4J-Bhf0VRv3g4ajQqk","pdfSize":"790872"}
