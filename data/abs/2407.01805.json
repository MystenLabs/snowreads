The thermodynamic efficiency is captured by a\nsingle coefficient of performance. Using a minimal model, we show that when the\nelectron repulsion energy matches the transport gap of the junction, the\nphotoconductor displays maximal response, performance and signal-to-noise\nratio, while the same regime is always detrimental for the solar cell.\nNevertheless, we find that electron repulsion is beneficial for the solar cell\nif it lies below the transport gap. Our work sheds important light on design\nprinciples for thermodynamically efficient photodevices in the presence of\ninteractions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tJY-XL8XUl6BWyix9MIKiqilXMfa4uP7oYmU3Q5EkbA","pdfSize":"449713","objectId":"0x4f659ace484fe4ff1ecf2bfd574e3ca683c753e5659dbd104a825300dffbbbf6","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
