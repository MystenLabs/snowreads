The model is shown to agree quantitatively with quantum\nmaster equations for microscopic lasers with a small number of emitters and\nwith classical Langevin equations for macroscopic systems. In contrast, neither\nquantum master equations nor classical Langevin equations adequately address\nthe mesoscopic regime. The stochastic approach is used to calculate the\nlinewidth throughout the transition to lasing, where the linewidth changes from\nbeing dominated by the particle-like nature of photons below threshold to the\nwave-like nature above threshold, where it is strongly influenced by index\nfluctuations enhancing the linewidth.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CpkhrxOEwS71FR68ux0Nrp-aDnOD4_63Aobi25HLg5k","pdfSize":"1788865"}
