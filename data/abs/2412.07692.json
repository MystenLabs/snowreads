  "abstract": "  We construct surfaces with arbitrarily large multiplicity for their first\nnon-zero Steklov eigenvalue. The proof is based on a technique by M. Burger and\nB. Colbois originally used to prove a similar result for the Laplacian\nspectrum. We start by constructing surfaces $S_p$ with a specific subgroup of\nisometry $G_p:= \\mathbb{Z}_p \\rtimes \\mathbb{Z}_p^*$ for each prime $p$. We do\nso by gluing surfaces with boundary following the structure of the Cayley graph\nof $G_p$. We then exploit the properties of $G_p$ and $S_p$ in order to show\nthat an irreducible representation of high degree (depending on $p$) acts on\nthe eigenspace of functions associated with $\\sigma_1(S_p)$, leading to the\ndesired result.\n",
