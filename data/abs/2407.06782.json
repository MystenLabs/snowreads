In order to tackle this problem, we have\ntried to model the inherent uncertainty and vagueness of color data using fuzzy\ncolor model. By taking fuzzy approach to color modeling, we could make a soft\ndecision for the vague regions between neighboring colors. The proposed fuzzy\ncolor model defined a three dimensional fuzzy color ball and color membership\ncomputation method with two inter-color distances. With the fuzzy color model,\nwe developed a new fuzzy clustering algorithm for an efficient partition of\ncolor data. Each fuzzy cluster set has a cluster prototype which is represented\nby fuzzy color centroid.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"bFQVYJDizjGApw_jPLM9EihhKL_tJodXf-cCvcemugw","pdfSize":"251532"}
