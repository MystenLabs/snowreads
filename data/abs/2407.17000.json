We\nreport trade-offs between the cardinalities of the reciprocal regions of the\nresonant coupling strengths versus phases. We discover that time-reversal\nsymmetry enforces projected generalized reflections in the background to cancel\nout completely. In double-port systems, the reciprocal regions of the coupling\nphases span a quarter of the nonreciprocal regions for any non-hidden mode.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"epvudFMiPFdm-Uke1gjYooaEcN_O6dq-W2tzn79ev7Q","pdfSize":"530020"}
