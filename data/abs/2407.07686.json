This work attempts to\nshed light on the bandwidth capacity requirements and latency of popular AR/VR\napplications with four different real experimental settings on the Meta Quest 3\nheadsets, and their potential impact on the network.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"g8LgC0BK3LCFgfQZ-4qfSJaoofMKX0k99-AS_5HR5NA","pdfSize":"11122253"}
