Our results\nprovide a new potential quantum supremacy in the VQE's optimization subroutine\nand enhance viable paths toward efficient quantum simulations on Noisy\nIntermediate-Scale Quantum Computing (NISQ) devices. Additionally, we also\nconducted a detailed study of quantum circuit ansatz structures in order to\nfind the one that would work best with the Ising model and NISQ, in which we\nutilized the symmetry of the investigated model.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JFNoUDGJpB3O7D_Vg7ZvXV57FC1fG-PyGQmosdst7wg","pdfSize":"2104542"}
