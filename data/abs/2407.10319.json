The\nhyperfine coupling is considered to suppress nuclear dipolar flip-flop\ntransitions, hindering the transport of nuclear hyperpolarization into the bulk\n(''spin-diffusion barrier''). Possible polarization-transfer pathways leading\nto DNP and subsequent spin diffusion between hypershifted nuclei in a\ntwo-electron two-nucleus four-spin system are investigated. The\nSchrieffer-Wolff transformation is applied to characterize transitions that are\nonly possible as second-order effects. An energy-conserving electron-nuclear\nfour-spin flip-flop is identified, which combines an electron dipolar with a\nnuclear dipolar flip-flop process, describing spin diffusion close to\nelectrons. The relevance of this process is supported by two-compartment model\nfits of HypRes-on experimental data. This suggests that all nuclear spins can\ncontribute to the hyperpolarization of the bulk and the concept of a\nspin-diffusion barrier has to be reconsidered for samples with significant\nelectron and nuclear dipolar couplings.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"od8M6TJg4o7wZrPind-bpM6RvDNpnmqpexR9FbnQOt0","pdfSize":"1318652"}
