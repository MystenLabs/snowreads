This\nflop is the only known simple flop that comes from a non-homogeneous roof. The\nproof of the derived equivalence is done by using tilting bundles, and also\nproduces a noncommutative crepant resolution of the singularity that is derived\nequivalent to both sides of the flop.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"6cwz-DqvwUepZzl7xxL344u8nEFSHgX_D83WRInuo5w","pdfSize":"424208"}
