  "abstract": "  We present a new method for state preparation using the Unitary Vibrational\nCoupled-Cluster (UVCC) technique. Our approach utilizes redundancies in the\nHilbert space in the direct mapping of vibrational modes into qubits. By\neliminating half of the qubit controls required in the Trotterized UVCC ansatz,\nour method achieves up to a 50% theoretical reduction in the entangling gate\ncount compared to other methods and up to a 28% reduction compared practically\nuseful approaches. This improvement enhances the fidelity of UVCC state\npreparation, enabling more efficient and earlier implementation of complex\nquantum vibrational structure calculations on near-term quantum devices. We\nexperimentally demonstrate our method on Quantinuum's H1-1 quantum hardware,\nachieving significantly higher fidelities for 6- and 8-qubit systems compared\nto existing implementations. For fault-tolerant architectures, eliminating half\nof the control qubits in multi-controlled rotations incurs an additional\nToffoli gate overhead elsewhere in the circuit. Thus, the overall performance\ngain depends on the specific decomposition method used for multi-controlled\ngates.\n",
