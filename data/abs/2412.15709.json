A new optimality measure using the Frobenius norm of the error\noperator has been introduced and the corresponding optimal dual pairs have been\nanalyzed for any number of erasures. Also, other measures of the error\noperator, namely the spectral radius and the numerical radius, have been\nconsidered for the analysis. Besides, explicit construction of certain optimal\ndual pairs has been provided.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5QLAx0iYJ3SQHTc45V7va6S4kY7buZoo4UTjKP1JUPo","pdfSize":"192620"}
