We propose\na ``multi-selection'' architecture where the server can send back multiple\nrecommendations and the user chooses one from these that matches best with\ntheir private features. When the user feature is one-dimensional -- on an\ninfinite line -- and the accuracy measure is defined w.r.t some increasing\nfunction $\\mathfrak{h}(.)$ of the distance on the line, we precisely\ncharacterize the optimal mechanism that satisfies differential privacy. The\nspecification of the optimal mechanism includes both the distribution of the\nnoise that the user adds to its private value, and the algorithm used by the\nserver to determine the set of results to send back as a response and further\nshow that Laplace is an optimal noise distribution. We further show that this\noptimal mechanism results in an error that is inversely proportional to the\nnumber of results returned when the function $\\mathfrak{h}(.)$ is the identity\nfunction.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AXb9uNFKZyL-ihEDtMzhSTLUNb-cfBn9GRV8UuhuId8","pdfSize":"1320403"}
