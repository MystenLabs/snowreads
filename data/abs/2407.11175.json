In this paper we study various aspects of this\nequation: its highly nontrivial derivation from the bilinear lattice AKP\nequation under dimensional reduction, a quadrilinear dual lattice equation,\nconservation laws, and periodic reductions leading to higher-dimensional\nintegrable maps and their Laurent property. Furthermore, we consider a higher\nGel'fand-Dikii lattice system, its periodic reductions and Laurent property. As\na special application, from both a trilinear Boussinesq recurrence as well as a\nhigher Gel'fand-Dikii system of three bilinear recurrences, we establish\nSomos-like integer sequences.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SQFG8GgK3HRgi3noADLWhBcAXex-I-7HLdlSe-LmjDY","pdfSize":"250933","objectId":"0x4a83dce46b4db3738ad6eb8077f7b3cd4258591adf956af256b7de52ed7c49ce","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
