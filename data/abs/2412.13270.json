In the\npresence of beyond-standard-model (BSM) operators, the resulting $\\Delta B = 0$\nHamiltonian features additional four-quark operators whose matrix elements need\nto be determined using non-perturbative methods. We present for the first time\nresults for the non-perturbative hadronic matrix elements of the four-quark\noperators relevant for the description of the meson lifetime ratio\n$\\tau\\left(B^+\\right) / \\tau\\left(B_d\\right)$, obtained using heavy-quark\neffective theory (HQET) sum rules with the full BSM effective Hamiltonian. In\naddition, we recompute and update the bag parameters for the Standard Model\noperators.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4bhq4NkZ_BlIm419n7uZwhzW4OoLJzMWorqcsU-xS9I","pdfSize":"904507"}
