We show here the existence of a\nmore general space-filling curve with additional convexity properties. More\nprecisely: by T ? R2 we denote a convex closed and bounded set and we show that\nthere exists a continuous surjection f : [0; 1] 7! T for which the image of any\ninterval is a convex set.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5wubmS-FybahNeu_SHjOGubRQbIjCdVzabrKjH9wkrY","pdfSize":"498500"}
