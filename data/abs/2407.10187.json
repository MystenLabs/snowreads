While subsequent\ncryptocurrencies aimed to address privacy concerns (like Zcash and Monero),\nthey often conflicted with regulatory frameworks, hindering broader adoption.\nIn response, inspired by recent researches about privacy and accountability and\nincentive techniques in Blockchain, we propose IdentityChain as a novel\nframework that integrates privacy and accountability principles, leading to a\nrobust system equipped with adaptable rules.\n  IdentityChain is a KYC (Know Your Customer) service on top of a public\nBlockchain (e.g., Ethereum, Ton, Polygon). The goal is to maintain privacy\nwhile ensuring compliance with existing regulations. Privacy is one of the key\ncharacteristics of IdentityChain, it's crucial for preventing conflicts of\ninterests further discussed how. Accountability is also one of the main\ncharacteristics of IdentityChain and prevents from misbehave of users. Privacy\nand accountability together wouldn't be possible unless advancements in\ncryptography.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"8Io_DFGEXveUOxG7KPFo7iYGO-TJZsnvivw_BX-fK1I","pdfSize":"1390854"}
