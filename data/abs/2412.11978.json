  "abstract": "  While crowdsourcing is an established solution for facilitating and scaling\nthe collection of speech data, the involvement of non-experts necessitates\nprotocols to ensure final data quality. To reduce the costs of these essential\ncontrols, this paper investigates the use of Speech Foundation Models (SFMs) to\nautomate the validation process, examining for the first time the cost/quality\ntrade-off in data acquisition. Experiments conducted on French, German, and\nKorean data demonstrate that SFM-based validation has the potential to reduce\nreliance on human validation, resulting in an estimated cost saving of over\n40.0% without degrading final data quality. These findings open new\nopportunities for more efficient, cost-effective, and scalable speech data\nacquisition.\n",
