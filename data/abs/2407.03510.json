Our approach achieves performance parity with the\nbest-known methods, requiring an average of 49,399 iterations with a 100%\nsuccess rate. The study demonstrates significant improvements over earlier\ngenetic algorithm implementations in this field, reducing iteration counts by\norders of magnitude. By achieving equivalent performance through a different\nalgorithmic approach, our work expands the toolkit available to cryptographers\nand highlights the potential of genetic methods in cryptographic primitive\ngeneration. The adaptability and parallelization potential of genetic\nalgorithms suggest promising avenues for future research in S-box generation,\npotentially leading to more robust, efficient, and innovative cryptographic\nsystems. Our findings contribute to the ongoing evolution of symmetric key\ncryptography, offering new perspectives on optimizing critical components of\nsecure communication systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DCR4rxV9uhc6jctoUnD4PK72ilcpyQdHfUGwccwg1Y4","pdfSize":"572874"}
