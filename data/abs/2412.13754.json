Here, nodes from the\ntwo-cluster Stochastic Block Model (SBM) are coupled with feature vectors,\nwhich are derived from a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) that corresponds to their\nrespective node labels. With only a subset of the CSBM node labels accessible\nfor training, our primary objective becomes the accurate classification of the\nremaining nodes. Venturing into the transductive learning landscape, we, for\nthe first time, pinpoint the information-theoretical threshold for the exact\nrecovery of all test nodes in CSBM. Concurrently, we design an optimal spectral\nestimator inspired by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with the training\nlabels and essential data from both the adjacency matrix and feature vectors.\nWe also evaluate the efficacy of graph ridge regression and Graph Convolutional\nNetworks (GCN) on this synthetic dataset. Our findings underscore that graph\nridge regression and GCN possess the ability to achieve the information\nthreshold of exact recovery in a manner akin to the optimal estimator when\nusing the optimal weighted self-loops. This highlights the potential role of\nfeature learning in augmenting the proficiency of GCN, especially in the realm\nof semi-supervised learning.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Machine Learning","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"67GAOKbflUmCA7J78oPsJBEgV7467PEoCwMpeiRjSTw","pdfSize":"2072351"}
