Annotations can capture various span-based phenomena\nsuch as semantic inaccuracies or irrelevant text. With factgenie, the\nannotations can be collected both from human crowdworkers and large language\nmodels. Our framework consists of a web interface for data visualization and\ngathering text annotations, powered by an easily extensible codebase.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"luo0aNXHyZT_YRhvcc7EQju47RVnQCgGRouES4V7bb4","pdfSize":"546124"}
