With no further assumptions on the pattern, this induced removal\nlemma cannot guarantee a fully pattern-free recolouring of the space, as some\n`non-generic' instances must necessarily remain. On the other hand,\nBhattacharyya et al. (arXiv:1212.3849) showed that in the case of\ntranslation-invariant patterns, it is possible to obtain recolourings that\neliminate the given pattern completely, with no exceptions left behind. This\npaper demonstrates that such complete removal can be achieved for all\npartition-regular arithmetic patterns of complexity 1.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"c3mWvwg8PjPr4mYYkSwHnNWJubXteaisSdXGBKZ5018","pdfSize":"1074420"}
