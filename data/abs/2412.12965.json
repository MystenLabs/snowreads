  "abstract": "  The iterative bleaching extends multiplexity (IBEX) Knowledge-Base is a\ncentral portal for researchers adopting IBEX and related 2D and 3D\nimmunofluorescence imaging methods. The design of the Knowledge-Base is modeled\nafter efforts in the open-source software community and includes three facets:\na development platform (GitHub), static website, and service for data\narchiving. The Knowledge-Base facilitates the practice of open science\nthroughout the research life cycle by providing validation data for recommended\nand non-recommended reagents, e.g., primary and secondary antibodies. In\naddition to reporting negative data, the Knowledge-Base empowers method\nadoption and evolution by providing a venue for sharing protocols, videos,\ndatasets, software, and publications. A dedicated discussion forum fosters a\nsense of community among researchers while addressing questions not covered in\npublished manuscripts. Together, scientists from around the world are advancing\nscientific discovery at a faster pace, reducing wasted time and effort, and\ninstilling greater confidence in the resulting data.\n",
