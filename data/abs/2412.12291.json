  "abstract": "  We consider the selective sensing of planar waves in the presence of noise.\nWe present different methods to control the sensitivity of a quantum sensor\nnetwork, which allow one to decouple it from arbitrarily selected waves while\nretaining sensitivity to the signal. Comparing these methods with classical\n(non-entangled) sensor networks we demonstrate two advantages. First,\nentanglement increases precision by enabling the Heisenberg scaling. Second,\nentanglement enables the elimination of correlated noise processes\ncorresponding to waves with different propagation directions, by exploiting\ndecoherence-free subspaces. We then provide a theoretical and numerical\nanalysis of the advantage offered by entangled quantum sensor networks, which\nis not specific to waves and can be of general interest. We demonstrate an\nexponential advantage in the regime where the number of sensor locations is\ncomparable to the number of noise sources. Finally, we outline a generalization\nto other waveforms, e.g., spherical harmonics and general time-dependent\nfields.\n",
