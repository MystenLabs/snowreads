Addressing these challenges requires a\nmultifaceted approach involving all the stakeholders, sustainable planning,\nefficient resource management, innovative solutions, and modern technologies.\nLike other modern technologies, social media informatics also plays its part in\ndeveloping more sustainable and resilient cities and societies. Despite its\nlimitations, social media informatics has proven very effective in various\nsustainable cities and society applications. In this paper, we review and\nanalyze the role of social media informatics in sustainable cities and society\nby providing a detailed overview of its applications, associated challenges,\nand potential solutions. This work is expected to provide a baseline for future\nresearch in the domain.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"t0PxyiV1RISXsh2BfaqWHivt7KDGOF4VinIydbz9iEs","pdfSize":"1514429"}
