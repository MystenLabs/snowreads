Our interest lies in the\ninterplay between two localization mechanisms. On the one hand, the attractive\n(repulsive) delta potential acting as a point defect breaks the translational\ninvariance of the lattice so that a linear staggering (non-staggering) bound\nstate is formed with negative (positive) energy. On the other hand, focusing\nnonlinearity may lead to self-trapping of excitation energy. For focusing\nnonlinearity we prove the existence of a spatially exponentially localized and\ntime-periodic ground state and investigate the impact of an attractive\nrespectively repulsive delta potential on the existence of an excitation\nthreshold, i.e. supercritical $l^2$ norm, for the creation of such a ground\nstates. Explicit expressions for the lower excitation thresholds are given.\nReciprocally, we discuss the influence of defocusing nonlinearity on the\ndurability of the linear bound states and provide upper thresholds of the\n$l^2-$norm for their preservation. Regarding the asymptotic behavior of the\nsolutions we establish that for a $l^2-$norm below the excitation threshold the\nsolutions scatter to a solution of the linear problem in $l^{p>2}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"DKUnzh7GJZCPxctkoK5NEpNFXVzs3xXqke8Z3k7MquE","pdfSize":"279831"}
