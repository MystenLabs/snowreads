Using their isomorphism to the Cuntz-Pimsner algebra of the\nquantum edge correspondence, we show that the general criteria for KMS states\ncan be translated into statements about the underlying quantum adjacency\noperator, somewhat analogously to the case of classical Cuntz-Krieger algebras.\nWe study some examples of gauge actions, for which a complete classification of\nKMS states can be obtained.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"H9NSpOiL3lzH7nm_DrfLepYxyf0-05HLjrxNvWZcfrM","pdfSize":"450177"}
