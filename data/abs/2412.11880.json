We revisit the duality framework proposed by Eckstein, Ferris,\nPennanen, and Robinson from a quarter of a century ago. Paramonotonicity is\nidentified as a broad condition ensuring that saddle points coincide with the\nclosed convex rectangle formed by the primal and dual solutions. Additionally,\nwe characterize total duality in the subdifferential setting and derive\nprojection formulas for sets that arise in the analysis of the Chambolle-Pock\nalgorithm within the recent framework developed by Bredies, Chenchene, Lorenz,\nand Naldi.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Fjjsax1osFBI016VmJZaB4slKnrr9dZorKF11v2RcDA","pdfSize":"283986"}
