A big challenge is maximizing the\ninformation per used probe particle to limit the damage to the probed system.\nWe present a cavity-enhanced continuous-wave microscopy approach that provides\nenhanced signal-to-noise ratios at fixed damage. Employing a self-imaging 4f\ncavity, we show contrast enhancement for controlled test samples as well as\nbiological samples. For thick samples, the imaging cavity leads to a new form\nof dark-field microscopy, where the separation of scattered and unscattered\nlight is based on optical path length. We theoretically show that enhanced\nsignal, signal-to-noise, and signal-to-noise per damage are also retrieved when\nthe cavity cannot be stabilized. Our results provide an approach to\ncavity-enhanced microscopy with unstabilized cavities and might be used to\nenhance the performance of dispersive imaging of ultracold atoms.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mEHc4D-H45lrmpR3tfpXIcTd7B7abzqDV4z1Qj3I-Yk","pdfSize":"11798821"}
