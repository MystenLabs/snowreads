In this paper, we present a bidirectional RNN model for character\nprediction of Coptic characters in manuscript lacunae. Our best model performs\nwith 72% accuracy on single character reconstruction, but falls to 37% when\nreconstructing lacunae of various lengths. While not suitable for definitive\nmanuscript reconstruction, we argue that our RNN model can help scholars rank\nthe likelihood of textual reconstructions. As evidence, we use our RNN model to\nrank reconstructions in two early Coptic manuscripts. Our investigation shows\nthat neural models can augment traditional methods of textual restoration,\nproviding scholars with an additional tool to assess lacunae in Coptic\nmanuscripts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iy1xvwlUltMMitIipVdS-VbPwA0fKcnIm3Th7H8ZTNo","pdfSize":"8136355"}
