It is expected that diffractive processes account for nearly\n40% of the total cross-section at LHC energies. These processes consist of\nsoft-scale physics where perturbation theory cannot be applied. Although highly\nsuccessful and often described as a perfect theory, quantum chromodynamics\nrelies heavily on perturbation theory, a model best suited for hard-scale\nphysics. The study of pomerons could help bridge the soft and hard processes\nand provide a complete description of the theory of the strong interaction\nacross the full momentum spectrum. Here, we will discuss some of the features\nof diffractive physics, experimental results from SPS, HERA, and the LHC, and\nwhere the field could potentially lead. With the recent publication of the\nodderon discovery in 2021 by the D0 and TOTEM collaborations and the new\nhorizon of physics that lies ahead with the upcoming Electron-Ion Collider at\nBrookhaven National Laboratory, interest is seemingly piquing in high energy\ndiffractive physics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eI5HUbBNmHZVv74ijKmaVE_chtHa7iMjUaeZL6IZSoA","pdfSize":"4879394"}
