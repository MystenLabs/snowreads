Ion clustering have been suggested as a possible origin of this\nbehaviour. In this work, we demonstrate that if such stable clusters indeed\nform, they are able to induce remarkably strong free energy barriers, under\nconditions where a corresponding solution of simple salt provide negligible\nforces. Our cluster model is based on connected ions producing a polyampholyte\nsalt, containing a symmetric mixture of monovalent cationic and anionic\npolyampholytes. Ion distributions and surface interactions are evaluated\nutilising statistical-mechanical (classical) polymer Density Functional Theory,\ncDFT. In the Supporting Information, we briefly investigate a range of\ndifferent polymer architectures (connectivities), but in the main part of the\nwork a polyampholyte ion is modelled as a linear chain with alternating\ncharges, in which the ends carry an identical charge (hence, a monovalent net\ncharge). These salts are able to generate repulsions, between similarly charged\nsurfaces, of a remarkable strength - exceeding those from simple salts by\norders of magnitude. The underlying mechanism for this is the formation of\nbrush-like layers at the surfaces, i.e. the repulsion is strongly related to\nexcluded volume effects, in a manner similar to the interaction between\nsurfaces carrying grafted polymers. We believe our results are relevant not\nonly to possible mechanisms underlying anomalously long-ranged underscreening\nin concentrated simple salt solutions, but also for the potential use of\nsynthesised polyampholyte salt as extremely efficient stabilisers of colloidal\ndispersions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iApGkm4BekgJEXt9--j9ABzFgm2ee3EQIIzQNnTg02U","pdfSize":"5317059"}
