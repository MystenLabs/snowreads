In the continuum case,\nfor a scalar equation, such media may exhibit so-called plasmonic resonances\nfor certain values of the (negative) conductivity in the metamaterial. This\nwork investigates such resonances, and the associated eigenfunctions, in the\ncase of composite conducting networks. Unlike the continuous media, we show a\nsurprising specific dependence on the geometry of the network of the resonant\nvalues. We also study how the problem is affected by the choice of boundary\nconditions on the external nodes of the structure.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CYZg4PrNa8aKe-f_GdTDcRnFNe40PKQ_ENPw1OcyzOk","pdfSize":"323938"}
