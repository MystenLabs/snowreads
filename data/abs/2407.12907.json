In the spectra of the kilonova AT2017gfo, a P Cygni line at about\n1$\\mu$m has been linked to Sr II, providing the first direct evidence of\nfreshly synthesised $r$-process material. An alternative explanation to Sr II\nwas proposed - He I $\\lambda 1083.3$nm under certain\nnon-local-thermodynamic-equilibrium (NLTE) conditions. A key way to robustly\ndiscriminate between these identifications, and indeed other proposed\nidentifications, is to analyse the temporal emergence and evolution of the\nfeature. In this analysis we trace the earliest appearance of the observed\nfeature and detail its spectro-temporal evolution, which we compare with a\ncollisional-radiative model of helium. We show that the 1$\\mu$m P Cygni line is\ninconsistent with a He I interpretation both in emergence time and in\nsubsequent spectral evolution. Self-consistent helium masses cannot reproduce\nthe observed feature, due to the diminishing strength of radiative pathways\nleaving triplet helium.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"u8rvhUMq6mXD4iTvkDPMrJbZRj1Ge6cCZ5rBGMz0h7U","pdfSize":"1010230"}
