In this work, we present an algorithm that automatically\nconstructs the optimal and exact tree tensor network operators (TTNO) for any\nsum-of-product symbolic quantum operator.The construction is based on the\nminimum vertex cover of a bipartite graph. With the optimal TTNO, we simulate\nopen quantum systems such as spin relaxation dynamics in the spin-boson model\nand charge transport in molecular junctions. In these simulations, the\nenvironment is treated as discrete modes and its wavefunction is evolved on\nequal footing with the system. We employ the Cole-Davidson spectral density to\nmodel the glassy phonon environment, and incorporate temperature effects via\nthermo field dynamics. Our results show that the computational cost scales\nlinearly with the number of discretized modes, demonstrating the efficiency of\nour approach.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9bvsEhmp9dSJRxdLaNi8PLbJrcSjEVrAm2Omf6HDNWI","pdfSize":"1838476"}
