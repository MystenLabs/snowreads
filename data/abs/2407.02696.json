Such a model incorporates a simulated linear\nhigh-frequency component that mirrors the growing characteristic frequency over\ntime observed in numerical simulations of core-collapse supernova gravitational\nwave signals. Unlike traditional numerical simulations, the method proposed in\nthis study requires minimal computational resources, which makes it\nparticularly advantageous for tasks such as data analysis, detection, and\nreconstruction of gravitational wave transients. To verify the physical\naccuracy of the generated signals, they are compared against the amplitude\nspectral of current LIGO interferometers and a 3D numerical simulation of a\ncore-collapse supernova gravitational wave signal from the Andresen et al. 2017\nmodel s15.nr. The results indicate that this approach is effective in\ngenerating scalable signals that align with LIGO interferometric data, offering\npotential utility in various gravitational wave transient investigations.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_MI4AyptyPRoNR7yDIogyBGOEbOvu_VmLIIeRIJz3T4","pdfSize":"3436998"}
