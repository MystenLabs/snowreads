The loop quantum black holes (LQBHs) are characterized by\nthree free parameters, one of which is the mass parameter, while the other two\nare purely due to quantum geometric effects. Among these two quantum\nparameters, one is completely fixed by black hole thermodynamics and its\neffects are negligible for macroscopic black holes, while the second parameter\nis completely free (in principle). In the studies of the QNMs of such LQBHs, we\npay particular attention to the difference of the QNMs between LQBHs and\nclassical ones, so that they can be observed for the current and forthcoming\ngravitational wave observations, whereby place the LQBH theory directly under\nthe test of observations.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Tq_jkC935Xe20MK0DuC2pSPUG0U0TaocPOlyB3Afuxw","pdfSize":"597498","objectId":"0x39b663ff9a6e6ee4ffad54ef731b8ef59ea937a39537713711d75ba9edf9d8c1","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
