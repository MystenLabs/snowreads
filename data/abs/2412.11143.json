  "abstract": "  IGR J17591--2342, a transient accretion-powered millisecond X-ray pulsar, was\ndiscovered during its 2018 outburst. Here, we present a timing and spectral\nanalysis of the source using {\\it AstroSat} data of the same outburst. From the\ntiming analysis, we obtain updated values of binary orbital parameters, which\nreveal an average pulsar spin frequency of 527.4256984(8) Hz. The pulse\nprofiles can be fit well with four harmonically related sinusoidal components\nwith fractional amplitudes of fundamental and second, third, and fourth\nharmonics as $\\sim13$\\%, $\\sim$6\\%, $\\sim$0.9\\%, $\\sim$0.2\\%, respectively. The\nenergy-dependent study of pulse profiles in the range of $3-20$ keV shows that\nthe fractional amplitude of both the fundamental and first overtone is\nconsistent with being constant across the considered energy band. Besides, a\ndecaying trend has been observed for both the fundamental and first overtone in\nthe phase-delay versus energy relation resulting in soft X-ray (2.8-3.3 keV)\nphase lags of $\\sim$0.05 and $\\sim$0.13 with respect to $\\leq 15$ keV photons,\nfor the fundamental and first overtone, respectively. The combined spectra from\nthe Large Area X-ray Proportional Counters and the Soft X-ray Telescope aboard\n{\\it AstroSat} in the $1-18$ keV range can be fit well with an absorbed model\nconsisting of a Comptonization, a blackbody and a Gaussian emission line\ncomponent yielding as best-fit parameters a blackbody seed photon temperature\n$kT_{\\rm bb}$ $\\sim 0.95 \\pm 0.03$ keV, and an electron temperature $kT_{\\rm\ne}$ $\\sim 1.54 \\pm0.03$ keV. The spectral aspects suggest the scattering of\nphotons from the accretion disc or the neutron star's surface.\n",
