Existing parameter estimation approaches in this setting are\ngenerally approximate. Recent work on using neural network models to\nreconstruct the mapping from the data space to the parameters from a set of\nsynthetic parameter-data pairs suffers from the curse of dimensionality,\nresulting in inaccurate estimation as the data size grows. We propose a\ndimension-reduced approach to likelihood-free estimation which combines the\nideas of reconstruction map estimation with dimension-reduction approaches\nbased on subject-specific knowledge. We examine the properties of\nreconstruction map estimation with and without dimension reduction and explore\nthe trade-off between approximation error due to information loss from reducing\nthe data dimension and approximation error. Numerical examples show that the\nproposed approach compares favorably with reconstruction map estimation,\napproximate Bayesian computation, and synthetic likelihood estimation.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Computation","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"H6oDVmDrtpmyd6D6rSh55aYfuCF1HlcmQpxZxYgZ-l4","pdfSize":"5210670"}
