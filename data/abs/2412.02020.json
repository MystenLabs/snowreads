However, many real-world systems involve multi-way interactions that\ncannot be fully captured by standard graphs. Hypergraphs, which generalize\ngraphs by allowing edges to connect any number of vertices, offer a more\nexpressive framework. In this paper, we introduce a new metric on the space of\nhypergraphs, inspired by the Gromov-Hausdorff distance for metric spaces. We\nestablish Lipschitz properties of common hypergraph transformations, which send\nhypergraphs to graphs, including a novel graphification method with ties to\nsingle linkage hierarchical clustering. Additionally, we derive lower bounds\nfor the hypergraph distance via invariants coming from basic summary statistics\nand from topological data analysis techniques. Finally, we explore stability\nproperties of cost functions in the context of optimal transport. Our results\nin this direction consider Lipschitzness of the Hausdorff map and conservation\nof the non-negative cross curvature property under limits of cost functions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"RYnguquabjV_MW7Jf2l1Zc0hbJzvLDHQYIGkmCaKtPc","pdfSize":"1207062"}
