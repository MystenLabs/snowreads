  "abstract": "  Student placements under diversity constraints are a common practice\nglobally. This paper addresses the selection of students by a single school\nunder a \\emph{one-to-one convention}, where students can belong to multiple\ntypes but are counted only once based on one type. While existing algorithms in\neconomics and computer science aim to help schools meet diversity goals and\npriorities, we demonstrate that these methods can result in significant\nimbalances among students with different type combinations.\n  To address this issue, we introduce a new property called \\emph{balanced\nrepresentation}, which ensures fair representation across all types and type\ncombinations. We propose a straightforward choice function that uniquely\nsatisfies four fundamental properties: maximal diversity, non-wastefulness,\njustified envy-freeness, and balanced representation. While previous research\nhas primarily focused on algorithms based on bipartite graphs, we take a\ndifferent approach by utilizing flow networks. This method provides a more\ncompact formalization of the problem and significantly improves computational\nefficiency. Additionally, we present efficient algorithms for implementing our\nchoice function within both the bipartite graph and flow network frameworks.\n",
