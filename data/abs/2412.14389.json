Motivated by this question and by\nanalogous results for the geodesic flow, we prove a number of results\nconcerning the asymptotic behavior of high energy $k$-surfaces, especially in\nrelation to the curvature of the ambient space.\n  First, we determine a rigid upper bound for the growth rate of quasi-Fuchsian\n$k$-surfaces, counted according to energy, and with asymptotically round limit\nset, subject to a lower bound on the sectional curvature of the ambient space.\nWe also study the marked energy spectrum for $k$-surfaces, proving a number of\ndomination and rigidity theorems in this context. Finally, we show that the\nmarked area and energy spectra for $k$-surfaces in $3$-dimensional manifolds of\nnegative curvature are asymptotic if and only if the sectional curvature is\nconstant.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TlBSuQbJeok0AuWWZtDdSoRfenigglZJMcl8khH1v-0","pdfSize":"371464"}
