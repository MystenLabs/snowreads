The Age of Information (AoI) emerges as a critical\nmetric in this context, representing the freshness of the information\ntransmitted across the network. This paper studies hybrid IoT networks that\nemploy Optical Communication (OC) as a reinforcement medium to Radio Frequency\n(RF). We formulate a non-linear convex optimization that adopts a\nmulti-objective optimization strategy to dynamically schedule the communication\nbetween devices and select their corresponding communication technology, aiming\nto balance the maximization of network throughput with the minimization of\nenergy usage and the frequency of switching between technologies. To mitigate\nthe impact of dominant sub-objectives and their scale disparity, the designed\napproach employs a regularization method that approximates adequate\nsub-objective scaling weights. Simulation results show that the OC\nsupplementary integration alongside RF enhances the network's overall\nperformances and significantly reduces the Mean AoI and Peak AoI, allowing the\ncollection of the freshest possible data using the best available communication\ntechnology.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computers and Society","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7HDunKYUre4AJvRsfhp1u2r1AxyX6ybfbcdHLlCZWE0","pdfSize":"793982"}
