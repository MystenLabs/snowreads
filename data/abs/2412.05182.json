  "abstract": "  An unsplittable multiflow routes the demand of each commodity along a single\npath from its source to its sink node. As our main result, we prove that in\nseries-parallel digraphs, any given multiflow can be expressed as a convex\ncombination of unsplittable multiflows, where the total flow on any arc\ndeviates from the given flow by less than the maximum demand of any commodity.\nThis result confirms a 25-year-old conjecture by Goemans for single-source\nunsplittable flows, as well as a stronger recent conjecture by Morell and\nSkutella, for series-parallel digraphs - even for general multiflow instances\nwhere commodities have distinct source and sink nodes. Previously, no\nnon-trivial class of digraphs was known for which either conjecture holds. En\nroute to proving this result, we also establish strong integrality results for\nmultiflows on series-parallel digraphs, showing that their computation can be\nreduced to a simple single-commodity network flow problem.\n",
