Stellarator optimization is traditionally performed as\na two-stage process; in the first stage, an optimal equilibrium is calculated\nwhich balances a set of competing constraints, and in the second stage a set of\ncoils is found that supports said equilibrium. Stage one is generally performed\nusing a representation for the equilibrium that assumes nestedness of flux\nsurfaces, even though this is not warranted and occasionally undesired. The\nsecond stage optimization of coils is never perfect, and the mismatch leads to\nworse performing equilibria, and further deteriorates if additional constraints\nsuch as force minimization, coil torsion or port access are included. The\nhigher fidelity of single-stage optimization is especially important for the\noptimization of islands as these are incredibly sensitive to changes in the\nfield. In this paper we demonstrate an optimization scheme capable of\noptimizing islands in finite $\\beta$ stellarator equilibria directly from\ncoils. We furthermore develop and demonstrate a method to reduce the\ndimensionality of the single-stage optimization problem to that of the first\nstage in the two-stage approach.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2JmSjiLBgGEXbvMGM_heihFL6HUCAgiXTSiCXePO7iw","pdfSize":"13948069"}
