Calibration is the\nprocess of identifying the parameters of these models, with a Bayesian\nframework providing a natural way in which to do this in a probabilistic\nfashion. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is one of a number of computational\ntools that is useful in carrying out this calibration. Objective: In the\ncontext of complex models in particular, a key problem that arises is one of\nnon-identifiability. In this setting, one approach which can be used is to\nconsider and ensure that appropriately informative priors are specified on the\njoint parameter space. We give examples of how this arises and may be addressed\nin practice. Methods: Using a basic SIS model the calibration process and the\nassociated challenge of non-identifiability is discussed. How this problem\narises in the context of a larger model for HPV and cervical cancer is also\nillustrated. Results: The conditions which allow the problem of\nnon-identifiability to be resolved are demonstrated for the SIS model. For the\nlarger HPV model, how this impacts on the calibration process is also\ndiscussed.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PSyAwnf4v7N8mMyYVFiZ---TBs_VE9y4qUpFiyTCNJM","pdfSize":"850094"}
