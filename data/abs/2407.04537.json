However, these\nrestrictions are not as strong as follows from Bohm mechanics. In particular,\nthe quantum formalism defines in the configuration space not one, but two\nfields of the particle momentum. Both fields satisfy the Heisenberg uncertainty\nrelations. And the key role here is played by the fact that one of the\ncontributions to the Bohm `potential' is actually a contribution to the field\ncharacterizing the kinetic energy of the particle.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"vj1J5rDmY1fuwdG7az-j993a5BHF22aGphqlVCG6YGA","pdfSize":"147605"}
