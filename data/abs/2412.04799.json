  "abstract": "  Understanding the effects of quarantine policies in populations with\nunderlying social networks is crucial for public health, yet most causal\ninference methods fail here due to their assumption of independent individuals.\nWe introduce DeepNetTMLE, a deep-learning-enhanced Targeted Maximum Likelihood\nEstimation (TMLE) method designed to estimate time-sensitive treatment effects\nin observational data. DeepNetTMLE mitigates bias from time-varying confounders\nunder general interference by incorporating a temporal module and domain\nadversarial training to build intervention-invariant representations. This\nprocess removes associations between current treatments and historical\nvariables, while the targeting step maintains the bias-variance trade-off,\nenhancing the reliability of counterfactual predictions. Using simulations of a\n``Susceptible-Infected-Recovered'' model with varied quarantine coverages, we\nshow that DeepNetTMLE achieves lower bias and more precise confidence intervals\nin counterfactual estimates, enabling optimal quarantine recommendations within\nbudget constraints, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.\n",
