Accurate reconstruction and identification of hadronically decaying\ntau leptons is a crucial task for current and future high energy physics\nexperiments. Given the advances in jet tagging, we demonstrate how tau lepton\nreconstruction can be decomposed into tau identification, kinematic\nreconstruction, and decay mode classification in a multi-task machine learning\nsetup.Based on an electron-positron collision dataset with full detector\nsimulation and reconstruction, we show that common jet tagging architectures\ncan be effectively used for these subtasks. We achieve comparable momentum\nresolutions of 2-3% with all the tested models, while the precision of\nreconstructing individual decay modes is between 80-95%. This paper also serves\nas an introduction to a new publicly available Fu{\\tau}ure dataset and provides\nrecipes for the development and training of tau reconstruction algorithms,\nwhile allowing to study resilience to domain shifts and the use of foundation\nmodels for such tasks.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"grfKekrLSSm1P8pfJBW7WAxoYYSWlbAp_ekPufsPkGc","pdfSize":"794668"}
