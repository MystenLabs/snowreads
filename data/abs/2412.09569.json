  "abstract": "  Given the rapid progress of generative AI, there is a pressing need to\nsystematically compare and choose between the numerous models and\nconfigurations available. The scale and versatility of such evaluations make\nthe use of LLM-based judges a compelling solution for this challenge.\nCrucially, this approach requires first to validate the quality of the LLM\njudge itself. Previous work has focused on instance-based assessment of LLM\njudges, where a judge is evaluated over a set of responses, or response pairs,\nwhile being agnostic to their source systems. We argue that this setting\noverlooks critical factors affecting system-level ranking, such as a judge's\npositive or negative bias towards certain systems. To address this gap, we\nconduct the first large-scale study of LLM judges as system rankers. System\nscores are generated by aggregating judgment scores over multiple system\noutputs, and the judge's quality is assessed by comparing the resulting system\nranking to a human-based ranking. Beyond overall judge assessment, our analysis\nprovides a fine-grained characterization of judge behavior, including their\ndecisiveness and bias.\n",
