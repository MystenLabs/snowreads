This requires developing some of the\nfundamental properties of Sobolev spaces and the energy method for\nquasiperiodic functions. We discuss prospects for global existence. We\ndemonstrate that while conservation laws still hold, these quantities no longer\ncontrol the associated Sobolev norms, thereby preventing the establishment of\nglobal results by usual arguments.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7KOeQirNMkA3qbfchL4GvBqoNoDT8eaZJRh6yhGASTs","pdfSize":"370386"}
