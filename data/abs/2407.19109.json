This paper\ninvestigates the entanglement of microwave-optical photon pairs generated from\nan electro-optomechanical system driven by a blue-detuned pulsed Gaussian pump.\nThe photon pairs are obtained through weak parametric-down-conversion, and\ntheir temporal correlation is revealed by the second-order correlation\nfunction. We then study the discrete variable entanglement encoded in the time\nbin degree of freedom, where entanglement is identified by Bell inequality\nviolation. Furthermore, we estimate the laser-induced heating and show that the\npulse-pumped system features lower heating effects while maintaining a\nreasonable coincidence photon counting rate.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EsJx7LZKlYhncoTgRzuCgH39AsPlLe_qPPsPDssyO34","pdfSize":"820843"}
