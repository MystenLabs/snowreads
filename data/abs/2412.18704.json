We give a finite axiomatization of this limit which\nspecifies it uniquely up to isomorphism among countable structures. We then\nshow that the aforementioned class of finite structures satisfies the Ramsey\nproperty and conclude, by the Kechris-Pestov-Todor\\v{c}evi\\'{c} correspondence,\nthat the automorphism group of its Fra\\\"iss\\'e limit is extremely amenable.\nFinally, we identify the universal minimal flow of the automorphism group of\nthe reduct $(D_n,<)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4C_56ztcppIBrJGy5h8U22qVWnaVJGfziGe8AlaI3Vs","pdfSize":"295531"}
