  "abstract": "  Traditional accelerators, while effective, suffer from extensive spatial and\nfinancial demands, necessitating the exploration of compact alternatives like\nPWFA, which significantly reduces the necessary accelerator length by utilizing\nthe wake generated by a high-speed pulse traveling through plasma. Our research\nfocuses on mitigating instabilities, particularly timing jitter, which\ncritically impacts the quality of accelerated beams. Through the deployment of\nImpact-T, Bmad, and Tao simulation tools at the FACET-II facility, we examined\nhow timing jitter influences key beam parameters, including peak currents and\nemittance, over various simulation scenarios. The findings reveal that even\nminute variations in accelerator settings can significantly influence beam\ncharacteristics, underscoring the importance of precise control in beam\ndynamics. The outcomes contribute to enhancing the reliability and precision of\nPWFA systems, promising improved applications in both scientific research and\nmedical therapies. Future research directions include integrating machine\nlearning techniques to refine control strategies further and reduce\nexperimental redundancies, highlighting the evolving synergy between\naccelerator physics and computational data science.\n",
