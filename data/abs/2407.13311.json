Even though they are trained on natural images, such encoder\nmodels have excelled in medical imaging, e.g., in classification, segmentation,\nand registration. However, no in-depth comparison of different state-of-the-art\ngeneral vision encoders for medical registration is available. In this work, we\ninvestigate how well general vision encoder features can be used in the\ndissimilarity metrics for medical image registration. We explore two encoders\nthat were trained on natural images as well as one that was fine-tuned on\nmedical data. We apply the features within the well-established B-spline FFD\nregistration framework. In extensive experiments on cardiac cine MRI data, we\nfind that using features as additional guidance for conventional metrics\nimproves the registration quality.
