  "abstract": "  We construct least squares formulations of PDEs with inhomogeneous essential\nboundary conditions, where boundary residuals are not measured in unpractical\nfractional Sobolev norms, but which formulations nevertheless are shown to\nyield a quasi-best approximations from the employed trial spaces. Dual norms do\nenter the least-squares functional, so that solving the least squares problem\namounts to solving a saddle point or minimax problem. For finite element\napplications we construct uniformly stable finite element pairs, whereas for\nMachine Learning applications we employ adversarial networks.\n",
