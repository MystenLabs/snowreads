The\nutilization of these rapid stages, particularly in high-repetition-rate\nsystems, is known to enable an effective reduction of noise content through\naveraging. However, caution must be exercised to optimize the data averaging\nprocess, with the goal of significantly optimizing the dynamic range (DR) and\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Here we discuss some pitfalls to avoid and the\neffect of improper data handling on the dynamic range obtainable. A free and\nopen-source program, called parrot (Processing All Rapidly & Reliably Obtained\nTHz-traces), is provided alongside this publication to overcome the discussed\npitfalls and facilitate the acceleration of experimental setups and data\nanalysis, thereby enhancing signal fidelity and reproducibility.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"09jbfQx_YTd7du2980SOrrzi07A-Bkes7DPlxbhKrbY","pdfSize":"871348"}
