This action has been studied extensively in type\n$A$ and described via Bender-Knuth involutions. We prove an analogous result\nfor the family of crystals $B(n\\varpi_1)$ in type $D$. Our main tools are\ncombinatorial toggles acting on reverse plane partitions of height $n$. As a\ncorollary, we show that the length one and two subdiagram elements generate the\nfull cactus action, addressing conjectures of Dranowski, the second author,\nKamnitzer, and Morton-Ferguson.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"t_MCXrJQ3kFzRhVF8_YPmb-je0a3KOL8N7cOUwozdaU","pdfSize":"217006"}
