This paper proposes a novel approach\nbased on Retentive Networks (RetNet) for b-jet tagging using low-level features\nof jet constituents along with high-level jet features. A simulated \\ttbar\ndataset provided by CERN CMS Open Data Portal was used, where only semileptonic\ndecays of \\ttbar pairs produced by 13 TeV proton-proton collisions are\nincluded. The performance of the newly proposed Retentive Network model is\ncompared with state-of-the-art models such as DeepJet and Particle Transformer,\nas well as with a baseline MLP (Multi-Layer-Perceptron) classifier. Despite\nusing a relatively smaller dataset, the Retentive Networks demonstrate a\npromising performance with only 330k trainable parameters. Results suggest that\nRetNet-based models can be used as an efficient alternative for b-jet with\nlimited computational resources.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RKPkicDVBIWD1KClHqOE03sj3bpPMeZCpQR1eTh3rTw","pdfSize":"1366749"}
