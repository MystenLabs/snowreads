The first detects\ninterdependence or the existence of coupling between time series. The second\nascertains directionality of coupling, or alternatively, latent coupling, the\ncase when multiple series are driven by another, unobserved system. In either\ncase, the driver and the recipients of the coupling may be periodic or\naperiodic, and in particular may be chaotic. The only inputs to the method are\ntwo or more simultaneously recorded time series. The methods rely solely on\nranking distances between states in time-delay reconstructions of the data, and\nfor that reason tend to be robust to observational noise.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"h054rnM7w8M1iPqQs-56WQdODMTJf3tbM4gySXTmAag","pdfSize":"921008"}
