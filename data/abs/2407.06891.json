We\npresent three complementary $r$ inference pipelines and compare their results\non a set of sky simulations that allow us to explore a number of Galactic\nforeground and instrumental noise models, relevant for SO. In most scenarios,\nthe pipelines retrieve consistent and unbiased results. However, several\ncomplex foreground scenarios lead to a $>2\\sigma$ bias on $r$ if analyzed with\nthe default versions of these pipelines, highlighting the need for more\nsophisticated pipeline components that marginalize over foreground residuals.\nWe present two such extensions, using power-spectrum-based and map-based\nmethods, and show that they fully reduce the bias on $r$ to sub-sigma level in\nall scenarios, and at a moderate cost in terms of $\\sigma(r)$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mhiTssPY5AOOwNB5VCadExOaHCjvJYSmLjmF9aND7W8","pdfSize":"313877"}
