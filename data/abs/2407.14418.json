In various countries, the\ninspection of road surfaces is still done manually, however, to automate it,\nresearch interest is now focused on detecting the road surface defects via the\nvisual data. While, previous research has been focused on deep learning methods\nwhich tend to process the entire image and leads to heavy computational cost.\nIn this study, we focus our attention on improving the classification\nperformance while keeping the computational cost of our solution low. Instead\nof processing the whole image, we introduce a segmentation model to only focus\nthe downstream classification model to the road surface in the image.\nFurthermore, we employ contrastive learning during model training to improve\nthe road surface condition classification. Our experiments on the public RTK\ndataset demonstrate a significant improvement in our proposed method when\ncompared to previous works.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"zosDE20SGN84aip9vfvvQS7aEIqXW9X_Ayk59j1bYZo","pdfSize":"650979","objectId":"0x65dbaa134efbb574d3f44eb06f6f63c0d9e1cfb5e9384fb265e87b1dc0454732","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
