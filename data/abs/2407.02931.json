First an\nextension of the MOOD methodology to nonconservative systems based on Taylor\nexpansions is presented. This extension combined with an in-cell discontinuous\nreconstruction operator are the key points to develop a new family of\nhigh-order methods that are able to capture exactly isolated shocks. Several\ntest cases are proposed to validate these methods for the Modified Shallow\nWater equations and the Two-Layer Shallow Water system.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9VE0gBHNVLPzjDUn-tryreYFc5CYsxZDIQ49GkrvHJM","pdfSize":"1231277","objectId":"0xea05212dc9ca54a8828d76ef6448fb97ddd5727af3f8804a5c14d1354bb74cdd","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
