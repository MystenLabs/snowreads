  "abstract": "  Despite their elegance and widespread use, the current Geometric Measures\n(GMs) of entanglement exhibit a significant limitation: they fail to\neffectively distinguish Local Unitary (LU) inequivalent states due to the\ninherent nature of their definition. We illustrate the impact of this\nlimitation using the fidelity of the teleportation protocol as an example. To\naddress this issue, we introduce the Sharp Geometric Measure (SGM) by modifying\nthe standard definition of the Geometric Measure. We show that the closed-form\nexpression of the SGM can be equivalently derived using the Riemannian\nstructure of both the composite state space and the reduced density operator\nspace. Furthermore, we define a measure of Genuine Multipartite Entanglement\n(GME) derived from the SGM, which we term GMS. We demonstrate that GMS resolves\ntwo key limitations of some existing GME measures, thereby establishing its\nutility and effectiveness in quantifying GME.\n",
