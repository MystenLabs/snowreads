We\ninclude an invariant theoretic approach to spectral covers in this setting for\nthe particular space $\\mathrm{GL}_{2n}/(\\mathrm{GL}_n\\times \\mathrm{GL}_n)$. We\nalso include a study of the regular centralizer group scheme for quasisplit\npairs, including a Galois description of a closely related group scheme. We\ncollect some basic consequences for Hitchin systems associated to such pairs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Jonk2EgTuy3mz9WoRePpkwGNvICRaV0hdMwns30_1XU","pdfSize":"598258"}
