We introduce lasso\nsemigroups as a generalisation of Wilke algebras that mirrors how lasso\nautomata generalise $\\Omega$-automata, and we show that finite lasso semigroups\ncharacterise regular lasso languages. We then show a dual adjunction between\nlasso automata and quotients of the free lasso semigroup with a recognising\nset, and as our main result we show that this dual adjunction restricts to one\nbetween $\\Omega$-automata and quotients of the free Wilke algebra with a\nrecognising set.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2o7Ys54c5LwyZ9RLykY0UMXeMAxeHbZ9VgQf0MJGQJQ","pdfSize":"367057","objectId":"0x0cf2cde59d02c7ad13746b86e23d40534c124fb9fe89daf6b0d1a786ada059f4","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
