In Goodwillie's homotopy\nfunctor calculus, being centered away from the null object amounts to doing\nhomotopy theory and functor calculus in the retractive setting.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9KsGVDVhcHNkBnB0zMh1NAGoqGfm4ug_gptlA9CzYb0","pdfSize":"294596","objectId":"0xa3c0fe0fb4eba5ea571b0a960b8f51a9b1f711d54c34eb64f1edf8c9c9ae9dd6","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
