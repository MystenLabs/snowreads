The use of such abundant raw materials confers a very low\nenergy-normalised cost to the Na-Zn system, but its operation requires them to\nbe entirely molten, and therefore to be operated at 600 {\\deg}C. To suppress\nthe self-discharge that results from this all-molten configuration, porous\nceramic diaphragms are used to partition the electrolyte and thereby impede the\nmovement of the Zn2+ ions responsible towards the Na electrode. Neutron images\nreveal large gas bubbles trapped beneath these diaphragms, formed during the\ncell fabrication process due to the large volume change that accompanies\nmelting/solidifying of the electrolyte. Cycling data confirm that these bubbles\ninterfere with cell operation by substantially increasing ohmic resistance.\nThey indicate the need for either a new diaphragm design, or a cell fabrication\nprocess that prevents their formation in the first instance.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PC40ppACwsgl_9ni4woWf2NBdwqtZCvOb4szUvDe5Ps","pdfSize":"24817004"}
