  "abstract": "  The recent announcement of evidence for a stochastic background of\ngravitational waves (GWB) in pulsar timing array (PTA) data has piqued interest\nacross the scientific community. A combined analysis of all currently available\ndata holds the promise of confirming the announced evidence as a solid\ndetection of a GWB. However, the complexity of individual pulsar noise models\nand the variety of modeling tools used for different types of pulsars present\nsignificant challenges for a truly unified analysis. In this work we propose a\nnovel approach to the analysis of PTA data: first a posterior distribution over\nFourier modes is produced for each pulsar individually. Then, in a global\nanalysis of all pulsars these posterior distributions can be re-used for a GWB\nsearch, which retains all information regarding the signals of interest without\nthe added complexity of the underlying noise models or implementation\ndifferences. This approach facilitates combining radio and gamma-ray pulsar\ndata, while reducing the complexity of the model and of its implementations\nwhen carrying out a GWB search with PTA data.\n",
