An intriguing property of these defects is that\nthey can be spin-active ($S\\geq 1$), even if weakly interacting. Employing\ndensity functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that two monomers\nof C-based defects of the same species can exhibit a stable triplet spin state\nat room temperature, even when they are separated $\\lesssim 1$ nm, if they\nreside in different layers. The zero-phonon line (ZPL) energy of C defects in\ndifferent layers lies within $1.6-2.2$ eV range. Also, we found defects that\ndeviate from the typical phonon replica patterns, potentially explaining the\nobserved phonon replicas in yellow emitters in hBN.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dyXzV5w8-xBw83xBE1suiL_KTvBRpiKfGqb1uWXMr3s","pdfSize":"9213080"}
