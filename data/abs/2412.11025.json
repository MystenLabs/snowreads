CapAgent automatically transforms\nuser-provided simple instructions into detailed, professional instructions,\nenabling precise and context-aware caption generation. By leveraging multimodal\nlarge language models (MLLMs) and external tools such as object detection tool\nand search engines, the system ensures that captions adhere to specified\nguidelines, including sentiment, keywords, focus, and formatting. CapAgent\ntransparently controls each step of the captioning process, and showcases its\nreasoning and tool usage at every step, fostering user trust and engagement.\nThe project code is available at https://github.com/xin-ran-w/CapAgent.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"ib8AGHv1B1okr4jodsGWVHCpApBWf3IHSoTT1Wj1Tss","pdfSize":"8308466"}
