  "abstract": "  Although advances in brain surgery techniques have led to fewer postoperative\ncomplications requiring Intensive Care Unit (ICU) monitoring, the routine\ntransfer of patients to the ICU remains the clinical standard, despite its high\ncost. Predictive Gradient Boosted Trees based on clinical data have attempted\nto optimize ICU admission by identifying key risk factors pre-operatively;\nhowever, these approaches overlook valuable imaging data that could enhance\nprediction accuracy. In this work, we show that multimodal approaches that\ncombine clinical data with imaging data outperform the current clinical data\nonly baseline from 0.29 [F1] to 0.30 [F1], when only pre-operative clinical\ndata is used and from 0.37 [F1] to 0.41 [F1], for pre- and post-operative data.\nThis study demonstrates that effective ICU admission prediction benefits from\nmultimodal data fusion, especially in contexts of severe class imbalance.\n",
