The\nresulting system of equations is highly challenging to solve. The na\\\"ive\nchoice of Newton's method frequently fails to converge, calling for more\nrefined solution techniques such as line search methods. When dealing with\nstrong nonlinearities and discontinuities, a global line search based on the\nmagnitude of the residual of all equations is at best costly to evaluate and at\nworst fails to converge. We therefore suggest a cheap and reliable approach\ntailored to the discontinuities. Utilising adaptive variable scaling, the\nalgorithm uses a line search to identify the transition between contact states.\nThen, a solution update weight is chosen to ensure that no fracture cells move\ntoo far beyond the transition. We demonstrate the algorithm on a series of test\ncases for poromechanics and thermoporomechanics in fractured porous media. We\nconsider both single- and multifracture cases and study the importance of\nproper scaling of variables and equations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"e7ZLvgkXrerGRuayLaq2gk-APSbAnoZZ384fohdRLiM","pdfSize":"801367","objectId":"0xcf51b1b445e45e6af8895f399ec8370b9edf5cae459cb5608775b827fdec0a56","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
