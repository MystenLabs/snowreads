  "abstract": "  We provide the first known upper bounds for the packing dimension of weighted\nsingular and weighted $\\omega$-singular matrices. We also prove upper bounds\nfor these sets when intersected with fractal subsets. The latter results, even\nin the unweighted setting, are already new for matrices. Further, even for row\nvectors, our results enlarge the class of fractals for which bounds are\ncurrently known. We use methods from homogeneous dynamics, in particular we\nprovide upper bounds for the packing dimension of points on the space of\nunimodular lattices, whose orbits under diagonal flows $p$-escape on average.\n",
