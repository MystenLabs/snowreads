To\naddress the wide range of potential education use cases for these systems, we\nreframe the challenge of injecting pedagogical behavior as one of\n\\textit{pedagogical instruction following}, where training and evaluation\nexamples include system-level instructions describing the specific pedagogy\nattributes present or desired in subsequent model turns. This framing avoids\ncommitting our models to any particular definition of pedagogy, and instead\nallows teachers or developers to specify desired model behavior. It also clears\na path to improving Gemini models for learning -- by enabling the addition of\nour pedagogical data to post-training mixtures -- alongside their rapidly\nexpanding set of capabilities. Both represent important changes from our\ninitial tech report. We show how training with pedagogical instruction\nfollowing produces a LearnLM model (available on Google AI Studio) that is\npreferred substantially by expert raters across a diverse set of learning\nscenarios, with average preference strengths of 31\\% over GPT-4o, 11\\% over\nClaude 3.5, and 13\\% over the Gemini 1.5 Pro model LearnLM was based on.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computers and Society","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"h2hmTzW1QS46DWfuuqqNhU9FzfOjB1GpPOji-h_hiQs","pdfSize":"4122298"}
