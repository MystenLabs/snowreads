This study aims to put observational\nconstraints on EoS parametrizations beyond the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model\nusing DESI BAO 2024 data, CMB anisotropy observations 2018, and various\nPantheon+, Union 3, and DES 5YR SNIa compilations. Our main goal is to check\nthe result of DESI collaborations \\cite{DESI:2024mwx} in the context of some\ngeneralizations of CPL approximation known as BA and Pade parametrizations. In\ngeneral, our research can reveal any potential biases in the CPL\nparametrization and determine the consistency of observational data with the\n$\\Lambda$CDM cosmology or alternative dark energy models. We find that in the\ngeneralizations of CPL parametrization, the deviation from $w_{\\Lambda}=-1$ is\nmore pronounced when we utilize the combinations of DESI BAO, CMB and various\nPantheon+, Union 3, and DES 5YR SNIa compilations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-SIHtu3xlJvra8XnjrMsgEsxYw7W-T1cjAsGjm5XRzM","pdfSize":"2373462"}
