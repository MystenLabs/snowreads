The diffuse-interface model is a variant of\nthe Zhou-Zhang-E model and has an Onsager gradient-flow structure with a\nrank-deficient mobility matrix reflecting the ODE character of stress\nrelaxation. In the case of constant coupling, we find that the evolution of the\nzero level set of the order parameter approximates the so-called intermediate\nsurface diffusion flow. For non-constant coupling functions monotonically\nconnecting the two phases, our asymptotic analysis leads to a family of third\norder whose propagation operator behaves like the square root of the minus\nLaplace-Beltrami operator at leading order. In this case, the normal velocity\nof the moving sharp interface arises as the Lagrange multiplier in a\nconstrained elliptic equation, which is at the core of our derivation. The\nconstrained elliptic problem can be solved rigorously by a variational\nargument, and is shown to encode the gradient structure of the effective\ngeometric evolution law. The asymptotics are presented for deep quench, an\nintermediate free boundary problem based on the double-obstacle potential.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7LCe7rDd9z0bY-gk8k_NcUVhPS73M9zMMDxS1sz3QgI","pdfSize":"751932"}
