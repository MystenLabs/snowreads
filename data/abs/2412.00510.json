  "abstract": "  The yields and ratios of light nuclei in heavy-ion collisions offer a method\nto distinguish between the thermal and coalescence models. Ratios such as $\\rm\nN_t \\times N_p/N_d^2$ and $\\rm N_{^3He} \\times N_p/N_d^2$ are suggested as\npotential probes to investigate critical phenomena within the QCD phase\ndiagram. The significantly larger datasets from STAR BES-II compared to BES-I,\ncombined with enhanced detector capabilities, allow for more precise\nmeasurements. In this proceeding, we present the centrality and energy\ndependence of transverse momentum spectra and particle yields of (anti-)proton,\n(anti-)deuteron, and $\\rm ^3He$ at BES-II energies ($\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = $7.7\n- 27$ GeV), as well as the light nuclei to proton yield ratios and coalescence\nparameters $(B_2(\\rm d)$ and $B_3(\\rm ^3He))$.\n",
