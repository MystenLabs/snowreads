It turns out that the point spectrum of both types\nof operators can be expressed in terms of the eigenvalues of the corresponding\nmatrices. For each $A\\in\\mathfrak{u}(d)$, it is known that the selfadjoint\noperator $H_A=-i d\\mu(A)$ has a quadratic Weyl symbol and we will give\nconditions on to guarantee that it has discrete spectrum. Under those\nconditions, using a known result in combinatorics, we show that the\nmultiplicity of the eigenvalues of $H_A$ is (up to some explicit translation\nand scalar multiplication) a quasi polynomial of degree $d-1$. Moreover, we\nshow that counting eigenvalues function behaves as an Ehrhart polynomial. Using\nthe latter result, we prove a Weyl's law for the operators $H_A$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bQ826isZLPXHx0dJnJ-2yWyhjB6czbZUxqz2ZHSlcNQ","pdfSize":"157261"}
