Using a constrained fermionic\nself-consistent mean-field method, we analyze the quantum spin liquid (QSL)\nground state for the extended Kitaev model with both the Zeeman term and the\nperturbative three-spin interaction term $\\kappa$. Our results demonstrate the\ndependence of the stability of the Kitaev QSL state on the field direction,\nconsistent with findings in the literature. Additionally, we calculate the\nphonon dynamics for acoustic phonons coupled to the Majorana fermion\nexcitations of the Kitaev spin liquid state, discussing the temperature and\nfield evolution of these quantities.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"b-zjsBhhYckHABrgZp5rJZlFMgN8S5q-4IQrzg5zlMA","pdfSize":"8290075","objectId":"0x0f686890f2c12699fef90d7c9fe42786eee31dbdebce380f9b37cdfbcec34fda","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
