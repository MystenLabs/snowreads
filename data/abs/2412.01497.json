  "abstract": "  Stabilizing nitrogen-rich compound crystals under conventional conditions is\na key issue in the development and application of high-energy density materials\n(HEDMs). Herein, a two-dimensional double-layer interlocked Li4(N5)2\nnitrogen-rich compound crystals, in which the two N5 rings are locked to by\nsharing four Li atoms, was found to maintain structural stability at zero\npressure conditions. Dynamics studies reliably confirm crystal stability below\n250 K. Furthermore, the stability of Li4(N5)2 crystal mainly arises from the\nionic interaction between Li atoms and N5 rings, formed by the charge transfer\nfrom Li atoms to N5 rings. This study highlights the feasibility of stabilizing\nnitrogen-rich compound crystals under conventional conditions, paving the way\nfor atomic level advancements in HEDMs.\n",
