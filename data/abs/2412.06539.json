These systems, comprising both main and harmonic rf cavities,\nrelax statistical collective effects but also introduce instabilities, such as\nRobinson and periodic transient beam loading (PTBL) instabilities. In this\npaper, we provide semi-analytical algorithms designed to predict and analyze\nthese instabilities with improved accuracy and robustness. The algorithms\nleverage recent advancements in the field, offering a computationally efficient\nand accurate complement to multibunch tracking simulations. Using the SOLEIL II\nproject as a case study, we demonstrate how these algorithms can optimize rf\ncavity parameters in high-dimensional parameter spaces, thereby maximizing the\nTouschek lifetime. An open-source Python package, ALBuMS (Algorithms for\nLongitudinal Multibunch Beam Stability), is provided as an accessible tool for\ndouble RF system stability analysis.\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OBXhEB5jxrsUohVAEULnzQwuPwHfPgbP-eXHCVJwqAk","pdfSize":"6216052"}
