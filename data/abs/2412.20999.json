  "abstract": "  We show that the category OS of operator spaces, with complete contractions\nas morphisms, is locally countably presentable. This result, together with its\nsymmetric monoidal closed structure with respect to the projective tensor\nproduct of operator spaces, implies the existence of cofree (cocommutative)\ncoalgebras with respect to the projective tensor product and therefore provides\na mathematical model of Intuitionistic Linear Logic in the sense of Lafont.\n",
