This\ntransformation enables various software applications to efficiently utilize\nreal-time transit data for purposes such as tracking, scheduling, and arrival\ntime prediction. Developed in Python, gps2gtfs employs techniques like\ngeo-buffer mapping, parallel processing, and data filtering to manage\nchallenges associated with raw GPS data, including high volume,\ndiscontinuities, and localization errors. This open-source package, available\non GitHub and PyPI, enhances the development of intelligent transportation\nsolutions and fosters improved public transit systems globally.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computers and Society","Computer Science/Mathematical Software"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hYwwTFgN1tuutI-5F5YosBqKSYwTMwcLzabZYy93zIM","pdfSize":"938600"}
