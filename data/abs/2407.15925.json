As an application, we focus on the low-energy expansions of type I\nand II superstring amplitudes. Besides providing new results for their leading\nand sub-leading logarithmic contributions beyond genus one, our approach\nelucidates the general structure of non-analytic threshold terms. In the case\nof open strings, the use of orthogonal colour projectors allows us to\nefficiently compute all contributions from different worldsheet topologies at a\ngiven loop order.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"u8oK_CB8QfnwAnufdsshtBqg7WPdVTBGnm8_0ZBsxM4","pdfSize":"699260","objectId":"0xf6ddfb6c836515b6e1b3984b59a04beebaf013ddcfccf52ad4d514fa9677c4df","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
