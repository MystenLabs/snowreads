However, there is currently\nno systematic comparison of different normalizing flow architectures for MCMC.\nAs such, many works choose simple flow architectures that are readily available\nand do not consider other models. Guidelines for choosing an appropriate\narchitecture would reduce analysis time for practitioners and motivate\nresearchers to take the recommended models as foundations to be improved. We\nprovide the first such guideline by extensively evaluating many normalizing\nflow architectures on various flow-based MCMC methods and target distributions.\nWhen the target density gradient is available, we show that flow-based MCMC\noutperforms classic MCMC for suitable NF architecture choices with minor\nhyperparameter tuning. When the gradient is unavailable, flow-based MCMC wins\nwith off-the-shelf architectures. We find contractive residual flows to be the\nbest general-purpose models with relatively low sensitivity to hyperparameter\nchoice. We also provide various insights into normalizing flow behavior within\nMCMC when varying their hyperparameters, properties of target distributions,\nand the overall computational budget.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Statistics/Computation","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gUZxPts9B2WFFgJUUAlbQk-3K6Zm7kePJgSod8sXDNw","pdfSize":"753623"}
