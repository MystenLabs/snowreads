In many of these systems, the lubricant\nexhibits viscoelastic properties, which modify the associated lubrication\nforces. Here, we experimentally study viscoelastic lubrication by considering\nthe motion of a submerged cylinder sliding down an incline. We demonstrate that\ncylinders move faster when released in a viscoelastic Boger liquid compared to\na Newtonian liquid with similar viscosity. Cylinders exhibit pure sliding\nmotion in viscoelastic liquids, in contrast to the stick-slip motion observed\nin Newtonian liquids. We rationalize our results by using the second-order\nfluid model, which predicts a lift force on the cylinder arising from the\nnormal-stress differences provided by the dissolved polymers. The interplay\nbetween viscoelastic lift, viscous friction, and gravity leads to a prediction\nfor the sliding speed, which is consistent with our experimental results for\nweakly viscoelastic flows. Finally, we identify a remarkable difference between\nthe lubrication of cylindrical and spherical contacts, as the latter does not\nexhibit any lift for weak viscoelasticity.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xqyC_ZXERpAE-HbZYG1j5MDUfGm1OihYAhfcFtxcQG8","pdfSize":"15896284"}
