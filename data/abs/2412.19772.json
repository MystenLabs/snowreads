  "abstract": "  The arrow of time can be quantified through the Kullback-Leibler divergence\n($D_{KL}$) between the distributions of forward and reverse trajectories in a\nsystem. Many approaches to estimate this rely on specific models, but the use\nof incorrect models can introduce uncontrolled errors. Here, we describe a\nmodel-free method that uses trajectory data directly to estimate the evidence\nfor irreversibility over finite windows of time. To do this we build on\nprevious work to identify and correct for errors that arise from limited sample\nsize. Importantly, our approach accurately recovers $D_{KL} = 0$ in systems\nthat adhere to detailed balance, and the correct nonzero $D_{KL}$ for data\ngenerated by well understood models of nonequilibrium systems. We apply our\nmethod to trajectories of neural activity in the retina as it responds to\nnaturalistic inputs, and find evidence of irreversibility in single neurons,\nemphasizing the non-Markovian character of these data. These results open new\navenues for investigating how the brain represents the arrow of time.\n",
