We describe a route to construct\ntopological quantum memory elements, dubbed Cheshire qudits, formed from\npunching holes in such a FQSH state and using proximity-induced\nsuperconductivity to gap out the resulting helical edge states. Cheshire qudits\nencode quantum information in states that differ by a fractional topological\n\"Cheshire\" charge that is hidden from local detection within a condensate\nanyons. Control of inter-edge tunneling by gates enables both\nsupercurrent-based readout of a Cheshire qudit, and capacitive measurement of\nthe thermal entropy associated with its topological ground-space degeneracy.\nAdditionally, we systematically classify different types of gapped boundaries,\nCheshire qudits, and parafermionic twist defects for various Abelian and\nnon-Abelian candidate FQSH orders that are consistent with the transport data,\nand describe experimental signatures to distinguish these orders.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"G2b1Ot14awVVg6OirN1uL1LuJLKS69jNzVXSlRYXWa4","pdfSize":"3492884"}
