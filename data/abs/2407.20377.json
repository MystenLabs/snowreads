The\nstudy utilizes a comprehensive dataset of news articles in Portuguese related\nto Petrobras, a major oil company in Brazil, collected from 2022 and 2023. The\ndata is filtered and classified for ESG-related sentiments using advanced NLP\nmethods. The Rasch model is then applied to evaluate the psychometric\nproperties of these ESG measures, providing a nuanced assessment of ESG\nsentiment trends over time. The results demonstrate the efficacy of this\nmethodology in offering a more precise and reliable measurement of ESG factors,\nhighlighting significant periods and trends. This approach may enhance the\nrobustness of ESG metrics and contribute to the broader field of sustainability\nand finance by offering a deeper understanding of the temporal dynamics in ESG\nreporting.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Quantitative Finance/General Finance","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"95U-GGkLhgvOzcv_NcA2WpCvdXlJoK96sBgE1K_sVFM","pdfSize":"470164"}
