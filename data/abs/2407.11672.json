We review a\nbroad range of quantum algorithms, from hybrid quantum-classical to fully\nquantum, focusing on the traditional Monte Carlo family, including Markov chain\nMonte Carlo, variational Monte Carlo, projector Monte Carlo, path integral\nMonte Carlo, etc. We also cover other relevant techniques involving complex\nsampling tasks, such as quantum-selected configuration interaction, minimally\nentangled typical thermal states, entanglement forging, and Monte\nCarlo-flavored Lindbladian dynamics. We provide a comprehensive overview of\nthese algorithms' classical and quantum counterparts, detailing their\ntheoretical frameworks and discussing the potentials and challenges in\nachieving quantum computational advantages.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"erbh6rat6n0YkdYQG_exwjjLwBeQqZGfJfGMaaQmN9U","pdfSize":"8312420"}
