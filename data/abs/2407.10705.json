Observations of morphologies of several such halos indicate that\nparticles diffuse very slowly around pulsars, compared with that in the Milky\nWay halo. The energy-dependent morphologies are expected to be very important\nin studying the energy-dependence of the diffusion coefficient. In this work we\npoint out that the spectrum of high-energy electrons takes effect in shaping\nthe $\\gamma$-ray morphologies at the ultra-high-energy bands, and thus results\nin a degeneracy between the electron spectrum and the energy-dependence of the\ndiffusion coefficient. The reasons for such a degeneracy include both the\nKlein-Nishina effect of the inverse Compton scattering and the curvature (if\nany) of the electron spectrum. It it thus necessary to take into account the\nspectral shape of electrons when deriving the energy-dependence of diffusion\ncoefficient using ultra-high-energy $\\gamma$-ray measurements of extended\npulsar halos.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0dQ9a9ZtUH2nwj0UR2PERk3Pc7pyuvWgIWk_ospl62o","pdfSize":"214202"}
