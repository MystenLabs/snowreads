We find a significant spin-liquid region\nextending from the Heisenberg limit and residing between the Y phase-known as\nthe magnetic analogue of the \"supersolid\"-and collinear stripe phase. The order\nparameters of the supersolid are analyzed and an understanding of its lack of\nferromagnetic moment is suggested.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZEVbiRQx5xUIVQ_w2Ek5ALsc8_zrhp_hbfQ5mB2bWpQ","pdfSize":"5171012"}
