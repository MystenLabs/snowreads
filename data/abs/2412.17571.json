Our approach leverages SNNs' intrinsic temporal dynamics\nand Transformers' robust attention mechanisms to enhance performance when\ndiscerning intricate particle interactions. At the heart of HPCNeuroNet lies\nthe integration of the sequential dynamism inherent in SNNs with the\ncontext-aware attention capabilities of Transformers, enabling the model to\nprecisely decode and interpret complex detector data. HPCNeuroNet is realized\nthrough the HLS4ML framework and optimized for deployment in FPGA environments.\nThe model accuracy and scalability are also enhanced by this architectural\nchoice. Benchmarked against machine learning models, HPCNeuroNet showcases\nbetter performance metrics, underlining its transformative potential in\nhigh-energy physics. We demonstrate that the combination of SNNs, Transformers,\nand FPGA-based high-performance computing in particle physics signifies a\nsignificant step forward and provides a strong foundation for future research.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Hardware Architecture","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"vaQ8ykaAYJUT5xBuw1s3_ayh58XtYx49B9H2weoZF8A","pdfSize":"1615623"}
