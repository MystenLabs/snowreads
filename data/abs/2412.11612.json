  "abstract": "  New types of high-resolution animal movement data allow for increasingly\ncomprehensive biological inference, but method development to meet the\nstatistical challenges associated with such data is lagging behind. In this\ncontribution, we extend the commonly applied hidden Markov models for step\nlengths and turning angles to address the specific requirements posed by\nhigh-resolution movement data, in particular the very strong within-state\ncorrelation induced by the momentum in the movement. The models feature\nautoregressive components of general order in both the step length and the\nturning angle variable, with the possibility to automate the selection of the\nautoregressive degree using a lasso approach. In a simulation study, we\nidentify potential for improved inference when using the new model instead of\nthe commonly applied basic hidden Markov model in cases where there is strong\nwithin-state autocorrelation. The practical use of the model is illustrated\nusing high-resolution movement tracks of terns foraging near an anthropogenic\nstructure causing turbulent water flow features.\n",
