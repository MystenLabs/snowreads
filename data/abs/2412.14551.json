This is a vital factor in performing\nhierarchical Bayesian inference for studying the population properties of\nmerging compact binaries observed with gravitational waves. In previous\nanalyses, this was evaluated numerically using kernel density estimation (KDE).\nHowever, we find that this numerical approach is inaccurate in certain\nparameter regions, where both $|\\chi_\\mathrm{eff}|$ and $\\chi_\\mathrm{p}$ are\nsmall. Our analytical approach provides accurate computations of the joint\nprior across the entire parameter space and enables more reliable population\ninference. Employing our analytic prior, we reanalyze binary black holes in the\nGravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 3 (GWTC-3) by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA\ncollaboration. While the results are largely unchanged, log-likelihood errors\ndue to the use of the inaccurate prior evaluations are $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. Since\nthese errors accumulate with the increasing number of events, our analytical\nprior will be crucial in the future analyses.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"FO8soIc33hlK3Prht-2g3VFGqnH5yXE_o3TCtKddb_w","pdfSize":"993358"}
