We get the essential\ndefinitions and criteria for a quaternionic power series convergence, adapting\ncomplex analogues to the quaternion case. It is established that the power\nseries expansions of any holomorphic function in C- and H-representations are\nsimilar and converge with identical convergence radiuses. We define a\nH-analytic function and prove that every H-holomorphic function is H-analytic.\nSome examples of power series expansions are given.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nVesC-g9Y1tY8smOUGWLgHEBya8hG34bMuHtSEqvfqQ","pdfSize":"303518"}
