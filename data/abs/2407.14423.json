We prove the convergence of the iteration scheme for a linear\nKlein-Gorden equation with a variable coefficient whose unique solution is\nknown. The iteration scheme depends on a {\\em Lagrange multiplier},\n$\\lambda(r,s)$, which is represented as a power series. We show that the VIM\niteration scheme converges uniformly on compact intervals to the unique\nsolution. We also prove convergence when $\\lambda(r,s)$ is replaced by any of\nits partial sums. The first proof follows a familiar pattern, but the second\nrequires a new approach. The second approach also provides some detail\nregarding the structure of the iterates.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JcOAEhOiP6H8JeJaTS2FFC82D41uiDLH-zoQQKkUpTY","pdfSize":"170643"}
