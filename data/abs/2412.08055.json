Here we present results from\n20-hour pulsar searching observations in seven open clusters with the\nFive-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Our first\ndiscovery is a 1.9-second pulsar (J1922+37) found in the direction of the old\nopen cluster NGC 6791. The measured dispersion measure (DM) implies a distance\nof 4.79 kpc and 8.92 kpc based on the NE2001 and YMW16 electron density models,\nrespectively. Given the large uncertainty of DM distance estimates, it is\nlikely that PSR J1922+37 is indeed a member of NGC 6791, for which the distance\nis $4.19\\pm0.02$ kpc based on Gaia Data Release 3. If confirmed, PSR J1922+37\nwill be the first pulsar found in Galactic open clusters. We outline future\nobservations that can confirm this pulsar-open cluster association and discuss\nthe general prospects of finding pulsars in open clusters.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"M7wQzTNepdOUq7KxlRZjbNgbYjAbBNw1fwEHNe01jss","pdfSize":"645397"}
