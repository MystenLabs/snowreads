We review suggested previous detections\n(e.g. China, Hipparchos). We analyze all Mira records from Fabricius in their\nhistorical context. Fabricius measured the separation of Mira to other stars to\n\\pm 1.6-1.7'. From his texts, we derive a brightness (slightly brighter than\nHamal) of ca. 1.9 \\pm 0.1 mag and a color index B-V \\simeq 1.3-1.4 mag (`like\nMars') for 1596 Aug 3 (jul.). Mira started to fainten 19 days later and was\nobserved until mid/late Oct. We show why such a red star cannot be followed by\nthe naked eye until ca. 6 mag: For Mira's color at disappearance and altitude\nfrom Frisia, the limit is reduced by ca. 1.0 mag. Since Fabricius connected the\nMira brightening with the close-by prograde Jupiter, he re-detected it only 12\nyears later, probably shortly before a relatively bright maximum - discoveries\nare strongly affected by biases. A Mira period of 330.2 days is consistent with\nboth the oldest data (from Fabricius 1596 to Hevelius 1660) and the most\ncurrent data (VSX 2004-2023), so that we see no evidence for secular period or\nphase shifts. (We also present Fabricius' observations of P Cygni in 1602.)\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2cPFe0K9VlKy44JttB2dhDRg0KTqIW_XVOuv74gizlw","pdfSize":"1066452"}
