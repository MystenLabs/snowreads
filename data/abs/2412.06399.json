Recently it was completely resolved by\nZhai and Lin [J. Comb. Theory, Ser. B 157 (2022) 184-215], which also confirms\na conjecture proposed by Tait [J. Comb. Theory, Ser. A 166 (2019) 42-58]. Here,\nthe prior work is fully stated, and then generalized with a self-contained\nproof. The more complete result is then used to better understand the\nrelationship between the $A_{\\alpha}$-spectral radius and the structure of the\ncorresponding extremal $K_{a,b}$-minor free graph.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"1b0N_8T2aqAcWXfHUYabtyWzhw4FHZwsp27kWikPQcM","pdfSize":"391713"}
