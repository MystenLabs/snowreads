Terahertz\ntechnology has been used for industrial quality control, security imaging, and\nhigh-speed communications, and often generated through optoelectronic solutions\nby using photoconductive antennas. In this paper, Multiphysics simulations on\nsemi insulating GaAs, grapheneenhanced photoconductive antennas are conducted\nto effectively decouple optical responses of semiconductor carrier\ngeneration/drift from Terahertz radiation computation, which provides a\ncomprehensive and integrated platform for future terahertz photoconductive\nantenna designs\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Wx08eULFZk79_ED1qQ85y5YFn3tyXhtgi_-8Coecfro","pdfSize":"475672"}
