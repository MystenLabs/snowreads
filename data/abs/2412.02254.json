  "abstract": "  Current Human Pose Estimation methods have achieved significant improvements.\nHowever, state-of-the-art models ignore out-of-image keypoints and use\nuncalibrated heatmaps as keypoint location representations. To address these\nlimitations, we propose ProbPose, which predicts for each keypoint: a\ncalibrated probability of keypoint presence at each location in the activation\nwindow, the probability of being outside of it, and its predicted visibility.\nTo address the lack of evaluation protocols for out-of-image keypoints, we\nintroduce the CropCOCO dataset and the Extended OKS (Ex-OKS) metric, which\nextends OKS to out-of-image points. Tested on COCO, CropCOCO, and OCHuman,\nProbPose shows significant gains in out-of-image keypoint localization while\nalso improving in-image localization through data augmentation. Additionally,\nthe model improves robustness along the edges of the bounding box and offers\nbetter flexibility in keypoint evaluation. The code and models are available on\nhttps://mirapurkrabek.github.io/ProbPose/ for research purposes.\n",
