{"id":"2407.01581","title":"The Cosmic Timeline Implied by the JWST Reionization Crisis","authors":"Fulvio Melia","authorsParsed":[["Melia","Fulvio",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2024 03:19:11 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-03","timestamp":1718162351000,"abstract":"  JWST's discovery of well-formed galaxies and supermassive black holes only a\nfew hundred Myr after the big bang, and the identification of polycyclic\naromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at $z=6.71$, seriously challenge the timeline\npredicted by $\\Lambda$CDM. Now, a recent analysis of reionization after JWST by\nMunoz et al. (2024) has concluded that the $\\Lambda$CDM timeline simply cannot\naccommodate the combined JWST-Planck observations even if exotic fixes are\nintroduced to modify the standard reionization model. In this paper, we argue\nthat this so-called `photon budget crisis' is more likely due to flaws in the\ncosmological model itself. We employ the standard reionization model using the\nJWST-measured UV luminosity function in the early Universe and the timeline and\nphysical conditions in both $\\Lambda$CDM and $R_{\\rm h}=ct$. We then contrast\nthe predicted reionization histories in these two scenarios and compare them\nwith the data. We confirm that the reionization history predicted by\n$\\Lambda$CDM is in significant tension with the observations, and demonstrate\nthat the latter are instead in excellent agreement with the $R_{\\rm h}=ct$\ntimeline. Together, the four anomalies uncovered by JWST provide strong\nevidence against the timeline predicted by $\\Lambda$CDM and in favor of the\nevolutionary history in $R_{\\rm h}=ct$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3zlaz2lpo4_aB3NObH5G9lTHVNIXsziLwioyJtTq8HU","pdfSize":"181548","objectId":"0xef47d01c9fb33724f97f0ed16db750eff189921a92856ccdf2f3c51cf56f2d67","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
