  "abstract": "  In this analysis, we investigate the angular distribution of low-mass dimuon\npairs produced in simulated electron-positron collisions at the proposed\nInternational Linear Collider (ILC), which operates at a center of mass energy\nof 500 GeV and an integrated luminosity of 1000 fb\\(^{-1}\\). We focus on the\ncos\\(\\theta_{\\text{CS}}\\) variable, defined in the Collins-Soper frame. In the\nStandard Model, the production of low-mass dimuon pairs is primarily driven by\nthe Drell-Yan process, which exhibits a pronounced forward-backward asymmetry.\nHowever, many scenarios beyond the Standard Model predict different shapes for\nthe cos\\(\\theta_{\\text{CS}}\\) distribution. This angular distribution can be\ninstrumental in distinguishing between these models in the event of excess\nobservations beyond the Standard Model. We have used the mono-Z\\(^{\\prime}\\)\nmodel to interpret the simulated data for our analysis. In the absence of any\ndiscoveries of new physics, we establish upper limits at the 95\\% confidence\nlevel on the masses of various particles in the model, including the spin-1\n\\(Z^{\\prime}\\) boson, as well as fermionic dark matter.\n",
