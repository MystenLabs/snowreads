Our experiment examines how easy it is to locate an\noblique line among vertical distractors versus a vertical line among oblique\ndistractors, a framework previously validated by Treisman & Gormican (1988) [4]\nand Gupta et al. (2015) [1]. We hypothesised that an oblique target among\nvertical lines would produce a perceptual 'pop-out' effect, allowing for\nfaster, parallel search, while the reverse condition would require serial\nsearch strategy. Seventy-eight participants from Utrecht University engaged in\ntrials with varied target-distractor orientations and number of items. We\nmeasured reaction times and found a significant effect of target type on search\nspeed: oblique targets were identified more quickly, reflecting 'pop-out'\nbehaviour, while vertical targets demanded focused attention ('glue phase').\nOur results align with past findings, supporting our hypothesis on search\nasymmetry and its dependency on distinct visual features. Future research could\nbenefit from eye-tracking and neural network analysis, particularly for\nidentifying the neural processing of visual features in both parallel and\nserial search conditions.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oraXeJ30FYaaW8z0dQHVVV1Ldf3MS7S7kdRiPW_VIXI","pdfSize":"1451928"}
