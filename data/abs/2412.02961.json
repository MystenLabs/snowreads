Specifically, given a set $\\Gamma \\subseteq\n\\mathbb{R}^n$ of $k$-dimensional semi-Pfaffian sets, where each $\\gamma \\in\n\\Gamma$ is defined by a fixed number of Pfaffian functions, and each Pfaffian\nfunction is in turn defined with respect to a Pfaffian chain $\\vec{q}$ of\nlength $r$, for any $D \\ge 1$, we prove the existence of a polynomial $P \\in\n\\mathbb{R}[X_1, \\ldots, X_n]$ of degree at most $D$ such that each connected\ncomponent of $\\mathbb{R}^n \\setminus Z(P)$ intersects at most $\\sim\n\\frac{|\\Gamma|}{D^{n - k - r}}$ elements of $\\Gamma$. Also, under some mild\nconditions on $\\vec{q}$, for any $D \\ge 1$, we prove the existence of a\nPfaffian function $P'$ of degree at most $D$ defined with respect to $\\vec{q}$,\nsuch that each connected component of $\\mathbb{R}^n \\setminus Z(P')$ intersects\nat most $\\sim \\frac{|\\Gamma|}{D^{n-k}}$ elements of $\\Gamma$. To do so, given a\n$k$-dimensional semi-Pfaffian set $\\mathcal{X} \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^n$, and a\npolynomial $P \\in \\mathbb{R}[X_1, \\ldots, X_n]$ of degree at most $D$, we\nestablish a uniform bound on the number of connected components of\n$\\mathbb{R}^n \\setminus Z(P)$ that $\\mathcal{X}$ intersects; that is, we prove\nthat the number of connected components of $(\\mathbb{R}^n \\setminus Z(P)) \\cap\n\\mathcal{X}$ is at most $\\sim D^{k+r}$. Finally as applications, we derive\nPfaffian versions of Szemer\\'edi-Trotter type theorems, and also prove bounds\non the number of joints between Pfaffian curves.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Jq9Tli38ZNJjhzELO4G8dQtnQC__HG4Shn1MPKHOvkE","pdfSize":"409132"}
