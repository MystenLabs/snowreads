Although gold typically exhibits a face-centered cubic (fcc)\nlattice, other phases have been reported in some nanoscale systems. We show\nthat the crystallographic system and the lattice parameters of the gold unit\ncell strongly depend on the nanoparticle geometry, for a wide size range.\nSpecifically, we show that decahedra exhibit a body-centered tetragonal\nstructure (I4/mmm), whereas rods and bipyramids exhibit a body-centered\northorhombic structure (Immm). These changes in the crystallographic structure\nare explained by the elastic lattice distortions required to close the mismatch\ngap in penta-twinned nanoparticles, with respect to fcc single-crystal gold\nnanoparticles. The effects of nanoparticle shape and size on the surface\npressure and the subsequent distortions are additionally discussed.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"32a5RLkRvhd6tLg2YKWiiMhSH7EOM0jBtsq6fggfg3A","pdfSize":"1441827"}
