We show that if the scalar curvature is\nless than the soliton constant by an arbitrarily small positive amount, then\nthe soliton is trivial. Additionally, we show that if the scalar curvature is\ngreater than the soliton constant by an arbitrarily small positive amount, then\nthe soliton is rotationally symmetric. Furthermore, we completely classify\nnontrivial complete expanding gradient Yamabe solitons in both cases: when the\nscalar curvature is greater than the soliton constant and when it is less than\nthe soliton constant.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"dJqctvEBErQs0_6SlenlS0cIBBDuO76lUvaS_lWg4to","pdfSize":"125137"}
