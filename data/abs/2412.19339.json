These\nresults are significant generalizations of some earlier findings, especially\nthose of Haldar and Ahamed (Entire solutions of several quadratic binomial and\ntrinomial partial differential-difference equations in $\\mathbb{C}^2$, Anal.\nMath.

To support our results, we have included several examples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oaadOGwGORqqWUcmnVlV8O0U4NB34RULHFLi7M5upy0","pdfSize":"339074"}
