Detailed proofs of the\nmachine-generated results are also provided. The dataset includes information\non 49 CW spectra, 180 maps, and 61 cofiber sequences. Leveraging these results,\nand with the addition of some ad hoc arguments derived through human insight,\nwe successfully resolved the Last Kervaire Invariant Problem in dimension 126.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RuFFbn6rcX7MdCgHD3IJekQNEb5Uc70z4Kqfz0bBRYM","pdfSize":"606414"}
