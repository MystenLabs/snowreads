Upon sacrificing hermiticity by adding non-reciprocal hopping, the\nnon-Hermitian skin effect competes with localization. We find another route for\ndelocalization, which involves imaginary potential disorder. While an entirely\nrandom potential generally still leads to localization, imposing minimal\nspatial structure to the disorder can protect delocalization: it endows the\nconcomitant transfer matrix with an SU(2) structure, whose compactness in turn\ntranslates into an infinite localization length. The fraction of delocalized\nstates can be tuned by the choice of boundary conditions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Oj79ggbbVk_hS_METzkVRyxZzy6ruTqE1xHkybYtm3M","pdfSize":"2360373"}
