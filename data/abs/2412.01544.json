There are several\nreasons why a mathematical analysis of this numerical scheme is important. A\ngeneralization of the present result to the case of flat axially symmetric\nsolutions would prove that the steady states obtained numerically in \\cite{AR3}\ndo exist. Moreover, in the relativistic case the question whether a steady\nstate can be obtained by this scheme seems to be related to its dynamical\nstability. This motivates the desire for a deeper understanding of this\nstrategy.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KKkOqCXIo44kdfVkC-y4AO2ixzS2kv5J0c9KI77-Yxs","pdfSize":"122058"}
