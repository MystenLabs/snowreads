  "abstract": "  We investigate quantum error correction protocols for neutral atoms quantum\nprocessors in the presence of atom loss. We complement the surface code with\nloss detection units (LDU) and analyze its performances by means of\ncircuit-level simulations for two distinct protocols -- the standard LDU and a\nrecently proposed teleportation-based LDU --, focussing on the impact of both\natom loss and depolarizing noise on the logical error probability. We introduce\nand employ a new adaptive decoding procedure that leverages the knowledge of\nloss locations provided by the LDUs, improving logical error probabilities by\nnearly three orders of magnitude compared to a naive decoder. For the\nconsidered error models, our results demonstrate the existence of an error\nthreshold line that depends linearly on the probabilities of atom loss and of\ndepolarizing errors. For zero depolarizing noise, the atom loss threshold is\nabout $2.6\\%$.\n",
