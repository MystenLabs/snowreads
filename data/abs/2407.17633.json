The work herein combines PI and CA in a deliberate and novel\nmanner to pair students together for a PI session in which they collaborate on\na CA task. The data used to inform the pairing method is restricted to the most\nprevious CA task students completed independently. The motivation for this\ndata-driven collaborative learning is to improve student learning,\ncommunication, and engagement. Quantitative results from an investigation of\nthe method show improved assessment scores on the PI CA tasks, although\nevidence of a positive effect on subsequent individual CA tasks was not\nstatistically significant as anticipated. However, student perceptions were\npositive, engagement was high, and students interacted with a broader set of\npeers than is typical. These qualitative observations, together with extant\nresearch on the general benefits of improving student engagement and\ncommunication (e.g. improved sense of belonging, increased social capital,\netc.), render the method worthy for further research into building and\nevaluating small student learning communities using student assessment data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"JWp8IZDVNT06zB-7QaA923va6VwgS8-vp9L1ILac0H8","pdfSize":"1135718"}
