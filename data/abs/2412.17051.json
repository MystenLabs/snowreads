The main idea is to transform iterated integrals\nencoded by decorated trees into words via an arborification map. This provides\na formalism alternative to the one of molecules introduced by Deng and Hani\n(2023). It allows us to compute the cancellations coming from Wave turbulence\nand the proof of the invariance of the Gibbs measure under the dynamics of the\nthree-dimensional cubic wave equation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ssG7CxMj8QKYfYQxBDGOOWJAbrwAeoudFEKBy7edMiE","pdfSize":"1129883"}
