  "abstract": "  Economic agent-based models (ABMs) are becoming more and more data-driven,\nestablishing themselves as increasingly valuable tools for economic research\nand policymaking. We propose to classify the extent to which an ABM is\ndata-driven based on whether agent-level quantities are initialized from\nreal-world micro-data and whether the ABM's dynamics track empirical time\nseries. This paper discusses how making ABMs data-driven helps overcome\nlimitations of traditional ABMs and makes ABMs a stronger alternative to\nequilibrium models. We review state-of-the-art methods in parameter\ncalibration, initialization, and data assimilation, and then present successful\napplications that have generated new scientific knowledge and informed policy\ndecisions. This paper serves as a manifesto for data-driven ABMs, introducing a\ndefinition and classification and outlining the state of the field, and as a\nguide for those new to the field.\n",
