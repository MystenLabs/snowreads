In\nthis study, first, we obtain a general achievable rate for a two-user wireless\nmultiple access channel (MAC) with specially correlated sources as a more\ngeneral version for continuous alphabet MACs, by extending the known discrete\nalphabet results to the wireless continuous alphabet version. Next, the impact\nof wireless channel coefficients correlation on the performance metrics using\nCopula theory, as the most convenient way for describing the dependence between\nseveral variables, is investigated. By applying the Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern\n(FGM) Copula function, we obtain closed-form expressions for the outage\nprobability (OP) under positive/negative dependence conditions. It is shown\nthat the fading correlation improves the OP for a negative dependence\nstructure. Specifically, whenever the dependence structure tends to negative\nvalues, the OP decreases and the efficiency of the channel increases. Finally,\nthe efficiency of the analytical results is illustrated numerically.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Information Theory","Computer Science/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"v9tp1lgSX1kXuELvH-cZVqvGYn9eAB9k3ofJX_eL9_o","pdfSize":"836813"}
