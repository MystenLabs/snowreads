With\nthis in hand, we define a notion of comparative patience. Alice is more patient\nthan Bob if Alice's normalized discounted utility gain by going from any $y$ to\nany dominating $x$ is less than Bob's discounted utility gain from such an\nimprovement. We provide a full characterization of this relation in terms of\nthe agents' discount rules.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DJ2cHLgrlBFBOoQOJ336KD9A5tYl9FEMm8ZIOrZjlYc","pdfSize":"367312"}
