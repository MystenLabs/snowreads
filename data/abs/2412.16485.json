However, existing algorithms for\ncounting $(p, q)$-bicliques often face significant computational challenges,\nparticularly on large real-world networks. In this paper, we propose a general\nbiclique counting framework, called \\npivot, based on a novel concept of\nnode-pivot. We show that previous methods can be viewed as specific\nimplementations of this general framework. More importantly, we propose a novel\nimplementation of \\npivot based on a carefully-designed minimum non-neighbor\ncandidate partition strategy. We prove that our new implementation of \\npivot\nhas lower worst-case time complexity than the state-of-the-art methods. Beyond\nbasic biclique counting, a nice feature of \\npivot is that it also supports\nlocal counting (computing bicliques per node) and range counting\n(simultaneously counting bicliques within a size range). Extensive experiments\non 12 real-world large datasets demonstrate that our proposed \\npivot\nsubstantially outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms by up to two orders of\nmagnitude.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"cNnlLCmuaMkezqRGomgYmw13i4TfJpEXoiGOeIHaZDA","pdfSize":"6431215"}
