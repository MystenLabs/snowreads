Our study focuses on quenching the system\nfrom a zero-momentum phase to a plane-wave phase. During this quench,\ntopological defects emerge in the form of vortices. These vortices and\nanti-vortices exhibit a random spatial distribution with equal numbers,\nmirroring the core principles of Kosterlitz-Thouless physics. In a uniform\nsystem, we observe an exponential scaling of both the vortex production time\nand the vortex number with the quench rate, consistent with the conventional\nKibble-Zurek mechanism. The decay of which adheres to a logarithmic law,\naligning with experimental observations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"R6t-k3Irv5HG_F-hA5ZwXoLKTnwm-xErGEP4FPHPVq0","pdfSize":"3019263"}
