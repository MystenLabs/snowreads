As segmentation foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM)\nbegin to emerge, zero-shot segmentation requires only minimal human\nparticipation obtaining high-quality object masks. We introduce a\nHoloLens-Object-Labeling (HOLa) Unity and Python application based on the\nSAM-Track algorithm that offers fully automatic single object annotation for\nHoloLens 2 while requiring minimal human participation. HOLa does not have to\nbe adjusted to a specific image appearance and could thus alleviate AR research\nin any application field. We evaluate HOLa for different degrees of image\ncomplexity in open liver surgery and in medical phantom experiments. Using HOLa\nfor image annotation can increase the labeling speed by more than 500 times\nwhile providing Dice scores between 0.875 and 0.982, which are comparable to\nhuman annotators.
