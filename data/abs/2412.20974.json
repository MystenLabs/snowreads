Complex CNN architecture running on CPU or GPU has\neither insufficient throughput or prohibitive power consumption. Hence, there\nis a need to have dedicated hardware to accelerate the computation workload to\nsolve these limitations. In this paper, we accelerate a CNN for image\nclassification with the CIFAR-10 dataset using Vitis-AI on Xilinx Zynq\nUltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU104 FPGA evaluation board. The work achieves 3.33-5.82x\nhigher throughput and 3.39-6.30x higher energy efficiency than CPU and GPU\nbaselines. It shows the potential to extract 2D features for downstream tasks,\nsuch as depth estimation and 3D reconstruction.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Qn7LyPH2gQX9ChhB8ieKWLyOepIRAdh_mP7xatLuXAo","pdfSize":"319989"}
