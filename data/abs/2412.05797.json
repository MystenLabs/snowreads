In multi-party working group environments,\nmultimodal analytics is crucial for identifying non-verbal interactions of\ngroup members. In conjunction with their verbal participation, this creates an\nholistic understanding of collaboration and engagement that provides necessary\ncontext for the AI Partner. In this demo, we illustrate our present\ncapabilities at detecting and tracking nonverbal behavior in student\ntask-oriented interactions in the classroom, and the implications for tracking\ncommon ground and engagement.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"MgcgMGKcLN9b_lCC36jUABAQ6KzdznJlOEkm1-R6wtk","pdfSize":"4024045"}
