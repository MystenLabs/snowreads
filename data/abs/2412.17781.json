The latter play a central role in the\ninvestigation of generalized symmetries, renormalization group flows and\nnumerous exotic phases of strongly-correlated systems. Here, a variational\nquantum simulation scheme is presented for the analysis of those anyonic chains\nwhich can be mapped to the restricted solid-on-solid~(RSOS) models of Andrews,\nBaxter and Forrester. An~$L_R$ site RSOS model associated with a Dynkin diagram\ncontaining~$p$ nodes is realized with~$L_R\\lceil\\ln_2 p\\rceil$ qubits,\nwhere~$\\lceil x\\rceil$ is the smallest integer~$\\geq x$. The scheme is\nbenchmarked by realizing the ground states of RSOS Hamiltonians in the~$A_p$\nfamily for~$4\\leq p\\leq8$ using a variational quantum-classical algorithm. The\nlatter is based on the Euler-Cartan circuit ansatz. Topological symmetry\noperators are analyzed for the RSOS models at the quantum-critical points.\nMeasurement of observables acting on~$\\lceil\\ln_2 p\\rceil$ qubits is shown to\ncapture the anyonic nature of the Hilbert space. The described quantum\nsimulation scheme provides a systematic approach to give rise to a large family\nof quantum field theories which have largely eluded physical realizations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"POKOqKRvNEf01UoNtLkkMnTcUJo_o48tXgCM4Ayp4tc","pdfSize":"579413"}
