Typically one starts from a group and several points and\nasks questions about the orbit closure of the points under the action of the\ngroup, e.g., whether two given orbit closures intersect.\n  In this paper we consider a collection of what we call determination problems\nconcerning groups and orbit closures. These problems begin with a given variety\nand seek to understand whether and how it arises either as an algebraic group\nor as an orbit closure. The how question asks whether the underlying group is\n$s$-generated, meaning it is topologically generated by $s$ matrices for a\ngiven number $s$. Among other applications, problems of this type have recently\nbeen studied in the context of synthesising loops subject to certain specified\ninvariants on program variables.\n  Our main result is a polynomial-space procedure that inputs a variety $V$ and\na number $s$ and determines whether $V$ arises as an orbit closure of a point\nunder an $s$-generated commutative matrix group. The main tools in our approach\nare rooted in structural properties of commutative algebraic matrix groups and\nlattice theory. We leave open the question of determining whether a variety is\nan orbit closure of a point under an algebraic matrix group (without the\nrequirement of commutativity). In this regard, we note that a recent paper by\nNosan et al. [NPSHW2021] gives an elementary procedure to compute the orbit\nclosure of a point under finitely many matrices.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7s7huxP3GSNyuPokGCSVoYk95sUsaKnrwwMtHvC4b4Y","pdfSize":"355698"}
