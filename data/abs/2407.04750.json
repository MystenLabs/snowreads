The\nnonlinear extension of the theory, called $f(Q)$ gravity, has recently been\nproposed and offers a promising avenue for addressing some of the long-standing\nchallenges in cosmology and fundamental physics. A number of solutions have\nalready been found that have confirmed the usefulness of the theory for\nastrophysics and cosmology. Motivated by earlier work on G\\\"odel-type\nspacetimes we investigate whether $f(Q)$ gravity admits such cosmological\nsolutions, which entail causality violation. In the coincident gauge, which is\nshown to be a legitimate gauge because the connection field equations are\nsatisfied, we find that G\\\"odel-type metrics are allowed by this modified\ngravity theory for any function $f(Q)$. As a matter of fact, out of all\nG\\\"odel-type metrics only G\\\"odel's original model is compatible with $f(Q)$\ngravity, implying violation of causality. The requirement that energy\nconditions be obeyed by the matter content leads to mild restrictions on the\nfunction $f(Q)$.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mI2zwl4ZM_9LhE016L7iwWJkxRXAhCXN-BLUiuJDnF4","pdfSize":"186788"}
