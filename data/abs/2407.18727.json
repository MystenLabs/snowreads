However, spatial\ninformation is crucial to identify the starting location of a transition\nprocess, and can be directly inferred by satellite observations. By using\ncomplex networks constructed from several climate variables on the numerical\ngrid of climate simulations, we seek for network properties that can serve as\nEWS when approaching a state transition. We show that network indicators such\nas the normalized degree, the average length distance and the betweenness\ncentrality are capable of detecting tipping points at the global scale, as\nobtained by the MIT general circulation model in a coupled-aquaplanet\nconfiguration for CO$_2$ concentration-driven simulations. The applicability of\nsuch indicators as EWS is assessed and compared to traditional methods. We also\nanalyse the ability of climate networks to identify nonlinear dynamical\npatterns.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"t9zPy5e9IkjUIdcdoU-RE-6uwB4Pwfx4bYHfveElxIY","pdfSize":"26788293","objectId":"0x7f60f5326a95f6e83766f9e878ac186a6abaedcedfb4b3dca4b03da92cd5068d","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
