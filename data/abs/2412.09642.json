These limitations include the lack of a standard\ncomparison operator and certain operations that depend on it (like array max,\nhistogram binning etc). We also observe that the existing solutions are either\ntoo low level or do not have proper abstractions to implement algorithms like\nSIFT. In this work, we demonstrate: 1. Methods of adapting regular code to the\nFHE setting. 2. Alternate implementations of standard algorithms (like array\nmax, histogram binning, etc.) to reduce the multiplicative depth. 3. A novel\nmethod of using deferred computations to avoid performing expensive operations\nsuch as comparisons in the encrypted domain. Through this exercise, we hope\nthis work acts as a practical guide on how one can adapt algorithms to FHE\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Cryptography and Security","Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"93PRo0IDhztsPe70ihmSYit279Acidp6U5JTNrXlQUI","pdfSize":"95745"}
