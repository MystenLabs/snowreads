  "abstract": "  We investigate the resistive anisotropy in CsV3Sb5 thin films within the\ncharge density wave phase. Using a device structure with twelve electrodes\nsymmetrically distributed in a circular shape, we measure the resistivity\nanisotropy by varying the current direction. A twofold resistivity anisotropy\nmodulated by temperature is found, which is fully consistent with the\nelectronic nematicity in CsV3Sb5, that is, the spontaneous rotational symmetry\nbreaking by electronic degree of freedom. Additionally, the resistivity\nanisotropy also shows modest changes by applying magnetic fields, implying the\npossible chiral charge orders with time-reversal symmetry breaking. These\nfindings provide deep insights into the correlated electronic states in Kagome\nmaterials and highlight the unique properties of CsV3Sb5 in the two-dimensional\nregime.\n",
