Notably,\npretraining data may not provide coverage of relevant distribution shifts\n(e.g., shifts induced via the use of different measurement instruments). We\nconsider deep learning models trained to classify the synthesis conditions of\nuranium ore concentrates (UOCs) and show that model editing is particularly\neffective for improving generalization to distribution shifts common in this\ndomain. In particular, model editing outperforms finetuning on two curated\ndatasets comprising of micrographs taken of U$_{3}$O$_{8}$ aged in humidity\nchambers and micrographs acquired with different scanning electron microscopes,\nrespectively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ysUxS42kFtD_H8L5bSeg-N_st4yE_V2FflJSywm5trY","pdfSize":"8886484","objectId":"0xc737ad956530ed9d8e3648df92f90538e76bbadb77d98cc28e181d1189825199","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
