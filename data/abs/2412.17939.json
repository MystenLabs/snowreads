  "abstract": "  Heterostructured quantum dots (QDs) based on narrow-gap PbSe and wide-gap\nCdSe have been studied with an eye on their prospective applications in\nnear-infrared (NIR) light sources, photodetectors, and solar cells. The most\ncommon structural motif is a spherical QD comprising a PbSe core enclosed into\na CdSe shell. However, the potential barrier created by the CdSe shell\ncomplicates extraction of band-edge charge carriers from the QD. Therefore,\nconventional PbSe/CdSe QDs are not suitable for applications in practical\nphotoconversion devices. Here we report inverted CdSe/PbSe core/shell QDs that\novercome this drawback. In these structures, both photocarriers (electron and\nhole) exhibit a significant degree of shell localization and are therefore free\nto move within the QD solid and be extracted into an external circuit. To\ncreate such QDs, we employ a novel synthetic method in which a thin, atomically\ncontrolled wetting layer is used to homogenize the surface of the CdSe core and\nthus promote directionally uniform growth of the PbSe shell. Unlike noninverted\nQDs, inverted core/shell structures exhibit highly efficient photocarrier\ntransport, making them excellent candidates for applications in practical\nphotoconversion including photovoltaics, photodetection, and photochemistry.\n",
