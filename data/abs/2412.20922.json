  "abstract": "  In the QCD phase diagram, the dependence of the pseudo-critical temperature,\n$T_{\\rm pc}$, on the baryon chemical potential, $\\mu_B$, is of fundamental\ninterest. The variation of $T_{\\rm pc}$ with $\\mu_B$ is normally captured by\n$\\kappa$, the coefficient of the leading (quadratic) term of the polynomial\nexpansion of $T_{\\rm pc}$ with $\\mu_B$. In this work, we present the first\ncalculation of $\\kappa$ using hadronic quantities. Simulating $N_f=2+1$\nflavours of Wilson fermions on {\\sc Fastsum} ensambles, we calculate the\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\mu_B^2)$ correction to mesonic correlation functions. By\ndemanding degeneracy in the vector and axial vector channels we obtain $T_{\\rm\npc}(\\mu_B)$ and hence $\\kappa$. While lacking a continuum extrapolation and\nbeing away from the physical point, our results are consistent with previous\nworks using thermodynamic observables (renormalised chiral condensate, strange\nquark number susceptibility) from lattice QCD simulations with staggered\nfermions.\n",
