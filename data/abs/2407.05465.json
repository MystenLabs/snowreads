In\ncontrast, our analysis, based on both ARPES measurements and a specialized ab\ninitio framework employing only quantities well defined in incommensurate\nmaterials, demonstrates that the large band shifts instead reflect changes in\nvalence band hybridization and interlayer bonding. The strong alignment of our\nab initio predictions and ARPES measurements confirms our understanding of the\nincommensurate electronic structure and charge transfer.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"1e52TglUxzyoIpjAXwzav3eh2auizJBQVD9y3h9L2dc","pdfSize":"18293410"}
