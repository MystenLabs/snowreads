We conducted five crowdsourced\nexperiments to quantify the effects of color, chart type, data trend, data\nvariability and data density on emotion (measured through self-reported arousal\nand valence). Results from our experiments show that there are multiple design\nelements which influence the emotion induced by a visualization and, more\nsurprisingly, that certain data characteristics influence the emotion of\nviewers even when the data has no meaning. In light of these findings, we offer\nguidelines on how to use color, scale, and chart type to counterbalance and\nemphasize the emotional impact of immutable data characteristics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_MMlucHh67i-Sz08qRyD6xzKetz0adYOHXTgj4g_16w","pdfSize":"12415906","objectId":"0x56f2c981f12c4c4df196632ab93bd44306dbd8ed06394910e659e41553db9d98","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
