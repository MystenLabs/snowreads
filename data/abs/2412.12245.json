  "abstract": "  Galaxy number counts suggest that we are located within the Gpc-scale KBC\nvoid. The Hubble tension might arise due to gravitationally driven outflow from\nthis void, as explored in detail by Haslbauer et al. We explore how the impact\nof the void on redshift decays at large distances. We define $H_0(z)$ as the\npresent expansion rate $H_0$ that would be inferred from observations in a\nnarrow redshift range centred on $z$. We find $H_0(z)$ in three different ways,\nall of which give similar results. We then compare these results with the\nobservations of Jia et al., who were careful to minimise the impact of\ncorrelations between $H_0$ measurements from data in different redshift bins.\nWe find reasonable agreement with their results for the Gaussian and\nExponential void underdensity profiles, although the agreement is less good in\nthe Maxwell-Boltzmann case. The latter profile causes severe disagreement with\nthe observed bulk flow curve at $z < 0.1$ (Mazurenko et al.), so the tension\nwith higher redshift data further highlights that the deepest part of the KBC\nvoid is probably near its centre. The observations show a decline of $H_0(z)$\ntowards the background $Planck$ value in qualitative agreement with the\nconsidered models, even if we use a larger void. The good overall agreement\nwith the recent results of Jia et al. suggests that the local supervoid evident\nfrom the galaxy luminosity density out to a Gpc might also solve the Hubble\ntension while retaining a low background $H_0$ consistent with $Planck$ data,\nassuming enhanced structure formation on $>100$ Mpc scales.\n",
