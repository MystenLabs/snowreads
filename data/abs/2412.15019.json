We extend this result to compact semisimple tensor 2-categories\nover an arbitrary field of characteristic zero. In order to do so, we\ngeneralize to an arbitrary field of characteristic zero many well-known results\nabout braided fusion 1-categories over an algebraically closed field of\ncharacteristic zero. Most notably, we prove that the Picard group of any\nbraided fusion 1-category is indfinite, generalizing the classical fact that\nthe Brauer group of a field is torsion. As an application of our main result,\nwe derive the existence of braided fusion 1-categories indexed by the fourth\nGalois cohomology group of the absolute Galois group that represent interesting\nclasses in the appropriate Witt groups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"YK6wiC6K_4ffcu4Anaw0pLKmXCHvXTTa0Kb9DnAMN3w","pdfSize":"475595"}
