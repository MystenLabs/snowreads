We show that these two notions agree for invariant\nglobal extensions of a weakly o-minimal type, in which case we say that the\ntype is trivial. In the o-minimal case, we prove that every definable complete\n1-type over a model is trivial. We prove that the triviality has several\nfavorable properties; in particular, it is preserved in nonforking extensions\nof a weakly o-minimal type and under weak nonorthogonality of weakly o-minimal\ntypes. We introduce the notion of a shift in a linearly ordered structure that\ngeneralizes the successor function. Then we apply the techniques developed to\nprove that every weakly quasi-o-minimal theory that admits a definable shift\nhas $2^{\\aleph_0}$ countable models.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"duT37h-SMRn59BkoAo4JBA1HyqWS5i2E1oJm2lKJtS4","pdfSize":"413943"}
