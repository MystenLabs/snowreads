That is, a QFT for structureless elementary particles that does not\nrequire renormalization where loop integrals in the Feynman diagrams are\nfinite. It is an algebraic theory utilizing orthogonal polynomials and based on\nthe structureless sector of SAQFT.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-efU1cdu0btx_k08N2bcBsIHdQZ8jV0RUXdlSzzrG7s","pdfSize":"991397"}
