However, the\nquality of BMD remains poorly understood. This study evaluates biases in BMD\nand develops mitigation methods. Using Google and Apple mobility data as\nexamples, this study compares them with benchmark data from governmental\nagencies. Spatio-temporal discrepancies between BMD and benchmark are observed\nand their impacts on transportation applications are investigated, emphasizing\nthe urgent need to address these biases to prevent misguided policymaking. This\nstudy further proposes and tests a bias mitigation method. It is shown that the\nmitigated BMD could generate valuable insights into large-scale public transit\nsystems across 100+ US counties, revealing regional disparities of the recovery\nof transit systems from the COVID-19. This study underscores the importance of\ncaution when using BMD in transportation research and presents effective\nmitigation strategies that would benefit practitioners.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"TpMum78jfkOJgsIqckYo-yIvPcfJFhw1QigePNPntC4","pdfSize":"3104598","objectId":"0xc4cc8e65eea12e95a2ea3e71485d1bed0d9af09c69799e7db00c7fd6e9078d67","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
