This work extends the\nPower-Zienau-Wooley (PZW) formulation of quantum electrodynamics to account for\nnonlinear interactions based on a fully fermionic approach, without resorting\nto any bosonization approximation. It provides a unified description of the\nmicrocavity and the local field enhancement effects on the nonlinear optical\nresponse, thus encompassing the phenomena known as epsilon near zero (ENZ)\neffect. In particular, our theory describes the impact of the light-matter\ncoupled states on the high frequency generation process, relevant for recent\nexperimental investigations with polaritonic metasurfaces. We unveil the\nlimitations of traditional single-particle approaches and propose novel design\nprinciples to optimize nonlinear conversion efficiencies in dense,\nmicrocavity-coupled electronic systems. The theoretical framework developed\nhere provides an efficient tool for the development of advanced quantum optical\napplications in the mid-infrared and terahertz spectral domains. Furthermore,\nit establishes a foundation for exploring the quantum properties of the\nultra-strong light-matter regime through frequency-converted polariton states.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"598PwKC8cVOnFLlMQqJF4chnG7Lcq9pwuzQHbiMfW90","pdfSize":"6211109"}
