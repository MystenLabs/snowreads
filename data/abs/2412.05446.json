  "abstract": "  In this paper we review aspects of anti de Sitter/conformal field theory\n(AdS/CFT) duality and the notion of holographic renormalization group (RG)\nflow. We start by discussing supersymmetry and construct the N = 4 super\nYang-Mills theory in d = 4 by Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction method. Then,\nwe study the large-N limit and how it leads to the AdS/CFT duality. Using\nAdS/CFT, we then study the super-gravitational dual flows to the RG flows in\nCFT generated by marginal and relevant deformations, using the N = 4 super\nYang-Mills theory as an example. Then, we prove the Zamolodchikov C-theorem\nholographically. Finally, we discuss the Wilsonian holographic renormalization.\n",
