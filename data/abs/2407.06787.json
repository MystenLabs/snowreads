We present different families of sets of\nqubit measurements which are incompatible, but cannot lead to any quantum over\nclassical advantage in PM scenarios. Our examples are obtained via a general\ntheorem which proves a set of qubit dichotomic measurements can have their\nincompatibility certified in a PM scenario if and only if their incompatibility\ncan be certified in a bipartite Bell scenario where the parties share a\nmaximally entangled state. Our framework naturally suggests a hierarchy of\nincreasingly stronger notions of incompatibility, in which more power is given\nto the classical simulation by increasing its dimensionality. For qubits, we\ngive an example of measurements whose incompatibility can be certified against\ntrit simulations, which we show is the strongest possible notion for qubits in\nthis framework.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cMfsJDLY44cdSIQKzrsGhKfcw3A6P1XHvQmUNQCE-tA","pdfSize":"1175237"}
