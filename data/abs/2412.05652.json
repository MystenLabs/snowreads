Additionally, several error bounds are established including\napplications to the trapezoidal rule as well as to a Simpson formula-type rule.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wZ8brI3lPESBJtZxwa7_O7XK2RRxhoj1SGfl8KVQDWU","pdfSize":"279251"}
