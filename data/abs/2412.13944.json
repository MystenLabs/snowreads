The integrated ions' free energy has two terms: The first can be\nshort- or long-range, depending on their density. The second is proportional to\nthe nucleus' volume and can shift the state from undersaturation to\nsupersaturation at high ion concentration. The inclusion of the Gibbs transfer\nenergies of ions in the free energy leads to a modified Poisson-Boltzmann\nequation for the potential around the core. The integrated ions' free energy is\nadded to the fluids' interfacial and bulk terms to establish a generalized\nThomson model. In the Debye-Huckel limit, the model is solved analytically,\nwhile in the nonlinear regime, it is solved numerically. The state diagram in\nthe plane of saturation and core charge includes regions with a homogeneous\nphase, electro-prewetting, metastable vapor, metastable nucleus, and\nspontaneous nucleation states. The lines separating these regions depend\nsensitively on the preferential solvation. Our model shows nucleation asymmetry\nto the sign of the nucleus' charge. This sign asymmetry is due to the Gibbs\ntransfer energies of ions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"d9iioZcFa_blJPXHpBUBzsq4N0yRTa20-a6luQX0pg0","pdfSize":"744995"}
