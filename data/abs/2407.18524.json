Grounded in Griselda Pollock's theories on visual culture and gender,\nthe analysis reveals that AI models tend to sexualize female figures while\nportraying male figures as more authoritative and competent. These findings\nunderscore AI's potential to mirror and perpetuate societal biases, emphasizing\nthe need for critical engagement with AI-generated content. The project\ncontributes to discussions on the ethical implications of AI in creative\npractices and its broader impact on cultural perceptions of gender.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-_TWtZPXbHrDpz1KtuKbtO8fD_3ECILbNsNPtTI17Sg","pdfSize":"1597737"}
