However, the state-of-the-art device\ndesigns face scalability challenges, notably in achieving tunable two-qubit\ncoupling and ensuring qubit addressability. Here, we propose a\nsurface-code-compatible architecture, where each module has both tunable\ntwo-qubit gates and addressable single-qubit gates by introducing only a single\nextra donor in a pair of donors. We found that to compromise between the\nrequirement of tunability and that of addressability, an asymmetric scheme is\nnecessary. In this scheme, the introduced extra donor is strongly\ntunnel-coupled to one of the donor spin qubits for addressable single-qubit\noperation, while being more weakly coupled to the other to ensure the turning\non and off of the two-qubit operation. The fidelity of single-qubit and\ntwo-qubit gates can exceed the fault-tolerant threshold in our design.\nAdditionally, the asymmetric scheme effectively mitigates valley oscillations,\nallowing for engineering precision tolerances up to a few nanometers. Thus, our\nproposed scheme presents a promising prototype for large-scale, fault-tolerant,\ndonor-based spin quantum processors.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"p4d8hR4xAc7Azr6SXkA11pUIMZ60j8VpA8YfjWy1GHw","pdfSize":"2069210"}
