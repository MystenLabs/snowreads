However, the limited\navailability of training data for these languages hinders effective code\ngeneration by large language models (LLMs). This paper presents ConMover, a\nnovel framework that enhances LLM-based code generation for Move by leveraging\na knowledge graph of Move concepts and a small set of verified code examples.\nConMover integrates concept retrieval, planning, coding, and debugging agents\nin an iterative process to refine generated code. Evaluations with various\nopen-source LLMs demonstrate substantial accuracy improvements over baseline\nmodels. These results underscore ConMover's potential to address low-resource\ncode generation challenges, bridging the gap between natural language\ndescriptions and reliable smart contract development.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"YtYnd5FhCVfB_nbZZSFTh_Mjg1lzt36Tub2a2eUerPc","pdfSize":"343519"}
