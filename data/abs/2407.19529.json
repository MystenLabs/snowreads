By\nharmonizing the mathematical structure with an energy minimization framework\ntailored for neural network approximations, our method's efficacy is confirmed\nthrough both 1D and 2D numerical simulations. Utilizing the NSIDC-0092 dataset\nfor Greenland and incorporating bedrock topography for model pre-training, we\nregister notable advances in prediction accuracy. Our research underscores the\npotent combination of traditional mathematical models and advanced\ncomputational techniques in delivering precise ice thickness estimations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cmM-CEc4onJZWGz9MsB0mNdxQubgCf0gXn_HR5dbYyM","pdfSize":"5548413"}
