A graceful coloring of $G$ is a vertex coloring $f$ of $G$ such that\nthe difference edge labelling $h$ induced by $f$ is a (proper) edge coloring of\n$G$. A graceful coloring with range $\\{1,2,\\dots,k\\}$ is called a graceful\n$k$-coloring. The least integer $k$ such that $G$ admits a graceful\n$k$-coloring is called the graceful chromatic number of $G$, denoted by\n$\\chi_g(G)$.\n  We prove that $\\chi(G^2)\\leq \\chi_g(G)\\leq a(\\chi(G^2))$ for every graph $G$,\nwhere $a(n)$ denotes the $n$th term of the integer sequence A065825 in OEIS. We\nalso prove that graceful coloring problem is NP-hard for planar bipartite\ngraphs, regular graphs and 2-degenerate graphs. In particular, we show that for\neach $k\\geq 5$, it is NP-complete to check whether a planar bipartite graph of\nmaximum degree $k-2$ is graceful $k$-colorable. The complexity of checking\nwhether a planar graph is graceful 4-colorable remains open.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"p3B99ePYGymCSq4vfPwd52WuOT2r-c8AbrMTiaOgIOg","pdfSize":"418593"}
