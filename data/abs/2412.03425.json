In dimension one we\nfind that the minimizer, up to translation, is the equidistant point set. In\ndimension two, minimizing with respect to triplets we find that the minimizer\nis the triangular lattice.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"C2JrFvQy8YOE2wn2TkB6-LLIDSGom8sDwf8t0hXJYAU","pdfSize":"239220"}
