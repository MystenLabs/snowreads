Using Radon measures associated with regular differential\n1-forms invariant under Schottky groups allows to construct self-adjoint\ndiffusion operators as Laplacian integral operators with kernel functions\ndetermined by the p-adic absolute value on the complex p-adic numbers. Their\nspectra are explicitly calculated and the corresponding Cauchy problems for\ntheir associated heat equations are found to be uniquely solvable and to\ndetermine Markov processes having paths which are cadlag. The heat kernels are\nshown to have explicitly given distribution functions, as well as boundary\nvalue problems associated with the heat equations under Dirchlet and von\nNeumann conditions are solved.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"E5pmI-tn9i9NImmXv7lB416HhxM6QrlxuoRBGOeLY_U","pdfSize":"265740"}
