For the\nfinite-temperature studies, we apply the soft-wall model, which is thermalized\nby introducing a thermal dilaton field. GPDs and charge density are considered\nin impact parameter (IP) space and at zero and finite temperatures. We plot the\ntemperature dependence of these quantities in IP space and observe a decreasing\nof their peaks on temperature increasing. The gravitational root means squared\nradius obtained here is close to the range given by experimental data for the\nmass radius and has low sensitivity to the temperature.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_NK-TAQAt8EhWZZ1_MegR_NihsUYKnflp9R5o2mSV1w","pdfSize":"4153586"}
