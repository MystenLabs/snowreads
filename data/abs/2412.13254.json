Considering the PBHs are described\nby a Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m metric, and are produced in a radiation dominated\nUniverse, we show, it is possible to simultaneously explain the\nmatter-antimatter asymmetry along with right DM abundance satisfying bounds\nfrom big bang nucleosynthesis, cosmic microwave background and gravitational\nwave energy density due to PBH density fluctuation. We also obtain the\nparameter space beyond the semiclassical approximation, taking into account the\nquantum effects on charged PBH dynamics due to memory burden.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"M965IDlk5oaFueUXXVI7prKO0QHkDaWItNJphvb_F0w","pdfSize":"696111"}
