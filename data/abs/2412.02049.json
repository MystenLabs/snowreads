Our\ntwo main results are\n  Theorem 1. There is a partition of the infinite interval $[kd,\\infty)$ of\npositive integers into a family of finite sets $X$ for which the sum of the\nreciprocals of the elements in $X$ is $n/d$.\n  Theorem 1. There is a partition of $[2kd,\\infty)$ into an infinite family of\ninfinite sets $Y$ for which the sum of the reciprocals of the elements in $Y$\nis $n/d$.\n  Our method is grounded in the Vital Identity, $1/z = 1/(z+1) + 1/z(z+1)$,\nwhich holds for every complex number $z \\notin \\{-1,0\\}$, and which gives rise\nto an eponymous algorithm that serves as our tool. At the core of our Theorems\n1 and 2 is the number theoretic function $\\star: x\\mapsto \\star x := x(x+1)$\ninto whose properties this paper continues an investigation initiated in [7].\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"kUcEAmzmPXviBSrgn-e4-FTBulOx2jlMdBaDveWRD5M","pdfSize":"162696"}
