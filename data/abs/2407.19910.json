There\nare various approaches to membership determination, including supervised and\nunsupervised machine learning (ML) methods. We perform membership analysis\nusing the supervised machine learning approach. We train and test our ML models\non two sets of star cluster data: snapshots from $N$-body simulations and 21\ndifferent clusters from the Gaia Data Release 3 data. We explore five different\nML models: Random Forest (RF), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines,\nFeed-Forward Neural Networks, and K-Nearest Neighbors. We find that all models\nproduce similar results, with RF showing slightly better accuracy. We find that\na balance of classes in datasets is optional for successful learning. The\nclassification accuracy depends strongly on the astrometric parameters. The\naddition of photometric parameters does not improve performance. We do not find\na strong correlation between the classification accuracy and clusters' age,\nmass, and half-mass radius. At the same time, models trained on clusters with a\nlarger number of members generally produce better results.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5xeZHOWLcRyvbdPJ7sg-GuRUXvOe8fUFPhw2I_EASzo","pdfSize":"6373371","objectId":"0x078cf48c51aadada3da31d9aaef532697d9b785cde7197e0620c7d936254b0de","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
