  "abstract": "  A model of the non-concentric spherical core-shell quantum dot under the\ninfluence of an externally applied electric field was proposed. It was\nestablished that the energy spectrum of both the electron and the hole depends\non the intensity of the electric field as well as on the specific location of\nthe core within the quantum dot. The phenomenon of energy level splitting and\ndegeneration was analyzed in detail. Additionally, the variations in the\noptical gap were determined and expressed as a function of the applied electric\nfield strength and the position of the core in the quantum dot.\n",
