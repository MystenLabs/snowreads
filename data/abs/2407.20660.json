Simultaneously,\nadvances in imaging AI have enabled extraction of morphological features\ndescribing the tissue. The intersection of spatial omics and imaging AI\npresents opportunities for a more holistic understanding. In this review we\nintroduce a framework for categorizing spatial omics-morphology combination\nmethods, focusing on how morphological features can be translated or integrated\ninto spatial omics analyses. By translation we mean finding morphological\nfeatures that spatially correlate with gene expression patterns with the\npurpose of predicting gene expression. Such features can be used to generate\nsuper-resolution gene expression maps or infer genetic information from\nclinical H&E-stained samples. By integration we mean finding morphological\nfeatures that spatially complement gene expression patterns with the purpose of\nenriching information. Such features can be used to define spatial domains,\nespecially where gene expression has preceded morphological changes and where\nmorphology remains after gene expression. We discuss learning strategies and\ndirections for further development of the field.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uu7bfLr4519d9yUht-ziwP5hwAsPFuBCzu7WqKtaaYE","pdfSize":"961923"}
