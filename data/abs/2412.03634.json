  "abstract": "  Control Flow Graphs and Function Call Graphs have become pivotal in providing\na detailed understanding of program execution and effectively characterizing\nthe behavior of malware. These graph-based representations, when combined with\nGraph Neural Networks (GNN), have shown promise in developing high-performance\nmalware detectors. However, challenges remain due to the large size of these\ngraphs and the inherent opacity in the decision-making process of GNNs. This\npaper addresses these issues by developing several graph reduction techniques\nto reduce graph size and applying the state-of-the-art GNNExplainer to enhance\nthe interpretability of GNN outputs. The analysis demonstrates that integrating\nour proposed graph reduction technique along with GNNExplainer in the malware\ndetection framework significantly reduces graph size while preserving high\nperformance, providing an effective balance between efficiency and transparency\nin malware detection.\n",
