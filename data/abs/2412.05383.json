In this work, we used density\nfunctional theory (DFT) that incorporates generalized gradient approximation\n(GGA) and meta-generalized gradient approximation (mGGA) methods to explore the\nvarious properties of the LiSnCl3 and LiSnBr3 perovskites. The structural\nstabilities, charge transfer, electronic, optical, mechanical, and\npiezoelectric properties are studied. Herein, we report that these rarely\nstudied materials are eco-friendly and look promising for optoelectronics and\npiezoelectric applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"f8I1BzP8jUKcNMi_wTBCgZgqWEYmm4kisOn53nAZLfk","pdfSize":"9043132"}
