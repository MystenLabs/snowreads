The algorithm yields correct results as long as the point\ncloud is contained in a hemisphere, but the hemisphere does not have to be\nknown in advance and the algorithm automatically detects whether the hemisphere\nassumption is met.\n  For the full-sphere case, that is, if the point cloud is not contained in a\nhemisphere, we provide hints on how to adapt existing linearithmic time\nalgorithms for spherical Voronoi diagrams to find the smallest enclosing\ncircle.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry","Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"abMGzythn8k96IqdQ4jyX2w8hatg5QbAOwHK406NXqk","pdfSize":"326199"}
