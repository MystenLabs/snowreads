  "abstract": "  Fano profiles are observed across various fields of wave physics. They emerge\nfrom interference phenomena and are quantified by the asymmetry parameter q. In\noptics, q is usually considered as a phenomenological coefficient obtained by\nfitting experimental or numerical data. In this work, we introduce an ab initio\nMaxwellian approach using quasinormal modes to analytically describe line\nshapes in light scattering problems. We show that the response of each\nindividual quasinormal mode inherently exhibits a Fano profile and derive an\nexplicit analytical formula for the Fano parameter. Experimental and numerical\nvalidations confirm the formula's accuracy across a broad spectrum of\nelectromagnetic systems. The general expression for q opens new possibilities\nfor fine-tuning and optimizing spectral line shapes in electromagnetism.\n",
