First we prove the Keel-Tao type theorem for the\northonormal Strichartz estimates, which means that the dispersive estimates\nyield the orthonormal Strichartz estimates for strongly continuous unitary\ngroups. This result applies to many Schr\\\"odinger propagators which are\ndifficult to treat by the smooth perturbation theory, for example,\nlocal-in-time estimates for the Schr\\\"odinger operator with unbounded\nelectromagnetic potentials, the $(k, a)$-generalized Laguerre operators and\nglobal-in-time estimates for the Schr\\\"odinger operator with scaling critical\nmagnetic potentials including the Aharonov-Bohm potentials. Next we observe\nmapping properties of resolvents for the repulsive Hamiltonian and apply to the\northonormal Strichartz estimates. We prove the Kato-Yajima type uniform\nresolvent estimates with logarithmic decaying weight functions. This is new\neven when without perturbations. The proof is dependent on the microlocal\nanalysis and the Mourre theory. We also discuss mapping properties on the\nSchwartz class and the Lebesgue space.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WiPfhaXKMjzJw0yEpuVn8YMArOf9mFal9tiJBjNWSQI","pdfSize":"563270"}
