  "abstract": "  In this paper, we study the nonexistence of global weak solutions for a wave\nequation with nonlinear memory and damping terms. We give an answer to an open\nproblem posed in [M. D'Abbicco, A wave equation with structural damping and\nnonlinear memory, Nonlinear Differ. Equ. Appl. 21 (2014), 751-773]. Moreover,\ncomparing with the existing results, our results do not require any positivity\ncondition of the initial values. The proof of our results is based on the\nasymptotic properties of solutions for an integral inequality.\n",
