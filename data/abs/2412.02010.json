Inelastic neutron\nscattering measurements show that the Tb ions adopt an Ising doublet ground\nstate. Here, we consider whether a transverse magnetic field can drive\nTbV$_6$Sn$_6$ towards a quantum critical point, providing a rare example of\ntransverse-field Ising criticality in a metallic compound. High-field\nmagnetization measurements suggest that this quantum criticality is avoided and\nreveal a first-order-like spin-reorientation transition at 25.6 T due to an\nexcited-state level crossing. Theoretical analysis shows that small changes in\nthe local Hamiltonian can restore the quantum criticality for some in-plane\nfield directions, suggesting that TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ is close to a novel quantum\ntricritical point induced by in-plane magnetic anisotropy.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yebPvN6fDsPJT9711dIONAHlVKLn0C_9akyThzxn9Gk","pdfSize":"6096370"}
