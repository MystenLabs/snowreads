If the process is critical and the mean distribution\nof types converges for large times, we prove that the tree structure of the\nprocess converges to the Brownian Continuum Random Tree, under a moment\nassumption. We provide a general approach to prove similar invariance\nprinciples for branching processes, which relies on deducing the convergence of\nthe genealogy from computing its moments. These are obtained using a new\nmany-to-few formula, which provides an expression for the moments of order $k$\nof a branching process in terms of a Markov chain indexed by a uniform tree\nwith $k$ leaves.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"DNv2yEFSdn5WgIzhbKu5d6LOTAw02DEXC2UBCEZywuo","pdfSize":"658002"}
