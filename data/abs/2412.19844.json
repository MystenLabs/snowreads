To manage this\ncomplexity, latent representation models - such as Autoencoders, Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs), and Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) - are\nincreasingly applied. These models are designed to reduce high-dimensional\nneuroimaging data to lower-dimensional latent spaces, where key patterns and\nvariations related to brain function can be identified. By modeling these\nlatent spaces, researchers hope to gain insights into the biology and function\nof the brain, including how its structure changes with age or disease, or how\nit encodes sensory information, predicts and adapts to new inputs. This review\ndiscusses how these models are used for clinical applications, like disease\ndiagnosis and progression monitoring, but also for exploring fundamental brain\nmechanisms such as active inference and predictive coding. These approaches\nprovide a powerful tool for both understanding and simulating the brain's\ncomplex computational tasks, potentially advancing our knowledge of cognition,\nperception, and neural disorders.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"pYDnotyXk3u3xjs-O2iHs_0Kgs5QBydgrBhKNx2ZSg8","pdfSize":"810863"}
