Our\nstudy involves a comprehensive analysis of ten years (2009-2019) of photometric\nmonitoring data and seven spectroscopic observations acquired between 2007 and\n2017. This work focuses on the pronounced deformations in the BEL profiles\nbetween images A and B, alongside the chromatic changes in their adjacent\ncontinua and the striking microlensing variability observed in the $r$-band\nlight curves. We employed a statistical model to quantify the distribution and\nimpact of microlensing magnifications and utilized a Bayesian approach to\nestimate the dimensions of various emission regions within the quasar. The\nanalysis of the $r$-band light curves reveals substantial microlensing\nvariability in the rest-frame UV continuum, suggesting that image B is\namplified relative to image A by a factor of up to six. This finding is\ncorroborated by pronounced microlensing-induced distortions in all studied BEL\nprofiles (Ly$\\alpha$, Si IV, C IV, C III], and Mg II), especially a prominent\nmagnification of image B's red wing. We estimated the average dimensions of the\nBLR to be notably smaller than usual: the region emitting the blue wings\nmeasures $R_{1/2} = 11.5 \\pm 1.7$ light-days, while the red wings originate\nfrom a more compact area of $R_{1/2} = 2.9\\pm0.6$ light-days. From the\nphotometric monitoring data, we inferred that the region emitting the $r$-band\nis $R_{1/2} = 2.2\\pm0.3$ light-days across. Furthermore, by assessing the\ngravitational redshift of the UV Fe III blend and combining it with the blend's\nmicrolensing-based size estimate, we calculated the central SMBH's mass to be\n$M_{BH} \\sim2 \\times 10^8 M_\\odot$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"g8tMm-zkyadkF_l4kLZfpGyMH6jijgvEX5TUOJ3PjFM","pdfSize":"782809"}
