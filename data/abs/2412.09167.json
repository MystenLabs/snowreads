  "abstract": "  A simple orbit classification constraint extension to stellar dynamical\nmodeling using Schwarzschild's method is demonstrated. The classification\nscheme used is the existing `orbit circularity' scheme (lambda_z) where orbits\nare split into four groups - hot, warm, cold and counter rotating orbits. Other\nschemes which can be related to the orbit weights are expected to be viable as\nwell. The results show that the classification constraint works well in\nmodeling. However, given that orbits in external galaxies are not observable,\nit is not clear how the orbit classification for any particular galaxy may be\ndetermined. Perhaps range constraints for different types of galaxies\ndetermined from cosmological simulations may offer a way forward.\n",
