  "abstract": "  We study the set of linear subspaces of a fixed dimension intersecting a\ngiven polytope. To describe this set as a semialgebraic subset of a\nGrassmannian, we introduce a Schubert arrangement of the polytope, defined by\nthe Chow forms of the polytope's faces of complementary dimension. We show that\nthe set of subspaces intersecting a specified family of faces is defined by\nfixing the sign of the Chow forms of their boundaries. We give inequalities\ndefining the set of stabbing subspaces in terms of sign conditions on the Chow\nform.\n",
