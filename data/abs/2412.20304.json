  "abstract": "  For an autonomous system of ordinary differential equations, the existence of\na meromorphic general solution is equivalent to the Painlev\\'e property, which\nis widely used to detect integrability. We find all meromorphic solutions of a\nmulti-parameter three-dimensional Lotka-Volterra system. Some cases correspond\nto particular choices of the parameters for which only some solutions are\nmeromorphic, while the general solution is branched. The main difficulty is to\nprove that all meromorphic solutions have been found. The proof relies on a\ndetailed study of local series expansions combined with value distribution\nresults from Nevanlinna theory.\n",
