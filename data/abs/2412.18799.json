  "abstract": "  Climate change is becoming a widely recognized risk factor of farmer-herder\nconflict in Africa. Using an 8 year dataset (Jan 2015 to Sep 2022) of detailed\nweather and terrain data across four African nations, we apply statistical and\nmachine learning methods to analyze pastoral conflict. We test hypotheses\nlinking these variables with pastoral conflict within each country using\ngeospatial and statistical analysis. Complementing this analysis are risk maps\nautomatically updated for decision-makers. Our models estimate which cells have\na high likelihood of experiencing pastoral conflict with high predictive\naccuracy and study the variation of this accuracy with the granularity of the\ncells.\n",
