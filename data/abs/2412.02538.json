In sixth generation\n(6G) networks, ubiquitous communication and computing resources allow large AI\nmodels to serve democratic large AI models-related services to enable real-time\napplications like autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and Internet of Things\n(IoT) ecosystems. However, the security considerations and sustainable\ncommunication resources limit the deployment of large AI models over\ndistributed wireless networks. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of\nprivacy, security, and trustworthy for distributed wireless large AI model\n(WLAM). In particular, a detailed privacy and security are analysis for\ndistributed WLAM is fist revealed. The classifications and theoretical findings\nabout privacy and security in distributed WLAM are discussed. Then the\ntrustworthy and ethics for implementing distributed WLAM are described.\nFinally, the comprehensive applications of distributed WLAM are presented in\nthe context of electromagnetic signal processing.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Information Theory","Computer Science/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"TwBQtDwjZER45qVksPrlnEvTAU1c_F_ZZSlKVWYJeqE","pdfSize":"985284"}
