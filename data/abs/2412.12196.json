However,\nthey also bring in a new channel for poisoning attacks, resulting in negative\nimpacts on society. Therefore, it is urgent to study this critical problem and\ndevelop effective strategies for defense. In this paper, we propose TrendSim,\nan LLM-based multi-agent system to simulate trending topics in social media\nunder poisoning attacks. Specifically, we create a simulation environment for\ntrending topics that incorporates a time-aware interaction mechanism,\ncentralized message dissemination, and an interactive system. Moreover, we\ndevelop LLM-based human-like agents to simulate users in social media, and\npropose prototype-based attackers to replicate poisoning attacks. Besides, we\nevaluate TrendSim from multiple aspects to validate its effectiveness. Based on\nTrendSim, we conduct simulation experiments to study four critical problems\nabout poisoning attacks on trending topics for social benefit.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Social and Information Networks","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RTWB_9OobYsJzPknlkrVIFGSGBdt_BYXXJ_qNf8IJPk","pdfSize":"1611057"}
