We rely on the\nadiabatic theory of strongly chirped DS and define the DS energy scaling in\nterms of dissipative soliton resonance (DSR). Three main experimentally\nverifiable signatures identify a transition to DSR: i) growth of a Lorentzian\nspike at the centrum of the DS spectrum, which resembles a spectral\ncondensation in Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), ii) saturation of the spectrum\nbroadening, and iii) asymptotical DS stretching. We connect the DSR breakup\nwith three critical factors: i) decoupling of two correlation scales inherent\nin strongly chirped DS, ii) resulting rise of the DS entropy with energy, which\nprovokes its disintegration, and iii) transition to a nonequilibrium phase,\nwhich is characterized by negative temperature. The breakup results in multiple\nstable DSs with lower energy. Theoretical results are in good qualitative\nagreement with the experimental data from a Kerr-lens mode-locked Cr$^{2+}$:ZnS\nchirped-pulse oscillator (CPO) that paves the way for optimizing high-energy\nfemtosecond pulse generation in solid-state CPO and all-normal-dispersion fiber\nlasers.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"byvxxtUauVeQUykEmdqaos6kBcBM1et6kMaLLXlqwI8","pdfSize":"4819255"}
