  "abstract": "  Recent advancements in high-fidelity dynamic scene reconstruction have\nleveraged dynamic 3D Gaussians and 4D Gaussian Splatting for realistic scene\nrepresentation. However, to make these methods viable for real-time\napplications such as AR/VR, gaming, and rendering on low-power devices,\nsubstantial reductions in memory usage and improvements in rendering efficiency\nare required. While many state-of-the-art methods prioritize lightweight\nimplementations, they struggle in handling scenes with complex motions or long\nsequences. In this work, we introduce Temporally Compressed 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (TC3DGS), a novel technique designed specifically to effectively\ncompress dynamic 3D Gaussian representations. TC3DGS selectively prunes\nGaussians based on their temporal relevance and employs gradient-aware\nmixed-precision quantization to dynamically compress Gaussian parameters. It\nadditionally relies on a variation of the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm in a\npost-processing step to further reduce storage by interpolating Gaussian\ntrajectories across frames. Our experiments across multiple datasets\ndemonstrate that TC3DGS achieves up to 67$\\times$ compression with minimal or\nno degradation in visual quality.\n",
