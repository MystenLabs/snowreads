  "abstract": "  Let $I$ be the ideal generated by the maximal minors of a matrix $X$ of\nindeterminates over a field and let $J$ denote the generic link, i.e., the most\ngeneral link, of $I$. The generators of the ideal $J$ are not known. We provide\nan explicit description of the lead terms of the generators of $J$ using\nGr\\\"obner degeneration: For a carefully chosen term order, the reduced\nGr\\\"obner basis of the generic link $J$ is a minimal set of its generators and\nthe initial ideal of $J$ is squarefree. We leverage this description of the\ninitial ideal to establish the equality of the symbolic and ordinary powers of\n$J$. Our analysis of the initial ideal readily yields the Gorenstein property\nof the associated graded ring of $J$, and, in positive characteristic, the\n$F$-rationality of the Rees algebra of $J$. Using the technique of $F$-split\nfiltrations, we further obtain the $F$-regularity of the blowup algebras of\n$J$.\n",
