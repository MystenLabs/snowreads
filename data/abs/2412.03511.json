  "abstract": "  We show that in the Ising pure $p$-spin model of spin glasses, shattering\ntakes place at all inverse temperatures $\\beta \\in (\\sqrt{(2 \\log p)/p},\n\\sqrt{2\\log 2})$ when $p$ is sufficiently large as a function of $\\beta$. Of\nspecial interest is the lower boundary of this interval which matches the large\n$p$ asymptotics of the inverse temperature marking the hypothetical dynamical\ntransition predicted in statistical physics. We show this as a consequence of a\n`soft' version of the overlap gap property which asserts the existence of a\ndistance gap of points of typical energy from a typical sample from the Gibbs\nmeasure. We further show that this latter property implies that stable\nalgorithms seeking to return a point of at least typical energy are confined to\nan exponentially rare subset of that super-level set, provided that their\nsuccess probability is not vanishingly small.\n",
