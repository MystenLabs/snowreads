  "abstract": "  Quantum states defined over a parameter space form a Grassmann manifold. To\ncapture the geometry of the associated gauge structure, gauge-invariant\nquantities are essential. We employ the projector of a multilevel system to\nquantify the quantum distance between states. Using the multidimensional\nscaling method, we transform the quantum distance into a reconstructed manifold\nembedded in Euclidean space. This approach is demonstrated with examples of\ntopological systems, showcasing their topological features within these\nmanifolds. Our method provides a comprehensive view of the manifold, rather\nthan focusing on local properties.\n",
