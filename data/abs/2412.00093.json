However, commercial\nlock-in amplifiers used for de-modulating the fluctuations exhibit a\nproblematic 1/f noise contribution, which imposes a hard lower limit on the\nrelative resistance noise that can be detected. We replace the lock-in\namplifier hardware by equivalent digital signal processing performed using\nopen-source software and inexpensive data acquisition systems. Our solution\noffers superior low-frequency noise performance with a reduction of the voltage\npower spectral density by about two orders of magnitude compared to high-end\ncommercial instruments.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"XsDifKxr_Cokv1dleZc1cyrDy1Iswg_jJnhvwO_7390","pdfSize":"1482304"}
