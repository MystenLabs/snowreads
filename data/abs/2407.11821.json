We explain how knowledge graph embeddings can be used to\napproximate probabilistic inference efficiently using the example of\nStatistical EL (SEL), a statistical extension of the lightweight Description\nLogic EL. We provide proofs for runtime and soundness guarantees, and\nempirically evaluate the runtime and approximation quality of our approach.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"3j4b6BBAS0N5YE_9XCrsfiOo4agueb1_7UFAcUfAk8M","pdfSize":"465452","objectId":"0x72c8b627d50f8946d5bf5b296423e71dfc793eb0f91290b567732a3327b048d9","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
