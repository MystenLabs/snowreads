  "abstract": "  \"Soft\" muons with a transverse momentum below 10 GeV are featured in many\nprocesses studied by the CMS experiment, such as decays of heavy-flavor hadrons\nor rare tau lepton decays. Maximizing the selection efficiency for these muons,\nwhile simultaneously suppressing backgrounds from long-lived light-flavor\nhadron decays, is therefore important for the success of the CMS physics\nprogram. Multivariate techniques have been shown to deliver better muon\nidentification performance than traditional selection techniques. To take full\nadvantage of the large data set currently being collected during Run 3 of the\nCERN LHC, a new multivariate classifier based on a gradient-boosted decision\ntree has been developed. It offers a significantly improved separation of\nsignal and background muons compared to a similar classifier used for the\nanalysis of the Run 2 data. The performance of the new classifier is evaluated\non a data set collected with the CMS detector in 2022 and 2023, corresponding\nto an integrated luminosity of 62 fb$^{-1}$.\n",
