This paper investigates the energy-absorbing\nproperties of four truss-lattice structures with two defined volume fractions\nof material in static compression experiments. The mass-specific energy\nabsorption is derived. The specimens are manufactured by SLA printing of\nviscoelastic polymeric material. Sustainability implies that the lattice\nstructures can withstand multiple loads and return to their original state\nafter some recovery. Additionally, we present finite element simulations of our\nexperiments and show that these calculations are, in principle, able to predict\nthe different responses of the lattices. Like in the experiments, the truncated\noctahedron-lattice structure proved to be the most effective for energy\nabsorption under strong compression.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"R7uZz6pS_xhnDx6wSs-nmrqmkoQg8P9sScFwzf6I8wk","pdfSize":"29979390"}
