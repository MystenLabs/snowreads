It can be useful or, depending on the complexity of the event\nstructure, even essential to employ modern analysis techniques in order to\nmeasure New-Physics effects. A particular class of such modern methods are\nMachine-Learning algorithms, which are becoming more and more popular in\nparticle physics. We attempt to gauge their potential in the study of\n$Vh(\\rightarrow b\\bar b)$ production processes, focusing on the leptonic decay\nchannels of the vector bosons. Specifically, we employ boosted decision trees\nusing the kinematical information of a given event to discriminate between\nsignal and background. Based on this analysis strategy, we derive bounds on\nfour dimension-6 SMEFT operators and subsequently compare them with the ones\nobtained from a conventional cut-and-count analysis. We find a mild improvement\nof $\\mathcal{O}(\\mathrm{few}\\, \\%)$ across the different operators.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zIxsR8rLl4SOwS1ZD_XN20eI9U4ZqLzjkOAFijbPORM","pdfSize":"967140","objectId":"0x416c8dec5a9f38e0e7149a9a50d724c87f28a154a2a7cbd3d4f4bb9a5f5f626b","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
