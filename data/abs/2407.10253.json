This problem is\nnoteworthy because it leads to substantial negative consequences for the\nstudent, both socially and economically, the educational institution and the\nlocal economy. This project aims to develop a predictive model that accurately\ndetects students early in their academic pursuit at risk of not graduating on\ntime. Various predictive models are developed to do this, and the best model,\nthe one with the highest performance, is selected. Using a dataset containing\ninformation from 24432 undergraduate students at the University of Puerto Rico\nat Mayaguez, the predictive performance of the models is evaluated in two\nscenarios: Group I includes both the first year of college and pre-college\nfactors, and Group II only considers pre-college factors. Overall, for both\nscenarios, the boosting model, trained on the oversampled dataset, is the most\nsuccessful at predicting who will not graduate on time.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1wucSI1_QtsiE6o35ZH2E5-8vGhTQPT-ODfAFCpPMQs","pdfSize":"565250"}
