There are two independent torsion subgroups in the cohomology.\nWhile one is associated to an orbifold construction of the SCFT, the other\nencodes the possibility of turning on a topologically non-trivial flat gerbe\nfor the NS-NS B-field. Inclusion of these data enriches mirror symmetry by\nproviding a refinement of the familiar structures and points to a\ngeneralization of the duality symmetry, where the topology of the flat gerbe\nenters on the same footing as the topology of the underlying manifold.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9bBA33cJjklmmWlmncU54hbh2vtgOBn6gVe0ipcZnbM","pdfSize":"747455","objectId":"0x3ea53aa576c9419959071af930febfe13d03c8bcb5ad1d9739f6e18ecd7edc0b","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
