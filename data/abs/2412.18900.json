In\nthis study, we assess the potential of alternate slot blowing to amplify force\nfluctuations. Pressurized air is ejected alternatingly from the top and bottom\nparts of the cylinder. Through experimentation in a low-speed wind tunnel\n($Re=8,000$), we show that the magnitude of lift fluctuations can be enhanced\nby up to a factor of three compared to the unforced flow when the actuation is\naligned with the natural vortex shedding frequency. Velocity field measurements\nindicate that this is caused by strong streamline bending whereas, at a higher\nforcing frequency, vortex shedding is suppressed. The results presented in this\narticle suggest that a significant increase in the dynamic load acting on a\ncylinder can be achieved with carefully chosen active flow control parameters,\nthereby promoting future energy harvesting applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DKJTJrevdXwH_ydLkKK1rW2wjtm-nvzy04Bw4dAskdM","pdfSize":"7059933"}
