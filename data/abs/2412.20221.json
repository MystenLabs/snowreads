TTLs have become the de-facto mechanism used to keep cached\ndata reasonably fresh (i.e., not too out of date with the backend). However,\nthe emergence of real-time applications requires tighter data freshness, which\nis impractical to achieve with TTLs. We discuss why this is the case, and\npropose a simple yet effective adaptive policy to achieve the desired\nfreshness.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Operating Systems","Computer Science/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computer Science/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xRoUZrGslfvwTUPc7pLNNAHsAZQHG7aJmsVVX6NHopw","pdfSize":"896581"}
