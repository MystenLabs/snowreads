As a result, a plethora of\nframeworks and guidelines have appeared to support practitioners in\nimplementing Trustworthy AI applications (TAI). However, little research has\nbeen done to investigate whether such frameworks are being used and how. In\nthis work, we study the vision AI practitioners have on TAI principles, how\nthey address them, and what they would like to have - in terms of tools,\nknowledge, or guidelines - when they attempt to incorporate such principles\ninto the systems they develop. Through a survey and semi-structured interviews,\nwe systematically investigated practitioners' challenges and needs in\ndeveloping TAI systems. Based on these practical findings, we highlight\nrecommendations to help AI practitioners develop Trustworthy AI applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lnxOWV3IO8NoPJFWmKa5Vq58rWBOxxA7-TNWxxYWHhg","pdfSize":"823079"}
