Drawing upon concepts from categorical logic, this\nabstract logic interprets formulas from context as subobjects in a specific\ncategory, e.g., Cartesian, regular, or coherent categories, Grothendieck, or\nelementary toposes. We proposed an entailment system formulated as a sequent\ncalculus which we proved complete. Building on this foundation, our current\nwork explores model theory within abstract logic. More precisely, we generalize\none of the most important and powerful classical model theory methods, namely\nthe ultraproduct method, and show its fundamental theorem, i.e., Los's theorem.\nThe result is shown as independently as possible of a given quantifier.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"z4h8osk60RcFdygfPqEeaC6s_sbUIQWCSQmqn2ZZy8E","pdfSize":"485365"}
