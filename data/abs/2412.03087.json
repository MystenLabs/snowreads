For this, we consider a two-dimensional thin film cooled down\nbelow the temperature of superconducting transition with the injected dc\nsupercurrent and exposed to an external electromagnetic field with a frequency\nsmaller than the superconducting gap. As a result, we predict the emergence of\na photoexcited quasiparticle current, and, as a consequence, oppositely\noriented stationary flow of Cooper pairs. The strength and direction of this\nphotoinduced supercurrent depend on (i) such material properties as the\neffective impurity scattering time and the nonequilibrium quasiparticles'\nenergy relaxation time and (ii) such electromagnetic field properties as its\nfrequency and polarization.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7_Vulpwv-vhyvFKJuT3P6gLt4NKWiimcJGNiqmdzhNU","pdfSize":"1043755"}
