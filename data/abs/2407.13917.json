This paper studies\nhow to introduce the popular positive linear satisfiability to neural networks.\nWe propose the first differentiable satisfiability layer based on an extension\nof the classic Sinkhorn algorithm for jointly encoding multiple sets of\nmarginal distributions. We further theoretically characterize the convergence\nproperty of the Sinkhorn algorithm for multiple marginals. In contrast to the\nsequential decision e.g.\\ reinforcement learning-based solvers, we showcase our\ntechnique in solving constrained (specifically satisfiability) problems by\none-shot neural networks, including i) a neural routing solver learned without\nsupervision of optimal solutions; ii) a partial graph matching network handling\ngraphs with unmatchable outliers on both sides; iii) a predictive network for\nfinancial portfolios with continuous constraints. To our knowledge, there\nexists no one-shot neural solver for these scenarios when they are formulated\nas satisfiability problems.
