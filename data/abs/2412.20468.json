  "abstract": "  This article discusses the evolving role of artificial intelligence (AI) in\nthe legal profession, focusing on its potential to streamline tasks such as\ndocument review, research, and contract drafting. However, challenges persist,\nparticularly the occurrence of \"hallucinations\" in AI models, where they\ngenerate inaccurate or misleading information, undermining their reliability in\nlegal contexts. To address this, the article proposes a novel framework\ncombining a mixture of expert systems with a knowledge-based architecture to\nimprove the precision and contextual relevance of AI-driven legal services.\nThis framework utilizes specialized modules, each focusing on specific legal\nareas, and incorporates structured operational guidelines to enhance\ndecision-making. Additionally, it leverages advanced AI techniques like\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Knowledge Graphs (KG), and Reinforcement\nLearning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to improve the system's accuracy. The\nproposed approach demonstrates significant improvements over existing AI\nmodels, showcasing enhanced performance in legal tasks and offering a scalable\nsolution to provide more accessible and affordable legal services. The article\nalso outlines the methodology, system architecture, and promising directions\nfor future research in AI applications for the legal sector.\n",
