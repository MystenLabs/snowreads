The topological drawing of the planar part of a graph allows\nrepresenting the planarization process by algebraic methods, without making any\ngeometric constructions on the plane. Constructing a rotation of graph vertices\nsolves two most important problems of graph theory simultaneously: the problem\nof testing a graph for planarity and the problem of constructing a topological\ndrawing of a planar graph. It is shown that the problem of constructing a\ndrawing of a non-planar graph can be reduced to the problem of constructing a\ndrawing of a planar graph, taking into account the introduction of additional\nvertices characterizing the intersection of edges. Naturally, the development\nof such a mathematical structure will make it possible to solve the following\nimportant problems of graph theory: testing the planarity of a graph,\nidentifying the largest planar subgraph of a graph, determining the thickness\nof a graph, obtaining a graph with a minimum number of intersections, etc.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"s9RLepYRwPUjNt3m6RpwCPYDqzkR461swF5TJGH_KXw","pdfSize":"2439907","objectId":"0xd05baac244c61b8027530e8a75f41bbb53a2f8b32abae587c5716a038ce669b4","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
