The choice of\nRydberg state has a huge impact on the strength and angular dependence of the\ninteractions, and so a detailed understanding of the underlying processes and\nresulting properties of the interactions is therefore key to select the most\nsuitable states for experiments. We study the van der Waals interactions in\nalkali atoms in detail and highlight the structures which allow an\nunderstanding and exploitation of the various interaction properties. A\nparticular theme is the identification of F\\\"orster resonances with $n_1 \\neq\nn_2$, which offer interaction potentials with a wide range of properties that\nmake them particularly interesting for experimental applications. A second\ntheme is a focus on the underlying structures that shape the angular dependency\nand sign of the interactions. This understanding -- instead of brute-force\ncalculations -- allows for a much simpler and more systematic search for\nsuitable pair states. These insights can be used for the selection of tailored\ninteraction potentials subject to experimental constraints and requirements. We\nuse rubidium as an example species in this work and also provide data for\ncesium and pair states that are coupled via two- or three-photon transitions,\ni.e. up to F states, in the appendix.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gKvqYELeKWfFKPfibFWcFBTjjQV0fKZQbmeZaR_g0ns","pdfSize":"19875953"}
