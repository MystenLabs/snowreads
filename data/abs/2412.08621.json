  "abstract": "  The separating Noether number of a finite group is the minimal positive\ninteger $d$ such that for any finite dimensional complex linear representation\nof the group, any two dictinct orbits can be distinguished by a polynomial\ninvariant of degree at most $d$. In the present paper its exact value is\ndetermined for all groups of order less than $32$, for all finite groups with a\ncyclic subgroup of index at most $2$, and for the direct product of a dihedral\ngroup with the $2$-element group. The results show in particular that unlike\nthe ordinary Noether number, the separating Noether number of a non-abelian\nfinite group may well be equal to the separating Noether number of a proper\ndirect factor of the group. Most of the results are proved for the case of a\ngeneral (possibly finite) base field containing an element whose multiplicative\norder equals the size of the group.\n",
