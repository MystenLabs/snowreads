The model displays two relevant\nspatial scales pointing out to a macroscopic phase and a microscopic phase,\ninteracting on disjoint inclusions. The shrinkage or the growth of the\ninclusions is governed by a modified Gibbs-Thomson law depending on the\nmacroscopic temperature, but without accessing curvature information. We use\nthe Hanzawa transformation to transform the problem onto a fixed reference\ndomain. Then a fixed-point argument is employed to demonstrate the\nwell-posedness of the system for a finite time interval. Due to the model's\nnonlinearities and the macroscopic parameters, which are given by differential\nequations that depend on the size of the inclusions, the problem is\ncomputationally expensive to solve numerically. We introduce a precomputing\napproach that solves multiple cell problems in an offline phase and uses an\ninterpolation scheme afterward to determine the needed parameters.\nAdditionally, we propose a semi-implicit time-stepping method to resolve the\nnonlinearity of the problem. We investigate the errors of both the precomputing\nand time-stepping procedures and verify the theoretical results via numerical\nsimulations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1fn3XT5UdJXIIippfU8squMjvwycmq5Gh49YbZdC16s","pdfSize":"884941"}
