  "abstract": "  People exhibit unique emotional responses. In the same scenario, the\nemotional reactions of two individuals can be either similar or vastly\ndifferent. For instance, consider one person's reaction to an invitation to\nsmoke versus another person's response to a query about their sleep quality.\nThe identification of these individual traits through the observation of common\nphysical parameters opens the door to a wide range of applications, including\npsychological analysis, criminology, disease prediction, addiction control, and\nmore. While there has been previous research in the fields of psychometrics,\ninertial sensors, computer vision, and audio analysis, this paper introduces a\nnovel technique for identifying human traits in real time using brainwave data.\nTo achieve this, we begin with an extensive study of brainwave data collected\nfrom 80 participants using a portable EEG headset. We also conduct a\nstatistical analysis of the collected data utilizing box plots. Our analysis\nuncovers several new insights, leading us to a groundbreaking unified approach\nfor identifying diverse human traits by leveraging machine learning techniques\non EEG data. Our analysis demonstrates that this proposed solution achieves\nhigh accuracy. Moreover, we explore two deep-learning models to compare the\nperformance of our solution. Consequently, we have developed an integrated,\nreal-time trait identification solution using EEG data, based on the insights\nfrom our analysis. To validate our approach, we conducted a rigorous user\nevaluation with an additional 20 participants. The outcomes of this evaluation\nillustrate both high accuracy and favorable user ratings, emphasizing the\nrobust potential of our proposed method to serve as a versatile solution for\nhuman trait identification.\n",
