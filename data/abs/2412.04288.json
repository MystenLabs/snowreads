  "abstract": "  The main result of this note asserts that a strong form of the Matroid Minor\nConjecture due to J. Draisma is not true, i.e., there exist properly ascending\nchains of $S_\\infty$-stable ideals in the affine coordinate ring of the affine\ninfinite Grassmannian, where $S_\\infty$ is the infinite symmetric group. In\nfact, we explicitly construct such an ascending chain. His conjectures on\ntopological noetherian property for the affine infinite Grassmannian remain\nopen though.\n",
