  "abstract": "  Holographically-designed aperiodic lattices have proven to be an exciting\nengineering technique for achieving electrically switchable single- or\nmulti-frequency emissions in terahertz (THz) semiconductor lasers. Here, we\nemploy the nonlinear transfer matrix modeling method to investigate\nmulti-wavelength nonlinear (sum- or difference-) frequency generation within an\nintegrated THz (idler) laser cavity that also supports optical (pump and\nsignal) waves. The laser cavity includes an aperiodic lattice, which engineers\nthe idler photon lifetimes and effective refractive indices. The key findings\nare: (i) the nonlinear conversion efficiency reveals resonant enhancement at\nthose idler frequencies where the photon lifetime is high; (ii) the resonant\nphase-matching process between the pump and idler waves has a one-to-one link\nwith absence of any other dispersion, the lowest threshold, multi-wavelength\ndefect modes of the aperiodic lattice laser have degenerate phase-matched pump\nfrequencies. This set of results will potentially have a significant impact on\nthe wavelength multiplexing in electronically switchable THz-over-fiber\ncommunication systems [1].\n",
