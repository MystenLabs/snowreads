A key challenge in NNUE training is the creation of\nhigh-quality datasets, particularly in complex domains like chess, where\ntactical and strategic evaluations are essential. However, methods for\nconstructing effective datasets remain poorly understood and under-documented.\nIn this paper, we propose an algorithm for generating and filtering datasets\ncomposed of \"quiet\" positions that are stable and free from tactical\nvolatility. Our approach provides a clear methodology for dataset creation,\nwhich can be replicated and generalized across various evaluation functions.\nTesting demonstrates significant improvements in engine performance, confirming\nthe effectiveness of our method.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"H5JCJ76XUkD8jSSoV0yGm8O4QGTbnrHdgWTnbPjdWG8","pdfSize":"523986"}
