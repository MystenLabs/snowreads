By incorporating key physical principles,\nit effectively links cloud formation, electrification, and lightning\ngeneration. The simulation also encompasses various thunderstorm types and\ntheir corresponding lightning activities.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Computer Science/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9RzXI-bMy5UzHWM4o7NwvB3oTYtykfM8po-8YL2csgs","pdfSize":"19337749"}
