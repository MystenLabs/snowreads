We show how $\\Omega_{rs}$ is related to the\ntensor product $\\rho_r\\otimes \\bar{\\rho}_s$ of two representations of the upper\nBorel subalgebra of $U_q(\\widehat{\\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$. This result is analogous\nto the factorization property of the Verma module of\n$U_q(\\widehat{\\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$ at generic-$q$ in terms of two q-oscillator\nrepresentation of the Borel subalgebra - a key step in the construction of the\nQ-operator. We construct short exact sequences of the different representations\nand use the results to construct Q operators that satisfy TQ relations for\n$q^N=1$ for both the 6-vertex and $\\tau_2$ models.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"6cMK_t82_vHQOjbhwMmFnnsP3RpE63z37mFVx1C3qZM","pdfSize":"341276"}
