Here, we present an\nexperimental demonstration of quantum control using a physics-informed neural\nnetwork (PINN). PINN's salient feature is how it encodes the entire control\nsequence in terms of its network parameters. This feature enables the control\nsequence to be later adopted to any hardware with optimal time discretization,\nwhich contrasts with conventional methods involving a priory time\ndiscretization. Here, we discuss two important quantum information tasks: gate\nsynthesis and state preparation. First, we demonstrate quantum gate synthesis\nby designing a two-qubit CNOT gate and experimentally implementing it on a\nheteronuclear two-spin NMR register. Second, we demonstrate quantum state\npreparation by designing a control sequence to efficiently transfer the thermal\nstate into the long-lived singlet state and experimentally implement it on a\nhomonuclear two-spin NMR register. We present a detailed numerical analysis of\nthe PINN control sequences regarding bandwidth, discretization levels, control\nfield errors, and external noise.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dTqgijnAClNG2MVHj2gFL6KP3nV9gkeZyozt28cQ8Oo","pdfSize":"690516"}
