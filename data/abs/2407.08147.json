Reduplication is a deliberate morphological process used\nto express grammatical, semantic, or pragmatic nuances, while repetition is\noften unintentional and indicative of disfluency. This paper presents the first\nlarge-scale study of reduplication and repetition in speech using computational\nlinguistics. We introduce IndicRedRep, a new publicly available dataset\ncontaining Hindi, Telugu, and Marathi text annotated with reduplication and\nrepetition at the word level. We evaluate transformer-based models for\nmulti-class reduplication and repetition token classification, utilizing the\nReparandum-Interregnum-Repair structure to distinguish between the two\nphenomena. Our models achieve macro F1 scores of up to 85.62% in Hindi, 83.95%\nin Telugu, and 84.82% in Marathi for reduplication-repetition classification.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pqEjk486LZb_uFC32iFyVrnyQVfGVpG1mRAS2xApS-4","pdfSize":"694048"}
