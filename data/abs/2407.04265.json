Our\nsegmentation gives convex and concave curves. To do so, we form curve support\nregions by grouping pixels of the thresholded filter response. Then, we model\neach support region boundary by Fourier series and extract the corresponding\nparametric curve segment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XhiERxnUyy6ZkDAnB5jauZJNLBlh_UXLtCuvaRy-fPo","pdfSize":"1110804"}
