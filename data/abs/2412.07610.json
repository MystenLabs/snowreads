  "abstract": "  Nonlinear magnetic interactions provide access to complex quantum spin\ndynamics and thus enable the study of intriguing physical phenomena. However,\nthese interactions are often dominated by the linear Zeeman effect, which can\ncomplicate system dynamics and make their analysis more challenging. In this\narticle, we theoretically and experimentally introduce a method to induce the\nquadratic Zeeman effect while effectively compensating for its linear\ncounterpart. By isolating the quadratic Zeeman contributions, we demonstrate\nand analyze controlled superposition generation between specific magnetic\nsublevels in room-temperature rubidium-87 atoms. This study opens avenues for\ncontrolling any spin system, regardless of its total angular momentum, which we\nplan to explore further in the context of quantum-state tomography and\nengineering (e.g., spin squeezing).\n",
