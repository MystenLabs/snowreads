Real-world implementations, however,\ndeviate from the idealized all-to-all connectivity, raising questions about the\nrobustness of its chaotic properties. In this work, we investigate a quadratic\nSYK model with distance-dependent interactions governed by a power-law decay.\nBy analytically and numerically studying the spectral form factor (SFF), we\nuncover how the single particle transitions manifest in the many-body system.\nWhile the SFF demonstrates robustness under slightly reduced interaction\nranges, further suppression leads to a breakdown of perturbation theory and new\nspectral regimes, marked by a higher dip and the emergence of a secondary\nplateau. Our results highlight the interplay between single-particle\ncriticality and many-body dynamics, offering new insights into the quantum\nchaos-to-localization transition and its reflection in spectral statistics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"blkXLf6ok_scpdOVuuCvsBJ5jsWrmEf0hU7G3P-_iHg","pdfSize":"1519129"}
