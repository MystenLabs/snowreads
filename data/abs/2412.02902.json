{"id":"2412.02902","title":"$\\left(p,q\\right)$-adic Analysis and the Collatz Conjecture","authors":"Maxwell Charles Siegel","authorsParsed":[["Siegel","Maxwell Charles",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2024 23:08:47 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-05","timestamp":1733267327000,"abstract":"  What use can there be for a function from the $p$-adic numbers to the\n$q$-adic numbers, where $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes? The traditional\nanswer, courtesy of the half-century old theory of non-archimedean functional\nanalysis: not much. It turns out this judgment was premature.\n'$\\left(p,q\\right)$-adic analysis' of this sort appears to be naturally suited\nfor studying the infamous Collatz map and similar arithmetical dynamical\nsystems. Given such a map $H:\\mathbb{Z}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{Z}$, one can\nconstruct a function $\\chi_{H}:\\mathbb{Z}_{p}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{Z}_{q}$ for an\nappropriate choice of distinct primes $p,q$ with the property that\n$x\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\backslash\\left\\{ 0\\right\\} $ is a periodic point of $H$ if and\nonly if there is a $p$-adic integer\n$\\mathfrak{z}\\in\\left(\\mathbb{Q}\\cap\\mathbb{Z}_{p}\\right)\\backslash\\left\\{\n0,1,2,\\ldots\\right\\} $ so that $\\chi_{H}\\left(\\mathfrak{z}\\right)=x$. By\ngeneralizing Monna-Springer integration theory and establishing a\n$\\left(p,q\\right)$-adic analogue of the Wiener Tauberian Theorem, one can show\nthat the question 'is $x\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\backslash\\left\\{ 0\\right\\} $ a periodic\npoint of $H$?' is essentially equivalent to 'is the span of the translates of\nthe Fourier transform of $\\chi_{H}\\left(\\mathfrak{z}\\right)-x$ dense in an\nappropriate non-archimedean function space?' This presents an exciting new\nfrontier in Collatz research, and these methods can be used to study\nCollatz-type dynamical systems on the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ for any\n$d\\geq1$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"j3rCePIHD0iRP_yj1MP-28WbmNnBZwqaxPgJpQTANc0","pdfSize":"3810783"}
