This type of sound can be controlled through the amplitudes\nof certain harmonics of the circular distribution of the inflow velocity.\nAttainable goals of such a controlled distortion of f (x) are formulated as\nfuzzy targets and required inequalities relating the integral characteristics\nof f (x) with the coefficients of the corresponding Fourier expansion are\nproven.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kf6ZUeAbiNf2DHP2R7r7VyBtvu-l5-JvOPtDgNiuUfc","pdfSize":"93378"}
