  "abstract": "  In holonomic quantum computation, quantum logic gates are realized by cyclic\nparallel transport of the computational space. The resulting quantum gate\ncorresponds to the holonomy associated with the closed path traced by the\ncomputational space. The isoholonomic inequality for gates establishes a\nfundamental lower bound on the path length of such cyclic transports, which\ndepends only on the spectrum of the holonomy, that is, the eigenvalues of the\nimplemented quantum gate. The isoholonomic inequality also gives rise to an\nestimate of the minimum time required to execute a holonomic quantum gate,\nunderscoring the central role of the inequality in quantum computation. In this\npaper, we show that when the codimension of the computational space is\nsufficiently large, any quantum gate can be implemented using a parallel\ntransporting Hamiltonian in a way that saturates the isoholonomic inequality\nand the corresponding time estimate. We call such implementations tight. The\ntreatment presented here is constructive and lays the foundation for the\ndevelopment of efficient and optimal implementation strategies in holonomic\nquantum computation.\n",
