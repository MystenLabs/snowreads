  "abstract": "  We propose a highly efficient and accurate methodology for generating\nsynthetic financial market data using a diffusion model approach. The synthetic\ndata produced by our methodology align closely with observed market data in\nseveral key aspects: (i) they pass the two-sample Cramer - von Mises test for\nportfolios of assets, and (ii) Q - Q plots demonstrate consistency across\nquantiles, including in the tails, between observed and generated market data.\nMoreover, the covariance matrices derived from a large set of synthetic market\ndata exhibit significantly lower condition numbers compared to the estimated\ncovariance matrices of the observed data. This property makes them suitable for\nuse as regularized versions of the latter. For model training, we develop an\nefficient and fast algorithm based on numerical integration rather than Monte\nCarlo simulations. The methodology is tested on a large set of equity data.\n",
