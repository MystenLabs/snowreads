However, many\nexisting methods rely on subroutines, in particular the Hadamard test, that are\nchallenging on near-term quantum hardware. Motivated by this problem, we\npresent a quantum Krylov method that uses only time evolutions and recovery\nprobabilities, making it well adapted for current quantum computers. This is\nsupplemented with a classical post-processing derivative estimation algorithm.\nThe method ultimately estimates the eigenvalues of the commutator\nsuper-operator $X\\to[H,X]$, so we declare it a super-Krylov method. We propose\napplying this method to estimate the ground-state energy of two classes of\nHamiltonians: where either the highest energy is easily computable, or where\nthe lowest and highest energies have the same absolute value. We prove that the\nresulting ground energy estimate converges in the noise-free regime and provide\na classical numerical demonstration of the method in the presence of noise.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"y4m-O31M9Sr0DIIbfclk-t-XM5PdTg0yZ3yeYT95WCM","pdfSize":"2045830"}
