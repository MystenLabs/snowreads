  "abstract": "  We introduce a simple, efficient and accurate nonnegative preserving\nnumerical scheme for simulating the square-root process. The novel idea is to\nsimulate the integrated square-root process first instead of the square-root\nprocess itself. Numerical experiments on realistic parameter sets, applied for\nthe integrated process and the Heston model, display high precision with a very\nlow number of time steps. As a bonus, our scheme yields the exact limiting\nInverse Gaussian distributions of the integrated square-root process with only\none single time-step in two scenarios: (i) for high mean-reversion and\nvolatility-of-volatility regimes, regardless of maturity; and (ii) for long\nmaturities, independent of the other parameters.\n",
