These datasets include a\nmonolingual dataset, a parallel dataset with Russian, a parallel dataset with\nEnglish, and an audio dataset. Each dataset is meticulously curated to serve\nvarious applications such as machine translation, linguistic analysis, and\nspeech recognition, providing valuable resources for scholars and developers\nworking with the Chuvash language. Together, these datasets represent a\nsignificant step towards preserving and promoting the Chuvash language in the\ndigital age.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"dmgcewYdmIhYHKU_OI62_wwOSzVI7T3RAmTOHwLenz4","pdfSize":"53653"}
