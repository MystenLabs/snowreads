Atypical\nbehavior patterns in a long, untrimmed video can serve as biomarkers for\nchildren with ASD. In this paper, we propose a video-based weakly-supervised\nmethod that takes spatio-temporal features of long videos to learn typical and\natypical behaviors for autism detection. On top of that, we propose a shallow\nTCN-MLP network, which is designed to further categorize the severity score. We\nevaluate our method on actual evaluation videos of children with autism\ncollected and annotated (for severity score) by clinical professionals.\nExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of behavioral biomarkers\nthat could help clinicians in autism spectrum analysis.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eRpwy9NK1EA2_jnW0mE5O3CKDKrcMlIW66w4kbpQHU4","pdfSize":"628653"}
