In this paper,\nwe first extend the Demazure product to the (infinite) set of all biwords on\n$\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$, or equivalently, the set of all $n \\times n$ nonnegative\ninteger matrices. We define this product diagrammatically, via braid-like\ngraphs we call kelp beds, since they significantly generalize the seaweeds\nintroduced by Tiskin (2015). Our motivation for this extended Demazure product\narises from optimization theory, in particular the semigroup of all $(n+1)\n\\times (n+1)$ simple nonnegative integer Monge matrices equipped with the\ndistance (i.e., min-plus) product. As our main result, we show that this\nsemigroup of Monge matrices is isomorphic to the semigroup of biwords equipped\nwith the extended Demazure product. We exploit this isomorphism to write down\ngenerating functions for the growth series of the Monge matrices with respect\nto certain natural matrix norms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XPWSHLvZaZm7Sk5KwF-qjNrCl998VOc1lZ8HAOurqy0","pdfSize":"273068"}
