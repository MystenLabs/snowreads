OSIS\nOvary (Online System for Image Segmentation for the Ovary) has been conceived\naiming to aid the management of the workflow in follicle tracking, one of the\nmost iterative procedures in cycle monitoring during ovarian stimulation. In\nthe present study, we compared OSIS Ovary (as three-dimensional\nultrasound-based automated system) with the two-dimensional manual standard\nmeasurement method, in order to assess the reliability of the main measurements\nobtained to track follicle growth during ovarian stimulation cycles, the\nfollicle size and count. Based on the mean follicle diameter and follicle count\nvalues obtained, the Pearson/intraclass correlation coefficients were\n0.976/0.987 and 0.804/0.889 in >=10mm follicles, 0.989/0.994 and 0.809/0.867 in\n>=13mm follicles and 0.995/0.997 and 0.791/0.840 in >=16mm follicles. The mean\ndifference (MnD) for the mean diameter and follicle count was, respectively,\n0.759/0.161 in >=10mm follicles, 0.486/1.033 in >=13mm follicles and\n0.784/0.486 in >=16mm follicles. The upper and lower limits of agreement (ULA\nand LLA) were 3.641/2.123 and 5.392/3.070 in >=10mm follicles, 3.496/2.522 and\n4.285/2.218 in >=13mm follicles, and 3.723/2.153 and 2.432/1.459 in >=16mm\nfollicles. The limits of agreement range (LoAR) were 5.764/8.462 in >=10mm\nfollicles, 6.048/6.503 in >=13mm follicles and 5.876/3.891 in >=16mm follicles.\nP<0.05 was considered for all calculations. As three-dimensional\nultrasound-based automated system in comparison with two-dimensional manual\nmethod standard, we found OSIS Ovary as a reliable tool to track follicle\ngrowth during ovarian stimulation cycles\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Tissues and Organs","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"gBFF0xSs1MSq4WmsZ3KE1QSb-aTdwHE70Xl9Z2r-Z80","pdfSize":"554128"}
