  "abstract": "  From a study of the subleading structure of the asymptotic equations of\nmotion in Einstein-Yang-Mills theory, we construct charges that are conserved\nup to quadratic order in non-radiative vacuum. We then show that these higher\nspin charges obey the celestial $sw_{1+\\infty}$ symmetry algebra found earlier\nfrom the OPE of positive-helicity conformally soft gluons and gravitons.\n",
