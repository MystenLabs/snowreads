Among these,\nrecovery techniques stand out as vital methods, playing significant roles in\nboth post-processing and pre-processing. This paper provides an overview of\nrecent developments in recovery techniques and their applications in adaptive\ncomputations. The discussion encompasses both gradient recovery and Hessian\nrecovery methods. To establish the superconvergence properties of these\ntechniques, two theoretical frameworks are introduced. Applications of these\nmethods are demonstrated in constructing asymptotically exact {\\it a\nposteriori} error estimators for second-order elliptic equations, fourth-order\nelliptic equations, and interface problems. Numerical experiments are performed\nto evaluate the asymptotic exactness of recovery type a posteriori error\nestimators.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"T32dnb6yvDqQF84at2CyCeQKRwBgDdAvTnst14CZaDo","pdfSize":"6199598"}
