Based on the leading\ntheories explaining this condition, vulnerability should be predicted by a\nperson's years of real-life experience before using a VR device and years of VR\nexperience after. A questionnaire was filled out on susceptibility to motion\nsickness in VR by people on VR-related forums. Results from the survey show\nthat the condition has a significant relationship with age or experience\noutside the environment.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"o9wipkp0V9V1WBVT4J2M6uU3-oyLBMBDbiQNKsSAzCw","pdfSize":"281994"}
