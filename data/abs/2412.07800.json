Zeros in the partition function indicates a\nphase transition, while the presence of zeros in the Loschmidt amplitude\nindicates a dynamical quantum phase transition. Based on the classical-quantum\ncorrespondence, we demonstrate that the partition function of a classical Ising\nmodel is equivalent to the Loschmidt amplitude in non-Hermitian dynamics,\nthereby mapping an Ising model with variable system size to the non-Hermitian\ndynamics. It follows that the Yang-Lee zeros and the Yang-Lee edge singularity\nof the classical Ising model correspond to the critical times of the dynamic\nquantum phase transitions and the exceptional point of the non-Hermitian\nHamiltonian, respectively. Our work reveals an inner connection between\nYang-Lee zeros and non-Hermitian dynamics, offering a dynamic characterization\nof the former.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GtbGzyZ8EreQAEVyfdoYkLj_5oZ_xgCCzN-CVKOxdqI","pdfSize":"2029987"}
