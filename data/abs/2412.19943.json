  "abstract": "  How hard is it to program $n$ robots to move about a long narrow aisle while\nmaking a series of $r-2$ intermediate stops, provided only $w$ of the robots\ncan fit across the width of the aisle? In this paper, we answer this question\nby calculating the $r^{\\text{th}}$-sequential topological complexity of\n$\\text{conf}(n,w)$, the ordered configuration space of $n$ open unit-diameter\ndisks in the infinite strip of width $w$. We prove that as long as $n$ is\ngreater than $w$, the $r^{\\text{th}}$-sequential topological complexity of\n$\\text{conf}(n,w)$ is $r\\big(n-\\big\\lceil\\frac{n}{w}\\big\\rceil\\big)$. This\nshows that any non-looping program moving the $n$ robots between arbitrary\ninitial and final configurations, with $r-2$ intermediate stops, must consider\nat least $r\\big(n-\\big\\lceil\\frac{n}{w}\\big\\rceil\\big)$ cases.\n",
