In this work, we reveal a\nquantum geometry origin of EMCA by a chiral rectangular lattice model that\nresembles a chiral organic conductor (DM-EDT-TTF)${}_2$ClO${}_4$ studied for\nEMCA recently and exhibits symmetry-protected Dirac bands similar to those of\ngraphene. Compared to the semiclassical term, we find that Dirac states\ncontribute significantly to EMCA by the quantum metric when Fermi energy is\nclose to the Dirac point. Besides, we discovered topological insulator state\ncan emerge once SOC is added to our chiral model lattice. Our work paves a path\nto understand quantum geometry in the magneto-transport of chiral materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ElKDfRKimJZRUkd73-Z6oEfD6H5oW_bKP3oB1OnM48s","pdfSize":"1701450"}
