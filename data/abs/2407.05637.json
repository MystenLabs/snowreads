Although the field of organic electronics provides a potential\nsolution to this issue, research and optimization is still majorly carried out\non glass or plastic substrates. Additionally, the fabrication of organic\ndevices requiring transparent electrodes is fraught with complex techniques and\nexpensive materials which limit widespread implementation and sustainability\ngoals. Here, we show that the quasi-fractal lignocellulose structures extracted\nfrom natural leaves can be successfully modified to be used as biodegradable\nsubstrates as well as electrodes for optoelectronic applications. Chemically\ncoating the microstructures of these leaf skeletons with metals results in\nquasi-transparent, flexible electrodes having sheet resistances below 1 ohm/sq.\nand a concomitant current carrying capacity as high as 6 A over a 2.5*2.5 cm2\nleaf electrode, all while maintaining broadband optical transmittance values of\naround 80%.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"YFlXSRlw8PDPxG4VgsnVNcAXZ9dNfHPnDHjwcWNKPRg","pdfSize":"512719"}
