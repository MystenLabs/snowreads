Nevertheless, there is not\nmuch literature on collision detection for point cloud models. This paper\npresents a novel collision detection algorithm for large point cloud models\nusing voxels, octrees and bounding spheres hierarchies (BSH). The scene graph\nis divided in voxels. The objects of each voxel are organized into an octree.\nDue to the high number of points in the scene, each non-empty cell of the\noctree is organized in a bounding sphere hierarchy, based on an R-tree\nhierarchy like structure. The BSH hierarchies are used to group neighboring\npoints and filter out very quickly parts of objects that do not interact with\nother models. Points derived from laser scanned data typically are not\nsegmented and can have arbitrary spatial resolution thus introducing\ncomputational and modeling issues. We address these issues and our results show\nthat the proposed collision detection algorithm effectively finds intersections\nbetween point cloud models since it is able to reduce the number of bounding\nvolume checks and updates.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aMZOODj3pmKne01O-uIwIjc3v5cQ6t3gR1VbBRHtZAc","pdfSize":"789333"}
