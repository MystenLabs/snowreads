This game can be seen\nas an instance of generic interactive hybrid systems as it involves interaction\nwith both virtual and real, tangible elements. We present a thorough user\nevaluation about various aspects of the gameplay in order to answer the\nquestion as to whether hybrid gameplay involving both real and virtual\ninterfaces and elements is more captivating and preferred by users, than\nstandard (baseline) gameplay with only virtual elements. We use multiple\nindustry standard user study questionnaires to try and answer this question. We\nalso try to determine whether the game facilitates understanding of the spatial\nmoves required to solve a Rubik's Cube, and the efficacy of a tangible puzzle\ninterface to a tabletop AR game.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Bx4iQbec21S_hUY6KmD7Bo_wJjFVvSYrbkzS2BQQ3L8","pdfSize":"10539934"}
