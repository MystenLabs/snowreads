  "abstract": "  We generalize a recent ``AdS S-matrix\" formulation for interacting massive\nscalars on AdS spacetimes to the case of massive vector fields. This method\nrelies on taking the infinite radius limit for scattering processes\nperturbatively, which is analyzed using Witten diagrams in the momentum space\nformulation of global AdS with embedding space coordinates. It recovers the\nS-matrix with subleading corrections in powers of the inverse AdS radius about\na flat spacetime region within the bulk. We first derive the massive vector\nbulk-to-boundary and bulk-to-bulk propagators within this perturbation theory.\nAs an example, we consider the Abelian Higgs Model in a certain regime of the\ncoupling parameter space to model an interacting Proca theory on AdS\nspacetimes. We specifically compute the AdS S-matrix for a process involving\nmassive external vector fields mediated by a massive scalar. We lastly discuss\npossible massless limit of propagators within this perturbative framework.\n",
