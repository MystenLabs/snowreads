  "abstract": "  We explore the robustness of complex networks against physical damage. We\nfocus on spatially embedded network models and datasets where links are\nphysical objects or physically transfer some quantity, which can be disrupted\nat any point along its trajectory. To simulate physical damage, we tile the\nnetworks with boxes of equal size and sequentially damage them. By introducing\nan intersection graph to keep track of the links passing through tiles, we\nsystematically analyze the connectivity of the network and explore how the\nphysical layout and the topology of the network jointly affect its percolation\nthreshold. We show that random layouts make networks extremely vulnerable to\nphysical damage, driven by the presence of very elongated links, and that\nhigher-dimensional embeddings further increase their vulnerability. We compare\nthis picture against targeted physical damages, showing that it accelerates\nnetwork dismantling and yields non-trivial geometric patterns. Finally, we\napply our framework to several empirical networks, from airline networks to\nvascular systems and the brain, showing qualitative agreement with the\ntheoretical predictions.\n",
