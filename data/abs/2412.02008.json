We\nshow that for population protocols running on a complete interaction graph with\nn>=2, if R(<x,y>) is a stably computable predicate such that R(x,y) holds for\nat least one y for each x, then R(x,y) is a stably computable relation. In\ncontrast, the converse is not necessarily true unless R(x,y) holds for exactly\none y for each x.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"qwiSPRO0GmLZBQDRPZF4-Rl0PgPbbW6tEIRcTJp-3oo","pdfSize":"156348"}
