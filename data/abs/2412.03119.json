  "abstract": "  The aim of this paper is to study degenerate Eulerian polynomials and\ndegenerate Eulerian numbers, respectively as degenerate versions of the\nEulerian polynomials and the Eulerian numbers, and to derive some of their\nproperties. Specifically, we derive an identity, recursive relations,\ngenerating function and degenerate version of Worpitzky's identity for the\ndegenerate Eulerian polynomials and numbers. In addition, we obtain several\nresults involving the degenerate Stirling numbers of the second kind and the\ndegenerate Bernoulli numbers as well as the degenerate Eulerian numbers.\n",
