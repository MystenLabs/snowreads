We set out to investigate the suitability of using\nopen-source training data to monitor levels of anti-LGBTQ+ content on social\nmedia across different national-varieties of English. Our findings suggests the\nsocial and cultural alignment of open-source hate speech data sets influences\nthe predicted outputs. Furthermore, the keyword-search approach of anti-LGBTQ+\nslurs in the development of open-source training data encourages detection\nmodels to overfit on slurs; therefore, anti-LGBTQ+ content may go undetected.\nWe recommend combining empirical outputs with qualitative insights to ensure\nthese systems are fit for purpose.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3XRz39Aj35UD3u07dkUeAS3zJrNn7LZhx_v3OJX83Tg","pdfSize":"1056614"}
