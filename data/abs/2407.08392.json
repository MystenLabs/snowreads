The goal is to find the shortest\npossible tour that visits each location exactly once and returns to the\nstarting location. Inspired by the fact that general TSP cannot be approximated\nin polynomial time within any constant factor, while metric TSP admits a\n(slightly better than) $1.5$-approximation in polynomial time, Zhou, Li and Guo\n[Zhou et al., ISAAC '22] introduced a parameter that measures the distance of a\ngiven TSP instance from the metric case. They gave an FPT $3$-approximation\nalgorithm parameterized by $k$, where $k$ is the number of triangles in which\nthe edge costs violate the triangle inequality. In this paper, we design a\n$2.5$-approximation algorithm that runs in FPT time, improving the result of\n[Zhou et al., ISAAC '22].\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cp05nc1iDZQ_ir1nUfSBUlb2vESeqGq7NhVFWqcPdYM","pdfSize":"514714"}
