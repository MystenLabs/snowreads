However, such problems are\ncomputationally expensive to solve using modern high-order numerical methods.\nIn order to address this issue, efficient, node-centered edge-based schemes are\ncurrently being developed. In these schemes, a median-dual tessellation of the\nspace-time domain is constructed based on an initial triangulation.\nUnfortunately, it is not straightforward to construct median-dual regions or\ndeduce their properties on triangulations for $d \\geq 4$. In this work, we\nprovide the first rigorous definition of median-dual regions on triangulations\nin any number of dimensions. In addition, we present the first methods for\ncalculating the geometric properties of these dual regions. We introduce a new\nmethod for computing the hypervolume of a median-dual region in $\\mathbb{R}^d$.\nFurthermore, we provide a new approach for computing the directed-hyperarea\nvectors for facets of a median-dual region in $\\mathbb{R}^{4}$. These geometric\nproperties are key for facilitating the construction of node-centered\nedge-based schemes in higher dimensions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Wk_qp11pBZUymYEP6DoI-Y3a3ujI-_76OlwBsC0kJ_s","pdfSize":"1341110"}
