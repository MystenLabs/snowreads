This energy storage can\nbe used as backup generation through the use of vehicle-to-grid (V2G)\ntechnology, where electricity is sent back from EV batteries to the grid. With\nenough participation from EV owners, V2G can mitigate outages during grid\nemergencies. In order to investigate a practical application of V2G, this study\nleverages a vast array of real-world data, such as survey results on V2G\nparticipation willingness, historical outage data within ERCOT, current EV\nregistrations, and demographic data. This data informs realistic emergency grid\nscenarios with V2G support using a synthetic transmission grid for Travis\nCounty. The results find that as EV ownership rises in the coming years, the\nsimultaneous facilitation of bidirectional charging availability would allow\nfor V2G to play a substantial role in preventing involuntary load shed as a\nresult of emergencies like winter storms.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computer Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"0JJabZq4M_sJyicvn_Svzv5eCBhiUSxZGjPuW5yvUaQ","pdfSize":"1275866"}
