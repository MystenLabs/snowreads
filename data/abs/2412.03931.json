Plasma Phys. {\\bf 88}, 835880101 (2022)]. This model is a generalization of\nTaylor relaxation that allows the ideal Ohm's law constraint to be included,\nand this offers a pathway to extend the multi-region relaxed MHD (MRxMHD)\nmodel. By constructing solutions numerically, we show that the RxMHD model of\nDewar \\& Qu is mathematically well-defined and computationally feasible for\nconstructing MHD equilibria. We also show that a cross-field flow can exist\nwithout enforcing an arbitrary constraint on the angular momentum (as is done\nin the case of MRxMHD with flow), and a pressure profile with a small gradient\ndue to the Bernoulli flow. Our results also demonstrate the self-organization\nof fully relaxed regions during the optimization, which was an important\nmotivation behind developing this model.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"122S52wm4FgG2puKPAxp0WmiL2QhvOuT7IWCNmygpHU","pdfSize":"620488"}
