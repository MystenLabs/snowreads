  "abstract": "  We develop a version of the Kloosterman circle method with a bump function\nthat is used to provide asymptotics for weighted representation numbers of\nnonsingular integral quadratic forms. Unlike many applications of the\nKloosterman circle method, we explicitly state some constants in the error\nterms that depend on the quadratic form. This version of the Kloosterman circle\nmethod uses Gauss sums, Kloosterman sums, Sali\\'{e} sums, and a principle of\nnonstationary phase. We briefly discuss a potential application of this version\nof the Kloosterman circle method to a proof of a strong asymptotic local-global\nprinciple for certain Kleinian sphere packings.\n",
