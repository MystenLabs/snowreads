The formalism enables constructions of the neural network for a\nquantum many-body solver represented by coupled noninteracting fermions. After\nshowing the exact correspondence of 1- and 2-site Hubbard model to\ntwo-component noninteracting fermions, numerical algorithm of the quantum\nmachine learning for the Hubbard model is proposed. Benchmark for the 4-site\nsystems is successfully presented and promising future directions as well as\nimplications are discussed.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eDLG2fuQr4SS1abrcdyu8alAej3WXh5sbb59YpbEU78","pdfSize":"272362","objectId":"0x8cbbbc3e0faeb02633de2cebf1f708067b46bac2631669f3f4c9d699d4df50d3","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
