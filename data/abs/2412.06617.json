To address this, we\npresent AI TrackMate, an LLM-based music chatbot designed to provide\nconstructive feedback on music productions. By combining LLMs' inherent musical\nknowledge with direct audio track analysis, AI TrackMate offers\nproduction-specific insights, distinguishing it from text-only approaches. Our\nframework integrates a Music Analysis Module, an LLM-Readable Music Report, and\nMusic Production-Oriented Feedback Instruction, creating a plug-and-play,\ntraining-free system compatible with various LLMs and adaptable to future\nadvancements. We demonstrate AI TrackMate's capabilities through an interactive\nweb interface and present findings from a pilot study with a music producer. By\nbridging AI capabilities with the needs of independent producers, AI TrackMate\noffers on-demand analytical feedback, potentially supporting the creative\nprocess and skill development in music production. This system addresses the\ngrowing demand for objective self-assessment tools in the evolving landscape of\nindependent music production.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Sound","Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction","Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Multimedia","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YzboPe8oPCA3reL_KGudR0hkW0C0iXrw8Mm1oK22d8A","pdfSize":"1315011"}
