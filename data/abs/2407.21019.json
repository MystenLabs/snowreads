We use a\ncombination of analytical methods and numerical simulations to establish the\nphase diagram of the model. The model displays a paired Tomonaga-Luttinger\nliquid phase featuring an emergent dipole symmetry, which encodes the local\npairing constraint into a global, non-local quantity. We scrutinize the effect\nof such emergent low-energy symmetry during quench dynamics including single\nparticle defects. We observe that, despite being approximate, the dipole\nsymmetry still leads to very slow relaxation dynamics, which we model via an\neffective field theory. The model we discuss is amenable to realization in both\ncold atoms in optical lattices and Rydberg atom arrays with dynamics taking\nplace solely in the Rydberg manifold. We present a blueprint protocol to\nobserve the effect of emergent dipole symmetry in such experimental platforms,\ncombining adiabatic state preparation with quench dynamics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"R8Zx9vgbzvXU3U1ZG4O4liQ3CovR2O71qVCrbUPUBJQ","pdfSize":"4142765","objectId":"0x81ee1bff24613d799a19efab4cba6df08323ce499d9f75f3f173a70b7d367f57","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
