  "abstract": "  The thermal conductivity of Functionally Graded Materials (FGMs) can be\nefficiently designed through topology optimization to obtain thermal\nmeta-structures that actively steer the heat flow. Compared to conventional\nanalytical design methods, topology optimization allows handling arbitrary\ngeometries, boundary conditions and design requirements; and producing\nalternate designs for non-unique problems. Additionally, as far as the design\nof meta-structures is concerned, topology optimization does not need\nintuition-based coordinate transformation or the form invariance of governing\nequations, as in the case of transformation thermotics. We explore isogeometric\ndensity-based topology optimization in the continuous setting, which perfectly\naligns with FGMs. In this formulation, the density field, geometry and solution\nof the governing equations are parameterized using non-uniform rational basis\nspline entities. Accordingly, the heat conduction problem is solved using\nIsogeometric Analysis. We design various 2D & 3D thermal meta-structures under\ndifferent design scenarios to showcase the effectiveness and versatility of our\napproach. We also design thermal meta-structures based on architected cellular\nmaterials, a special class of FGMs, using their empirical material laws\ncalculated via numerical homogenization.\n",
