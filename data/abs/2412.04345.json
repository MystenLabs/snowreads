It is\ngenerally agreed that particles depend not only on spacetime, but also on\ncoordinates used to parametrise spacetime points. One of us has in contrast\nproposed a coordinate-frame-independent model of quantum particles within the\nframework of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. The aim of this article\nis to present a scalar-field-equation solution that is not only a zero-rank\ntensor under general coordinate transformations, but also common for\nanti-de-Sitter, de-Sitter, closed and open Einstein static universes. Moreover,\nit locally reduces to a Minkowski plane-wave solution and is non-perturbative\nin curvature. The former property makes it suitable for the standard\napplications of quantum theory in particle physics, while the latter allows\nthen to gain insights into quantum physics in the strong-gravity regime.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"V3zKrbTC4pywy2XihG7EqWo0mox_FwB6nwj4_bTEnh8","pdfSize":"909549"}
