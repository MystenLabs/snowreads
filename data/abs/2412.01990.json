Here, we first briefly review some of the most prominent features\nenabled by time-periodic modulations, and we then focus on two specific areas,\nnamely, time-varying systems to break reciprocity and to overcome various\ntheoretical limitations and performance bounds, discussing their current\nstatus, challenges, and opportunities.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MWuu1chjgDVYbLq3v-8eZ6J96vUlerxLh9DpIUuS0DU","pdfSize":"2126427"}
