The brain is recurrent,\nwhile these models are not. It is therefore relevant to explore what would be\nthe impact of adding recurrent mechanisms to existing state-of-the-art\narchitectures and to answer the question of whether recurrency can improve\nexisting architectures. To this end, we build on a feed-forward segmentation\nmodel and explore multiple types of recurrency for image segmentation. We\nexplore self-organizing, relational, and memory retrieval types of recurrency\nthat minimize a specific energy function. In our experiments, we tested these\nmodels on artificial and medical imaging data, while analyzing the impact of\nhigh levels of noise and few-shot learning settings. Our results do not\nvalidate our initial hypothesis that recurrent models should perform better in\nthese settings, suggesting that these recurrent architectures, by themselves,\nare not sufficient to surpass state-of-the-art feed-forward versions and that\nadditional work needs to be done on the topic.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1Tk68Y1u5oICgEsM9xJP-or1yZshTxXgO3e_7LBa37Y","pdfSize":"1714098"}
