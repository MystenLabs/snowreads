In\naddition to constraints from flavor physics measurements, we include both the\nLEP charged Higgs search channels, as well as the LHC search results on the\nlight and heavy charged Higgses. We consider both the conventional charged\nHiggs search channels of $H^\\pm \\rightarrow \\tau\\nu, cs, cb, tb$, and the\nlatest search results on the exotic decay channels $H^\\pm \\rightarrow A W^\\pm /\nH W^\\pm$. We find that $H^\\pm \\rightarrow A W^\\pm / H W^\\pm$ are complementary\nto the conventional fermionic channels for $m_{H^\\pm} < m_t$. For heavy\n$H^\\pm$, $H^\\pm \\rightarrow A W^\\pm / H W^\\pm$ extend the reach of $\\tan \\beta$\nbeyond that of $H^\\pm \\to tb$ in the Type-L 2HDM. We also present the combined\nreach of all the neutral and charged Higgs searches.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Q_MAjPrVFzX9p5paIwTO8jE0god8l48_PbtNE2P4pcM","pdfSize":"3263903"}
