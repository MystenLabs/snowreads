Due to the widespread and frequent application since then,\nthis opened up an attractive phishing opportunity for malicious actors. They\ntrick users into scanning the codes and redirecting them to malicious websites.\nIn order to explore whether phishing with QR codes is another successful attack\nvector, we conducted a real-world phishing campaign with two different QR code\nvariants at a research campus. The first version was rather plain, whereas the\nsecond version was more professionally designed and included the possibility to\nwin a voucher. After the study was completed, a qualitative survey on phishing\nand QR codes was conducted to verify the results of the phishing campaign.\nBoth, the phishing campaign and the survey, show that a professional design\nreceives more attention. They also illustrate that QR codes are used more\nfrequently by curious users because of their easy functionality. Although the\nresults confirm that technical-savvy users are more aware of the risks, they\nalso underpin the malicious potential for non-technical-savvy users and suggest\nfurther work regarding countermeasures.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"50gRnxDLjINKF5QTz-dLO8C-_mSs3gVXm2xPRyE18fU","pdfSize":"1849879","objectId":"0x5bef869c3171b915d052c693bcd9fb5661b42d3b6175d32a7cacf80ce36558c3","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
