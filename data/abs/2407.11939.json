The BSIS, a Physics-Informed Hybrid Hierarchical Reinforcement\nLearning State Machine, employs carbon nanotube-coated electrodes to interface\nrat brains with computational systems, enabling high-fidelity neural\ninterfacing and bidirectional communication through self-organizing systems in\nboth biological and silicon forms. Our system leverages both analogue and\ndigital AI theory, incorporating concepts from computational theory, chaos\ntheory, dynamical systems theory, physics, and quantum mechanics. Additionally,\nthe BSIS replicates the neuronal dynamics typical of intelligent brain tissue,\nemploying nonlinear operations underlying learning and information storage.\nNeural signals are read through the FreeEEG32 board and BrainFlow software,\nthen features are extracted and mapped to game actions by tracking feature\nchanges in continuous data. Metadata is encoded into both analogue and digital\nbrain stimulation signals at the microvolt level using our proprietary software\nand hardware. The system employs a dual signaling approach for training the rat\nbrain, incorporating a reward solution and sound as well as human-inaudible\ndistress sounds. This paper details the design, theory, functionality, and\ntechnical specifications of the BSIS, highlighting its interdisciplinary\napproach and advanced technological integration.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"DuhfnXBjU5M1cxEy2DwbeyY1TVOo77GaJCPLzO02DPg","pdfSize":"4456828"}
