  "abstract": "  This paper presents the application of Tokenlab, an agent-based modeling\nframework designed to analyze price dynamics and speculative behavior within\ntoken-based economies. By decomposing complex token systems into discrete agent\ninteractions governed by fundamental behavioral rules, Tokenlab simplifies the\nsimulation of otherwise intricate market scenarios. Its core innovation lies in\nits ability to model a range of speculative strategies and assess their\ncollective influence on token price evolution.\n  Through a novel controller mechanism, Tokenlab facilitates the simulation of\nmultiple speculator archetypes and their interactions, thereby providing\nvaluable insights into market sentiment and price formation. This method\nenables a systematic exploration of how varying degrees of speculative activity\nand evolving strategies across different market stages shape token price\ntrajectories. Our findings enhance the understanding of speculation in token\nmarkets and present a quantitative framework for measuring and interpreting\nmarket heat indicators.\n",
