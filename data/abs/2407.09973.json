Inversion symmetry in our system is broken due to periodic and\nout-of-phase longitudinal modulation of the refractive index applied to the\nconstituent sublattices of the honeycomb structure. By combining two honeycomb\narrays with different initial phases of refractive index modulation we create a\ndynamically changing domain wall that supports localized linear Floquet edge\nstates despite the fact that on average two sublattices in each honeycomb\nstructure forming the domain wall have the same refractive index. In the\npresence of focusing nonlinearity, bright or dark Floquet edge solitons may\nbifurcate from such linear Floquet edge states. We numerically identified a\nfamily of these solitons and compared them with the results obtained from the\nanalytical approach, which involved averaging over one longitudinal period in\nthe evolution coordinate. These solitons exhibit localization in both spatial\ndirections - along the interface due to nonlinear self-action and across the\ninterface as the edge states - that allows them to travel along the domain wall\nover long distances without noticeable shape variations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ulZ3dsqKyNFQr7HHBzGAqiDkgDm5QfdEToCbBN_gd9c","pdfSize":"17054067"}
