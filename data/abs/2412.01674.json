  "abstract": "  Causal discovery is essential across various scientific fields to uncover\ncausal structures within data. Traditional methods relying on observational\ndata have limitations due to confounding variables. This paper presents an\noptimization-based approach using integer programming (IP) to design minimal\nintervention sets that ensure causal structure identifiability. Our method\nprovides exact and modular solutions that can be adjusted to different\nexperimental settings and constraints. We demonstrate its effectiveness through\ncomparative analysis across different settings, demonstrating its applicability\nand robustness.\n",
