We show: (1) If the extremal geometry\ncontains lines, then the Lie algebra admits a $5 \\times 5$-grading that can be\nparametrized by a cubic norm structure; (2) If there exists a field extension\nof degree at most $2$ such that the extremal geometry over that field extension\ncontains lines, and in addition, there exist symplectic pairs of extremal\nelements, then the Lie algebra admits a $5 \\times 5$-grading that can be\nparametrized by a quadrangular algebra.\n  One of our key tools is a new definition of exponential maps that makes sense\neven over fields of characteristic $2$ and $3$, which ought to be interesting\nin its own right.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zRdwg0dytoLCUiVQUxdKiN8FcTqI22P-8LltbL1K9qE","pdfSize":"786831"}
