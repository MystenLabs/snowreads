  "abstract": "  We study symmetry-breaking inflation within the framework of metric-affine\ngravity. By introducing a non-minimal coupling, $\\beta(\\phi)\\tilde{\\cal R}$,\nbetween the Holst invariant and the inflaton, both small-field and large-field\ninflationary predictions can be brought into agreement with the latest\nobservational constraints. Remarkably, even for sub-Planckian vacuum\nexpectation values, appropriately chosen values of $\\beta(\\phi)$ enable viable\ninflation, a scenario previously considered unattainable.\n",
