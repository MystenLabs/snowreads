Our\nresults suggest that the superconducting order in all three compounds is fully\ngapped, in contrast to reports of nodal superconductivity in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ and\nRbV$_3$Sb$_5$. Analysis of the temperature-dependent superfluid density,\n$\\rho_s(T)$, shows deviations from the behavior expected for a single isotropic\ngap, but the data are well described by models incorporating either a single\nanisotropic gap or two isotropic gaps. Notably, the temperature dependences of\n$\\lambda(T)$ and $\\rho_s(T)$ in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ and RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ are\nqualitatively more similar to each other than to CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, consistent with\nthe superconducting phase reflecting features of the normal-state band\nstructure. Our findings provide a direct comparison of the superconducting\nproperties across the AV$_3$Sb$_5$ family.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7gK2tL_qSjhFPRwy4bAeAzlUCMZ-GeDg346Ltx8X8E0","pdfSize":"4517126"}
