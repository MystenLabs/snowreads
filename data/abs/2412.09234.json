  "abstract": "  It is widely observed that particles produced in high-energy collisions\nfollow a power-law distribution. One such power-law distribution used\nextensively in the phenomenological studies owes its origin to nonadditive\nstatistics proposed by C. Tsallis. In this article, we derive a novel\nnonadditive generalization of the conventional Bose-Einstein distribution using\na single-mode harmonic oscillator. The approach taken in this paper eliminates\nthe need of a regularization procedure proposed in previous works. We observe\nthat the spectra of the bosonic particles like the pions and kaons produced in\nhigh-energy collisions are well-described by the nonadditive bosonic\ndistribution derived in this paper.\n",
