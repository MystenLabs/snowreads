  "abstract": "  We consider $N$ i.i.d. Ising spins with mean $m\\in (-1,1)$ whose interactions\nare described by a Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Hamiltonian with a quartic\ncorrection. This model was recently introduced by Bolthausen in \\cite{Bolt2} as\na toy model to understand whether a second moment argument can be used to\nderive the replica symmetric formula in the full high temperature regime if\n$m\\neq 0$. In \\cite{Bolt2}, Bolthausen suggested that a natural analogue of the\nde Almeida-Thouless condition for the toy model is\n  \\begin{equation}\\label{eq:conj} \\beta^2(1-m^2)^2\\leq 1. \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\,\n\\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, (1)\\end{equation} Here, $\\beta \\geq 0$\ncorresponds to the inverse temperature. While the second moment method implies\nreplica symmetry for $\\beta $ sufficiently small, Bolthausen showed that the\nmethod fails to prove replica symmetry in the full region described by (1). A\nnatural question that was left open in \\cite{Bolt2} is whether (1) correctly\ncharacterizes the high temperature phase of the toy model. In this note, we\nshow that this is indeed not the case. We prove that if $|m| \\geq m_*$, for\nsome $m_* \\in (0,1)$, the limiting free energy of the toy model is negative for\nsuitable $\\beta $ that satisfy (1).\n",
