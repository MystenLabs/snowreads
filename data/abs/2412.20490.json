  "abstract": "  Realistic metric spaces (such as road/transportation networks) tend to be\nmuch more algorithmically tractable than general metrics. In an attempt to\nformalize this intuition, Abraham et al. (SODA 2010, JACM 2016) introduced the\nnotion of highway dimension. A weighted graph $G$ has highway dimension $h$ if\nfor every ball $B$ of radius $\\approx 4r$ there is a hitting set of size $h$\nhitting all the shortest paths of length $>r$ in $B$. Unfortunately, this\ndefinition fails to incorporate some very natural metric spaces such as the\ngrid graph, and the Euclidean plane.\n  We relax the definition of highway dimension by demanding to hit only\napproximate shortest paths. In addition to generalizing the original\ndefinition, this new definition also incorporates all doubling spaces (in\nparticular the grid graph and the Euclidean plane). We then construct a PTAS\nfor TSP under this new definition (improving a QPTAS w.r.t. the original more\nrestrictive definition of Feldmann et al. (SICOMP 2018)). Finally, we develop a\nbasic metric toolkit for spaces with small highway dimension by constructing\npadded decompositions, sparse covers/partitions, and tree covers. An abundance\nof applications follow.\n",
