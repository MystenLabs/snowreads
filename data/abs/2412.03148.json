However, there is limited research on whether LLMs can\naccurately simulate user behavior in real-world scenarios, such as social\nmedia. This requires models to effectively analyze a user's history and\nsimulate their role. In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{FineRob}, a novel\nfine-grained behavior simulation dataset. We collect the complete behavioral\nhistory of 1,866 distinct users across three social media platforms. Each\nbehavior is decomposed into three fine-grained elements: object, type, and\ncontent, resulting in 78.6k QA records. Based on FineRob, we identify two\ndominant reasoning patterns in LLMs' behavior simulation processes and propose\nthe \\textbf{OM-CoT} fine-tuning method to enhance the capability. Through\ncomprehensive experiments, we conduct an in-depth analysis of key factors of\nbehavior simulation and also demonstrate the effectiveness of OM-CoT\napproach\\footnote{Code and dataset are available at\n\\url{https://github.com/linkseed18612254945/FineRob}}\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rMi56h1t2QOZ7L7_yTLbjP8MbrpCdqHZBnFYoD5jBVA","pdfSize":"2311908"}
