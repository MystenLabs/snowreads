This is the\ntraditional setting of Green elasticity, also known as hyper-elasticity.\nHowever, in its original form the theory of elasticity does not assume the\nexistence of a strain-energy function. In this case, called Cauchy elasticity,\nstresses are directly related to the strains. Since the emergence of modern\nelasticity in the 1940s, research on Cauchy elasticity has been relatively\nlimited. One possible reason is that for Cauchy materials, the net work\nperformed by stress along a closed path in the strain space may be nonzero.\nTherefore, such materials may require access to both energy sources and sinks.\nThis characteristic has led some mechanicians to question the viability of\nCauchy elasticity as a physically plausible theory of elasticity. In this\npaper, motivated by its relevance to recent applications, such as the modeling\nof active solids, we revisit Cauchy elasticity in a modern form.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"1yKiJK1wcs5TOdMvX4Ae4yHxQQQyL1UVTjQR13FqL7o","pdfSize":"1010227"}
