Since\ncontrol theory advances the idea of suitably modifying the behavior of a\ndynamical system, this paper explores the role of control theory in designing\nefficient algorithms (or dynamical systems) related to problems surrounding the\noptimization framework, including constrained optimization, optimization-based\ncontrol, and parameter estimation. This amalgamation of control theory with the\nabove-mentioned areas has been made possible by the recently introduced\nparadigm of Passivity and Immersion (P\\&I) based control. The generality and\nworking of P\\&I, as compared to the existing approaches in control theory, are\nbest introduced through the example presented below.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2_FBwqXJl-UIyJUWj4JRJa_R8NV9j-qUgwr1dmI_0s8","pdfSize":"1449763","objectId":"0x942853fc9c48c9bb93054b421d1a1fda5095cba63765dd2fde286599eccb7d35","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
