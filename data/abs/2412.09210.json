  "abstract": "  Magnetotransport of conventional semiconductor based double layer systems\nwith barrier suppressed interlayer tunneling has been a rewarding subject due\nto the emergence of an interlayer coherent state that behaves as an excitonic\nsuperfluid. Large angle twisted bilayer graphene offers unprecedented strong\ninterlayer Coulomb interaction, since both layer thickness and layer spacing\nare of atomic scale and a barrier is no more needed as the twist induced\nmomentum mismatch suppresses tunneling. The extra valley degree of freedom also\nadds richness. Here we report the observation of fractional quantum Hall\nphysics at 1/3 total filling for balanced layer population in this system.\nMonte Carlo simulations support that the ground state is also an excitonic\nsuperfluid but the excitons are composed of fractional rather than elementary\ncharges. The observed phase transitions with an applied displacement field at\nthis and other fractional fillings are also addressed with simulations. They\nreveal ground states with different topology and symmetry properties.\n",
