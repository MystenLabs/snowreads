In particular, we prove a conjecture of Kendall\nstating that geodesics do not pause en route, i.e, use roads of arbitrary small\nspeed except at their endpoints. It follows that the geodesic frame of\n$\\left(\\mathbb{R}^2,T\\right)$ is the set of points on roads. We also consider\ngeodesic stars and hubs, and give a complete description of the local structure\nof geodesics around points on roads. Notably, we prove that leaving a road by\ndriving off-road is never geodesic.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1alVuJIVpZ6zJ2ORYNp-29SvL05bTDl9zNBqJ1ioxz0","pdfSize":"3780005"}
