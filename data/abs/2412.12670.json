  "abstract": "  The concept of concrete regularity structure gives the algebraic backbone of\nthe operations involved in the local expansions used in the regularity\nstructure approach to singular stochastic partial differential equations. The\nspaces and the details of the structures depend on each equation. We introduce\nhere a parameter-dependent universal algebraic regularity structure that can\nhost all the regularity structures used in the study of singular stochastic\npartial differential equations. This is done by using the correspondence\nbetween the notions of model on a regularity structure and the notion of\nparacontrolled system. We prove that the iterated paraproducts that form the\nfundamental bricks of paracontrolled systems have some local expansion\nproperties that are governed by this universal structure.\n",
