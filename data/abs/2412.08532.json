We\nconsider a novel method for finding an upper bound for the quantum violation of\nsuch inequalities by combining the NPA hierarchy, the method of alternating\nprojections, and the memory-efficient optimisation algorithm L-BFGS. Whilst our\nmethod may not give the tightest upper bound possible, it often does so several\norders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art solvers, with minimal memory\nusage, thus allowing solutions to problems that would otherwise be intractable.\nWe benchmark using the well-studied I3322 inequality as well as a more general\nlarge-scale randomized inequality RXX22. For randomized inequalities with 130\ninputs either side (a first-level moment matrix of size 261x261), our method is\n~100x faster than both MOSEK and SCS whilst giving a bound only ~2% above the\noptimum.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mbnxeICzEBNUmrZ3eA6q-QEllaU7dzCOrs9_A2k4L5E","pdfSize":"557910"}
