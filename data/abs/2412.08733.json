  "abstract": "  The search for axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) remains a major\nendeavor in modern physics investigation. Axions play essential roles in the\nquest to understand dark matter, the strong CP problem, and various\nastrophysical phenomena. This paper provides a very brief overview of the\ncurrent status of experimental efforts, highlighting significant advancements,\nongoing projects, and future opportunities. Particular attention is given to\ncavity haloscopes, helioscopes, and laboratory-based light-shining-through-wall\nexperiments, as well as astrophysical probes. Some future perspectives are also\ndiscussed.\n",
