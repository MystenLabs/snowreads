  "abstract": "  We know definition of Rota--Baxter operators on different algebraic systems.\nFor examples, on groups, on algebras, on Hopf algebras. On some algebraic\nsystems it is possible to define different types of Rota--Baxter operators. For\nexample, on group algebra it is possible to define Rota--Baxter operator as on\nassociative algebra, group Rota--Baxter operator and Rota--Baxter operator as\non a Hopf algebra. We are investigating the following question: What are\nconnections between these operators? We are studying these questions for the\nSweedler algebra $H_4$, that is 4-dimension non--cocommutative Hopf algebra.\n",
