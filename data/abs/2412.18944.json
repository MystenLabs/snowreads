  "abstract": "  This article is devoted to the study of a certain class of smooth\ncircle-valued functions on a cylinder $S^1\\times [0,1]$, a torus $T^2$, a disk\n$D^2$ and a sphere $S^2$ which is a generalization of Morse-Bott functions\nwithout saddles. We established a \"normal form\" for functions from this class,\nnamely, we proved that any such function $f$ can be presented in the form $f =\n\\varkappa\\circ f_0\\circ h^{-1}$, where $f_0$ is the ``simplest'' Morse function\non the given surface for some diffeomorphism $h$ and a smooth function\n$\\varkappa$ satisfying some natural conditions.\n",
