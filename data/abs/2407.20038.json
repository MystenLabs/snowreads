Despite considerable research and a number of\npromising future alternatives such as hydrogen, battery storages currently\nremain the first choice. However, costs remain high and it remains to be shown\nwhether an investment can be profitable. This article addresses this question\nby modelling a battery storage operating in the German power market. We\nconsider two periods with very distinct price dynamics, namely a calm year\n(2020) and a turbulent year (2023). It shows that even for low battery costs a\n2020 style price environment does not allow for profitable battery operation,\nwhereas current market conditions allow for positive payoffs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KbFNOUOmEdTGWxyfi_KSyIHw9D5PctAt6eN9x-_dBiA","pdfSize":"568457"}
