We\ndesign a multi-round distributed algorithm for canonical correlation analysis.\nWe construct principal directions through the convex formulation of canonical\ncorrelation analysis and use the shift-and-invert preconditioning iteration to\nexpedite the convergence rate. This distributed algorithm is\ncommunication-efficient. The resultant estimate achieves the same convergence\nrate as if all observations were pooled together, but does not impose stringent\nrestrictions on the number of machines. We take a gap-free analysis to bypass\nthe widely used yet unrealistic assumption of an explicit gap between the\nsuccessive canonical correlations in the canonical correlation analysis.\nExtensive simulations and applications to three benchmark image data are\nconducted to demonstrate the empirical performance of our proposed algorithms\nand theories.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zVyd1ANuTnQ505Pw3ofQewRM3nQ7qM5QqYwNZdXpe-o","pdfSize":"551943"}
