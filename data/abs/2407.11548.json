Despite the existing tools\nfor protein retrieval, they prioritize sequence similarity and probably\noverlook proteins that are dissimilar but share homology or functionality. In\norder to tackle this problem, we propose a novel protein retrieval framework\nthat mitigates the bias towards sequence similarity. Our framework initiatively\nharnesses protein language models (PLMs) to embed protein sequences within a\nhigh-dimensional feature space, thereby enhancing the representation capacity\nfor subsequent analysis. Subsequently, an accelerated indexed vector database\nis constructed to facilitate expedited access and retrieval of dense vectors.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can equally retrieve both\nsimilar and dissimilar proteins. Moreover, this approach enables the\nidentification of proteins that conventional methods fail to uncover. This\nframework will effectively assist in protein mining and empower the development\nof biology.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GNfhM23GDpo63FlpeshXABYakW3bUCCkO19NnEEi_uA","pdfSize":"6870532","objectId":"0xedd1dec1b65e89b369643d82457d447baca7dd50e37cbe7502e768e2385b8134","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
