  "abstract": "  The asymptotics of a singularly perturbed problem is constructed. describing\nthe transport of a polydisperse impurity in the atmosphere, taking into account\nthe processes of precipitation and wind pick-up, as well as the processes of\ncoagulation - dissociation. The mathematical model of this process represents a\ndifferential-operator equation of turbulent diffusion with a non-standard\nboundary condition containing two components - atmospheric and soil. The\nasymptotics of the solution is constructed by the method of boundary functions.\nProblems that do not contain small parameters are obtained for the main terms\nof the asymptotic equation.\n",
