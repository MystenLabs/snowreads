  "abstract": "  We investigate optical properties of bi-isotropic materials under the\nanomalous Hall effect (AHE) of the axion electrodynamics. Four refractive\nindices associated with circularly polarized waves are achieved, implying\ncircular birefringence with rotatory power (RP) endowed with double sign\nreversal, an exotic optical signature for chiral dielectrics. The Kerr rotation\nand ellipticity are analyzed, with an unusual observation of rotation angle\ndeprived of discontinuity. Anomalous reflection (greater than unity) is also\nreported, associated with negative refraction stemming from the anomalous\ntransport properties. These effects constitute the singular optical signature\nof a bi-isotropic media with the AHE.\n",
