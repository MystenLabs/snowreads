Community attributes like demographics, housing, and pet\nregistration were collected and analyzed through geospatial visualization and\ncorrelation analysis. Strongly correlated features were identified using the\nchi-square test, and predictive models were built using association rule mining\nand machine learning algorithms. The findings suggest that crime rates are\nclosely linked to factors such as population density, while pet registration\nhas a smaller impact. This study offers valuable insights for city managers to\nenhance community safety strategies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Q32yEs6FGGXeyuIldSctwaLH-P_59C-sGFuPxU23XfI","pdfSize":"11669086"}
