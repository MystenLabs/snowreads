The detection of these photons\ndemands the presence of at least PeV energy particle in the source. It is\nimportant to understand particle acceleration and radiation emission processes\nin such source. One of those twelve sources, LHAASO J2108+5157 does not show\nany association or counterparts at any other wavelength. In search of\ncounterpart, we surveyed the region with Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT)\nat 650 MHz frequency. GMRT observation revel radio emission from an extended\nsource within the PSF of LHAASO which shows disk-jet morphology. Considering\nthe spatial association and extent of the source, it is plausible that particle\nacceleration to PeV energies originates from this source.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"n3hAy43ZHYjYHOb64knzF9YCKUcxvsc7NCPVi_iktD8","pdfSize":"421393"}
