  "abstract": "  In the adversarial streaming model, the input is a sequence of adaptive\nupdates that defines an underlying dataset and the goal is to approximate,\ncollect, or compute some statistic while using space sublinear in the size of\nthe dataset. In 2022, Ben-Eliezer, Eden, and Onak showed a dense-sparse\ntrade-off technique that elegantly combined sparse recovery with known\ntechniques using differential privacy and sketch switching to achieve\nadversarially robust algorithms for $L_p$ estimation and other algorithms on\nturnstile streams. In this work, we first give an improved algorithm for\nadversarially robust $L_p$-heavy hitters, utilizing deterministic turnstile\nheavy-hitter algorithms with better tradeoffs. We then utilize our heavy-hitter\nalgorithm to reduce the problem to estimating the frequency moment of the tail\nvector. We give a new algorithm for this problem in the classical streaming\nsetting, which achieves additive error and uses space independent in the size\nof the tail. We then leverage these ingredients to give an improved algorithm\nfor adversarially robust $L_p$ estimation on turnstile streams.\n",
