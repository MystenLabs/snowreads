Current incentive structures and regulatory delays\nmay hinder responsible AI development and deployment, particularly in light of\nthe transformative potential of large language models (LLMs). To address these\nchallenges, we propose developing the following three contributions: (1) a\nlarge multimodal text and economic-timeseries foundation model that integrates\neconomic and natural language policy data for enhanced forecasting and\ndecision-making, (2) algorithmic mechanisms for eliciting diverse and\nrepresentative perspectives, enabling the creation of data-driven public policy\nrecommendations, and (3) an AI-driven web platform for supporting transparent,\ninclusive, and data-driven policymaking.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computers and Society","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YJhH14iQKUXo2XTEzYyPBD2JplPJJT-rUe_MgwaAocc","pdfSize":"1805129"}
