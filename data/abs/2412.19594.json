  "abstract": "  We present a brief history of quasicrystals and a short introduction to\nclassical lattice-gas models of interacting particles. We discuss stability of\nnon-periodic tilings and one-dimensional sequences of symbols seen as ground\nstates of some hamiltonians. We argue that some sort of homogeneity, the\nso-called Strict Boundary Condition, is necessary for stability of non-periodic\nground states against small perturbations of interactions and thermal\nfluctuations.\n",
