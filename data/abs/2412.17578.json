Moreover, the need for secure information transmission based\non quantum encryption protocols leads to investigating the possibility of\nmultiplexing both quantum and classical signals in the same fiber. In this\nwork, we experimentally study the modal multiplexing of both quantum and\nclassical signals at telecom wavelengths, by using a few-mode fiber of 8 km and\nmodal multiplexers/demultiplexers. We observe the existence of random-mode\ncoupling at the quantum level, leading to cross-talk among both degenerate and\nnon-degenerate channels. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using\nfew-mode fibers for simultaneously transmitting classical and quantum\ninformation, leading to an efficient implementation of physical information\nencryption protocols in spatial-division multiplexed systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-fYV-lZidFKTPLVr1Sg7F4CdPAA-NqlqoarefxcL9dY","pdfSize":"1917498"}
