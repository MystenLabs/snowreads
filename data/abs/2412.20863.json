  "abstract": "  We study the torus-equivariant cohomology of weighted flag varieties, and\nprove a positivity property in the equivariant cohomology and Chow groups of\nweighted flag varieties, analogous to the non-weighted positivity proved in\n[Graham 2001]. Our result strengthens and generalizes the positivity proved for\nweighted Grassmannians by [Abe-Matsumura 2015]. The positivity property is\nexpressed in terms of weighted roots, which are used to describe weights of\ntorus equivariant curves in weighted flag varieties. This provides a geometric\ninterpretation of the parameters used in [Abe-Matsumura 2015]. We approach\nweighted flag varieties from a uniform Lie-theoretic point of view, providing a\nmore general definition than has appeared previously, and prove other general\nresults about weighted flag varieties in this setting, including a Borel\npresentation of the equivariant cohomology. In addition, we generalize some\nresults obtained for weighted Grassmannians or more generally type $A$\n([Abe-Matsumura 2015], [Azam-Nazir-Qureshi 2020]); in particular, we obtain a\nweighted Chevalley formula, descriptions of restrictions to fixed points, the\nGKM description of the cohomology, and a weighted Chevalley formula.\n",
