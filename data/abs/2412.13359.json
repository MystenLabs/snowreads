  "abstract": "  Multi-Agent Motion Planning (MAMP) finds various applications in fields such\nas traffic management, airport operations, and warehouse automation. In many of\nthese environments, differential drive robots are commonly used. These robots\nhave a kinodynamic model that allows only in-place rotation and movement along\ntheir current orientation, subject to speed and acceleration limits. However,\nexisting Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF)-based methods often use simplified\nmodels for robot kinodynamics, which limits their practicality and realism. In\nthis paper, we introduce a three-level framework called MASS to address these\nchallenges. MASS combines MAPF-based methods with our proposed stationary state\nsearch planner to generate high-quality kinodynamically-feasible plans. We\nfurther extend MASS using an adaptive window mechanism to address the lifelong\nMAMP problem. Empirically, we tested our methods on the single-shot grid map\ndomain and the lifelong warehouse domain. Our method shows up to 400%\nimprovements in terms of throughput compared to existing methods.\n",
