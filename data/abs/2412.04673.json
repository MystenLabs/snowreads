  "abstract": "  Pedestrian trajectory prediction remains a challenge for autonomous systems,\nparticularly due to the intricate dynamics of social interactions. Accurate\nforecasting requires a comprehensive understanding not only of each\npedestrian's previous trajectory but also of their interaction with the\nsurrounding environment, an important part of which are other pedestrians\nmoving dynamically in the scene. To learn effective socially-informed\nrepresentations, we propose a model that uses a reconstructor alongside a\nconditional variational autoencoder-based trajectory forecasting module. This\nmodule generates pseudo-trajectories, which we use as augmentations throughout\nthe training process. To further guide the model towards social awareness, we\npropose a novel social loss that aids in forecasting of more stable\ntrajectories. We validate our approach through extensive experiments,\ndemonstrating strong performances in comparison to state of-the-art methods on\nthe ETH/UCY and SDD benchmarks.\n",
