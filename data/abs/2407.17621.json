By using these multilinear polynomials, we\npropose a geometric representation for entanglement states. In particular, we\nshow that the Bell's states are associated with non-factorable real multilinear\npolynomial, which can be represented geometrically by three-dimensional\nsurfaces. Furthermore, in this framework, we show that a quantum circuit can be\nseen as a geometric transformations of plane geometry. This phenomenon is\nanalogous to gravity, where matter curves space-time. In addition, we show an\nanalogy between quantum teleportation and operations involving multilinear\npolynomials.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KYSlKTznt0xlmyrRkCBtw6pJn4LketsZygxKdFsSQW8","pdfSize":"243630"}
