Our results show that $\\alpha$ is strongly effected by relatively\nmild annealing conditions (T = 300 C) when performed in a vacuum. This increase\nneeds to be taken into account when obtaining the spin mixing conductance from\nspin pumping measurements. We measure an increase in $\\alpha$ by a factor of 8\nwhen the YIG is vacuum annealed at 300 C. No such changes in $\\alpha$ are\nobserved when annealed at the same temperature in 0.1 mbar of oxygen.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3kaINjWImvlPh_bfWSS-xf-SILVkwjRzQstUP1ZcV2M","pdfSize":"4396520"}
