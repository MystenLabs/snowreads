Conventional methods\nusing state tomography and estimating numerous terms of the series expansion\nare computationally expensive, while alternative approaches based on a purified\nquery oracle impose practical constraints. In this paper, we introduce the\nquantum state function (QSF) framework by extending the SWAP test via linear\ncombination of unitaries and parameterized quantum circuits. Our framework\nenables the implementation of arbitrary degree-$n$ polynomial functions of\nquantum states with precision $\\varepsilon$ using\n$\\mathcal{O}(n/\\varepsilon^2)$ copies. We further apply QSF for developing\nquantum algorithms of fundamental tasks, achieving a sample complexity of\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1/(\\varepsilon^2\\kappa))$ for both von Neumann entropy\nestimation and quantum state fidelity calculations, where $\\kappa$ represents\nthe minimal nonzero eigenvalue. Our work establishes a concise and unified\nparadigm for estimating and realizing nonlinear functions of quantum states,\npaving the way for the practical processing and analysis of quantum data.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computer Science/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"G4HK_m4f3PX0QNb019Sr2E-bMAIMigceEuFa75ItHHk","pdfSize":"1237507"}
