This paper presents a novel method for safely navigating an\naircraft along a desired route while avoiding moving obstacles. We utilize a\nclass of control barrier functions (CBFs) based on collision cones to ensure\nthe relative velocity between the aircraft and the obstacle consistently avoids\na cone of vectors that might lead to a collision. By demonstrating that the\nproposed constraint is a valid CBF for the aircraft, we can leverage its\nreal-time implementation via Quadratic Programs (QPs), termed the CBF-QPs.\nValidation includes simulating control law along trajectories, showing\neffectiveness in both static and moving obstacle scenarios.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"LjoBPiNGIrCypSmsD7UnIQQ_qW_UMq5w54BidUgj8uM","pdfSize":"851059","objectId":"0x294afc40487cb88bc07922a5963f5fb88f4f4ac7158cbaea8cfb65ce630d47e0","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
