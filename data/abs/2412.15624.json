  "abstract": "  Generative AI (genAI) tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot) have become ubiquitous\nin software engineering (SE). As SE educators, it behooves us to understand the\nconsequences of genAI usage among SE students and to create a holistic view of\nwhere these tools can be successfully used. Through 16 reflective interviews\nwith SE students, we explored their academic experiences of using genAI tools\nto complement SE learning and implementations. We uncover the contexts where\nthese tools are helpful and where they pose challenges, along with examining\nwhy these challenges arise and how they impact students. We validated our\nfindings through member checking and triangulation with instructors. Our\nfindings provide practical considerations of where and why genAI should (not)\nbe used in the context of supporting SE students.\n",
