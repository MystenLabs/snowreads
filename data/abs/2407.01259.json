The\nconnection of the formalism developed to the Casimir effect is discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HJTDN16L4ef2JbfMddfj4bpvQhAWXqwE0YYacCD1sbs","pdfSize":"343946"}
