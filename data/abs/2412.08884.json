  "abstract": "  Partial rigidity is a quantitative notion of recurrence and provides a global\nobstruction which prevents the system from being strongly mixing. A dynamical\nsystem $(X, \\mathcal{X}, \\mu, T)$ is partially rigid if there is a constant\n$\\delta >0$ and sequence $(n_k)_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ such that $\\displaystyle\n\\liminf_{k \\to \\infty } \\mu(A \\cap T^{n_k}A) \\geq \\delta \\mu(A)$ for every $A\n\\in \\mathcal{X}$, and the partial rigidity rate is the largest $\\delta$\nachieved over all sequences. For every integer $d \\geq 1$, via an explicit\nconstruction, we prove the existence of a minimal subshift $(X,S)$ with $d$\nergodic measures having distinct partial rigidity rates. The systems built are\n$\\mathcal{S}$-adic subshifts of finite alphabetic rank that have\nnon-superlinear word complexity and, in particular, have zero entropy.\n",
