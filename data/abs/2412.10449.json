The analysis focuses on the behavior\nof energy dissipation in turbulent flows modeled by operators \\( P_h \\) with\nsymbols \\( a(x, \\xi) \\in S^m(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\), where \\( m < 0 \\). Using\nmicrolocal partitions of unity, we derive an expression for the energy\ndissipation rate \\( \\varepsilon_h \\) in both spatial and spectral regions,\nshowing its asymptotic equivalence to a two-dimensional integral over phase\nspace. This framework is then applied to the study of the propagation of\nsingularities in solutions to the equation \\( P_h u_h = 0 \\), where the\nwavefront set \\( \\operatorname{WF}_h(u_h) \\) evolves along generalized\nbicharacteristics of the principal symbol \\( p_0(x, \\xi) \\), with energy\ndissipation controlled by the imaginary part of \\( p_0(x, \\xi) \\). The results\ncombine microlocal analysis, semiclassical techniques, and symbolic calculus to\noffer insights into the complex dynamics of wave propagation and energy\ndissipation in turbulent systems, with implications for both theoretical and\napplied studies in mathematical physics.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"VqNezBWCMw-0ac4eMiIrw-DvxQ5o8a0Ii7hWpM8cE0k","pdfSize":"268456"}
