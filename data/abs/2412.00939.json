  "abstract": "  High-precision, robust quantum gates are essential components in quantum\ncomputation and information processing. In this study, we present an\nalternative perspective, exploring the potential applicability of quantum gates\nthat exhibit heightened sensitivity to errors. We investigate such sensitive\nquantum gates, which, beyond their established use in in vivo NMR spectroscopy,\nquantum sensing, and polarization optics, may offer significant utility in\nprecision quantum metrology and error characterization. Utilizing the composite\npulses technique, we derive three fundamental quantum gates with narrowband and\npassband characteristics -- the X (NOT) gate, the Hadamard gate, and gates\nenabling arbitrary rotations. To systematically design these composite pulse\nsequences, we introduce the SU(2), modified-SU(2), and regularization random\nsearch methodologies. These approaches, many of which are novel, demonstrate\nsuperior performance compared to established sequences in the literature,\nincluding NB1, SK1, and PB1.\n",
