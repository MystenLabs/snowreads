However, most of\nthem neglected scale variations and domain generalization scenarios, performing\npoorly in instances involving domain shifts, typically made worse by\ninter-domain and cross-domain scale variances. To overcome these issues, we\npropose a cascaded data augmentation and SWIN transformer domain generalization\nframework (DAST-DG) in the current research work Initially, we examine the\ndisparity in dataset representation. A feature generator is trained to make\nauthentic images from various domains indistinguishable. This process is then\napplied to recaptured images, creating a dual adversarial learning setup.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is practical and surpasses\nstate-of-the-art methods across different databases. Our model achieves an\naccuracy of approximately 82\\% with a precision of 95\\% on high-variance\ndatasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TFKEOvoTm8a1T3L7fBP5n63ySF1mR6gGSW4ciqlk0dE","pdfSize":"26887817"}
