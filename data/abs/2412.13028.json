Classic ESES\ndetection approaches have usually been performed with manual processing or\nconventional algorithms, suffering from poor sample sizes, single-channel-based\nanalyses, and low generalization abilities. In contrast, the proposed ViT model\novercomes these limitations by using the attention mechanism to focus on the\nimportant features in multi-channel EEG data, which is contributing to both\nbetter accuracy and efficiency. The model processes frequency-domain\nrepresentations of EEG signals, such as spectrograms, as image data to capture\nlong-range dependencies and complex patterns in the signal. The model\ndemonstrates high performance with an accuracy of 97% without requiring\nintensive data preprocessing, thus rendering it suitable for real-time clinical\napplications on a large scale. The method represents a significant development\nin the advancement of neurological disorders such as ESES in detection and\nanalysis.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Computer Science/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"F7sQuLQ9bJ5mLk5HQeC6ofS1hhlsNZioht3u5Dyde48","pdfSize":"775969"}
