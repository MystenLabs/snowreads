  "abstract": "  Photography during night or in dark conditions typically suffers from noise,\nlow light and blurring issues due to the dim environment and the common use of\nlong exposure. Although Deblurring and Low-light Image Enhancement (LLIE) are\nrelated under these conditions, most approaches in image restoration solve\nthese tasks separately. In this paper, we present an efficient and robust\nneural network for multi-task low-light image restoration. Instead of following\nthe current tendency of Transformer-based models, we propose new attention\nmechanisms to enhance the receptive field of efficient CNNs. Our method reduces\nthe computational costs in terms of parameters and MAC operations compared to\nprevious methods. Our model, DarkIR, achieves new state-of-the-art results on\nthe popular LOLBlur, LOLv2 and Real-LOLBlur datasets, being able to generalize\non real-world night and dark images.
