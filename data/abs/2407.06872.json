GQBP that generalized two earlier models of quantum branching\nprograms. In this work we study a restricted version of GQBP with the\nmotivation of proving bounds on the query-space requirement of quantum-query\ncircuits. We show the first explicit query-space lower bound for our restricted\nversion. We prove that the well-studied OR$_n$ decision problem, given a\npromise that at most one position of an $n$-sized Boolean array is a 1,\nsatisfies the bound $Q^2 s = \\Omega(n^2)$, where $Q$ denotes the number of\nqueries and $s$ denotes the width of the GQBP. We then generalize the problem\nto show that the same bound holds for deciding between two strings with a\nconstant Hamming distance; this gives us query-space lower bounds on problems\nsuch as Parity and Majority. Our results produce an alternative proof of the\n$\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$-lower bound on the query complexity of any non-constant\nsymmetric Boolean function.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5NqNPAH0Eui9dYAQQcRqJmrTZoa4MH6diXOlxzrHj78","pdfSize":"708611"}
