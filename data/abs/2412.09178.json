  "abstract": "  In Regional Economics, the attractiveness of regions for capital, migrants,\ntourists, and other kinds of flows is a relevant topic. Usually, studies in\nthis field have mainly explored single flows, characterizing the dimensions of\nterritorial attractiveness separately, rarely considering the interwoven effect\nof flows. Here we investigate attractiveness from a multi-dimensional\nperspective (i.e., dealing with different flows), asking how various types of\nregional flows collectively shape the attractiveness dynamics of European\nregions. We analyze eight distinct flow types across NUTS2 regions from 2010 to\n2018, employing a multilayer network approach. Notably, the multilayer approach\nunveils insights that would be missed in single-layer analyses. Community\ndetection reveals complex structures that demonstrate the cohesive power of\nnational borders and the existence of strong cross-border ties in specific\nregions. Our study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of regional\nattractiveness, with implications for targeted policy interventions in regional\ndevelopment and European cohesion.\n",
