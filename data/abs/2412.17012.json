This controller is synthesized from the solution of a \"data-driven\nalgebraic equation\" constructed from the model-free Bellman equation used in\nQ-learning. This algebraic equation is driven by data correlation matrices that\ndoes not scale in the number of data points, making for an efficient online\nimplementation. As a result, a sufficient condition that ensures stability and\nrobustness against unmodeled dynamics in the plant is extracted. The derived\nresults also allows for a quantitative characterization of the interplay\nbetween explorations and robustness to unmodeled dynamics. The class of optimal\ncontrol problems considered here bears equivalence to Stochastic Shortest Path\n(SSP) problems, allowing for a performance comparison between the proposed\nadaptive policy and model-free algorithms for learning the stochastic shortest\npath, as presented in the numerical experiment.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computer Science/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"oCaFEpxmJMq69reyf0rgaKnWEfVRfSqcEIDkeNq1T30","pdfSize":"580868"}
