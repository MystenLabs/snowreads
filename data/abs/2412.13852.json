Accompanying, we introduce a fast,\nmachine-interpretable data format with a Python API for easy integration into\nneural network research, that we call RadFiled3D. Both developments are\nintended to be used to research alternative radiation simulation methods using\ndeep learning.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"fppWJLeCJJfl741qh-7wvCrZwsi3COYCkVARTCtiJYU","pdfSize":"1112935"}
