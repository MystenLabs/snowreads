Probability density functions of four key\nfeatures$-$velocity $v$, density $\\rho$, avoidance number $Av$, and intrusion\nnumber $In$$-$were analyzed to characterize pedestrian behavior.\nVelocity-density fundamental diagrams were constructed for each $\\alpha$ and\nfitted with functional forms from existing literature. Classification attempts\nusing $Av$-$In$ and $v$-$\\rho$ phase spaces revealed significant overlaps,\nhighlighting the limitations of these metrics alone for scenario\ndifferentiation. To address this, machine learning models, including logistic\nregression and random forest, were employed using all four features. Results\nshowed robust classification performance, with $v$ and $Av$ contributing most\nsignificantly. Insights from feature importance metrics and classification\naccuracy offer practical guidance for managing high-density crowds, optimizing\npedestrian flow, and designing safer public spaces. These findings provide a\ndata-driven framework for advancing pedestrian dynamics research.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Wr28Z1kWSb8mOOkn-8pzoLeL1chzch_obZp7Sn5Z0A4","pdfSize":"1628041"}
