It is known that\nthe syzygies of $X$ contain some geometric information. In recent years the\nsyzygies of non-projectively normal varieties or in other words, the projection\n$X'$ of $X$ away from a linear subspace $W\\subset\\mathbb{P}^r$, were taken into\nconsiderations. Assuming that the coordinate ring of the ambient space that\n$X'$ lives in is $S$, there are two types of vanishing properties of the Betti\ndiagrams of the projected varieties, the so-called $N_{d,p}^S$ and\n$\\widetilde{N}_{d,p}$. The former one have been widely discussed for general\nvarieties, for example by S. Kwak, Y. Choi and E. Park, while the latter one\nwas discussed by W. Lee and E. Park for curves of very large degree.\n  In this paper I will discuss about the $\\widetilde{N}_{d,p}$ properties of\nthe projection of a generic canonical and paracanonical curve away from a\ngeneric point and in particular whether they are cut out by quadrics. Some\nconjectures will be claimed based on the tests on Macaulay2.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5dN7tuhdYRH0hRZsUtETK7F_vexNMLXDGUr7M2EL_FA","pdfSize":"247394"}
