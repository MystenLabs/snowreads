  "abstract": "  Issue salience is a major determinant in voters' decisions. Candidates and\npolitical parties campaign to shift salience to their advantage - a process\ntermed priming. We study the dynamics, strategies and equilibria of campaign\nspending for voter priming in multi-issue multi-party settings. We consider\nboth parliamentary elections, where parties aim to maximize their share of\nvotes, and various settings for presidential elections, where the winner takes\nall. For parliamentary elections, we show that pure equilibrium spending always\nexists and can be computed in time linear in the number of voters. For two\nparties and all settings, a spending equilibrium exists such that each party\ninvests only in a single issue, and an equilibrium can be computed in time that\nis polynomial in the number of issues and linear in the number of voters. We\nalso show that in most presidential settings no equilibrium exists. Additional\nproperties of optimal campaign strategies are also studied.\n",
