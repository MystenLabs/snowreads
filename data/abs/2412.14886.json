  "abstract": "  We present a scheme to realize a topological superconducting system\nsupporting Majorana zero modes, within a number-conserving framework suitable\nfor optical-lattice experiments. Our approach builds on the engineering of\npair-hopping processes on a ladder geometry, using a sequence of pulses that\nactivate single-particle hopping in a time-periodic manner. We demonstrate that\nthis dynamic setting is well captured by an effective Hamiltonian that\npreserves the parity symmetry, a key requirement for the stabilization of\nMajorana zero modes. The phase diagram of our system is determined using a\nbosonization theory, which is then validated by a numerical study of the\ntopological bulk gap and entanglement spectrum using matrix product states. Our\nresults indicate that Majorana zero modes can be stabilized in a large\nparameter space, accessible in optical-lattice experiments.\n",
