  "abstract": "  With the rapid development of generative artificial intelligence,\nparticularly large language models, a number of sub-fields of deep learning\nhave made significant progress and are now very useful in everyday\napplications. For example, well-known financial institutions simulate a wide\nrange of scenarios for various models created by their research teams using\nreinforcement learning, both before production and after regular operations. In\nthis work, we propose a backdoor attack that focuses solely on data poisoning.\nThis particular backdoor attack is classified as an attack without prior\nconsideration or trigger, and we name it FinanceLLMsBackRL. Our aim is to\nexamine the potential effects of large language models that use reinforcement\nlearning systems for text production or speech recognition, finance, physics,\nor the ecosystem of contemporary artificial intelligence models.\n",
