  "abstract": "  Motivated by recent developments in tetraquark studies, we investigate the\nmass spectra and decay properties of light-strange tetraquarks\n($sq\\bar{s}\\bar{q},ss\\bar{q}\\bar{q}$) in diquark-antidiquark formalism. By\nconsidering different internal quark structures and internal color structures,\nmass spectra are generated in semi-relativistic and non-relativistic\nframeworks. For decay widths, the annihilation model and spectator model have\nbeen incorporated. Several resonances have been explored as potential\ncandidates for these tetraquarks. Concurrently, mass spectra and several decay\nchannels of kaons ($s\\bar{q},q\\bar{s}$) are also investigated. This study is\ncarried out in the hope of helping improve the understanding of tetraquarks in\nthe light-light sector.\n",
