In the present work, we formulate a\nthermodynamically consistent kinetic framework to study the interplay between\nphase separation, chemical reaction and aging in spatially inhomogeneous\nmacromolecular mixtures. A numerical algorithm is also proposed to simulate\ndomain growth from collisions of liquid and gel domains via passive Brownian\nmotion in both two and three spatial dimensions. Our results show that the\ncoarsening behavior is significantly influenced by the degree of gelation and\nBrownian motion. The presence of a gel phase inside condensates strongly limits\nthe diffusive transport processes, and Brownian motion coalescence controls the\ncoarsening process in systems with high area/volume fractions of gel-like\ncondensates, leading to formation of interconnected domains with atypical\ndomain growth rates controlled by size-dependent translational and rotational\ndiffusivities.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MLLjM0lXD8TydqwgeSqYyNSvNBP-x1JhdsFNS5QrXnY","pdfSize":"8888447"}
