Our studies focus on the impact of black hole spin $a$,\nelectric charge $Q$ and PFDM parameter $\\lambda$ on the horizons, ecoregions\nand circular geodesics at the equatorial plane of this black hole, and how they\nfurther influence the reconnection efficiency and energy extraction rate. Our\nresults show that the size of ergoregion does not vary monotonically with\nincreasing dark matter parameters $\\lambda$, but it can significantly increase\nat faster spins ($a>0.8$) as the dark matter parameter $\\lambda$ decreases,\ngiven the electric charge stays within $Q\\in [0.2,0.5]$. We identify the\noptimal conditions for the combination of $a$, $Q$ and $\\lambda$ that enable\nefficient energy extraction even when the black hole is not rapidly spinning.\nThe Kerr-Newman black hole in PFDM allows for achieving high energy extraction\nrates comparable to those of most previously studied rotating black holes,\nwhich typically require near-extremal spin to reach similar efficiency levels.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JGi8Gt4n4cP0cNEchfU7WVVLZyxb2sC3Cky98uvCzGs","pdfSize":"3447463"}
