  "abstract": "  We present a microscopic theory of DC current-biased Josephson junctions,\nresolving long-standing discrepancies in the subharmonic gap structure (SGS)\nbetween theoretical predictions and experimental observations. Applicable to\njunctions with arbitrary transparencies, our approach surpasses existing\ntheories that fail to reproduce all experimentally observed SGS singularities.\nIntroducing a microscopic Floquet framework, we find a novel two-quasiparticle\nnon-equilibrium tunneling process absent in existing lowest-order tunneling\napproximations. We attribute the origin of the subharmonics to this\nnon-equilibrium tunneling of the Josephson effect. We elaborate this via two\ncomplementary perspectives: in the time domain, as the interference of\nnon-equilibrium current pulses, and in the frequency domain, as a generalized\nform of multiple Andreev reflections. Our framework extends to various types of\nJosephson junctions, providing insights into Josephson dynamics critical to\nquantum technologies.\n",
