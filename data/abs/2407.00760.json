Our\nframework lies in the realm of graph-based semi-supervised learning. With novel\nmodifications on Gaussian Random Fields Learning and Poisson Learning\nalgorithms, we increase the accuracy and create more robust algorithms.\nExperimental results demonstrate the efficiency and superiority of the proposed\nmethods over conventional graph-based semi-supervised techniques, especially in\nthe context of imbalanced datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"d9_rpHwKZ_is-1YOEHheg2qzUutEDkbPP1dPmWqzmJs","pdfSize":"734942","objectId":"0xc3928bc76482c8bd15c41b6a2da737abc06329e50e8c4a37f5545dafef5b33a4","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
