Although higher-order Ising models\nprovide a more compact encoding, they are, however, hard to physically\nimplement. This work proposes a theoretical framework of a higher-order Ising\nsimulator, IsingSim. The Ising spins and gradients in IsingSim are decoupled\nand self-customizable. We significantly accelerate the simulation speed via a\nbidirectional approach for differentiating the hyperedge functions. Our\nproof-of-concept implementation verifies the theoretical framework by\nsimulating the Ising spins with exact and approximate gradients. Experiment\nresults show that our novel framework can be a useful tool for providing design\nguidelines for higher-order Ising machines.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AoEABg11_zdBK5afCgMJW8Vkr3VI-8ViDXlSjDq6Th0","pdfSize":"1085772"}
