While not\nexhaustive in citations, this review provides historical context and discusses\nthe main controversies and limitations in the current consensus. The nuclear\nbulge region, within $\\sim$200 pc from the Galactic center, has been excluded\nfrom this review. This very complex region, hosting dense molecular clouds and\nactive star formation, would deserve a dedicated paper.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"sWRBz0IBbCyy2bhJ2hjIIlf8aFAdxxWTlAUjapryc2o","pdfSize":"3461894"}
