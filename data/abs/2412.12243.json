  "abstract": "  We study the 1d Ising model with long-range interactions decaying as\n$1/r^{1+s}$. The critical model corresponds to a family of 1d conformal field\ntheories (CFTs) whose data depends nontrivially on $s$ in the range $1/2\\leq\ns\\leq 1$. The model is known to be described by a generalized free field with\nquartic interaction, which is weakly coupled near $s=1/2$ but strongly coupled\nnear the short-range crossover at $s=1$. We propose a dual description which\nbecomes weakly coupled at $s=1$. At $s=1$, our model becomes an exactly\nsolvable conformal boundary condition for the 2d free scalar. We perform a\nnumber of consistency checks of our proposal and calculate the perturbative CFT\ndata around $s=1$ analytically using both 1) our proposed field theory and 2)\nthe analytic conformal bootstrap. Our results show complete agreement between\nthe two methods.\n",
