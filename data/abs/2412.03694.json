  "abstract": "  In this work, we develop two methods to obtain a factorisation as a product\nof bidiagonal matrices for the Hessenberg recurrence matrix of a system of\nmultiple orthogonal polynomials. One method is based on the Gauss-Borel\nfactorisation of the moment matrix of the system and of its Darboux\ntransformations, and the other uses the connection of multiple orthogonal\npolynomials with production matrices and branched continued fractions. As a\ncase study, we present an explicit bidiagonal factorisation for the Hessenberg\nrecurrence matrix of the Jacobi-Pi\\~neiro polynomials, using both methods, and\nof the multiple Laguerre polynomials of first kind, as a limiting case.\n",
