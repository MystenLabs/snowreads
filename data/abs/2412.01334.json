We investigate CHMs containing exactly three distinct\nelements, which is also the least number of distinct elements. In this paper,\nwe show that such CHMs can only be complex equivalent to two kind of matrices,\none is $H_2$-reducible and the other is the Tao matrix. Using our result one\ncan further narrow the range of MUB trio (a set of four MUBs in $\\mathbb{C}^6$\nconsists of an MUB trio and the identity) since we find that the two CHMs\nneither belong to MUB trios. Our results may\n  lead to the more complete classification of $6\\times 6$ CHMs whose elements\nin the first row are all 1.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"-IqbWtGpz5GqDQ8pudReuePUwAtfZI4uYwGIsevYslo","pdfSize":"300356"}
