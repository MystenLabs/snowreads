  "abstract": "  We present Plancraft, a multi-modal evaluation dataset for LLM agents.\nPlancraft has both a text-only and multi-modal interface, based on the\nMinecraft crafting GUI. We include the Minecraft Wiki to evaluate tool use and\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), as well as an oracle planner and oracle\nRAG information extractor, to ablate the different components of a modern agent\narchitecture. To evaluate decision-making, Plancraft also includes a subset of\nexamples that are intentionally unsolvable, providing a realistic challenge\nthat requires the agent not only to complete tasks but also to decide whether\nthey are solvable at all. We benchmark both open-source and closed-source LLMs\nand strategies on our task and compare their performance to a handcrafted\nplanner. We find that LLMs and VLMs struggle with the planning problems that\nPlancraft introduces, and we offer suggestions on how to improve their\ncapabilities.\n",
