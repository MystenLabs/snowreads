  "abstract": "  The famous Ryser--Brualdi--Stein conjecture asserts that every $n \\times n$\nLatin square contains a partial transversal of size $n-1$. Since its\nappearance, the conjecture has attracted significant interest, leading to\nseveral generalizations. One of the most notable extensions is to matroid\nintersection given by Aharoni, Kotlar, and Ziv, focusing on the existence of a\ncommon independent transversal of the common independent sets of two matroids.\nIn this paper, we study a special case of this setting, the Rainbow\nArborescence Conjecture, which states that any graph on $n$ vertices formed by\nthe union of $n-1$ spanning arborescences contains an arborescence using\nexactly one arc from each. We prove that the computational problem of testing\nthe existence of such an arborescence with a fixed root is NP-complete, verify\nthe conjecture in several cases, and explore relaxed versions of the problem.\n",
