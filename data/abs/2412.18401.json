  "abstract": "  In this paper, we introduce and investigate a model of magnetic quantum walk\non a general hypercube. We first construct a set of unitary involutions\nassociated with a magnetic potential $\\nu$ by using quantum Bernoulli noises.\nAnd then, with these unitary involutions as the magnetic shift operators, we\ndefine the evolution operator $\\mathsf{W}^{(\\nu)}$ for the model, where $\\nu$\nis the magnetic potential. We examine the point-spectrum and\napproximate-spectrum of the evolution operator $\\mathsf{W}^{(\\nu)}$ and obtain\ntheir representations in terms of the coin operator system of the model. We\nshow that the point-spectrum and approximate-spectrum of $\\mathsf{W}^{(\\nu)}$\nare completely independent of the magnetic potential $\\nu$ although\n$\\mathsf{W}^{(\\nu)}$ itself is dependent of the magnetic potential $\\nu$. Our\nwork might suggest that a quantum walk perturbed by a magnetic field can have\nspectral stability with respect to the magnetic potential.\n",
