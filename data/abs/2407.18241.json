It is unclear whether a model is actually better in using\nnumerical literals, or better capable of utilizing the graph structure. This\nraises doubts about the effectiveness of these methods and about the\nsuitability of the existing benchmark datasets.\n  We propose a methodology to evaluate LP models that incorporate numerical\nliterals. We propose i) a new synthetic dataset to better understand how well\nthese models use numerical literals and ii) dataset ablations strategies to\ninvestigate potential difficulties with the existing datasets. We identify a\nprevalent trend: many models underutilize literal information and potentially\nrely on additional parameters for performance gains. Our investigation\nhighlights the need for more extensive evaluations when releasing new models\nand datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pyB448dsYtg-sqHIG89z4JYUYQETLO4i7WrXrJoMs3Q","pdfSize":"1203750"}
