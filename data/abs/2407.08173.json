Dielectric confinement is well described by a\nfractional dimension scaling law as a function of layer thickness. The\ncontribution from polaron formation is found to be a non-monotonic function of\nthe lead halide layer thickness, which is clarified by a general variational\ntheory. Accounting for both of these effects provides a description of exciton\nbinding energies in good agreement with experimental measurements. By studying\nisolated layers and stacked layered crystals of various thicknesses, with\nligands of varying polarity, we provide a systematic understanding of the\nexcitonic behavior of this class of materials and how to engineer their\nphotophysics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"08ebDNSpqvuJQnM9bCvhBRp4-odOW8GeHJmONn7IZQI","pdfSize":"692540"}
