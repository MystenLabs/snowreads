Encouraging AM\nintegration in a risk-averse community necessitates documentation and\ndissemination of previous case studies. The objective of this study is to\ncreate the first review of AM in astronomy hardware, answering: where is AM\ncurrently being used in astronomy, what is the status of its adoption, and what\nchallenges are preventing its widespread use? The review starts with an\nintroduction to astronomical instruments size/cost challenges, alongside the\nrole of manufacturing innovation. This is followed by highlighting the\nbenefits/challenges of AM and used materials/processes in both space-based and\nground-based applications. The review case studies include mirrors,\noptomechanical structures, compliant mechanisms, brackets and tooling\napplications that are either in research phase or are implemented.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VzaDl2wp2V37xO8LAs9b1HXyNoZ2ZKA4bI2ue3THzFM","pdfSize":"11646876","objectId":"0x4b1720df5e86a4e30a01d534a95f0fb42a21902b76879f1c3ee30eca9bdefc64","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
