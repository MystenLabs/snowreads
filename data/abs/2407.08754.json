These techniques offer comprehensive solutions that traditional\nsingle-objective approaches fail to provide. Due to the many innovative\nalgorithms, it has been challenging for researchers to choose the optimal\nalgorithms for solving their problems. This paper examines recently developed\nMOO-based algorithms. MOO is introduced along with Pareto optimality and\ntrade-off analysis. In real-world case studies, MOO algorithms address\ncomplicated decision-making challenges. This paper examines algorithmic\nmethods, applications, trends, and issues in multi-objective optimization\nresearch. This exhaustive review explains MOO algorithms, their methods, and\ntheir applications to real-world problems. This paper aims to contribute\nfurther advancements in MOO research. No singular strategy is superior;\ninstead, selecting a particular method depends on the natural optimization\nproblem, the computational resources available, and the specific objectives of\nthe optimization tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"H1TiywYNgQ-a68gpDXpXgHbC40LZ7F1beqAtv33h20U","pdfSize":"542149"}
