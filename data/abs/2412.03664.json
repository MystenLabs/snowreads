This class comprises two spectroscopically similar\nsubclasses - dusty R Coronae Borealis (RCB) and dustless Hydrogen-deficient\nCarbon (dLHdC) stars. Both subclasses have a stark overabundance of\n$^{18}\\textrm{O}$ in their atmospheres, but spectroscopic differences between\nthem remain poorly studied. We present high-resolution ($R \\approx 75000$)\nK-band spectra of six RCB and six dLHdC stars, including four newly discovered\ndLHdC stars, making this the largest sample to date. We develop a\nsemi-automated fitting routine to measure $^{16}\\textrm{O}/^{18}\\textrm{O}$\nratios for this sample, tripling the number of dLHdC stars with oxygen isotope\nratios measured from high resolution spectra. All six dLHdC stars have\n$^{16}\\textrm{O}/^{18}\\textrm{O}<1$, while the RCB stars have\n$^{16}\\textrm{O}/^{18}\\textrm{O}>4$. Additionally, for the first time, we find\na trend of decreasing $^{16}\\textrm{O}/^{18}\\textrm{O}$ ratios with increasing\neffective temperature for HdC stars, consistent with predictions of theoretical\nWD merger models. However, we note that current models overpredict the low\n$^{16}\\textrm{O}/^{18}\\textrm{O}$ ratios of dLHdC stars by two orders of\nmagnitude. We also measure abundances of C, N, O, Fe, S, Si, Mg, Na, and Ca for\nthese stars. We observe a correlation between the abundances of\n$^{14}\\textrm{N}$ and $^{18}\\textrm{O}$ in our sample, suggesting that a fixed\nfraction of the $^{14}\\textrm{N}$ is converted to $^{18}\\textrm{O}$ in these\nstars via $\\alpha$-capture. Our results affirm the emerging picture that the\nmass ratio/total mass of the WD binary determine whether an RCB or dLHdC is\nformed post-merger.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AD838S2g2EwOVg9FuqAQvAiZO7C0CLbeU2UvQlXmSlE","pdfSize":"1033945"}
