  "abstract": "  Our understanding of the structure of atomic nuclei largely derives from the\nnuclear shell model, which has proven widely successful. Further test to our\ninterpretation of the nuclear properties is provided by the study of shell\nevolution. Increasing experimental information has shown that the nuclear\nenergy shells change when going towards the most exotic nuclei, in turn making\nsome shell closures disappear while others arise. In particular, the $N=40$\nsub-shell closure has been the subject of extensive research due to the\nemergence of a so-called Island of Inversion, where deformed intruder\nconfigurations dominate the wave function of the ground state. An overview of\nrecent experimental results in the $N=40$ Island of Inversion, particularly\nthose performed with the combination of the MINOS hydrogen target and the DALI2\n$\\gamma$-ray array at the RIBF are discussed.\n",
