  "abstract": "  We examine the correlations between new scalar boson decays to photons and\nelectric dipole moments (EDMs) in the CP-violating flavor-aligned\ntwo-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM). It is convenient to work in the Higgs basis\n$\\{{H}_1, {H}_2\\}$ where only the first Higgs doublet field ${H}_1$ acquires a\nvacuum expectation value. In light of the LHC Higgs data, which agree well with\nStandard Model (SM) predictions, it follows that the parameters of the 2HDM are\nconsistent with the Higgs alignment limit. In this parameter regime, the\nobserved SM-like Higgs boson resides almost entirely in ${H}_1$, and the other\ntwo physical neutral scalars, which reside almost entirely in ${H}_2$, are\napproximate eigenstates of CP (denoted by the CP-even $H$ and the CP-odd $A$).\nIn the Higgs basis, the scalar potential term $\\bar{Z}_7 {H}_1^\\dagger {H}_2\n{H}_2^\\dagger {H}_2+{\\rm h.c.}$ governs the charged-Higgs loop contributions to\nthe decay of $H$ and $A$ to photons. If $ \\text{Re } \\bar{Z}_7 \\, \\text{Im }\n\\bar{Z}_7 \\neq 0$, then CP-violating effects are present and allow for an $H^+\nH^- A$ coupling, which can yield a sizable branching ratio for\n$A\\to\\gamma\\gamma$. These CP-violating effects also generate non-zero EDMs for\nthe electron, the neutron and the proton. We examine these correlations for the\ncases of $m_{A}=95$ GeV and $m_{A}=152$ GeV where interesting excesses in the\ndiphoton spectrum have been observed at the LHC. These excesses can be\nexplained via the decay of $A$ while being consistent with the experimental\nbound for the electron EDM in regions of parameter space that can be tested\nwith future neutron and proton EDM measurements. This allows for the\ninteresting possibility where the 95 GeV diphoton excess can be identified with\n$A$, while $m_H\\simeq 98$ GeV can account for the best fit to the LEP excess in\n$e^+e^-\\to ZH$ with $H\\to b\\bar b$.\n",
