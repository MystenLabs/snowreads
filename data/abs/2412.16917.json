Although\nwe successfully separate the $^{51}$V NMR signals in the domain from those in\nthe other structural domains, only the high-frequency region of NMR spectrum is\nobserved due to a significant increase of the spin-echo decay rate in the\nlow-frequency region. In $B_{\\rm{ext}}\\parallel[111]$, we find the NMR signals\nfrom the supermagnetized cycloidal state in the parallel domains as well as\nfrom the conical state in domains where the polar axis is tilted from the\nmagnetic field. No NMR signal from the skyrmion lattice state is observed,\nsuggesting a significant increase of the decay rate by additional low-energy\nexcitations caused by dynamics of the skyrmions. In\n$B_{\\rm{ext}}\\parallel[001]$, where all the structural domains are magnetically\nequivalent, multiple NMR peaks converge into one peak at the saturation\nmagnetic field. This field dependence is explained by the closing of magnetic\ncones as approaching the forced-ferromagnetic state.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"QvoCpGAfH4juH9oFUoH8vVJUbZBE1ZM-_NSgEETSD3I","pdfSize":"2670253"}
