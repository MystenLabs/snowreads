We\nprovide a positive answer for a class of systems related to the restricted\nthree-body problem by defining and computing its Lagrangian Rabinowitz Floer\nhomology. The main technical work goes into dealing with the noncompactness of\nthe corresponding energy hypersurfaces.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"daekt8_H3aB_e0MMDMhdL4Sknb9t3hfoFZ902vGRIvI","pdfSize":"573365"}
