We find that, altermagnetism,\nas a newly discovered unconventional magnetism, may open an avenue along this\neffort. Specifically, to have deterministic switching, i.e., reversing current\ndirection must reverse magnetic structure, parity symmetry has to be broken. We\ndiscover that due to their symmetry that depends on chemical environments,\naltermagnet devices may naturally carry the parity symmetry breaking required\nfor deterministic electrical switching of magnetism. More importantly, we\nidentify MnTe and FeS bilayers as candidate devices. This scheme will inspire\nfurther explorations on unconventional magnetism and potential applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4_6j9rTDQoFNsOZJYtDyB8CKF46wPYq1guSGenJsIHY","pdfSize":"547011"}
