  "abstract": "  Living organisms have some common structures, chemical reactions and\nmolecular structures. The organisms consist of cells with cell division, they\nhave homochirality of protein and carbohydrate units, and metabolism, and\ngenetics, and they are mortal. The molecular structures and chemical reactions\nunderlying these features are common from the simplest bacteria to human\nbeings. The origin of life is evolutionary with the emergence of a network of\nspontaneous biochemical reactions, and the evolution has taken place over a\nvery long time. The evolution contains, however some \"landmarks\" and\nbottlenecks, which in a revolutionary manner directed the evolution, and the\narticle tries to establish the order of these events. The article advocates\nthat a possible order in the emergence of life is that the first milestone in\nprebiotic evolution is at the emergence of homochirality in proteins. The\nhomochirality of peptides is, however, with instability and racemization which\ncauses aging of the peptides and mortality. The metabolism and genetics are\nestablished through homochiral enzymes in the Earth's crust for $\\approx$ 4 Gyr\nago. Finally, the cells with cell division are established in the Hot Springs\nenvironment at the interface between the crust and the Hadean Ocean.\n",
