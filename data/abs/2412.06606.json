These assignment algorithms consider two main factors: (1)\nreviewers' expressed interests indicated by their bids for papers, and (2)\nreviewers' domain expertise inferred from the similarity between the text of\ntheir previously published papers and the submitted manuscripts. A significant\nchallenge these conferences face is the existence of collusion rings, where\ngroups of researchers manipulate the assignment process to review each other's\npapers, providing positive evaluations regardless of their actual quality. Most\nefforts to combat collusion rings have focused on preventing bid manipulation,\nunder the assumption that the text similarity component is secure. In this\npaper, we demonstrate that even in the absence of bidding, colluding reviewers\nand authors can exploit the machine learning based text-matching component of\nreviewer assignment used at top ML/AI venues to get assigned their target\npaper. We also highlight specific vulnerabilities within this system and offer\nsuggestions to enhance its robustness.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Cryptography and Security","Computer Science/Digital Libraries"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"b038Ox8rjs55UhehYaFlCZ4Me2I8uLBAHFhKZQOdw-0","pdfSize":"967198"}
