  "abstract": "  Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is widely viewed as a potential\ncandidate for providing enhanced multiple access in future mobile networks by\neliminating the orthogonal distribution of radio resources amongst the users.\nNevertheless, the performance of NOMA can be significantly improved by\ncombining it with other sophisticated technologies such as wireless data\ncaching and device-to-device (D2D) communications. In this letter, we propose a\nnovel cellular system model which integrates uplink NOMA with cache based\ndevice-to-device (D2D) communications. The proposed system would enable a\ncellular user to upload data file to base station while simultaneously\nexchanging useful cache content with another nearby user. We maximize the\nsystem sum rate by deriving closed form solutions for optimal power allocation.\nSimulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model\nover other potential combinations of uplink NOMA and D2D communications.\n",
