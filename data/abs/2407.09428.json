The inherent connection between storage and transmission infrastructure\nis captured from a \"cumulative energy\" perspective, which enables the\nreformulating of the conventional optimization problem by employing line power\nflow as the decision variable. The study also establishes the theoretical\nlimitations of both storage and transmission lines that can be replaced by each\nother, providing explicit closed-form expressions for the minimum capacity\nneeded. As a key departure from conventional practice in which transmission\nlines are designed according to the peak power delivery needs, with sufficient\nstorage capacity, the transmission line capacity can be designed based on the\naverage power delivery needs. The models of this paper only rely on a few basic\nassumptions, paving the way for understanding future storage as a transmission\nasset market design. Numerical experiments based on 2-bus, modified RTS 24-bus,\nRTS-GMLC, and Texas synthetic power systems illustrate the results.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lzU-n46sl-eSsBCk9awsYdcBpUpX2CLymFm8aqYbp0g","pdfSize":"2010222"}
