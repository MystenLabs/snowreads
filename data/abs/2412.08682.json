In this study, we present a PYTHIA8-based Monte Carlo\nstudy of substructure of jets produced in $p+p$ collisions at 200 GeV. The\nselection criteria is adapted for a feasible measurement at sPHENIX. We\nconsider different types of jet substructure observables such as jet\nangularities and primary Lund Plane with a special focus on suppression of\ncollinear radiation around emitting heavy quark known as a dead cone effect.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UriXrG7wdyJE0NzHpoxVfJR9huosGFMWU_1s2g0s77M","pdfSize":"983772"}
