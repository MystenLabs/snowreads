The molecular mechanisms driving it are, however, elusive and\nill-understood. Here, we use computer simulations to explore the role of 3D\nchromatin structure in driving transcriptional noise. We study a simple polymer\nmodel where proteins - modeling complexes of transcription factors and\npolymerases - bind multivalently to transcription units - modeling regulatory\nelements such as promoters and enhancers. We also include cohesin-like factors\nwhich extrude chromatin loops that are important for the physiological folding\nof chromosomes. We find that transcription factor binding creates\nspatiotemporal patterning and a highly variable correlation time in\ntranscriptional dynamics, providing a mechanism for intrinsic noise within a\nsingle cell. Instead, loop extrusion contributes to extrinsic noise, as the\nstochastic nature of this process leads to different networks of cohesin loops\nin different cells in our simulations. Our results could be tested with\nsingle-cell experiments and provide a pathway to understanding the principles\nunderlying transcriptional plasticity in vivo.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"0H2QBIWFMyXKhoUB2Do-G7OomjL_QvhclbveATkDkH4","pdfSize":"11834670"}
