As the literature does not contain more than a proof\nsketch of the lower bound of this equiconsistency, we give an expository proof\nwhich fills in the details in order to fill this gap in the literature.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"H3-0ETSJ0lUQcHYmihHJBumdi8_TQLqHxPox287GUUo","pdfSize":"93589"}
