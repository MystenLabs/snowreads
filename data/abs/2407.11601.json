Given that surf-riding precedes\nbroaching, the SGISC uses vulnerability criteria for broaching based on\nsurf-riding dynamics. The surf-riding threshold is derived by Melnikov's method\nin the level-2 vulnerability criterion. In this paper, the authors discuss the\nuniqueness of the approximate analytical solutions to be used as the\nsurf-riding threshold in the SGISC and based on the relationship between\nMelnikov's analysis and its physical interpretation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"_vBJtKTUJu_miuWpArfaYDyDmn1QyCYYwZ201_nL9S8","pdfSize":"129655","objectId":"0xee44ae541deca155b654e92afb80221c7cec75d0b51f7fb93ecb354323f88957","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
