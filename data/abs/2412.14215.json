With this paper we introduce the Generative AI Toolkit, which\nautomates essential workflows over the whole life cycle of LLM-based\napplications. The toolkit helps to configure, test, continuously monitor and\noptimize Generative AI applications such as agents, thus significantly\nimproving quality while shortening release cycles. We showcase the\neffectiveness of our toolkit on representative use cases, share best practices,\nand outline future enhancements. Since we are convinced that our Generative AI\nToolkit is helpful for other teams, we are open sourcing it on and hope that\nothers will use, forward, adapt and improve\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Software Engineering","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6F9cyDsjvxz7bUra-ih2nk-1qxd952yZzuDnxDFxeK0","pdfSize":"1534362"}
