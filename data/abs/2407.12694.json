These new high-resolution\nsimulations allowed us to revisit fitting formulas proposed in the literature\nand provided updated fitting parameters that extend to less massive haloes and\nlower neutrino masses than previously in the literature, in accordance with new\ncosmological limits. The trend we observe for low neutrino masses is that, for\ndark matter halo masses below $\\sim 4\\times10^{14}$$h^{-1}M_\\odot$, the\npresence of the core becomes weaker and the profile over the whole radius is\ncloser to a simple power law. We also characterized the neutrino density\nprofile dependence on the solid angle within clustered structures: a\nforward-backward asymmetry larger than 10% was found when comparing the density\nprofiles from neutrinos along the direction of motion of cold dark matter\nparticles within the same halo. In addition, we looked for neutrino wakes\naround halo centres produced by the peculiar motion of the halo itself. Our\nresults suggest that the wakes effect is observable in haloes with masses\ngreater than $3\\times10^{14}$ $h^{-1}M_\\odot$ where a mean displacement of\n$0.06$\\hmpc was found.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GtBi5VWxnIvy4Kp_xpK-UOys0Jn8tumbdJMiVZ7YOzw","pdfSize":"4178341"}
