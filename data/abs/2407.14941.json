For a Cahn-Hilliard energy with a singular (logarithmic)\npotential short time well-posedness of strong solutions together with a\nseparation property is shown, under the assumption of a priori prescribed\nsurface evolution. The problem is reformulated with the help of a pullback to\nthe initial surface. Then a suitable linearization and a contraction mapping\nargument for the pullback system are used. In order to deal with the linearized\nsystem, it is necessary to show maximal $L^2$-regularity for the surface Stokes\noperator in the case of variable viscosity and to obtain maximal\n$L^p$-regularity for the linearized Cahn-Hilliard system.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"MVRSuR7PCs8Tp2lSRCn1IIEDlBK2XO9y5yczJ6vICxs","pdfSize":"425809"}
