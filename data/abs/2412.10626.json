  "abstract": "  Information theory, introduced by Shannon, has been extremely successful and\ninfluential as a mathematical theory of communication. Shannon's notion of\ninformation does not consider the meaning of the messages being communicated\nbut only their probability. Even so, computational approaches regularly appeal\nto \"information processing\" to study how meaning is encoded and decoded in\nnatural and artificial systems. Here, we contrast Shannon information theory\nwith integrated information theory (IIT), which was developed to account for\nthe presence and properties of consciousness. IIT considers meaning as\nintegrated information and characterizes it as a structure, rather than as a\nmessage or code. In principle, IIT's axioms and postulates allow one to\n\"unfold\" a cause-effect structure from a substrate in a state, a structure that\nfully defines the intrinsic meaning of an experience and its contents. It\nfollows that, for the communication of meaning, the cause-effect structures of\nsender and receiver must be similar.\n",
