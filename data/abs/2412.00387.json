  "abstract": "  The advent of large-scale quantum computers implies that our existing\npublic-key cryptography infrastructure has become insecure. That means that the\nprivacy of many mobile applications involving dynamic peer groups, such as\nmulticast messaging or pay-per-view, could be compromised. In this work we\npropose a generalization of the well known group key exchange protocol proposed\nby Burmester and Desmedt to the non-abelian case by the use of finite group\nactions and we prove that the presented protocol is secure in Katz and Yung's\nmodel.\n",
