While artificial\nintelligence (AI) has made significant advances in automating aspects of\nscientific reasoning, simulation, and experimentation, we still lack integrated\nAI systems capable of performing autonomous long-term scientific research and\ndiscovery. This paper examines the current state of AI for scientific\ndiscovery, highlighting recent progress in large language models and other AI\ntechniques applied to scientific tasks. We then outline key challenges and\npromising research directions toward developing more comprehensive AI systems\nfor scientific discovery, including the need for science-focused AI agents,\nimproved benchmarks and evaluation metrics, multimodal scientific\nrepresentations, and unified frameworks combining reasoning, theorem proving,\nand data-driven modeling. Addressing these challenges could lead to\ntransformative AI tools to accelerate progress across disciplines towards\nscientific discovery.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tEIkRcMu7VjpE_B4Mv2Q7tB3gDPFi7jCcbmbggn91Mw","pdfSize":"3261065"}
