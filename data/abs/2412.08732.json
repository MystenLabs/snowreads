  "abstract": "  A broad class of observables in four-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=2$ and\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal Yang-Mills theories can be exactly computed for\narbitrary 't Hooft coupling as Fredholm determinants of integrable Bessel\noperators. These observables admit a unifying description through a\none-parameter generating function, which possesses a determinant representation\ninvolving a matrix generalization of the Bessel operator. We analyze this\ngenerating function over a wide range of parameter values and finite 't Hooft\ncoupling. We demonstrate that it has a well-behaved weak-coupling expansion\nwith a finite radius of convergence. In contrast, the strong-coupling expansion\nexhibits factorially growing coefficients, necessitating the inclusion of\nnon-perturbative corrections that are exponentially suppressed at strong\ncoupling. We compute these non-perturbative corrections and observe a striking\nresemblance between the resulting trans-series expansion of the generating\nfunction and the partition function of a strongly coupled theory expanded in\npowers of a mass gap.\n",
