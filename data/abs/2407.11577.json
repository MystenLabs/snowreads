{"id":"2407.11577","title":"Dirichlet spaces over chord-arc domains","authors":"Huaying Wei and Michel Zinsmeister","authorsParsed":[["Wei","Huaying",""],["Zinsmeister","Michel",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2024 10:40:20 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-17","timestamp":1721126420000,"abstract":"  If $U$ is a $C^{\\infty}$ function with compact support in the plane, we let\n$u$ be its restriction to the unit circle $\\mathbb{S}$, and denote by\n$U_i,\\,U_e$ the harmonic extensions of $u$ respectively in the interior and the\nexterior of $\\mathbb S$ on the Riemann sphere. About a hundred years ago,\nDouglas has shown that \\begin{align*}\n  \\iint_{\\mathbb{D}}|\\nabla U_i|^2(z)dxdy&=\n\\iint_{\\bar{\\mathbb{C}}\\backslash\\bar{\\mathbb{D}}}|\\nabla U_e|^2(z)dxdy\n  &= \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\iint_{\\mathbb S\\times\\mathbb\nS}\\left|\\frac{u(z_1)-u(z_2)}{z_1-z_2}\\right|^2|dz_1||dz_2|, \\end{align*} thus\ngiving three ways to express the Dirichlet norm of $u$. On a rectifiable Jordan\ncurve $\\Gamma$ we have obvious analogues of these three expressions, which will\nof course not be equal in general. The main goal of this paper is to show that\nthese $3$ (semi-)norms are equivalent if and only if $\\Gamma$ is a chord-arc\ncurve.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vaB7qbgb3mTF1EDrbNddC5Efkl3b3QdS_hQBpQDrkvc","pdfSize":"306238"}
