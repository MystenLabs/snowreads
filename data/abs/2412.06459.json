To establish a systematic understanding of CDW, we\ndevelop a diagrammatic self-consistent-field approach for cubic Holstein model\nemploying fluctuation exchange approximation, and explore the emergence and\ntransition of three-dimensional CDWs. Commensurate CDW (c-CDW) locked at\n$(\\pi,\\pi,\\pi)$ is favored near half-filling, and the transition temperature is\npredicted around half of the nearest-neighbor hopping. Large hole doping leads\nto a suppression of CDW transition temperature and the emergence of\nincommensurate CDW (i-CDW), which is evidenced by a drifting of the ordering\nvector away from $(\\pi,\\pi,\\pi)$ towards $(\\pi,\\pi,0)$. Phonon frequency\nsignificantly impacts the transition temperature and the phase boundary between\nc-CDW and i-CDW, and the optimal frequency for enlarging the CDW regime is also\npredicted near half of the nearest-neighbor hopping. These new theoretical\nresults provide a systematic understanding of CDW and a fresh perspective on\nemergent phenomena dominated by electron-phonon interaction.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"F-Jda37teCcf0pRY0z8TP3L0I870emzW_SxlhOsUhpc","pdfSize":"737639"}
