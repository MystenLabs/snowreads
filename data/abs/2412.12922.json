  "abstract": "  We use numerical simulations to determine whether the saturation length of\nthe self-modulation (SM) instability of a long proton bunch in plasma could be\ndetermined by measuring the radius of the bunch halo SM produces. Results show\nthat defocused protons acquire their maximum transverse momentum and exit the\nwakefields at a distance approximately equal to the saturation length of the\nwakefields. This suggests that measuring the radius of the halo as a function\nof plasma length in the AWAKE experiment would yield a very good estimate for\nthe saturation length of SM.\n",
