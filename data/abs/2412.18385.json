We theoretically designed a MoS$_2$-based transistor,\nfeaturing bilayer MoS$_2$ connected to Cu-intercalated bilayer MoS$_2$\nelectrodes. At 0.6 V, contact resistance is 16.7 $\\Omega \\cdot \\mu$m (zigzag)\nand 30.0 $\\Omega \\cdot \\mu$m (armchair), nearing or even surpassing the 30\n$\\Omega \\cdot \\mu$m quantum limit for single-layer materials. This low\nresistance is attributed to the elimination of the tunneling barrier and the\ncreation of ohmic contacts. Additionally, the small contact potential\ndifference enables lower operating voltages. Our intercalation design offers a\nnovel approach to achieving low contact resistance in 2D electronic devices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"PdFqV9f8liz63jwENuVIfX3b_MMKQ7cJ81pRCwrjmsQ","pdfSize":"1853072"}
