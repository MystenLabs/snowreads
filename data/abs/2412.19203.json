In 2023, Li and Sun \\cite{LiSun1} determined all the connected\n$\\{K_{2,3}, K_4\\}$-minor free graphs whose second largest eigenvalue\n$\\lambda_2\\le 1$. As a continuance of it, in this paper we completely identify\nall the connected $\\{K_5,K_{3,3}\\}$-minor free graphs without $C_3$ whose\nsecond largest eigenvalue does not exceed 1. This partially solves an open\nproblem posed by Li and Sun \\cite{LiSun1}: Characterize all connected planar\ngraphs whose second largest eigenvalue is at most $1.$ Our main tools include\nthe spectral theory and the local structure characterization of the planar\ngraph with respect to its girth.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"057u4B-jbmePg6JDVKEUoP525YkTvEchuWAZxKaA4yg","pdfSize":"366114"}
