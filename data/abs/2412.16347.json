Dissipative energy functionals, also known as Hamiltonians, storage\nfunctions, or Lyapunov functions, depending on the setting, are extremely\nvaluable to analyze and control the behavior of dynamical systems, but in\ngeneral circumstances they are very difficult to compute, and not fully\nunderstood. In this paper we consider passive linear time-varying (LTV)\nsystems, under very mild regularity assumptions, and their associated storage\nfunctions, as a necessary step to analyze general nonlinear systems. We\ndemonstrate that every passive LTV system must have at least one time-varying\npositive semidefinite quadratic storage function, greatly reducing our search\nscope. Now focusing on quadratic storage functions, we analyze in detail their\nnecessary regularity, which is lesser than continuous. Moreover, we prove that\nthe rank of quadratic storage functions is nonincreasing in time, allowing us\nto introduce a novel null space decomposition, under much weaker assumptions\nthan the one needed for general matrix functions. Additionally, we show a\nnecessary kernel condition for the quadratic storage function, allowing us to\nreduce our search scope even further.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sxBP32WlQQylZIxrfLpm3W55R83VUJFzM0ypl6Awfgg","pdfSize":"369248"}
