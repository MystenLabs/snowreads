Consequently, in\nthe presence of the resonant channel, the acquired polarization can be clearly\nobserved even for light ions when it is challenging to discern which state of\nthe ion was excited in the process. We also show that the energy dependence of\nthe polarization parameter clearly demonstrates strong interference both\nbetween the contributions of specific autoionizing states in the resonant\nchannel and between the non-resonant and resonant channels.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7nkQZWWVAh1fCy0gAflKzcu_1X-OpVVKvPX-06AqeEY","pdfSize":"10029054"}
