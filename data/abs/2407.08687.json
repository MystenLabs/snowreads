In particular, they allow one to\nbuild generative models of complex non-linear fields from a limited amount of\ndata. In the context of upcoming cosmological surveys, the extension of these\ntools to spherical data is necessary. We develop scattering transforms on the\nsphere and focus on the construction of maximum-entropy generative models of\nastrophysical fields. The quality of the generative models, both statistically\nand visually, is very satisfying, which therefore open up a wide range of new\napplications for future cosmological studies.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CA6Al8NKRIycEQQzjI88axU3feRNuEDzjMdTukl1kkY","pdfSize":"505824"}
