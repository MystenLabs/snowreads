Introducing a novel framework, we define a\ndistance metric within the parameter space of the INAR($\\infty$) model, which\nimproves parameter estimation capabilities. Employing a least-squares\nestimator, we derive its theoretical properties, demonstrating its equivalence\nto a norm-based metric and establishing its optimality within this framework.\n  To validate the estimator's performance, we conduct comprehensive numerical\nexperiments with sample sizes $T=200$ and $T=500$. These simulations reveal\nthat the estimator accurately recovers the true parameters and exhibits\nasymptotic normality, as confirmed by statistical tests and visual assessments\nsuch as histograms and Q--Q plots. Our findings provide empirical support for\nthe theoretical underpinnings of the cumulative INAR($\\infty$) model and affirm\nthe efficacy of the proposed estimation method. This work not only deepens the\nunderstanding of infinite-order count time series models but also establishes\nparallels with continuous-time Hawkes processes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"16LatkZnxsejU_D4tqz-dsIBVHpLK93jvXfq_Xsf1Y0","pdfSize":"631401"}
