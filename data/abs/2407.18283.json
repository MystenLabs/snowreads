This study examines how wear-induced\ngouge production affects the evolution of fault seismicity, focusing on\nearthquake nucleation, recurrence, and moment partitioning. Using 2D\nquasi-dynamic simulations integrating rate-and-state friction with Archard's\nlaw of wear, we model the space-time distribution of gouge and its effect on\nthe critical slip distance. The study reveals a shift from single to\nmulti-rupture nucleation, marked by increased foreshock activity. The\nrecurrence interval undergoes two separate phases: an initial phase of steady\nincrease followed by a secondary phase of unpredictable behavior. Finally, we\nobserve a transition in the moment partitioning from faster to slower slip\nrates and a decrease in the moment released per cycle relative to the case\nwhere no gouge formation is simulated. This research sheds light on wear-driven\nmechanisms affecting fault slip behavior, offering valuable insights into how\nthe evolution of gouge along a fault affects its seismic potential.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QnqsspuMsJlf48Tlsc79brRIG_Ck-ZSI_sO_djBY0ys","pdfSize":"114798740","objectId":"0x31323aa232096e70a22ef3cf07146f99061048ee5f81955f09f8e87f0fe589eb","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
