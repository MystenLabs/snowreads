However, the larger bond\ndimensions are known to be difficult to achieve in practice due to the higher\ncomputational cost. Adopting the methods of the minimally decomposed TRG and\nits triad prescriptions, we construct a triad representation of the\nfour-dimensional ATRG by decomposing the unit-cell tensor. We observe that this\ncombining approach can significantly improve the computational cost even with\nmaintaining the convergence accuracy of the free energy in the four-dimensional\nIsing model. In addition, we also show that a further improvement can be\nachieved in terms of the computational cost when our proposed approach is\nimplemented in parallel on GPUs.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zZ2S7qr8PCKFNp48dCTOYjsIwmzdcsjVzjnjm57L9-s","pdfSize":"448501"}
