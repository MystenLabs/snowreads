  "abstract": "  The higher Bruhat orders $\\mathcal{B}(n,k)$ were introduced by\nManin-Schechtman to study discriminantal hyperplane arrangements and\nsubsequently studied by Ziegler, who connected $\\mathcal{B}(n,k)$ to oriented\nmatroids. In this paper, we consider the enumeration of $\\mathcal{B}(n,k)$ and\nimprove upon Balko's asymptotic lower and upper bounds on $|\\mathcal{B}(n,k)|$\nby a factor exponential in $k$. A proof of Ziegler's formula for\n$|\\mathcal{B}(n,n-3)|$ is given and a bijection between a certain subset of\n$\\mathcal{B}(n,n-4)$ and totally symmetric plane partitions is proved. Central\nto our proofs are deletion and contraction operations for the higher Bruhat\norders, defined in analogy with matroids. Dual higher Bruhat orders are also\nintroduced, and we construct isomorphisms relating the higher Bruhat orders and\ntheir duals. Additionally, weaving functions are introduced to generalize\nFelsner's encoding of elements in $\\mathcal{B}(n,2)$ to all higher Bruhat\norders $\\mathcal{B}(n,k)$.\n",
