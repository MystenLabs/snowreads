This paper explores the fundamental importance\nof system fingerprinting as a proactive and effective approach to addressing\nthis issue. By capturing a comprehensive host's fingerprint, including\nhardware-related details, file hashes, and kernel-level information, during\nperiods of system cleanliness, a historical record is established. This\nhistorical record provides valuable insights into system changes and assists in\nunderstanding the factors contributing to a security breach. We develop a tool\nto capture and store these fingerprints securely, leveraging the advanced\nsecurity features. Our approach presents a robust solution to address the\nconstantly evolving cyber threat landscape, thereby safeguarding the integrity\nand security of critical systems.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2QsyiJJwu0nNnyfRjkcSw3mmTjKD30p55rSBFpPn9z0","pdfSize":"166822"}
