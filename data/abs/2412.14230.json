This solution interpolates between\nAy\\'on--Beato--Garc\\'ia black hole, Letelier black hole and Schwarzschild black\nhole { in the absence of cloud of strings parameter, magnetic monopole charge\nand both of them, respectively}. We also discuss the thermal properties of this\nblack hole and find that the solution follows the modified first law of black\nhole thermodynamics. Furthermore, we estimate the solution's black hole shadow\nand quasinormal modes.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8WNshIzh8_YgYlSLBcZkMFEO8tpGERRs1DBwsDIfdo4","pdfSize":"624325"}
