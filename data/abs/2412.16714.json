It is applied to the diffusive\nscaling of the symmetric Zero-Range Process (in dimensions one and two). The\nrate of convergence is estimated in a Monge-Kantorovich distance asymptotic to\nthe L^1 stability estimate of Kruzkhov, as well as in relative entropy; and it\nis uniform in time. The method avoids the use of the so-called ``block\nestimates''. It is based on a modulated Monge-Kantorovich distance estimate and\nmicroscopic stability properties.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"Qxs1jwiY4JbHCbRSaAuslnoUZYtnDT2khNfGLGN29yY","pdfSize":"636196"}
