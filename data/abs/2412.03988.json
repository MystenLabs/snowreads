  "abstract": "  We consider the kinematic distances to nearby galaxies obtained by the\nNumerical Action Method (NAM) based on the Cosmic-flow-3 survey data. NAM\ndistances are compared with 418 high-precision distances measured by the Tip of\nthe Red Giant Branch (TRGB) method using the Hubble Space Telescope. We\nestimated the average difference <D_NAM - D_TRGB> = -0.30 +- 0.08 Mpc and the\nstandard deviation of 1.57 Mpc. Approximately the same difference in the\ndistance scale is obtained in comparison with less accurate distance estimates\nthrough the membership of galaxies in known groups or from the Tully-Fisher\nrelation. We conclude that the NAM method provides distance estimates with an\naccuracy of 20% within the Local Volume, which is valid for ~90% of the sky,\nexcept for the regions of the Virgo cluster and the Coma-I group.\n",
