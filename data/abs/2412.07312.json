In particular, for\nstrong margin conditions, high-dimensional discontinuous classifiers can be\napproximated with a rate that is typically only achievable when approximating a\nlow-dimensional smooth function. We demonstrate how these expression rate\nbounds imply fast-rate learning bounds that are close to $n^{-1}$ where $n$ is\nthe number of samples. In addition, we carry out comprehensive numerical\nexperimentation on binary classification problems with various margins. We\nstudy three different dimensions, with the highest dimensional problem\ncorresponding to images from the MNIST data set.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QvidC1my7QjaQbupK2GzniI8PkPKlOO8JK_nPBGeZo0","pdfSize":"8297557"}
