  "abstract": "  Focused ultrasound (FUS) therapy is a promising tool for optimally targeted\ntreatment of spinal cord injuries (SCI), offering submillimeter precision to\nenhance blood flow at injury sites while minimizing impact on surrounding\ntissues. However, its efficacy is highly sensitive to the placement of the\nultrasound source, as the spinal cord's complex geometry and acoustic\nheterogeneity distort and attenuate the FUS signal. Current approaches rely on\ncomputer simulations to solve the governing wave propagation equations and\ncompute patient-specific pressure maps using ultrasound images of the spinal\ncord anatomy. While accurate, these high-fidelity simulations are\ncomputationally intensive, taking up to hours to complete parameter sweeps,\nwhich is impractical for real-time surgical decision-making. To address this\nbottleneck, we propose a convolutional deep operator network (DeepONet) to\nrapidly predict FUS pressure fields in patient spinal cords. Unlike\nconventional neural networks, DeepONets are well equipped to approximate the\nsolution operator of the parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) that\ngovern the behavior of FUS waves with varying initial and boundary conditions\n(i.e., new transducer locations or spinal cord geometries) without requiring\nextensive simulations. Trained on simulated pressure maps across diverse\npatient anatomies, this surrogate model achieves real-time predictions with\nonly a 2% loss on the test set, significantly accelerating the modeling of\nnonlinear physical systems in heterogeneous domains. By facilitating rapid\nparameter sweeps in surgical settings, this work provides a crucial step toward\nprecise and individualized solutions in neurosurgical treatments.\n",
