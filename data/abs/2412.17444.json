  "abstract": "  We introduce a definition of braided tensor product\n$\\operatorname{M}\\overline{\\boxtimes}\\operatorname{N}$ of von Neumann algebras\nequipped with an action of a quasi-triangular quantum group $\\mathbb{G}$ (this\nincludes the case when $\\mathbb{G}$ is a Drinfeld double). It is a new von\nNeumann algebra which comes together with embeddings of\n$\\operatorname{M},\\operatorname{N}$ and the unique action of $\\mathbb{G}$ for\nwhich embeddings are equivariant. More generally, we construct braided tensor\nproduct of von Neumann algebras equipped with actions of locally compact\nquantum groups linked by a bicharacter. We study several examples, in\nparticular we show that crossed products can be realised as braided tensor\nproducts. We also show that one can take the braided tensor product\n$\\vartheta_1\\boxtimes\\vartheta_2$ of normal, completely bounded maps which are\nequivariant, but this fails without the equivariance condition.\n",
