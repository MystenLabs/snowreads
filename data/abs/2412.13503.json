  "abstract": "  Document-level Relation Extraction (DocRE) aims to identify relationships\nbetween entity pairs within a document. However, most existing methods assume a\nuniform label distribution, resulting in suboptimal performance on real-world,\nimbalanced datasets. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel data\naugmentation approach using generative models to enhance data from the\nembedding space. Our method leverages the Variational Autoencoder (VAE)\narchitecture to capture all relation-wise distributions formed by entity pair\nrepresentations and augment data for underrepresented relations. To better\ncapture the multi-label nature of DocRE, we parameterize the VAE's latent space\nwith a Diffusion Model. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical training\nframework to integrate the proposed VAE-based augmentation module into DocRE\nsystems. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method\noutperforms state-of-the-art models, effectively addressing the long-tail\ndistribution problem in DocRE.\n",
