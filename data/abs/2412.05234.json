  "abstract": "  Risk measures, which typically evaluate the impact of extreme losses, are\nhighly sensitive to misspecification in the tails. This paper studies a robust\noptimization approach to combat tail uncertainty by proposing a unifying\nframework to construct uncertainty sets for a broad class of risk measures,\ngiven a specified nominal model. Our framework is based on a parametrization of\nrobust risk measures using two (or multiple) $\\phi$-divergence functions, which\nenables us to provide uncertainty sets that are tailored to both the\nsensitivity of each risk measure to tail losses and the tail behavior of the\nnominal distribution. In addition, our formulation allows for a tractable\ncomputation of robust risk measures, and elicitation of $\\phi$-divergences that\ndescribe a decision maker's risk and ambiguity preferences.\n",
