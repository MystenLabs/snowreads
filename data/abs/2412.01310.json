The luminosity is determined by the\nconvolution of particle densities of the colliding beams. In special van der\nMeer transverse beam separation scans, the convolution function is sampled\nalong the horizontal and vertical axes with the purpose of determining the beam\nconvolution and getting an absolute luminosity calibration. For this purpose,\nthe van der Meer data of luminometer rates are separately fitted in the two\ndirections with analytic functions giving the best description. With the\nassumption that the 2D convolution shape is factorizable, one can calculate it\nfrom the two 1D fits. The task of XY factorization analyses is to check this\nassumption and give a quantitative measure of the effect of nonfactorizability\non the calibration constant to improve the accuracy of luminosity measurements.\n\\newline We perform a dedicated analysis to study XY non-factorization on\nproton-proton data collected in 2022 at $\\sqrt{s} = 13.6$~TeV by the CMS\nexperiment. A detailed examination of the shape of the bunch convolution\nfunction is presented, studying various biases, and choosing the best-fit\nanalytic 2D functions to finally obtain the correction and its uncertainty.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CeBDUZDi3FkjAgs5grujEEH9ApvlvDgIhwjq3dk73JM","pdfSize":"1664520"}
