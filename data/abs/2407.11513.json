Rev. D {\\bf 59},\n084016 (1999)), within the context of modified gravity theories. We consider\nRicci-inverse gravity of all Classes of models, {\\it i.e.}, (i) Class-{\\bf I}:\n$f(\\mathcal{R}, \\mathcal{A})=(\\mathcal{R}+\\beta\\,\\mathcal{A})$, (ii) Class-{\\bf\nII}: $f(\\mathcal{R},\nA^{\\mu\\nu}\\,A_{\\mu\\nu})=(\\mathcal{R}+\\gamma\\,A^{\\mu\\nu}\\,A_{\\mu\\nu})$ model,\nand (iii) Class-{\\bf III}: $f(\\mathcal{R}, \\mathcal{A},\nA^{\\mu\\nu}\\,A_{\\mu\\nu})=(\\mathcal{R}+\\beta\\,\\mathcal{A}+\\delta\\,\\mathcal{A}^2+\\gamma\\,A^{\\mu\\nu}\\,A_{\\mu\\nu})$\nmodel, where $A^{\\mu\\nu}$ is the anti-curvature tensor, the reciprocal of the\nRicci tensor, $R_{\\mu\\nu}$, $\\mathcal{A}=g_{\\mu\\nu}\\,A^{\\mu\\nu}$ is its scalar,\nand $\\beta, \\gamma, \\delta$ are the coupling constants. In fact, we show that\nLi time-machine space-time serve as valid solution within this Ricci-inverse\ngravity theory. Thus, this new theory allows the formation of closed time-like\ncurves analogue to general relativity, representing a possible time machine\nmodel in Ricci-inverse modified gravity theoretically.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8OsFz2l-XCaU9nHTzetifmitoWk_Pvm3iEpcysCA96o","pdfSize":"174096"}
