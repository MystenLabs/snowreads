We present a formalized, iterative methodology proving that\nAI can fully replace human programmers in all aspects of code creation and\nrefinement. Our approach, combining large language models with formal\nverification, test-driven development, and incremental architectural guidance,\nachieves a 38.6% improvement over the current top performer's 48.33% accuracy\non the SWE-bench benchmark. This surpasses previously assumed limits, signaling\nthe end of human-exclusive coding and the rise of autonomous AI-driven software\ninnovation. More than a technical advance, our work challenges centuries-old\nassumptions about human creativity. We provide robust evidence of AI\nsuperiority, demonstrating tangible gains in practical engineering contexts and\nlaying the foundation for a future in which computational creativity outpaces\nhuman ingenuity.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Software Engineering","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KJ3erppOjKbPasReBN1j6FRvIfYlvJq9tC98P1A0-ok","pdfSize":"1151042"}
