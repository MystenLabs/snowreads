A critical bottleneck when solving such problems for\nfinely-resolved images is the solution of huge-scale, dense linear systems\narising from the minimization of an energy term. We tackle this using a Krylov\nsubspace approach, with a Nonequispaced Fast Fourier Transform utilized to\napproximate matrix-vector products in a matrix-free manner. We accelerate the\nalgorithm using a novel change of basis approach to account for the (known)\nsmallest eigenvalue-eigenvector pair of the matrices involved, coupled with a\nsimple but frequently very effective diagonal preconditioning approach. We\npresent a number of theoretical results concerning the eigenvalues and\npredicted convergence behavior, and a range of numerical experiments which\nvalidate our solvers and use them to tackle parameter learning problems. These\ndemonstrate that very large problems may be effectively and rapidly denoised\nwith very low storage requirements on a computer.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NQmTATYdC_ykTmEapD2-9lewgckIMgpyHT0bYBI-pzE","pdfSize":"15226606"}
