While recent mainstream efforts in the LLM community mainly\nfocus on scaling data and compute for improved capabilities of LLMs, we argue\nthat it is also very important to enable LLM systems, or language agents, to\ncontinuously adapt to the diverse and ever-changing profiles of every distinct\nuser and provide up-to-date personalized assistance. We provide a clear task\nformulation and introduce a simple, general, effective, and scalable framework\nfor life-long personalization of LLM systems and language agents. To facilitate\nfuture research on LLM personalization, we also introduce methods to synthesize\nrealistic benchmarks and robust evaluation metrics. We will release all codes\nand data for building and benchmarking life-long personalized LLM systems.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tpj_TNCOiQ78VnuQ6IiYAV8VogSUQC5wtvSSvrLjVhg","pdfSize":"2312046"}
