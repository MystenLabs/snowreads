In this work, we predict that in such\nmagnetic topological systems, the interaction between electrons and magnons\nsubstantially destabilizes the Weyl nodes, leading to a topological phase\ntransition below the Curie temperature. Remarkably, the sensitivity of the Weyl\nnodes to electron-magnon interaction depends on their spin chirality. We find\nthat Weyl nodes with a trivial chirality are more sensitive to electron-magnon\ninteractions than Weyl nodes presenting an inverted chirality, demonstrating\nthe resilience of the latter compared to the former. Our results open\nperspectives for the interpretation of the transport signatures of Weyl\nsemimetals, especially close to the Curie temperature.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KJ6kOo7a_YbGZlnVrXKpBmD0z_r__CsbRDMSy3-2NY8","pdfSize":"1901667"}
