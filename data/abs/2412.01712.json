  "abstract": "  We present a bisequent calculus (BSC) for the minimal theory of definite\ndescriptions (DD) in the setting of neutral free logic, where formulae with\nnon-denoting terms have no truth value. The treatment of quantifiers, atomic\nformulae and simple terms is based on the approach developed by Pavlovi\\'{c}\nand Gratzl. We extend their results to the version with identity and definite\ndescriptions. In particular, the admissibility of cut is proven for this\nextended system.\n",
