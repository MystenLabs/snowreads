In this\nformalism, $f(Q, C)$ gravity has been recently introduced by incorporating the\nboundary term $C$ with the non-metricity scalar $Q$. In this paper, we develop\nthe theory of cosmological scalar perturbation for $f(Q, C)$ gravity, and\nretrieve that of $f(\\mathring{R})$ and $f(Q)$ gravity from our result. The\nanalysis assumes a model-independent approach within these theories that\nadheres to the conventional continuity equation at the background level. We\nderive the density contrast equation by employing some standard cosmological\napproximations, where the $f(Q, C)$ theory is encoded in the effective\nNewtonian constant $G_{eff}$. Finally, we derive the evolution equation of\ndensity growth $f_g$.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1usmVLK5kPw0MWTtX-euORTxP78fGI50hEyPU9BT7sk","pdfSize":"241662"}
