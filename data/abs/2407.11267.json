Moreover,\nmost existing approaches primarily focus on one-step forecasting, and the\nperformance often varies depending on the dataset and specific case study. In\nthis paper, we introduce an ensemble model to capture Brent oil price\nvolatility and enhance the multi-step prediction. Our methodology employs a\ntwo-pronged approach. First, we assess popular deep-learning models and the\nimpact of various external factors on forecasting accuracy. Then, we introduce\nan ensemble multi-step forecasting model for Brent oil prices. Our approach\ngenerates accurate forecasts by employing ensemble techniques across multiple\nforecasting scenarios using three BI-GRU networks.Extensive experiments were\nconducted on a dataset encompassing the COVID-19 pandemic period, which had a\nsignificant impact on energy markets. The proposed model's performance was\nevaluated using the standard evaluation metrics of MAE, MSE, and RMSE. The\nresults demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms benchmark and\nestablished models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"W1FE9rarmMRgTpfssTbBQbdnFqhfidgZDC8gyqmTvQM","pdfSize":"803441"}
