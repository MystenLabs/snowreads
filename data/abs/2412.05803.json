In this vein, the TLSM\nindicator and it spectral counterpart known as the multifrequency LSM are\nformulated within the context of LU testing. The affiliated imaging functionals\nare then computed using synthetic and experimental data germane to LU\ninspection of aluminum alloy specimens with manufactured defects.\nHyperparameters of inversion are computationally analyzed. We demonstrate using\nsynthetic data that the TLSM indicator has the unique ability to recover weak\n(or hard-to-reach) scatterers and has the potential to generate higher quality\nimages compared to LSM. Provided high-SNR measurements, this advantage may be\npreserved in reconstructions from LU test data.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"uWCU82JDZTglIBq9GeAIJ_qYdR8VJ6JUBe8bSlHhepw","pdfSize":"10906780"}
