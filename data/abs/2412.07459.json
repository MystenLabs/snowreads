Our study focuses on Poland, a country\nwith different cultural individualism at work, which can impact work-from-home\npreferences and, indirectly, home relocation desires. Given the methodological\nlimitations of official data on remote work practices in Poland, we conducted\nan original survey, gathering primary data from a nationally representative\nsample of office workers living in cities with populations exceeding 100,000.\nTo investigate the factors shaping employees' preferences for suburban\nrelocation driven by remote work, we utilized logistic regression to analyze\nthe effects of socio-economic and employment characteristics, commuting\nexperiences, and reported changes in work productivity. Our findings reveal\nthat age, mode of commuting, perceived changes in work productivity, and sector\nownership are significant determinants, strongly affecting home relocation\npreferences in response to work-from-home opportunities. These results align\nwith previous research, typically based on data from countries with different\ncultural frameworks and more developed work-from-home practices.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lEwV-sI7T8gPExh1KE8vka_Vsqqxeo58H6L-6FkdQ1o","pdfSize":"1133648"}
