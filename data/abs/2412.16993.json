  "abstract": "  In this paper we present new results about arrangements of lines and conics\nassociated to the Fermat curves in the projective plane. The first result is\nthat we compute the 2-Hessian to a Fermat curve, which is a union of lines, and\nwe determine the singularities of this line arrangement. Then we consider the\nsextactic points on the Fermat curves and show that they are distributed on\nthree grids. The lines in the grids constitute new line arrangements associated\nwith the Fermat curves, and we determine the singularities on each of them. The\nmain result is that we compute the hyperosculating conics to the Fermat curves,\nstudy the arrangement of these conics, and find that they intersect in a\nspecial way.\n",
