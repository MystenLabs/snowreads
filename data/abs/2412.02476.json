  "abstract": "  In this paper, we research more in depth properties of Backtracking New\nQ-Newton's method (recently designed by the third author), when used to find\nroots of meromorphic functions.\n  If $f=P/Q$, where $P$ and $Q$ are polynomials in 1 complex variable z with\n$\\deg (P)>\\deg (Q)$, we show the existence of an exceptional set\n$\\mathcal{E}\\subset\\mathbf{C}$, which is contained in a countable union of real\nanalytic curves in $\\mathbf{R}^2=\\mathbf{C}$, so that the following statements\nA and B hold. Here, $\\{z_n\\}$ is the sequence constructed by BNQN with an\ninitial point $z_0$ which is not a pole of $f$.\n  A) If $z_0\\in\\mathbf{C}\\backslash\\mathcal{E}$, then $\\{z_n\\}$ converges to a\nroot of $f$.\n  B) If $z_0\\in \\mathcal{E}$, then $\\{z_n\\}$ converges to a critical point -\nbut not a root - of $f$.\n  Experiments seem to indicate that in general, even when $f$ is a polynomial,\nthe set $\\mathcal{E}$ is not contained in a finite union of real analytic\ncurves. We provide further results relevant to whether locally $\\mathcal{E}$ is\ncontained in a finite number of real analytic curves. A similar result holds\nfor general meromorphic functions. Moreover, unlike previous work, here we do\nnot require that the parameters of BNQN are random, or that the meromorphic\nfunction $f$ is generic.\n  Based on the theoretical results, we explain (both rigorously and\nheuristically) of what observed in experiments with BNQN, in previous works by\nthe authors. In particular, the dynamics of BNQN (an iterative method) seems to\nhave some striking similarities to Newton's method (a continuous method) and\nthe classical Poincar\\'e-Bendixon theorem for differentiable real dynamical\nsystems on the complex plane. This is the more interesting given that discrete\nversions of Newton's method (e.g. Relaxed Newton's method) does not behave this\nway.\n",
