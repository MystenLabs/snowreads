  "abstract": "  Geospatial models must adapt to the diversity of Earth observation data in\nterms of resolutions, scales, and modalities. However, existing approaches\nexpect fixed input configurations, which limits their practical applicability.\nWe propose AnySat, a multimodal model based on joint embedding predictive\narchitecture (JEPA) and resolution-adaptive spatial encoders, allowing us to\ntrain a single model on highly heterogeneous data in a self-supervised manner.\nTo demonstrate the advantages of this unified approach, we compile GeoPlex, a\ncollection of $5$ multimodal datasets with varying characteristics and $11$\ndistinct sensors. We then train a single powerful model on these diverse\ndatasets simultaneously. Once fine-tuned, we achieve better or near\nstate-of-the-art results on the datasets of GeoPlex and $4$ additional ones for\n$5$ environment monitoring tasks: land cover mapping, tree species\nidentification, crop type classification, change detection, and flood\nsegmentation. The code and models are available at\nhttps://github.com/gastruc/AnySat.\n",
