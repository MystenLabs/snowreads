We present a general framework to determine the minimal\nthermodynamic cost and the optimal protocol for arbitrary resetting speeds. Our\nstudy reveals the divergent behavior of minimal entropy production in the\nshort-time limit depends on the convergence and divergence of the jump\noperators. For the convergent class, an inherent trade-off exists between the\nminimal required time and the set error probability, which hinders the Moore's\nlaw continuing in such cases. Moreover, we find the optimal protocol exhibits\nthe similarity in the fast-driving regime for different times. To demonstrate\nour findings, we empoly fermionic and bosonic baths as examples. Our results\nsuggest that the super-Ohmic bosonic heat bath is a suitable choice for qubit\nreset.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"s8RxiRVhwzGTr2wA0ZM58GIKLrd2qNFuP86EGzjc8dE","pdfSize":"1116929"}
