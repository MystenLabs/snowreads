  "abstract": "  It is conjectured by Chen and Raspaud that for each integer $k \\ge 2$, any\ngraph $G$ with \\[ \\mathrm{mad}(G) < \\frac{2k+1}{k} \\quad\\text{and}\\quad\n\\mathrm{odd\\text{-}girth}(G) \\ge 2k+1 \\] admits a homomorphism into the Kneser\ngraph $K(2k+1,k)$. The base cases $k=2$ and $k=3$ are known from earlier work.\nA modular inductive proof is provided here, in which graphs at level $k+1$ are\nclassified into four structural classes and are shown to admit no minimal\ncounterexamples by means of forbidden configuration elimination, a discharging\nargument, path-collapsing techniques, and a combinatorial embedding of smaller\nKneser graphs into larger ones. This argument completes the induction for all\n$k \\ge 2$, thus settling the Chen-Raspaud conjecture in full generality.\n",
