  "abstract": "  We consider a microstructure foundation for rough volatility models driven by\nPoisson random measures. In our model the volatility is driven by self-exciting\narrivals of market orders as well as self-exciting arrivals of limit orders and\ncancellations. The impact of market order on future order arrivals is captured\nby a Hawkes kernel with power law decay, and is hence persistent. The impact of\nlimit orders on future order arrivals is temporary, yet possibly long-lived.\nAfter suitable scaling the volatility process converges to a fractional Heston\nmodel driven by an additional Poisson random measure. The random measure\ngenerates occasional spikes and clusters of spikes in the volatility process.\nOur results are based on novel existence and uniqueness of solutions results\nfor stochastic path-dependent Volterra equations driven by Poisson random\nmeasures.\n",
