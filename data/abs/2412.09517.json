  "abstract": "  Traditional methods employed in matrix volatility forecasting often overlook\nthe inherent Riemannian manifold structure of symmetric positive definite\nmatrices, treating them as elements of Euclidean space, which can lead to\nsuboptimal predictive performance. Moreover, they often struggle to handle\nhigh-dimensional matrices. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for\nforecasting realized covariance matrices of asset returns using a\nRiemannian-geometry-aware deep learning framework. In this way, we account for\nthe geometric properties of the covariance matrices, including possible\nnon-linear dynamics and efficient handling of high-dimensionality. Moreover,\nbuilding upon a Fr\\'echet sample mean of realized covariance matrices, we are\nable to extend the HAR model to the matrix-variate. We demonstrate the efficacy\nof our approach using daily realized covariance matrices for the 50 most\ncapitalized companies in the S&P 500 index, showing that our method outperforms\ntraditional approaches in terms of predictive accuracy.\n",
