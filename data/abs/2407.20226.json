Though MST is a workhorse in applications, the\nmathematical properties of random MST are far less explored than those of UST.\nIn this paper we develop tools for the quantitative study of random MST. We\nconsider the standard case that the weights are drawn i.i.d. from a single\ndistribution on the real numbers, as well as successive generalizations that\nlead to \\emph{product measures}, where the weights are independently drawn from\narbitrary distributions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"V1wyFhsixfFybktok5FKqEE6QR0mnoGBTTndfOmbrWo","pdfSize":"2837204"}
