However, like other types of medical data,\nECGs are subject to privacy concerns when distributed and analyzed. Diffusion\nmodels have made significant progress in recent years, creating the possibility\nfor synthesizing data comparable to the real one and allowing their widespread\nadoption without privacy concerns. In this paper, we use diffusion models with\nstructured state spaces for generating digital 10-second 12-lead ECG signals.\nWe propose the SSSD-ECG-nle architecture based on SSSD-ECG with a modified\nconditioning mechanism and demonstrate its efficiency on downstream tasks. We\nconduct quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including analyzing\nconvergence speed, the impact of adding positive samples, and assessment with\nphysicians' expert knowledge. Finally, we share the results of physician\nevaluations and also make synthetic data available to ensure the\nreproducibility of the experiments described.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"DiyoGkTed1wdeZxQo6ieV0vMQqTLQ6EyEuvdQp1dA8M","pdfSize":"609592"}
