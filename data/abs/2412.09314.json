The combined image\nover the S1 (1.96 - 2.84 GHz) and S4 (2.62 - 3.50 GHz) sub-bands has an angular\nresolution of 6.8''$\\times$3.6'' (4.0''$\\times$2.4'') at a robust weighting of\n$R = 0.3$ ($R=-0.5$) and a sensitivity of 4.7 (7.5) $\\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ with an\non-source integration time of 70 minutes and a minimum of 52 of the 64\nantennas, for respective observations. We present the differential source\ncounts for this field, as well as a morphological comparison of resolved\nsources between S-band and archival MeerKAT L-band images. We find consistent\nsource counts with the literature and provide spectral indices fitted over a\ncombined frequency range of 1.8 GHz. These observations provide an important\nfirst demonstration of the capabilities of MeerKAT S-band imaging with\nrelatively short integration times, as well as a comparison with existing\nS-band surveys, highlighting the rich scientific potential with future MeerKAT\nS-band surveys.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0Cy0fZRz-lQrKe8I5CmvNzxkApRRim7dXlsbAo1SeQw","pdfSize":"4857370"}
