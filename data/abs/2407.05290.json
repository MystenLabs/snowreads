We report on a lack of\nsystematic approach to the security of IoT context-sharing platforms and\npropose the need for a methodological and systematic alternative to evaluate\nthe existing solutions and develop `secure-by-design' solutions. We have\nidentified the key components of a generic IoT context-sharing platform and\npropose using MITRE ATT&CK for threat modelling of such platforms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Th8EAaxf8R9kVyOwXDIoHU2v1tFQEWjsljqGT6HZRy8","pdfSize":"88836"}
