  "abstract": "  In this article, we study a model-free design approach for stochastic linear\nquadratic (SLQ) controllers. Based on the convexity of the SLQ dual problem and\nthe Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, we find the relationship between the\noptimal point of the dual problem and the Q-function, which can be used to\ndevelop a novel model-free semidefinite programming (SDP) algorithm for\nderiving optimal control gain. This study provides a new optimization\nperspective for understanding Q-learning algorithms and lays a theoretical\nfoundation for effective reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Finally, the\neffectiveness of the proposed model-free SDP algorithm is demonstrated by two\ncase simulations.\n",
