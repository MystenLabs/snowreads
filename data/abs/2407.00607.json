We propose to design parallel flagged syndrome extraction with\nshared flag qubits for quantum stabilizer codes. Versatile parallelization\ntechniques are employed to minimize the required circuit area, thereby\nimproving the error threshold and overall performance. Specifically, all the\nmeasurement outcomes in multiple rounds of syndrome extraction are integrated\ninto a lookup table decoder, allowing us to parallelize multiple stabilizer\nmeasurements with shared flag qubits. We present flag-sharing and fully\nparallel schemes for the [[17,1,5]] and [[19,1,5]] Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS)\ncodes. This methodology extends to the [[5,1,3]] non-CSS code, achieving the\nminimum known circuit area. Numerical simulations have demonstrated improved\npseudothresholds for these codes by up to an order of magnitude compared to\nprevious schemes in the literature.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4-7qrBQz1yssuFYwhnbeNZQe7R4_oCz1zqyUVe4D7Ko","pdfSize":"3082745"}
