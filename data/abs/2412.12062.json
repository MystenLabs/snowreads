  "abstract": "  Engaging messages delivered by teachers are a key aspect of the classroom\ndiscourse that influences student outcomes. However, improving this\ncommunication is challenging due to difficulties in obtaining observations.\nThis study presents a methodology for efficiently extracting actual\nobservations of engaging messages from audio-recorded lessons. We collected\n2,477 audio-recorded lessons from 75 teachers over two academic years. Using\nautomatic transcription and keyword-based filtering analysis, we identified and\nclassified engaging messages. This method reduced the information to be\nanalysed by 90%, optimising the time and resources required compared to\ntraditional manual coding. Subsequent descriptive analysis revealed that the\nmost used messages emphasised the future benefits of participating in school\nactivities. In addition, the use of engaging messages decreased as the academic\nyear progressed. This study offers insights for researchers seeking to extract\ninformation from teachers' discourse in naturalistic settings and provides\nuseful information for designing interventions to improve teachers'\ncommunication strategies.\n",
