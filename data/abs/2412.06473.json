  "abstract": "  A discrepancy of approximately 5$\\sigma$ exists between the two known results\nfor the tenth-order QED contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the\nelectron, calculated from Feynman vertex diagrams without fermion loops. To\ninvestigate this, we decomposed this contribution into 389 parts based on a\nself-energy diagram representation, enabling a diagram-by-diagram numerical\ncomparison of the two calculations. No significant discrepancies were found for\nindividual diagrams. However, the numerical differences of the 98 diagrams\nsharing a common structure were not randomly distributed. The accumulation of\nthese differences resulted in the 5$\\sigma$ discrepancy. A recalculation with\nincreased statistics in the Monte Carlo integration was performed for these 98\ndiagrams, resolving the discrepancy.\n",
