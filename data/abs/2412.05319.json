This practice shares a similar\nneural substrate and correlated temporal scale with motor execution. Besides\nthat, it can lead to performance improvements in the actual execution of the\nimagined task. Therefore it is important to understand functional differences\nand equivalences between motor imagery and motor execution. To tackle that we\nemployed a finger-tapping serial reaction time task in two groups of\nparticipants, a Motor Execution (n=10) and a Motor imagery (n=10). The sequence\nof stimuli defining the task had 750 items composed of three distinct auditory\nstimuli. Also, this sequence had some intrinsic variability making some of the\nnext items unpredictable. Each auditory stimulus was mapped to a single right\nhand finger in the Motor Imagery group. The Motor imagery group indicated the\nend of the imagination with a single response using the left hand. The results\nshow improvement in performance of the Motor Imagery group throughout the task\nand that the duration of the motor imagery, indirectly measured by reaction\ntimes, are influenced by distinct factors than those of Motor Execution.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"oI-d9irAbVrUxFteTWwnVt9jVhQiiXEv4yv_6vah3Us","pdfSize":"602561"}
