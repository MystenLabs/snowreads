The monthly attention the news pays\nto 180 topics (Bybee et al., 2024) captures up to 80% of the variation in the\nEBP, and this component of variation forecasts macroeconomic movements. Greater\nnews attention to financial intermediaries and crises tends to drive up the EBP\nand portend macroeconomic downturns, while greater news attention to politics\nand science tends to drive down the EBP. Attention-based estimates of EBP\nlargely drive out the forecast power of direct sentiment measures for\nmacroeconomic fluctuations and predict the business cycle going back to the\nearly 1900's. Overall, we attribute predictive variation about the EBP for\nmacroeconomic movements to variation in news attention to financial\nintermediaries, crises, and politics.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/General Finance","Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"ak7WfQUpM-pCS9llidLe4U5JZiDrzovw-XQBp_xyFOs","pdfSize":"2162472"}
