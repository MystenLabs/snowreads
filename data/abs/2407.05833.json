This display comprises a\ntransparent display that repeatedly turns on and off and a camera installed\nbehind the display so that the user's gaze and the optical path of the camera\nare closely aligned. This display is designed to show the user's face, and eye\ncontact occurs when the user looks at the face on the display. Therefore, by\nusing this display for all participants in a conversation, users can\ncommunicate with each other via the face on the display via facial and gaze\ncues. This interaction provides an experience as if the remote user's face were\npresent in the local environment. See-Through Face Display proposes the\nimportance of mutual gaze communication in telepresence.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"22wwbdDB5mMoOzXUTyl3MHPudU4JZEBz830YjM_nGXI","pdfSize":"1483022"}
