We show that some systems where an\ninteraction temperature is reported are too dilute for dipolar interactions to\nplay a role unless at least some of the particles are clumped together. We then\nshow using the most simple type of clumps (particle pairs) that positive and\nnegative interaction temperatures are possible due to dipolar interactions. The\nclump orientation dramatically changes this result. Finally, we show that an\napparent interaction temperature can be measured in magnetic nanoparticle\nsystems that have no interactions between particles, due to some alignment of\nanisotropy easy axes. These results show that nanoscale physical structures\naffect the measured magnetic response of nanoparticles.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uMAmYSbmGpRGdwIEoSpSddwoX44CHgAkh1GOLpr5_BI","pdfSize":"1135185"}
