As a\nspecific example of the quantum corrections, the Grisaru-Zanon quartic\ncurvature terms in the gravitational effective action of closed superstrings\nare chosen. Those quartic curvature terms are compared to the Bel-Robinson\ntensor squared in a flat Friedman universe, and the upper bound on the\neffective string coupling constant is found by demanding unitarity (causality)\nand the absence of ghosts. It is found that the quantum corrections to the\nobservables (tilts) of the cosmic microwave background radiation in the\nStarobinsky inflation may be of the same order of magnitude as the\nnext-to-next-to-next classical contributions in the Starobinsky model with\nrespect to the inverse powers of the e-folding number at the horizon crossing.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kEFs-bUk57JWTJtqnSbaGthxORH7y1zTeJGExVfqfDc","pdfSize":"332227"}
