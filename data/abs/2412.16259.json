  "abstract": "  Let ${\\mathtt{k}}$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero\nand $n, m$ coprime positive integers. Let ${\\stackrel{{\\rm\no}}{{\\mathfrak{g}}}}$ be the Lie superalgebra ${\\mathfrak{gl}}(n|m)$ with root\nsystem $\\Delta$. Using $\\Delta$, Sergeev and Veselov, \\cite{SV2} introduced an\naction of the Weyl groupoid ${\\mathcal{W}}$, in connection with their study of\nthe the Grothendieck group of finite dimensinonal graded\n$\\mathfrak{g}$-modules. We denote the subgroupoid of ${\\mathcal{W}}$ with\nmorphisms corresponding to isotropic roots by $\\mathfrak T_{iso}$.\n  Later, \\cite{SV101} the same authors defined an action of ${\\mathcal{W}}$ on\n$X={\\mathtt{k}}^{n|m}$ such that the invariant algebra\n${\\mathcal{O}}(X)^{\\mathcal{W}}$ is isomorphic to the algebra of quantum\nintegrals for the deformed Calogero-Moser system introduced in \\cite{SV1}. This\ncompletely integrable system depends on a non-zero parameter $\\kappa$. When\n$\\kappa=-m/n$ we study a certain infinite $\\mathfrak T_{iso}$-orbit {\\bf O} for\nthis action. %which appears in \\cite{SV101} Equation (14). The Cayley graph for\nthis orbit is isomorphic to the Cayley graphs for two other actions of\n$\\mathfrak T_{iso}$ which were studied in \\cite{M23}.\n",
