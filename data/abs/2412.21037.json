  "abstract": "  We introduce TangoFlux, an efficient Text-to-Audio (TTA) generative model\nwith 515M parameters, capable of generating up to 30 seconds of 44.1kHz audio\nin just 3.7 seconds on a single A40 GPU. A key challenge in aligning TTA models\nlies in the difficulty of creating preference pairs, as TTA lacks structured\nmechanisms like verifiable rewards or gold-standard answers available for Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs). To address this, we propose CLAP-Ranked Preference\nOptimization (CRPO), a novel framework that iteratively generates and optimizes\npreference data to enhance TTA alignment. We demonstrate that the audio\npreference dataset generated using CRPO outperforms existing alternatives. With\nthis framework, TangoFlux achieves state-of-the-art performance across both\nobjective and subjective benchmarks. We open source all code and models to\nsupport further research in TTA generation.\n",
