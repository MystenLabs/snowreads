The background\nequations governing the evolution of viscous interacting fluids in a multifluid\nsystem are derived. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation is applied\nto constrain the best-fit cosmological parameters with Supernova Type 1a data.\nIn addition, linear cosmological perturbations are investigated in a\ndust-matter-dominated frame using a $1+3$ covariant formalism approach. It is\nevident from the perturbation results obtained that the model predicts the\ndisintegration of bound structures of large-scale structures in the late-time\nuniverse.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sfRIf7CM3LtClhhr1ZP3n-DtzpIbMEZsZTBeQTgEdhw","pdfSize":"1728178"}
