In this work a preliminary characterization is\nmade in terms of the resistance of the channel for a commercial device that has\nGFETs of 1 and 3 channels for cases of dry and wet gate at atmospheric\npressure. The channel resistance was obtained by sweeping the drain-source\nvoltage from -1 to +1V and measuring the drain current in a test station\ndeveloped for this purpose, for gate cases with and without a PBS 0.001X\nreference solution. The ohmic response of the channel is linear current with\nrespect to voltage, being greater resistance in the case of wet gate. An\nincrease in resistance with respect to voltage was observed that it is\nimportant to review. It was possible to make the ohmic characterization of the\nchannel and a series of recommendations are suggested to continue this\nresearch.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"LGCR4HRP0KC49xSKhyV1y7dG1ein9Ykl-SjG0msSiR4","pdfSize":"778113"}
