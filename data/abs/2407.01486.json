A PV survey\nprobing a large fraction of the sky is subject to so-called wide-angle effects,\narising from the variation of the line-of-sight across the sky, and other\nsub-leading projection effects due to the propagation of the photons in a\nperturbed cosmological background. In this work, for the first time, we provide\na complete description, within linear theory and General Relativity, of the\npower spectrum of luminosity distance fluctuations, clarifying its relation to\nthe observables in a PV survey. We find that wide-angle effects will be\ndetected at high significance by future observations and will have to be\nincluded in the cosmological analysis. Other relativistic projections effects\ncould also be detected provided accurate, per object, distances are available.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"38NLyBcZg1Hl3a3TZliwqCvLme4AGy5F8GpyQ4cIXFg","pdfSize":"1235392"}
