  "abstract": "  The aim of our paper is to study the multi-quanta Abrikosov vortices injected\ninto a superconductor layer by the twisted light impulses. We predict that the\ncondensate circulating around the core of a multi-quanta vortex may differ in\nnature from that of the bulk superconductor. Special attention is paid to\npossibility of appearance of the quasi angular momentum of Cooper pairs and its\ncompensation via their recombination to the fermion quartets. We show potential\napplications of the multi-quanta vortices as massive memories as well as spin,\nangular momentum and energy batteries. Finally, we predict the emergence of\nhalf-quantum multi-quanta Josephson vortices under certain conditions.\n",
