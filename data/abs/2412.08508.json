Comparative Quintuple Extraction (COQE) aims\nto identify five key components in text: the target entity, compared entities,\ncompared aspects, opinions on these aspects, and polarity. Extracting precise\ncomparative information from product reviews is challenging due to nuanced\nlanguage and sequential task errors in traditional methods. To mitigate these\nproblems, we propose MTP-COQE, an end-to-end model designed for COQE.\nLeveraging multi-perspective prompt-based learning, MTP-COQE effectively guides\nthe generative model in comparative opinion mining tasks. Evaluation on the\nCamera-COQE (English) and VCOM (Vietnamese) datasets demonstrates MTP-COQE's\nefficacy in automating COQE, achieving superior performance with a 1.41% higher\nF1 score than the previous baseline models on the English dataset.\nAdditionally, we designed a strategy to limit the generative model's creativity\nto ensure the output meets expectations. We also performed data augmentation to\naddress data imbalance and to prevent the model from becoming biased towards\ndominant samples.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xz-FpYxMxoNCDxTw-xvRMeAZwEMPq_wtrgty2jWBcHU","pdfSize":"1390430"}
