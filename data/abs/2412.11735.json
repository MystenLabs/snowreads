Current unrestricted\nadversarial impersonation attacks exhibit limited control over adversarial face\nattributes and often suffer from low transferability. In this paper, we propose\na novel Text Controlled Attribute Attack (TCA$^2$) to generate photorealistic\nadversarial impersonation faces guided by natural language. Specifically, the\ncategory-level personal softmax vector is employed to precisely guide the\nimpersonation attacks. Additionally, we propose both data and model\naugmentation strategies to achieve transferable attacks on unknown target\nmodels. Finally, a generative model, \\textit{i.e}, Style-GAN, is utilized to\nsynthesize impersonated faces with desired attributes. Extensive experiments on\ntwo high-resolution face recognition datasets validate that our TCA$^2$ method\ncan generate natural text-guided adversarial impersonation faces with high\ntransferability. We also evaluate our method on real-world face recognition\nsystems, \\textit{i.e}, Face++ and Aliyun, further demonstrating the practical\npotential of our approach.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"iRsYn-CpbLrDgKYxsHkT67W-89BiM5BZiVc2eySUNmE","pdfSize":"26367814"}
