This problem statement translates to an object detection\ntask. Therefore, this paper compares recent You Only Look Once (YOLO) models in\nthe context of helmet detection in terms of reliability and computational load.\nSpecifically, YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and the newly released YOLOv11 have been used.\nBesides, a modified architectural pipeline that remarkably improves the overall\nperformance has been proposed in this manuscript. This hybridized YOLO model\n(h-YOLO) has been pitted against the independent models for analysis that\nproves h-YOLO is preferable for helmet detection over plain YOLO models. The\nmodels were tested using a range of standard object detection benchmarks such\nas recall, precision, and mAP (Mean Average Precision). In addition, training\nand testing times were recorded to provide the overall scope of the models in a\nreal-time detection scenario.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lkvOjtJb3uJGToDiplmk0A1X5o3qN78y40BroaR6mVE","pdfSize":"636184"}
