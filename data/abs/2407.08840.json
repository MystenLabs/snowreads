This work leverages the Lagrangian nature of\nthe model equations to derive structure-preserving linear reduced-order models\nvia Lagrangian Operator Inference and compares their performance with prominent\nlinear model reduction techniques through an anguilliform swimming soft robot\nmodel example with 231,336 degrees of freedom. The case studies demonstrate\nthat preserving the underlying Lagrangian structure leads to learned models\nwith higher predictive accuracy and robustness to unseen inputs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HjT9nk835CAl441AXe2cBsUWsS-TAXHUIQYj-7pTFaQ","pdfSize":"823026"}
