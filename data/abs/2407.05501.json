GE admits both massless and massive modes for the photon. We recover\nthe ordinary quantum phase shift of the AB effect, derived in the context of\nMaxwell electrodynamics, for the massless mode of the photon in GE. The massive\nmode induces a correction factor to the AB phase shift depending on the photon\nmass. We study both the magnetic AB effect and its electric counterpart. In\nprinciple, accurate experimental observations of AB the phase shift could be\nused to constrain GE photon mass.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"NpZDDeSDcSVs-YQcBIAkD5gNxoUfKYIbguZDklOjVVA","pdfSize":"1551962"}
