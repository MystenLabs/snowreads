  "abstract": "  Deep Learning methods are highly local and sensitive to the domain of data\nthey are trained with. Even a slight deviation from the domain distribution\naffects prediction accuracy of deep networks significantly. In this work, we\nhave investigated a set of techniques aimed at increasing accuracy of generator\nnetworks which perform translation from one domain to the other in an\nadversarial setting. In particular, we experimented with activations, the\nencoder-decoder network architectures, and introduced a Loss called cyclic loss\nto constrain the Generator network so that it learns effective source-target\ntranslation. This machine learning problem is motivated by myriad applications\nthat can be derived from domain adaptation networks like generating labeled\ndata from synthetic inputs in an unsupervised fashion, and using these\ntranslation network in conjunction with the original domain network to\ngeneralize deep learning networks across domains.\n",
