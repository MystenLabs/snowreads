  "abstract": "  Motivated by the time-reversal symmetry breaking signal in muon spin\nrelaxation below a transition temperature without accompanying noticeable\nmagnetic Bragg peaks in $5d^2$ Os double perovskites, a rare ferro-octupolar\norder was proposed to account for such hidden order. Here we study the phase\ntransitions under a magnetic field in triangular and face-centered cubic\nlattices using classical Monte Carlo simulations. It is expected that\nhigher-rank moments do not couple linearly to the magnetic field. Consequently,\na field applied along the ferro-octupolar order is not anticipated to influence\nthe ordering. However, we observe the emergence of antiferro-quadrupolar\nordering mixed with the antiferro-octupolar order (AFQO) due to the\nfield-induced bond-dependent exchange interaction. This field-linear\ninteraction among non-Kramer doublets arises via the coupling to the excited\ntriplet states enabled by the external field. In the triangular lattice, we\nuncover intriguing vortex states, which could inspire future research into\n$5d^2$ triangular lattice systems.\n",
