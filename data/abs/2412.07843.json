  "abstract": "  We construct and solve a complete system of differential equations for\ngeneral tree-level inflation correlators with an arbitrary number of massive\nscalar exchanges and time-dependent couplings. Any massive tree correlators can\nbe uniquely fixed by solving this system of equations with appropriate boundary\nconditions. We take a hybrid approach to solve this system, using the\ndifferential equation to get the inhomogeneous solution and the bulk time\nintegrals to determine the homogeneous solution. Altogether, we obtain\nanalytical results for all tree-level massive inflation correlators with\ngeneric kinematics, expressed as multivariate hypergeometric series of energy\nratios. The result can be neatly organized as a sum of the completely\ninhomogeneous solution, which we call the massive family tree, and all of its\ncuts. As simple applications, we provide full analytical expressions for tree\ncorrelators with one, two, and three massive exchanges.\n",
