Its\nnon-$D\\bar{D}$ decay channels have attracted considerable interest. In this\nstudy, we investigate these allowed non-$D\\bar{D}$ decays of $\\psi_3(3842)$\ninto $PP$, $PV$, and $VV$ final states using the hadronic loop mechanism, where\n$P$ and $V$ represent light pseudoscalar and vector mesons, respectively. Our\nresults suggest that these non-$D\\bar{D}$ decays of $\\psi_3(3842)$ can be\nsignificant, with contributions primarily driven by hadronic loops. Notably,\nthe $\\rho\\pi$ channel stands out as the main non-$D\\bar{D}$ decay mode, while\nnon-$D\\bar{D}$ decay channels involving strange mesons are also sizable. These\npredictions could be tested in future experiments such as those at LHCb and\nBESIII.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"besQI7ndzRuZ5BpcauH5KuLkkN6BoJ2FedBWP9PzVgU","pdfSize":"466625"}
