While unsupervised\ntechniques leveraging Information Retrieval (IR) and Machine Learning (ML)\nmethods have been widely used for predicting trace links, their effectiveness\nremains underexplored. In particular, these techniques often assume\ntraceability patterns are present within textual data - a premise that may not\nhold universally. Moreover, standard evaluation metrics such as precision,\nrecall, accuracy, or F1 measure can misrepresent the model performance when\nunderlying data distributions are not properly analyzed. Given that automated\ntraceability techniques tend to struggle to establish links, we need further\ninsight into the information limits related to traceability artifacts. In this\npaper, we propose an approach, TraceXplainer, for using information theory\nmetrics to evaluate and better understand the performance (limits) of\nunsupervised traceability techniques. Specifically, we introduce\nself-information, cross-entropy, and mutual information (MI) as metrics to\nmeasure the informativeness and reliability of traceability links. Through a\ncomprehensive replication and analysis of well-studied datasets and techniques,\nwe investigate the effectiveness of unsupervised techniques that predict\ntraceability links using IR/ML. This application of TraceXplainer illustrates\nan imbalance in typical traceability datasets where the source code has on\naverage 1.48 more information bits (i.e., entropy) than the linked\ndocumentation. Additionally, we demonstrate that an average MI of 4.81 bits,\nloss of 1.75, and noise of 0.28 bits signify that there are\ninformation-theoretic limits on the effectiveness of unsupervised traceability\ntechniques. We hope these findings spur additional research on understanding\nthe limits and progress of traceability research.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Software Engineering","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"EyItAmQvEtbvagv70M5l3X0lWPoizb5DL1PYmaFoIV0","pdfSize":"1188414"}
