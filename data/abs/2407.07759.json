A simple example is the Boole-Shannon expansion\n$c[p] \\equiv (p \\wedge c[\\mathrm{true}] ) \\vee (\\neg\\, p \\wedge\nc[\\mathrm{false}] )$, where $c$ denotes an arbitrary formula with possibly\nmultiple occurrences of a \"hole\", called a context, and $c[\\varphi]$ denotes\nthe result of \"filling\" all holes of $c$ with the formula $\\varphi$. Another\nexample is the unfolding rule $\\mu X. c[X] \\equiv c[\\mu X. c[X]]$ of the modal\n$\\mu$-calculus.\n  We consider the modal $\\mu$-calculus as overarching temporal logic and, as\nusual, reduce the problem whether $\\varphi_1 \\equiv \\varphi_2$ holds for\ncontextual formulas $\\varphi_1, \\varphi_2$ to the problem whether $\\varphi_1\n\\leftrightarrow \\varphi_2$ is valid . We show that the problem whether a\ncontextual formula of the $\\mu$-calculus is valid for all contexts can be\nreduced to validity of ordinary formulas. Our first result constructs a\ncanonical context such that a formula is valid for all contexts if{}f it is\nvalid for this particular one. However, the ordinary formula is exponential in\nthe nesting-depth of the context variables. In a second result we solve this\nproblem, thus proving that validity of contextual formulas is EXP-complete, as\nfor ordinary equivalences. We also prove that both results hold for CTL and LTL\nas well. We conclude the paper with some experimental results. In particular,\nwe use our implementation to automatically prove the correctness of a set of\nsix contextual equivalences of LTL recently introduced by Esparza et al. for\nthe normalization of LTL formulas. While Esparza et al. need several pages of\nmanual proof, our tool only needs milliseconds to do the job and to compute\ncounterexamples for incorrect variants of the equivalences.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sbHRFXekJKcRkgkq5ya4EAuIYgjqJRD4Bwv4FYfBQFo","pdfSize":"888949"}
