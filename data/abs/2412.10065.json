While extensively studied in two-dimensional (2D) configurations, the\ndynamics of reconnection in three-dimensional (3D) systems remain\nunder-explored. In this work, we extend the classical tearing mode instability\nto 3D by introducing a modulation along the otherwise uniform direction in a 2D\nequilibrium, given by $g(y)$, mimicking a flux tube-like configuration. We\nperform linear stability analysis (both analytically and numerically) and\ndirect numerical simulations to investigate the effects of\nthree-dimensionality. Our findings reveal that the 3D tearing instability\nexhibits reduced growth rates compared to 2D by a factor of $\\int g(y)^{1/2}\ndy~/\\int dy$, with the dispersion relation maintaining similar scaling\ncharacteristics. We show that the modulation introduces spatially varying\nresistive layer properties, which influence the reconnection dynamics.\nRemarkably, we find that Sweet-Parker scaling for the reconnection rate\npersists even in the absence of a guide field.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Xl_K09Fyu5eV7KtZS3FaDjNUUJwRSHr3fjpsAflKM9A","pdfSize":"12566769"}
