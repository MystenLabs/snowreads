In this paper, we study the\nanalogous objects for systems of Majorana fermions. A crucial role is played by\nfermion parity symmetry, which is an unbreakable symmetry present in any system\nin which the fundamental degrees of freedom are fermionic. We prove that the\nsubgroup of parity-preserving fermionic Cliffords can be represented by the\northogonal group over the binary field $\\mathbb{F}_2$, and we show how it can\nbe generated by braiding operators and used to construct any (even-parity)\nMajorana stabilizer code. We also analyze the frame potential for this\nso-called p-Clifford group, proving that it is equivalent to the frame\npotential of the ordinary Clifford group acting on a fixed-parity sector of the\nHilbert space.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_HakV-Yyx8UxO4cxLvrdnk7Sis1DZDi3PPWcPh4Oom8","pdfSize":"350263"}
