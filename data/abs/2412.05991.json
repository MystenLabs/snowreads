The defining feature of the CS is that it is\nan eigenmode of the annihilation operator. The construction easily generalizes\nto the case of a finite number of sites. However, the challenge is altogether\ndifferent when one considers an infinite array of sites. In this work we\ndemonstrate a mathematically rigorous construction that resolves the latter\ncase. The resulting nonlocal coherent states (NCS) are simultaneous eigenmodes\nfor all of the infinitely many annihilation operators acting in the infinite\narray's Fock space. Our construction fundamentally relies on Dirichlet\nseries-based analysis and number theoretic arguments.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"h701mM8Xgyx8xrxnXiZEFLjLdTHuN8N5Vq86lAtRoUk","pdfSize":"2433630"}
