  "abstract": "  The finite monodromy groups of abelian varieties over number fields have been\nintroduced by Grothendieck. They represent the local obstruction to semi-stable\nreduction. In this paper we prove a criteria for finite groups to be realized\nas finite monodromy groups in given dimension. An application to the degree of\nsemi-stability gives an effective version of Grothendieck's semi-stable\nreduction theorem in terms of the degree of the extension with regards to the\ndimension of the variety.\n",
