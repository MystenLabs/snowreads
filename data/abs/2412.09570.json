Our proof uses an infinite random graph sampled from a\ndistribution that generalizes the random regular graph distribution. To control\nthe spectral behavior of this infinite object, we show that Huang and Yau's\nproof of Friedman's theorem bounding the second eigenvalue of a random regular\ngraph generalizes to this model. We also bound the trace of the\nnon-backtracking operator, as was done in Bordenave's separate proof of\nFriedman's theorem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Spectral Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HKoi_uMW2QbLgx-VITgOzYj9XX3SlLjJ8Ap1AnxIIPA","pdfSize":"439262"}
