To accurately determine the asteroid's shape from\ndiffraction-affected light curves, we developed a novel data reduction\ntechnique named the Diffracted Occultation's United Simulator for Highly\nInformative Transient Explorations (DOUSHITE). Using DOUSHITE-generated\nsynthetic models, we derived constraints on (98943) 2001 CC21's shadow shape\nfrom the single-chord occultation data. Our results suggest a significant\nelongation of the shadow with an axis ratio of $b/a = 0.37\\pm0.09$. This shape\ncan be crucial for planning Hayabusa2's high-speed flyby to optimise the\nlimited imaging opportunities.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4WQS9gZv1W1ObTSDmEspTDww7m5OM9MRZnrKCbEKP0s","pdfSize":"12621557"}
