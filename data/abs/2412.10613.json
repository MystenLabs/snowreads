  "abstract": "  X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) are renowned for their high brightness,\nsignificantly impacting biology, chemistry, and nonlinear X-ray optics.\nHowever, current XFELs are large, expensive, and exhibit significant\nshot-to-shot instability. Here, we propose a novel compact apparatus for\ngenerating X-ray lasers. The setup integrates an ion source to produce highly\ncharged ions as the gain medium. The X-ray optical cavity employs crystal Bragg\ndiffraction for high reflectivity at large angles, and two parabolic compound\nrefractive lenses (CRLs) focus the X-rays. Pumping is achieved through electron\ncollision excitations. This X-ray laser offers compact dimensions, reduced\ncosts, and enhanced coherence, positioning it as a promising seed for XFELs.\nWith further optimization, this device has the potential to rival XFELs and\nrevolutionize both scientific research and industrial applications.\n",
