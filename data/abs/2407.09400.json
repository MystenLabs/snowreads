Contrary to\nthese predictions, large-angle CMB temperature anomalies generically involve\ncorrelations between even-$\\ell$ and odd-$\\ell$ angular power spectrum\n$C_\\ell$, while recent analyses of CMB polarization have revealed non-zero\nequal-$\\ell$ $EB$ correlations. These findings challenge the conventional\nunderstanding, suggesting deviations from statistical isotropy, violations of\nparity, or both. Cosmic topology, which involves changing only the boundary\nconditions of space relative to standard cosmology, offers a compelling\nframework to potentially account for such parity-violating observations.\nTopology inherently breaks statistical isotropy, and can also break homogeneity\nand parity, providing a natural paradigm for explaining observations of\nparity-breaking observables without the need to add parity violation to the\nunderlying microphysics. Our investigation delves into the harmonic space\nimplications of topology for CMB correlations, using as an illustrative example\n$EB$ correlations generated by tensor perturbations under both\nparity-preserving and parity-violating scenarios. Consequently, these findings\nnot only challenge the foundational assumptions of the standard cosmological\nmodel but also open new avenues for exploring the topological structure of the\nUniverse through CMB observations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sotJIell190OULmojma3AQ82eKYqv-_PdZzBCHJQ7Mg","pdfSize":"1537295"}
