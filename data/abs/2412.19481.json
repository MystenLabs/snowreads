This tensor is a higher-order extensions of the\nadjacency matrix of G. A lower bound of the clique number is given via the\nspectral radius of A(G). It is an extension of Nikiforov's spectral bound and\ntighter than the bound of Nikiforov in some classes of graphs. Furthermore, we\nobtain a spectral version of the Erdos-Simonovits stability theorem for clique\ntensors based on this bound.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lF-lAkCyIC3Lk04PbdWBn0H4wEaVm_IL70ITutofSi0","pdfSize":"152321"}
