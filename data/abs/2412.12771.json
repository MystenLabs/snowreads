  "abstract": "  Producing large images using small diffusion models is gaining increasing\npopularity, as the cost of training large models could be prohibitive. A common\napproach involves jointly generating a series of overlapped image patches and\nobtaining large images by merging adjacent patches. However, results from\nexisting methods often exhibit noticeable artifacts, e.g., seams and\ninconsistent objects and styles. To address the issues, we proposed Guided\nFusion (GF), which mitigates the negative impact from distant image regions by\napplying a weighted average to the overlapping regions. Moreover, we proposed\nVariance-Corrected Fusion (VCF), which corrects data variance at\npost-averaging, generating more accurate fusion for the Denoising Diffusion\nProbabilistic Model. Furthermore, we proposed a one-shot Style Alignment (SA),\nwhich generates a coherent style for large images by adjusting the initial\ninput noise without adding extra computational burden. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrated that the proposed fusion methods improved the quality of the\ngenerated image significantly. The proposed method can be widely applied as a\nplug-and-play module to enhance other fusion-based methods for large image\ngeneration. Code: https://github.com/TitorX/GVCFDiffusion\n",
