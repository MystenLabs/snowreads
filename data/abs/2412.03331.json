However, these models rely heavily on parallel data,\nwhich can be scarce for many low-resource languages, including Luxembourgish.\nThis scarcity results in suboptimal performance of monolingual and\ncross-lingual sentence embedding models for these languages. To address this\nissue, we compile a relatively small but high-quality human-generated\ncross-lingual parallel dataset to train LuxEmbedder, an enhanced sentence\nembedding model for Luxembourgish with strong cross-lingual capabilities.\nAdditionally, we present evidence suggesting that including low-resource\nlanguages in parallel training datasets can be more advantageous for other\nlow-resource languages than relying solely on high-resource language pairs.\nFurthermore, recognizing the lack of sentence embedding benchmarks for\nlow-resource languages, we create a paraphrase detection benchmark specifically\nfor Luxembourgish, aiming to partially fill this gap and promote further\nresearch.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1eJeRU-dmimn6PKPa2QRqi_qHrSDlO653WFXIqE24jU","pdfSize":"1807869"}
