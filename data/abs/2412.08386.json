In\nthis system, $X$ is a Hawkes-diffusion process, and $\\lambda$ denotes the\nstochastic intensity of the Hawkes process driving the jumps of $X$. Based on\nthe continuous observation of a path of $(X_t)$ over $[0, T]$, and initially\nassuming that $\\lambda$ is known, we establish the convergence rate of a kernel\nestimator $\\widehat\\pi\\left(x^*, y^*\\right)$ of $\\pi\\left(x^*,y^*\\right)$ as $T\n\\rightarrow \\infty$. Interestingly, this rate depends on the value of $y^*$\ninfluenced by the baseline parameter of the Hawkes intensity process. From the\nrate of convergence of $\\widehat\\pi\\left(x^*,y^*\\right)$, we derive the rate of\nconvergence for an estimator of the invariant density $\\lambda$. Subsequently,\nwe extend the study to the case where $\\lambda$ is unknown, plugging an\nestimator of $\\lambda$ in the kernel estimator and deducing new rates of\nconvergence for the obtained estimator. The proofs establishing these\nconvergence rates rely on probabilistic results that may hold independent\ninterest. We introduce a Girsanov change of measure to transform the Hawkes\nprocess with intensity $\\lambda$ into a Poisson process with constant\nintensity. To achieve this, we extend a bound for the exponential moments for\nthe Hawkes process, originally established in the stationary case, to the\nnon-stationary case. Lastly, we conduct a numerical study to illustrate the\nobtained rates of convergence of our estimators.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZZPo0Kxw7GRbMBnlowVDond3QXBcpR4IDo1dvRwNdhg","pdfSize":"883223"}
