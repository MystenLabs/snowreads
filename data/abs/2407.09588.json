If these waves travel through another massive\nastrophysical object, they will undergo an effect called gravitational lensing,\nthat will distort and deflect them. This effect can create multiple images of\nthe gravitational wave signal, and interference between them. In this document,\nwe describe the sonification process of the gravitational lensing effect on\ngravitational waves. Sonification is the translation of data into sound. The\nwave nature of sound creates interference between waves in a natural way. This\nhas allowed us to reproduce the interference produced by the superposition of\ngravitational wave images, characteristic of the gravitational lensing effect.\n  The results can be heard on the following websites:\n  https://zoom3.net/sonificacions/ona-gravitacional.html - gravitational waves\nfrom the merger of two black holes\n  https://zoom3.net/sonificacions/ona-gravitacional-lent.html - gravitational\nwaves affected by a gravitational lens, interactive website\n  https://zoom3.net/sonificacions/ona-gravitacional-lent-exemples.html -\ngravitational waves affected by a gravitational lens, recorded examples.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Popular Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PJym5P1g8J83R6envQlNf6vDh62W_729cZ17Gllg8SE","pdfSize":"2078215"}
