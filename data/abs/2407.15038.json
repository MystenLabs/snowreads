This paper explores the\napplication of explainable AI (XAI) models to forecast the likelihood of RFQ\nfulfillment. By leveraging advanced algorithms including Logistic Regression,\nRandom Forest, XGBoost and Bayesian Neural Tree, we are able to improve the\naccuracy of RFQ fill rate predictions and generate the most efficient quote\nprice for market makers. XAI serves as a robust and transparent tool for market\nparticipants to navigate the complexities of RFQs with greater precision.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"261qzHoBNWQV4uwf6BC7tD_YA6Les_z1wo9q5jsIHTU","pdfSize":"727436"}
