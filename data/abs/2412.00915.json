However,\nvarious kinds of matters may exist around the source or on the path to the\ndetector, and there also exist many different kinds of modified theories of\ngravity. The effects of these modifications can be characterized within the\nparameterized post-Einstein (ppE) framework, and the corresponding phase\ncorrections on the waveform at leading post-Newtonian (PN) order are also\nexpressed by the additional parameters for these effects. In this work, we\nconsider the varying-G theory and the dynamical friction of the dark matter\nspike as an example. Both of these two effects will modify the waveform at -4PN\norder, if we choose the suitable power law index for the spike. We choose to\nuse a statistic to characterize the dispersion between the posterior of $\\dot\nG$ for different events. For different astronomical models, we find that this\nstatistic can distinguish these two models very effectively. This result\nindicates that we could use this statistic to distinguish other degenerate\neffects with the detection of multiple sources.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RBdllu2kUQbD3Lwmu_x00tWZNdFrs0YlX_EKiuloShg","pdfSize":"919532"}
