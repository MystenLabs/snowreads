Many robotics applications in unstructured environments such as the\nhome or warehouse would benefit a lot from better grasp performance. This paper\nproposes a novel framework for detecting $SE(3)$ grasp poses based on point\ncloud input. Our main contribution is to propose an $SE(3)$-equivariant model\nthat maps each point in the cloud to a continuous grasp quality function over\nthe 2-sphere $S^2$ using a spherical harmonic basis. Compared with reasoning\nabout a finite set of samples, this formulation improves the accuracy and\nefficiency of our model when a large number of samples would otherwise be\nneeded. In order to accomplish this, we propose a novel variation on\nEquiFormerV2 that leverages a UNet-style backbone to enlarge the number of\npoints the model can handle. Our resulting method, which we name\n$\\textit{OrbitGrasp}$, significantly outperforms baselines in both simulation\nand physical experiments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"wOH8wnSw-ET48sgmvEJp1AY0oEGsgdUv12zz7WAT6lo","pdfSize":"30050731"}
