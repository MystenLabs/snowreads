  "abstract": "  Optical Schr\\\"{o}dinger cat states are non-Gaussian states with applications\nin quantum technologies, such as for building error-correcting states in\nquantum computing. Yet the efficient generation of high-fidelity optical\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger cat states is an outstanding problem in quantum optics. Here,\nwe propose using squeezed superpositions of zero and two photons,\n$|\\theta\\rangle = \\cos{(\\theta/2)}|0\\rangle + \\sin{(\\theta/2)}|2\\rangle$, as\ningredients for protocols to efficiently generate high-fidelity cat states. We\npresent a protocol using linear optics with success probability $P\\gtrsim 50\\%$\nthat can generate cat states of size $|\\alpha|^2=5$ with fidelity $F>0.99$. The\nprotocol relies only on detecting single photons and is remarkably tolerant of\nloss, with $2\\%$ detection loss still achieving $F>0.98$ for cats with\n$|\\alpha|^2=5$. We also show that squeezed $\\theta$ states are ideal candidates\nfor nonlinear photon subtraction using a two-level system with near\ndeterministic success probability and fidelity $F>0.98$ for cat states of size\n$|\\alpha|^2=5$. Schemes for generating $\\theta$ states using quantum emitters\nare also presented. Our protocols can be implemented with current\nstate-of-the-art quantum optics experiments.\n",
