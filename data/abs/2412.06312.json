  "abstract": "  Planning is a fundamental activity, arising frequently in many contexts, from\ndaily tasks to industrial processes. The planning task consists of selecting a\nsequence of actions to achieve a specified goal from specified initial\nconditions. The Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) is the leading\nlanguage used in the field of automated planning to model planning problems.\nPrevious work has highlighted the limitations of PDDL, particularly in terms of\nits expressivity. Our interest lies in facilitating the handling of complex\nproblems and enhancing the overall capability of automated planning systems.\nUnified-Planning is a Python library offering high-level API to specify\nplanning problems and to invoke automated planners. In this paper, we present\nan extension of the UP library aimed at enhancing its expressivity for\nhigh-level problem modelling. In particular, we have added an array type, an\nexpression to count booleans, and the allowance for integer parameters in\nactions. We show how these facilities enable natural high-level models of three\nclassical planning problems.\n",
