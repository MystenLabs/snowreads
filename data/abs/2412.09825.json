  "abstract": "  We present an experimental study on the generation of self-sustained and fast\nsquare oscillations from the TE mode of semiconductor VCSELs with delayed\northogonal polarization feedback. We find that the low frequency switching\noriginates from the rotation of the TE and TM modes facilitated by a long time\ndelay, but the fast oscillations are anchored to the frequency beating between\nthe TE and TM modes and are modified by a half-wavelength ($\\lambda/2$) plate.\nA comprehensive analysis of the evolution of the nonlinear dynamics is\nconducted and the related mechanism is discussed. Our study not only deepens\nour comprehension of laser nonlinear dynamics but also offers an all-optical\napproach for producing specialized signals, which could be instrumental in\napplications such as optical communications and photonic computing.\n",
