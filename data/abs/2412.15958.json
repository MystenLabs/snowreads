This\ncalculation allows us to extract the one-loop matching kernel, necessary to\nconnect quasi and pseudo-distributions to collinear parton distribution\nfunctions (PDFs), accounting for heavy-quark mass effects. Our result is exact\nin that it includes all powers of $z^2m^2$ at one loop in $\\alpha_s$. In the\nlimit $z^2m^2\\rightarrow 0$, it consistently reduces to the known massless\nresult. We also carry out an implementation of our expression, which allows us\nto compute the charm pseudo-distribution of the proton given its PDF. We\nfinally comment on the quantitative impact of heavy-quark mass corrections.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cBvuzDUXbqK7-f85L0VJzAtZccvU1a9Ez9yCRbRLfsE","pdfSize":"382754"}
