The basis is based on the Muffin Tin Orbital (MTO) idea that the\neigenstates of the Khon Sham (KS) Hamiltonian may we be expanded in terms of\neigenstates of the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian inside the so called\nMuffin Tin (MT) spheres and Bessel functions in the interstitial multiplied by\nappropriate spherical Harmonics. Here we use the fact that the solution to\nproblem of finding the ground state electron density is most often done through\nan iterative process, where generically on the order of over 20 iterations are\ntaken till the ground state electron density and energy converges to the lowest\nvalues allowed by the correlation and exchange functional for the fixed form of\nthe external potential. We use eigenstate information from the previous\nconvergence iteration to choose the energies of the eigenstates of the\nspherically averaged KS Hamiltonian. Furthermore within the Atomic Sphere\nApproximation (ASA) the energies of the Bessel functions do not matter as they\nare cancelled out. This is an efficient method aimed at studying the electronic\nstructure of materials with large unit cells especially if they are of close\npacked form where ASA is particularly accurate.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ho5lcEgHFrRwYrAj0frUc8bTUkKfa3TN-DiQfwkQgWo","pdfSize":"1318371"}
