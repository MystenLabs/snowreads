In the strong injection\nregime, a soliton is stabilized at the injection site, which has been termed a\ncontact soliton DEF or CS-DEF. Here, we investigate the modulation of CS-DEFs\nas a mechanism to inject magnons into a DEF. By varying the injection current,\nthe parameters connecting the soliton with the DEF via a boundary layer are\nvaried. These lead to a modification in the DEF which is interpreted as a spin\npiston. The injected magnons follow the expected dispersion relation of DEFs,\nakin to the Bogoliubov - de Gennes dispersion relation. This work demonstrates\nthat changes in the injected current can pumping magnons along a ferromagnetic\nchannel via dissipative exchange flows.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PfrbWBRcyCIuMkZC1lK1GsKVBnfKe07J__hCy_aLznk","pdfSize":"363636"}
