  "abstract": "  The Land Matrix initiative (https://landmatrix.org) and its global\nobservatory aim to provide reliable data on large-scale land acquisitions to\ninform debates and actions in sectors such as agriculture, extraction, or\nenergy in low- and middle-income countries. Although these data are recognized\nin the academic world, they remain underutilized in public policy, mainly due\nto the complexity of access and exploitation, which requires technical\nexpertise and a good understanding of the database schema.\n  The objective of this work is to simplify access to data from different\ndatabase systems. The methods proposed in this article are evaluated using data\nfrom the Land Matrix. This work presents various comparisons of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) as well as combinations of LLM adaptations (Prompt Engineering,\nRAG, Agents) to query different database systems (GraphQL and REST queries).\nThe experiments are reproducible, and a demonstration is available online:\nhttps://github.com/tetis-nlp/landmatrix-graphql-python.\n",
