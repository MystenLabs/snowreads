  "abstract": "  Online services that desire to operate anonymously routinely host themselves\nas 'Hidden Services' in the Tor network. However, these services are frequently\nthreatened by deanonymization attacks, whereby their IP address and location\nmay be inferred by the authorities. We present VaulTor, a novel architecture\nfor the Tor network to ensure an extra layer of security for the Hidden\nServices against deanonymization attacks. In this new architecture, a volunteer\n(vault) is incentivized to host the web application content on behalf of the\nHidden Service. The vault runs the hosted application in a Trusted Execution\nEnvironment (TEE) and becomes the point of contact for interested clients. This\nsetup can substantially reduce the uptime requirement of the original Hidden\nService provider and hence significantly decrease the chance of deanonymization\nattacks against them. We also show that the VaulTor architecture does not cause\nany noticeable performance degradation in accessing the hosted content (the\nperformance degradation ranges from 2.6-5.5%).\n",
