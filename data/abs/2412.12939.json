  "abstract": "  A numerical integration of the equations of motion of the Sun-planets-an\nobject system is used to study the evolution of orbits close to the orbit of\nthe P/1996 R2 object, which is a Jupiter-crossing object, and to the asteroidal\norbit of the P/1996 N2 object, which, at the moment of its detection, had a\ntail similar to a cometary one. Small variations in the initial data\nconsiderably affect the evolution of orbits close to that of the P/1996 R2\nobject. The time elapsed up to the ejection of the object into a hyperbolic\norbit varied from 3*10^4 to 2.7*10^7 yr. Some objects were in resonances with\nJupiter and Saturn for a long time. For about 20 percent of the runs, objects\nreached the Earth's orbit during evolution. Orbital elements of the P/1996 N2\nobject changed quasi-periodically over the considered time span of 200 Myr.\nVariations in the semimajor axis, eccentricity, and inclination were equal to\n0.04 AU, 0.11 deg, and 3.5 deg, respectively.\n",
