The model incorporates an inverse seesaw mechanism to explain the small\nactive neutrino masses through sterile neutrinos. Discrete symmetries,\nincluding $Z_2, Z_2^\\prime, Z_3, Z_4, Z_7$ and $Z_{10}$ distinct mixing for the\nquarks and neutrinos . The model successfully predicts observed fermion masses\nand mixing patterns. Additionally, the constrained parameter space,\nparticularly in the lepton sector, allows for potentially observable cLFV\nprocesses like $\\mu \\rightarrow e \\gamma$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"RiHkmk2SLAQy9F9wtDF_7TB2PBa_uImNTuQBZAv1Q5k","pdfSize":"2845058"}
