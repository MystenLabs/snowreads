We focus on PT symmetric antiferromagnets that\nbreak both time-reversal T and inversion symmetry P. We identify crucial\ncontributions in phenomenological elastic theory, dubbed flexo-viscosity and\nflexo-torque, that induce phonon nonreciprocity without changing the phonon\npolarization. The microscopic origin of these contributions is the molecular\nBerry curvature, manifested as emergent nonlocal magnetic fields on phonons.\nThe symmetry breaking originated from spin order is transferred to the phonon\nsystem through spin-orbit coupling, where the orbital degree of freedom affects\nthe lattice dynamics directly. By electrically modifying the spin-orbit\ncoupling, we show that both the phonon nonreciprocity and helicity can be\ncontrolled and enhanced. Importantly, the phonon nonreciprocity is an odd\nfunction of the N\\'eel vector, serving as an indicator of the order parameter.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"wba6xsrFgwn4QQ0hnX_fa_F7-yk6pHiCJRle1kAF-yQ","pdfSize":"238598"}
