However, the reduced\ndimensionality in monolayer FeSe, which may drive superconducting fluctuations,\ncomplicates the understanding of the enhancement mechanisms. Here we construct\na new superconducting interface: monolayer FeSe/SrVO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$, in which\nthe itinerant electrons of highly metallic SrVO$_3$ films can screen all the\nhigh-energy Fuchs-Kliewer phonons, including those of SrTiO$_3$, making it the\nfirst FeSe/oxide system with screened interfacial EPC while maintaining the\nmonolayer FeSe thickness. Despite comparable doping levels, the heavily\nelectron-doped monolayer FeSe/SrVO$_3$ exhibits a lower pairing temperature\n($T_\\mathrm{g}$ $\\sim$ 48 K) than FeSe/SrTiO$_3$ and FeSe/LaFeO$_3$. Our\nfindings disentangle the contributions of interfacial EPC from dimensionality\non enhancing $T_\\mathrm{g}$ in FeSe/oxide interfaces, underscoring the\nimportance of interfacial EPC in $T_\\mathrm{g}$ enhancement. This FeSe/VO$_x$\ninterface also provides a platform for studying the interfacial\nsuperconductivity.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OOXsGyiQQzErhg6vbeMQ_zV2WnbSp6IcwWlZ16kxpCU","pdfSize":"5619628","objectId":"0x024f9cd0819affab1540b285135f287cde73911673e5293eb69ae3e4d4ab324d","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
