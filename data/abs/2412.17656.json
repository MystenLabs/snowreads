  "abstract": "  The optical and plasmonic properties of the chains of prolate metallic\nspheroids of the dielectric substrate are studied in the work using the local\nfield approximation. The case when spheroids are arranged in such a way that\ntheir major semi-axis belongs to the substrate plane is considered. The\nrelations for the transverse component of the chain polarizability tensor and\nthe frequency of the transverse chain resonance are obtained. The comparative\nanalysis of spectral shifts of the maxima of the imaginary part of the\ntransverse chain polarizability and the polarizability of isolated prolate\nspheroid is performed. The influence of the variation of the material of\nparticles in the chain and the dielectric environment on the location of the\nmaxima of the imaginary part of the transverse polarizability is studied. The\nlimits of applicability of the theory proposed in the paper are established.\n",
