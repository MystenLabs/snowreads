  "abstract": "  This work addresses the challenge of optimal energy management in microgrids\nthrough a collaborative and privacy-preserving framework. We propose the\nFedTRPO methodology, which integrates Federated Learning (FL) and Trust Region\nPolicy Optimization (TRPO) to manage distributed energy resources (DERs)\nefficiently. Using a customized version of the CityLearn environment and\nsynthetically generated data, we simulate designed net-zero energy scenarios\nfor microgrids composed of multiple buildings. Our approach emphasizes reducing\nenergy costs and carbon emissions while ensuring privacy. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that FedTRPO is comparable with state-of-the-art federated RL\nmethodologies without hyperparameter tunning. The proposed framework highlights\nthe feasibility of collaborative learning for achieving optimal control\npolicies in energy systems, advancing the goals of sustainable and efficient\nsmart grids.\n",
