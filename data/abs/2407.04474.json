The most\nrepresentative such problem is one-sided matching, in which a set of n agents\nhave values for a set of n items, and the objective is to compute a matching of\nthe agents to the items of maximum total value (a.k.a., social welfare).\nFollowing the recent framework of Caragiannis and Rathi [10], we consider a\nmodel in which the agent-item values are not available upfront but become known\nby querying agent sequences. In particular, when the agents are asked to act in\na sequence, they respond by picking their favorite item that has not been\npicked by agents who acted before and reveal their value for it. Can we compute\nan agent sequence that induces a social welfare-optimal matching?\n  We answer this question affirmatively and present an algorithm that uses\npolynomial number (n^5) of queries. This solves the main open problem stated by\nCaragiannis and Rathi [CR23]. Our analysis uses a potential function argument\nthat measures progress towards learning the underlying edge-weight information.\nFurthermore, the algorithm has a truthful implementation by adapting the\nparadigm of VCG payments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZkZbgFz_vf2UbSEOAsfwdQ9PJcpwPV0KCOjXh5MtOSM","pdfSize":"174951"}
