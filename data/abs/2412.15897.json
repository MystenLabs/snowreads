In previous work, we\nintroduced the enlarge-likelihood-each-notable-amplitude spiking-neural-network\n(ELENA-SNN) decoder, a novel decoding algorithm for low-density parity-check\n(LDPC) codes. The decoder integrates SNNs into belief propagation (BP) decoding\nby approximating the check node (CN) update equation using SNNs. However, when\ndecoding LDPC codes with a small variable node(VN) degree, the approximation\ngets too rough, and the ELENA-SNN decoder does not yield good results. This\npaper introduces the multi-level ELENA-SNN (ML-ELENA-SNN) decoder, which is an\nextension of the ELENA-SNN decoder. Instead of a single SNN approximating the\nCN update, multiple SNNs are applied in parallel, resulting in a higher\nresolution and higher dynamic range of the exchanged messages. We show that the\nML-ELENA-SNN decoder performs similarly to the ubiquitous normalized min-sum\ndecoder for the (38400, 30720) regular LDPC code with a VN degree of dv = 3 and\na CN degree of dc = 15.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computer Science/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LJ8NTisv7sg9yhSlZ39qrserO5o07gkmEah7hYQu2TE","pdfSize":"456925"}
