The singularity in the\nmagnetization found by Onsager does not survive the presence of the external\nmagnetic field as found earlier by Lee and Yang in 1952. However, the\nsingularity in the heat capacity remains even in the presence of the magnetic\nfield. A surprising result is the presence of negative heat capacity for h > 0.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"VpuVcJA2oevmc2jpYJ6NOWyf85OQtoJQjXDkw6JnQ7c","pdfSize":"773183"}
