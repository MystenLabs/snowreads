  "abstract": "  We consider membranes as fluid deformable surface and allow for higher order\ngeometric terms in the bending energy. The evolution equations are derived and\nnumerically solved using surface finite elements. The higher order geometric\nterms related to the Gaussian curvature squared have a tendency to stabilize\ntubes and enhance the evolution towards equilibrium shapes, thereby\nfacilitating rapid shape changes. This is demonstrated in axisymmetric settings\nand fully three-dimensional simulations.\n",
