We show\nthat the criterion applies to the monadic Grzegorczyk logic MGrz, thus\nestablishing that MGrz axiomatizes the one-variable fragment of the predicate\nGrzegorczyk logic QGrz. This we do by proving the finite model property of\nMGrz, which is achieved by strengthening the notion of a maximal point of a\ndescriptive MGrz-frame and by refining the existing selective filtration\nmethods.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VhKEZAK0T-5RNnK9sRl556a1mgCjOPivn_uAWy4urEE","pdfSize":"395178"}
