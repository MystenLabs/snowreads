We\nevaluated the potential contributions of specific natural language processing\nsolutions to support knowledge discovery from biomedical literature. Two models\nfrom the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) family,\ntwo Large Language Models, and PubTator 3.0 were tested for their ability to\nsupport the named entity recognition (NER) and the relation extraction (RE)\ntasks. PubTator 3.0 and the BioBERT model performed best in the NER task (best\nF1-score equal to 0.93 and 0.89, respectively), while BioBERT outperformed all\nother solutions in the RE task (best F1-score 0.79) and a specific use case it\nwas applied to by recognizing nearly all entity mentions and most of the\nrelations.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9L0Oz5mVM3O-FrJ_0T5pt0rbngaTrkfWj0OTaEzXPd8","pdfSize":"395324"}
