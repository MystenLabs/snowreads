We use first-principles density functional theory\nwith a hybrid functional to investigate several features that are key for its\nuse in heterostructures. First, for the purposes of growing wz-LaN on a\nsubstrate or designing a heterostructure, we show that it can be\nlattice-matched with a number of cubic materials along their [111] axes. We\nalso evaluate the bound charge at such interfaces, taking into account both the\npolarization discontinuity and the piezoelectric polarization due to\npseudomorphic strain. Second, we investigate band alignments and assess the\nresults for interfaces with zincblende-, rocksalt-, and perovskite-structure\ncompounds, and with chemically similar wurtzite and rocksalt nitrides. Our\nresults provide guidance for the development of electronic devices based on\nwz-LaN.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"mEgt2Y5n0Z_NRsOxDmhGPhqEzVWHrpad1jRZ1exDwI0","pdfSize":"757523"}
