  "abstract": "  Phages use bacterial host resources to replicate, intrinsically linking phage\nand host survival. To understand phage dynamics, it is essential to understand\nphage-host ecology. A key step in this ecology is infection of bacterial hosts.\nPrevious work has explored single and multiple, sequential infections. Here we\nfocus on the theory of simultaneous infections, where multiple phages\nsimultaneously attach to and infect one bacterial host cell. Simultaneous\ninfections are a relevant infection dynamic to consider, especially at high\nphage densities when many phages attach to a single host cell in a short time\nwindow. For high bacterial growth rates, simultaneous infection can result in\nbi-stability: depending on initial conditions phages go extinct or co-exist\nwith hosts, either at stable densities or through periodic oscillations of a\nstable limit cycle. This bears important consequences for phage applications\nsuch as phage therapy: phages can persist even though they cannot invade.\nConsequently, through spikes in phage densities it is possible to infect a\nbacterial population even when the phage basic reproductive number is less than\none. In the regime of stable limit cycles, if timed right, only small densities\nof phage may be necessary.\n",
