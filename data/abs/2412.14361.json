While the results outperformed benchmarks, practical\nimplementation raises concerns about robustness and evolving market conditions.\nThis study explores modifications addressing reliance on T-bills, alternative\nfallback allocations, and industry exclusions. Despite attempts to enhance\nadaptability through momentum signals, parameter optimization, and Walk-Forward\nAnalysis, results reveal persistent challenges. The results highlight\nchallenges in adapting historical strategies to modern markets and offer\ninsights for future trend-following frameworks.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Portfolio Management","Quantitative Finance/Trading and Market Microstructure"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BSvvi0S6RRe8hlSwgDeDDuwzSBgP_WjJ-w-Pw2Z3LTc","pdfSize":"1887922"}
