  "abstract": "  Infectious diseases often involve multiple strains that interact through the\nimmune response generated after an infection. This study investigates the\nconditions under which a two-strain epidemic model with partial cross-immunity\ncan lead to self-sustained oscillations, and reveals a new oscillatory regime\nin these models. Contrary to previous findings, which suggested that strong\ncross-immunity and significant asymmetry between strains are necessary for\noscillations, our results demonstrate that sustained oscillations can occur\neven with weak cross-immunity and weak asymmetry. Using asymptotic methods, we\nprovide a detailed mathematical analysis showing that the steady state of\ncoexistence becomes unstable along specific curves in the parameter space,\nleading to oscillatory solutions for any value of the basic reproduction number\ngreater than one. Numerical simulations support our theoretical findings,\nhighlighting an unexpected oscillatory region in the parameter domain. These\nresults challenge the current understanding of oscillatory dynamics in\nmulti-strain epidemiological models, point to an oversight in previous studies,\nand suggest broader conditions under which such dynamics can arise.\n",
