  "abstract": "  In this paper, we investigate the thermal quantum correlations in a\nsemiconductor double quantum dot system. The device comprises a single electron\nin a double quantum dot subjected to a longitudinal magnetic field and a\ntransverse magnetic field gradient. The thermal entanglement of the single\nelectron is driven by the charge and spin qubits. Utilizing the density matrix\nformalism, we derive analytical expressions for thermal concurrence and\ncorrelated coherence. The main goal of this work is to provide a good\nunderstanding of the effects of temperature and various parameters on quantum\ncoherence. Additionally, our findings indicate that the transverse magnetic\nfield can be employed to adjust the thermal entanglement and quantum coherence\nof the system. We also highlight the roles of thermal entanglement and\ncorrelated coherence in generating quantum correlations, noting that thermal\ncorrelated coherence is consistently more robust than thermal entanglement.\nThis suggests that quantum algorithms based solely on correlated coherence\nmight be more resilient than those relying on entanglement.\n",
