Traditionally, constructing patent\nlandscapes is intensely laborious and expensive, and the rapid expansion of\npatenting activity in recent decades has driven an increasing need for\nefficient and effective automated patent landscaping approaches. In particular,\nit is critical that we be able to construct patent landscapes using a minimal\nnumber of labeled examples, as labeling patents for a narrow technology area\nrequires highly specialized (and hence expensive) technical knowledge. We\npresent an automated neural patent landscaping system that demonstrates\nsignificantly improved performance on difficult examples (0.69 $F_1$ on 'hard'\nexamples, versus 0.6 for previously reported systems), and also significant\nimprovements with much less training data (overall 0.75 $F_1$ on as few as 24\nexamples). Furthermore, in evaluating such automated landscaping systems,\nacquiring good data is challenge; we demonstrate a higher-quality training data\ngeneration procedure by merging Abood and Feltenberger's (2018)\n\"seed/anti-seed\" approach with active learning to collect difficult labeled\nexamples near the decision boundary. Using this procedure we created a new\ndataset of labeled AI patents for training and testing. As in prior work we\ncompare our approach with a number of baseline systems, and we release our code\nand data for others to build upon.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5mNqLgGSQxWw-39nRnnJIpOXK-W4Ac2T6zjAtHsXN5Q","pdfSize":"2032813","objectId":"0xfde968d8411bc327c633c80771b0109b28032bb4ef0510ef3ed874535523c38c","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
