The obstructions to\nthe surjectivity of this representation are either local (i.e. at a prime), or\ndue to nonsurjectivity on the product of local Galois images. In this article,\nwe study an extreme case: the coincidence i.e. the equality of $n$-division\nfields, generated by the $n$-torsion points, attached to different positive\nintegers $n$. We give necessary conditions for coincidences, dealing separately\nwith vertical coincidences, at a given prime, and horizontal coincidences,\nacross multiple primes, in particular when the Galois group on the $n$-torsion\ncontains the special linear group. We also give a non-trivial construction for\ncoincidences not occurring over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"wXM3EAPZiKktXL2TL_BZVi4vT5oGMqU318TTLmnRHrA","pdfSize":"368333"}
