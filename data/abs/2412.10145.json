Here, we use large-scale Tree Tensor Network simulations to identify\nthe dynamical signature of an interface roughening transition within the\nferromagnetic phase of the 2D quantum Ising model. For initial domain wall\nprofiles we find extended prethermal plateaus for smooth interfaces, whereas\nabove the roughening transition the domain wall decays quickly. Our results can\nbe readily explored experimentally in Rydberg atomic systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PQvLNI90Xj_CTv-mhbQBVQkKweK_BDMW5VzD7lW3-7Q","pdfSize":"4881685"}
