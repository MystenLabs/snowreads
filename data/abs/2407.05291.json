Though recent LLMs seem\ncapable of planning and reasoning given user instructions, their effectiveness\nin applying these capabilities for autonomous task solving remains\nunderexplored. This is especially true in enterprise settings, where automated\nagents hold the promise of a high impact. To fill this gap, we propose\nWorkArena++, a novel benchmark consisting of 682 tasks corresponding to\nrealistic workflows routinely performed by knowledge workers. WorkArena++ is\ndesigned to evaluate the planning, problem-solving, logical/arithmetic\nreasoning, retrieval, and contextual understanding abilities of web agents. Our\nempirical studies across state-of-the-art LLMs and vision-language models\n(VLMs), as well as human workers, reveal several challenges for such models to\nserve as useful assistants in the workplace. In addition to the benchmark, we\nprovide a mechanism to effortlessly generate thousands of ground-truth\nobservation/action traces, which can be used for fine-tuning existing models.\nOverall, we expect this work to serve as a useful resource to help the\ncommunity progress toward capable autonomous agents.
