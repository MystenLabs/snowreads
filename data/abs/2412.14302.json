  "abstract": "  Transformer-based approaches such as BERT4Rec and SASRec demonstrate strong\nperformance in Next Item Recommendation (NIR) tasks. However, applying these\narchitectures to Next-Basket Recommendation (NBR) tasks, which often involve\nhighly repetitive interactions, is challenging due to the vast number of\npossible item combinations in a basket. Moreover, frequency-based methods such\nas TIFU-KNN and UP-CF still demonstrate strong performance in NBR tasks,\nfrequently outperforming deep-learning approaches. This paper introduces\nSAFERec, a novel algorithm for NBR that enhances transformer-based\narchitectures from NIR by incorporating item frequency information,\nconsequently improving their applicability to NBR tasks. Extensive experiments\non multiple datasets show that SAFERec outperforms all other baselines,\nspecifically achieving an 8\\% improvement in Recall@10.\n",
