  "abstract": "  Assume $G$ is a bridgeless graph. A cycle cover of $G$ is a collection of\ncycles of $G$ such that each edge of $G$ is contained in at least one of the\ncycles. The length of a cycle cover of $G$ is the sum of the lengths of the\ncycles in the cover. The minimum length of a cycle cover of $G$ is denoted by\n$cc(G)$. It was proved independently by Alon and Tarsi and by Bermond, Jackson,\nand Jaeger that $cc(G)\\le \\frac{5}{3}m$ for every bridgeless graph $G$ with $m$\nedges. This remained the best-known upper bound for $cc(G)$ for 40 years. In\nthis paper, we prove that if $G$ is a bridgeless graph with $m$ edges and $n_2$\nvertices of degree $2$, then $cc(G) < \\frac{29}{18}m+ \\frac 1{18}n_2$. As a\nconsequence, we show that $cc(G) \\le \\frac 53 m - \\frac 1{42} \\log m$. The\nupper bound $ cc(G) < \\frac{29}{18}m \\approx 1.6111 m$ for bridgeless graphs\n$G$ of minimum degree at least 3 improves the previous known upper bound\n$1.6258m$. A key lemma used in the proof confirms Fan's conjecture that if $C$\nis a circuit of $G$ and $G/C$ admits a nowhere zero 4-flow, then $G$ admits a\n4-flow $f$ such that $E(G)-E(C)\\subseteq \\text{supp} (f)$ and\n$|\\textrm{supp}(f)\\cap E(C)|>\\frac{3}{4}|E(C)|$.\n",
