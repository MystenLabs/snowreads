Distinct from trends observed at\nlower redshifts, where most galaxies exhibit negative color gradients whereby\ngalaxy centers are redder than their outskirts, in high-redshift galaxies\npositive color gradients match or even outnumber negative color gradients. The\ncolor gradients principally reflect radial variations in stellar population\ninstead of dust reddening or contamination from active galactic nuclei. The\nsign and magnitude of the color profile depend systematically on the global\nproperties of the galaxy: positive color gradients, characteristic of centrally\nconcentrated star formation or outside-in growth, preferentially inhabit\ngalaxies of lower stellar mass, smaller size, and bluer spectral energy\ndistribution.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"l8G6AKjcYOpFu20snr6K9ptHzWp7JT0lzwUu8TYzUgo","pdfSize":"2580089"}
