  "abstract": "  Let $R$ be a ring (not necessarily a commutative ring) with identity. The\nclean graph $Cl(R)$ of a ring $R$ is a graph with vertices in the form of an\nordered pair $(e,u)$, where $e$ is an idempotent and $u$ is a unit of ring $R$,\nrespectively. Two distinct vertices $(e,u)$ and $(f,v)$ are adjacent in $Cl(R)$\nif and only if $ef=fe=0$ or $uv=vu=1$. In this study, we considered the induced\nsubgraph $Cl_2(R)$ of $Cl(R)$. We determined the Wiener index of $Cl_2(R)$, and\nwe showed $Cl_2(R)$ has a perfect matching. In addition, we determined the\nmatching number of $Cl_2(R)$ if $|U(R)|$ is not even.\n",
