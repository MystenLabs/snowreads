  "abstract": "  Cornish (2024) recently gave a general theory of neural network\nsymmetrisation in the abstract context of Markov categories. We give a\nhigh-level overview of these results, and their concrete implications for the\nsymmetrisation of deterministic functions and of Markov kernels.\n",
