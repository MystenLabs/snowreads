Fontaine has constructed a useful\nclassification of $p$-adic representations of $\\mathcal{G}_K$ in terms of\ncyclotomic $(\\varphi,\\Gamma)$-modules. Lately, interest has risen around a\ngeneralization of the theory of $(\\varphi,\\Gamma)$-modules, replacing the\ncyclotomic extension with an arbitrary infinitely ramified $p$-adic Lie\nextension. Computations from Berger suggest that locally analytic vectors\nshould provide such a generalization for any arbitrary infinitely ramified\n$p$-adic Lie extension, and this has been conjectured by Kedlaya.\n  In this paper, we focus on the case of $\\mathbf{Z}_p$-extensions, using\nrecent work of Berger-Rozensztajn and Porat on an integral version of locally\nanalytic vectors, and prove that Kedlaya's conjecture does not hold for\nanticyclotomic extensions. This also provide an example of an extension for\nwhich there is no overconvergent lift of its field of norms and for which there\nexist nontrivial higher locally analytic vectors\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"K2xuwBWSy-omV6LxvsonmHNYeur7ykgJUcXITtRp6Qw","pdfSize":"335027"}
