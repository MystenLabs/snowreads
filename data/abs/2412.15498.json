  "abstract": "  Suicidal ideation is a serious health problem affecting millions of people\nworldwide. Social networks provide information about these mental health\nproblems through users' emotional expressions. We propose a multilingual model\nleveraging transformer architectures like mBERT, XML-R, and mT5 to detect\nsuicidal text across posts in six languages - Spanish, English, German,\nCatalan, Portuguese and Italian. A Spanish suicide ideation tweet dataset was\ntranslated into five other languages using SeamlessM4T. Each model was\nfine-tuned on this multilingual data and evaluated across classification\nmetrics. Results showed mT5 achieving the best performance overall with F1\nscores above 85%, highlighting capabilities for cross-lingual transfer\nlearning. The English and Spanish translations also displayed high quality\nbased on perplexity. Our exploration underscores the importance of considering\nlinguistic diversity in developing automated multilingual tools to identify\nsuicidal risk. Limitations exist around semantic fidelity in translations and\nethical implications which provide guidance for future human-in-the-loop\nevaluations.\n",
