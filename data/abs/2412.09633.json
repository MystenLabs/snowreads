We\nestablish the algorithm and demonstrate its convergence, as well as its\nefficiency for a class of functions that can be expanded as exponential\nfunctions. We provide simulation results to validate our numerical results.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computer Science/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aByvlqq4_YmobnAK_0Sea6R43FbhggBOpCHqOnzJUng","pdfSize":"1104654"}
