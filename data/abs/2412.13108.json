In particular, we show that isolated divisors are well-behaved under\nmorphisms of varieties, and are closely related to isolated divisors on the\nStein factorization of the variety. We then restrict to the case of modular\ncurves $X_{H}$, and give precise conditions for mapping isolated points between\nmodular curves. Finally, we classify the isolated points with rational\n$j$-invariant on all modular curves of level 7, as well as the modular curves\n$X_{0}(n)$, the latter assuming a conjecture on images of Galois\nrepresentations of elliptic curves over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HnSHy_DY1UcD9vfVnDChkrzudi7qaAlclYj-3NY6DQ8","pdfSize":"919672"}
