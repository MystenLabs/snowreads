One major challenge is that errors cannot be quantified to\nvalidate predictions when ground truth is unknown. Validation is key to\nquantitative applications, especially using limited-bandwidth ultrasonic linear\ndetector arrays. Here, we propose a hybrid Bayesian convolutional neural\nnetwork (Hybrid-BCNN) to jointly predict PA image and segmentation with error\n(uncertainty) predictions. Each output pixel represents a probability\ndistribution where error can be quantified. The Hybrid-BCNN was trained with\nsimulated PA data and applied to both simulations and experiments. Due to the\nsparsity of PA images, segmentation focuses Hybrid-BCNN on minimizing the loss\nfunction in regions with PA signals for better predictions. The results show\nthat accurate PA segmentations and images are obtained, and error predictions\nare highly statistically correlated to actual errors. To leverage error\npredictions, confidence processing created PA images above a specific\nconfidence level.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fyuhVhJpChvjAzKatRtUt8TGuU2vOq758zY0d6JwBbU","pdfSize":"2073553","objectId":"0x73b9c09be8c922d526aaab66e83aa787da8efde0329c17ca222a3a6cdc627532","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
