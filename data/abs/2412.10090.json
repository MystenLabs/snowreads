In the present paper, we investigate the\ncodegree of the stable set polytope $P_G$ associated with a graph $G$.\nSpecifically, we establish the inequalities \\[ \\omega(G) + 1 \\leq {\\rm\ncodeg}(P_G) \\leq \\chi(G) + 1, \\] where $\\omega(G)$ and $\\chi(G)$ denote the\nclique number and the chromatic number of G, respectively. Furthermore, an\nexplicit formula for ${\\rm codeg}(P_G)$ is given when G is either a line graph\nor an $h$-perfect graph. Finally, as an application of these results, we\nprovide upper and lower bounds on the regularity of the toric ring associated\nwith $P_G$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yKJzThFoKTz9Qwpr-ugEPjzcAQsNLuvg9OIpqV3Ttvk","pdfSize":"121039"}
