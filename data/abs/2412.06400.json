Using the\nmeasured cross-section data for $e^+e^-\\to \\gamma X(3872)$ as a reference, we\ncalculate the cross sections for $e^+e^-\\to \\gamma \\chi_{c0}(2P)$ and\n$e^+e^-\\to \\gamma \\chi_{c2}(2P)$. Since the $\\chi_{c0}(2P)$ and $\\chi_{c2}(2P)$\nstates predominantly decay into $D\\bar{D}$ final states, we also predict the\ncorresponding $D\\bar{D}$ invariant mass spectrum for the $e^+e^-\\to \\gamma\nD\\bar{D}$ process. Our results indicate that $e^+e^-\\to \\gamma D\\bar{D}$ is an\nideal process for identifying the $\\chi_{c0}(2P)$ and $\\chi_{c2}(2P)$ states,\nanalogous to the $\\gamma\\gamma\\to D\\bar{D}$ and $B^+\\to D^+D^-K^+$ processes.\nThis study highlights the discovery potential of charmonium $2P$ states at\nBESIII and Belle II.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"ZqAKKlsp6CI4gNOzLAxyjY5VDxT3IBfD-VYqhQs7DI4","pdfSize":"504623"}
