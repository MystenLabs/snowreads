  "abstract": "  Recently, LLMs (Large Language Models) have been adapted for time series\nprediction with significant success in pattern recognition. However, the common\nbelief is that these models are not suitable for predicting financial market\nreturns, which are known to be almost random. We aim to challenge this\nmisconception through a counterexample. Specifically, we utilized the Chronos\nmodel from Ansari et al.(2024) and tested both pretrained configurations and\nfine-tuned supervised forecasts on the largest American single stocks using\ndata from Guijarro-Ordonnez et al.(2022). We constructed a long/short\nportfolio, and the performance simulation indicates that LLMs can in reality\nhandle time series that are nearly indistinguishable from noise, demonstrating\nan ability to identify inefficiencies amidst randomness and generate alpha.\nFinally, we compared these results with those of specialized models and smaller\ndeep learning models, highlighting significant room for improvement in LLM\nperformance to further enhance their predictive capabilities.\n",
