Among\nthese are spin-1 resonances. We investigate models containing\n$\\text{SU(2)}_L\\times \\text{SU(2)}_R$ as part of the unbroken subgroup in the\nnew strong sector. These models predict that there are two neutral and one\ncharged spin-1 resonances mixing sizably with the SM vector bosons. As a\nconsequence, these can be singly produced in Drell-Yan processes at the LHC. We\nexplore their rich LHC phenomenology and show that there are still viable\nscenarios consistent with existing LHC data where the masses of these states\ncan be as low as about 1.5 TeV.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Z5V2pmY367pWW7qrQ7cjr-HTwdcLraZ1pts0PR-6q1Y","pdfSize":"1738929"}
