The spectral properties of a sample correlation matrix\n$\\mathbf{C}$ and a sample covariance matrix $\\mathbf{S}$ are asymptotically\nequal whenever the population correlation matrix $\\mathbf{R}$ is bounded (El\nKaroui 2009). We demonstrate this also for general linear models for unbounded\n$\\mathbf{R}$, by examining the behavior of the singular values of\nmultiplicatively perturbed matrices. By this, we establish: Given a factor\nmodel of an idiosyncratic noise variance $\\sigma^2$ and a rank-$r$ factor\nloading matrix $\\mathbf{L}$ which rows all have common Euclidean norm $L$.\nThen, the $k$th largest eigenvalues $\\lambda_k$ $(1\\le k\\le N)$ of $\\mathbf{C}$\nsatisfy almost surely: (1) $\\lambda_r$ diverges, (2) $\\lambda_k/s_k^2\\to1/(L^2\n+ \\sigma^2)$ $(1 \\le k \\le r)$ for the $k$th largest singular value $s_k$ of\n$\\mathbf{L}$, and (3) $\\lambda_{r + 1}\\to(1-\\rho)(1+\\sqrt{c})^2$ for $\\rho :=\nL^2/(L^2 + \\sigma^2)$. Whenever $s_r$ is much larger than $\\sqrt{\\log N}$, then\nbroken-stick rule (Frontier 1976, Jackson 1993), which estimates\n$\\mathrm{rank}\\, \\mathbf{L}$ by a random partition (Holst 1980) of $[0,\\,1]$,\ntends to $r$ (a.s.). We also provide a natural factor model where the rule\ntends to \"essential rank\" of $\\mathbf{L}$ (a.s.) which is smaller than\n$\\mathrm{rank}\\, \\mathbf{L}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CStFeiYdSglpPQJxNw7CjO2S_HrYkanPcGDy512iTH8","pdfSize":"653819"}
