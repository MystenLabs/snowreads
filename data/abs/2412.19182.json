Phys. 54:14). The essay aims to\nrespond to such objections and to show once again that the theorem proved in\nour paper is correct, and therefore true - contrary to Gao's claims.\nPhilosophical consequences of this fact are briefly discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"mCQZCwfiOysINTmmu7AHjB9yDpEOK-SzTBYunpTFW_c","pdfSize":"150153"}
