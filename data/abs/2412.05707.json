  "abstract": "  Detecting road obstacles is essential for autonomous vehicles to navigate\ndynamic and complex traffic environments safely. Current road obstacle\ndetection methods typically assign a score to each pixel and apply a threshold\nto generate final predictions. However, selecting an appropriate threshold is\nchallenging, and the per-pixel classification approach often leads to\nfragmented predictions with numerous false positives. In this work, we propose\na novel method that leverages segment-level features from visual foundation\nmodels and likelihood ratios to predict road obstacles directly. By focusing on\nsegments rather than individual pixels, our approach enhances detection\naccuracy, reduces false positives, and offers increased robustness to scene\nvariability. We benchmark our approach against existing methods on the\nRoadObstacle and LostAndFound datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance\nwithout needing a predefined threshold.\n",
