This framework can be\nutilized by power system operators to generate default bids for storage or to\nbenchmark market power in bids submitted by storage participants. We derive a\ntheoretical framework based on a two-stage chance-constrained formulation which\nsystematically incorporates system balance constraints and uncertainty\nconsiderations. We present tractable reformulations for the joint chance\nconstraints. Analytical results show that the storage opportunity cost is\nconvex and increases with greater net load uncertainty. We also show that the\nstorage opportunity prices are bounded and are linearly coupled with future\nenergy and reserve prices. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\napproach on an ISO-NE test system and compare it with a price-taker storage\nprofit-maximizing bidding model. Simulation results show that the proposed\nmarket design reduces electricity payments by an average of 17.4% and system\ncosts by 3.9% while reducing storage's profit margins, and these reductions\nscale up with the renewable and storage capacity.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"51bMZUKMkQEs5nA3qzGR7hk_5J5QosH27S-bNa4a7Iw","pdfSize":"849303"}
