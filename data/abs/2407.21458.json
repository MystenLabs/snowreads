These waves can include laser\nlight, polaritons, acoustic waves, and sliding density waves, whose speed may\nvary widely. Since these waves are periodic in both space and time, the\nelectrons in the materials form Floquet-Bloch states when influenced by the\nwaves. We investigate band engineering by these waves, using three-dimensional\n(3D) Dirac electrons in circularly polarized laser wave as a case study. We\nclassify the fields by their speed into time, light and space-like waves, and\nfind that the electronic states are distinctive in the three cases. We\ndemonstrate phase transitions of the electronic bands and discover emergent\nFloquet Weyl bands, which potentially become Type-II in the vicinity of the\ntransition. The effect of Floquet band engineering is enhanced by Lorentz\ncontraction, which is maximized when the wave speed approaches the Fermi\nvelocity. Additionally, we discuss the geometric nature of the response\ncurrents.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"apZ3S65fLiv1VHr2TqigKHueq4t2nLD5Avjr22pByCM","pdfSize":"13650702","objectId":"0x04e845ca7656b75f0316b011c381d4633cf3b004cce0c1e78caa6717dd0d96d5","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
