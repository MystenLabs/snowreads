Also, we describe the\nsandpile group of a sandpile graph $E$ via archimedean classes of\n$\\text{SP}(E)$, and prove that all maximal subgroups of $\\text{SP}(E)$ are\nexactly the Grothendieck groups of these archimedean classes. Finally, we give\nthe structure of the Leavitt path algebra $L_{K}(E)$ of a sandpile graph $E$\nvia a finite chain of graded ideals being invariant under every graded\nautomorphism of $L_{K}(E)$, and completely describe the structure of $L_{K}(E)$\nsuch that the lattice of all idempotents of $\\text{SP}(E)$ is a chain.\nConsequently, we completely describe the structure of the weighted Leavitt path\nalgebra of a sandpile graph $E$ such that $\\text{SP}(E)$ has exactly two\nidempotents.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JySz8rfyi8PDiOMkmg2-4QgoT8kUApAnj4zG72rH_SQ","pdfSize":"333603"}
