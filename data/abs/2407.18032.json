Although cages display isotropic evolution\nin the laboratory frame, we observe a striking anisotropy when analyzed in the\ndisplacement frame of the caged particles. Moreover, our findings reveal that\nparticles in specific but distinct regions of the cage predominantly contribute\nto either its persistence or relaxation. Thus, our study provides a\ncoarse-grained microscopic picture of the structural relaxation of these fluids\nthrough cage evolution, which has broader implications for the flow and phase\nbehavior of complex fluids in confined geometry.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YVxTeJKxvPeZNUSSmUb9suCGlaBQYwIWxgWjrMTMFQ4","pdfSize":"5204826"}
