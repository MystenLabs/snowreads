  "abstract": "  In optical diffraction tomography (ODT), a sample's 3D refractive-index (RI)\nis often reconstructed after illuminating it from multiple angles, with the\nassumption that the sample remains static throughout data collection. When the\nsample undergoes dynamic motion during this data-collection process,\nsignificant artifacts and distortions compromise the fidelity of the\nreconstructed images. In this study, we develop a space-time inverse-scattering\ntechnique for ODT that compensates for the translational motion of\nmultiple-scattering samples during data collection. Our approach involves\nformulating a joint optimization problem to simultaneously estimate a\nscattering sample's translational position at each measurement and its\nmotion-corrected 3D RI distribution. Experimental results demonstrate the\ntechnique's effectiveness, yielding reconstructions with reduced artifacts,\nenhanced spatial resolution, and improved quantitative accuracy for samples\nundergoing continuous translational motion during imaging.\n",
