  "abstract": "  Four-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes have been central to recent\ndevelopments in infrared physics. Gravitational waves reaching the asymptotic\nboundary reveal an infinite-dimensional symmetry group known as the\nBondi--Metzner--Sachs (BMS) group. The vacuum structure breaks this symmetry,\ngiving rise to Goldstone modes that play a pivotal role in the analysis of\nscattering amplitudes. However, these modes must be added to the phase space of\nthe metric formulation. In this work, we explore an alternative formulation of\ngeneral relativity, teleparallel gravity, which is dynamically equivalent to\nthe standard metric description in the bulk. This framework relies on a tetrad\nfield to encode the gravitational degrees of freedom and a flat connection to\nrepresent inertial effects. Leveraging this decomposition, we propose a novel\nencoding of the Goldstone modes within the flat connection. We examine the\nimplications of this approach in the covariant phase space framework, focusing\non the symplectic potential and its connection to the Wald--Zoupas\nprescription.\n",
