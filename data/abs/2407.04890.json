The investigation focus on the role\nof bulk viscosity in understanding the universe's accelerated expansion.\nSpecifically, a bulk viscous matter-dominated cosmological model is considered,\nwith the bulk viscosity coefficient expressed as $\\zeta= \\zeta_0 \\rho H^{-1} +\n\\zeta_1 H $. We consider the power law $f(Q)$ function $f(Q)=\\alpha Q^n $,\nwhere $\\alpha$ and $n$ are arbitrary constants and derive the analytical\nsolutions for the field equations corresponding to a flat FLRW metric.\nSubsequently, we used the combined Cosmic Chronometers (CC)+Pantheon+SH0ES\nsample to estimate the free parameters of the obtained analytic solution. We\nconduct Bayesian statistical analysis to estimate the posterior probability by\nemploying the likelihood function and the MCMC random sampling technique, along\nwith the AIC and BIC statistical assessment criteria. In addition, we explore\nthe evolutionary behavior of significant cosmological parameters. The effective\nequation of state (EOS) parameter predicts the accelerating behavior of the\ncosmic expansion phase. Further, by the statefinder and $Om(z)$ diagnostic\ntest, we found that our viscous model favors quintessence-type behavior and can\nsuccessfully describe the late-time scenario.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PH7oAP9nTFJAa9BUWF-AQMhn5UrovllWJbkcxGyH9Y0","pdfSize":"701762"}
