There are, however, often opportunities to learn\nstronger models by being more data-efficient. To achieve this, one can leverage\nknowledge about the data from which the soft sensor is learned. Taking\nadvantage of properties frequently possessed by industrial data, we introduce a\ndeep latent variable model for semi-supervised multi-unit soft sensing. This\nhierarchical, generative model is able to jointly model different units, as\nwell as learning from both labeled and unlabeled data.\n  An empirical study of multi-unit soft sensing is conducted using two\ndatasets: a synthetic dataset of single-phase fluid flow, and a large, real\ndataset of multi-phase flow in oil and gas wells. We show that by combining\nsemi-supervised and multi-task learning, the proposed model achieves superior\nresults, outperforming current leading methods for this soft sensing problem.\nWe also show that when a model has been trained on a multi-unit dataset, it may\nbe finetuned to previously unseen units using only a handful of data points. In\nthis finetuning procedure, unlabeled data improve soft sensor performance;\nremarkably, this is true even when no labeled data are available.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"6-vOaieyGfoV-T43Ujku7sa9m5XgD2yRfY08qzLSJ-Q","pdfSize":"839050"}
