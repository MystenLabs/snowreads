  "abstract": "  LPWAN service's inexpensive cost and long range capabilities make it a\npromising addition and countless satellite companies have started taking\nadvantage of this technology to connect IoT users across the globe. However,\nLEO satellites have the unique challenge of using rechargeable batteries and\ngreen solar energy to power their components. LPWAN technology is not optimized\nto maximize battery lifespan of network nodes. By incorporating a MAC protocol\nthat maximizes node the battery lifespan across the network, we can reduce\nbattery waste and usage of scarce Earth resources to develop satellite\nbatteries.\n",
