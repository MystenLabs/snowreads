Here we derive an\nanalytical model of the system, supported by experimental results. We predict\nthe direction of rotation, and explain why the device is so easy to operate,\neven without fine control of the various parameters. The potential importance\nof the vertical displacement of the finger exerting the perturbation force is\nalso highlighted. We finally discuss similarities between the mechanical system\ndescribed here and the optical effect of birefringence.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education","Physics/Classical Physics","Physics/Popular Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"u5tiuMdpKGOHuGuv-DzjYedtO1GoDBeHkJoe1Yrk82c","pdfSize":"924651"}
