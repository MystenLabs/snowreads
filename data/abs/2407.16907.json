How to effectively use these data has always been a key issue in the\nfield of educational data mining. In this work, a machine learning model based\non Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) was used to conduct an in-depth\nanalysis of educational big data to evaluate student performance. The LSTM\nmodel efficiently processes time series data, allowing us to capture\ntime-dependent and long-term trends in students' learning activities. This\napproach is particularly useful for analyzing student progress, engagement, and\nother behavioral patterns to support personalized education. In an experimental\nanalysis, we verified the effectiveness of the deep learning method in\npredicting student performance by comparing the performance of different\nmodels. Strict cross-validation techniques are used to ensure the accuracy and\ngeneralization of experimental results.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"5qEVBQRpNYyTXJyfIcV_S1n9yyoAx0bVGZRqiPxJz6E","pdfSize":"1250814"}
