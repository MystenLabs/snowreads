By exploiting the optimal solution of the game involving\ntwo pursuers, conditions are derived under which the multi-pursuer game becomes\nequivalent to the two-pursuer one. This opens the possibility of designing a\nnumber of pursuit strategies in which the pursuers first try to enforce the\nsatisfaction of the aforementioned condition and then switch to a two-pursuer\ngame as soon as it is verified. The contribution is useful in two ways. First,\nnew winning pursuit strategies can be devised starting from simple plans, such\nas pure pursuit. Moreover, the performance of existing pursuit strategies, like\nthose based on Voronoi partitions, can be significantly improved by resorting\nto the corresponding switching version.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gfGANtvLXFbHL8uxcJvP5ZmPq2dYtwFMHRSzq7YriRE","pdfSize":"756905","objectId":"0x611e1a5902a6822772a6d3262189fd0789a55ffffc1351d2606bf7f7dec1a6b3","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
