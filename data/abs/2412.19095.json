  "abstract": "  Given a graph $G$, the Laplacian matrix of $G$, $L(G)$ is the difference of\nthe adjacency matrix $A(G)$ and $\\text{Deg}(G)$, where $\\text{Deg}(G)$ is the\ndiagonal matrix of vertex degrees.\n  The distance Laplacian matrix $D^L({G})$ is the difference of the\ntransmission matrix of $G$ and the distance matrix of $G$.\n  In the given paper, we first obtain the Laplacian and distance Laplacian\nspectrum of generalized fan graphs.\n  We then introduce a new graph class which is denoted by\n$\\mathcal{NC}(F_{m,n})$. Finally, we determine the Laplacian spectrum and the\ndistance Laplacian spectrum of $\\mathcal{NC}(F_{m,n})$.\n",
