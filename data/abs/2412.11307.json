  "abstract": "  Quantum Interior Point Methods (QIPMs) have been attracting significant\ninterests recently due to their potential of solving optimization problems\nsubstantially faster than state-of-the-art conventional algorithms. In general,\nQIPMs use Quantum Linear System Algorithms (QLSAs) to substitute classical\nlinear system solvers. However, the performance of QLSAs depends on the\ncondition numbers of the linear systems, which are typically proportional to\nthe square of the reciprocal of the duality gap in QIPMs. To improve\nconditioning, a preconditioned inexact infeasible QIPM (II-QIPM) based on\noptimal partition estimation is developed in this work. We improve the\ncondition number of the linear systems in II-QIPMs from quadratic dependence on\nthe reciprocal of the duality gap to linear, and obtain better dependence with\nrespect to the accuracy when compared to other II-QIPMs. Our method also\nattains better dependence with respect to the dimension when compared to other\ninexact infeasible Interior Point Methods.\n",
