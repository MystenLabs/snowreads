SiamTST integrates a Siamese network with attention,\nchannel-independent patching, and normalization techniques to achieve superior\nperformance. Evaluated on a real-world industrial telecommunication dataset,\nSiamTST demonstrates significant improvements in forecasting accuracy over\nexisting methods. Notably, a simple linear network also shows competitive\nperformance, achieving the second-best results, just behind SiamTST.
