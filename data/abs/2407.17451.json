Embracing Bluesky's principles of open-source and open-data, we\npresent the first collection of the temporal dynamics of user-driven social\ninteractions. BlueTempNet integrates multiple types of networks into a single\nmulti-network, including user-to-user interactions (following and blocking\nusers) and user-to-community interactions (creating and joining communities).\nCommunities are user-formed groups in custom Feeds, where users subscribe to\nposts aligned with their interests. Following Bluesky's public data policy, we\ncollect existing Bluesky Feeds, including the users who liked and generated\nthese Feeds, and provide tools to gather users' social interactions within a\ndate range. This data-collection strategy captures past user behaviors and\nsupports the future data collection of user behavior.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"YGNRQRmrlXw9QLh8gFLRZRl_UL4gfCDyfIBUoweaUik","pdfSize":"5362332","objectId":"0x03556892113c2a49e9d6363dc742959924303b5ce0314dc0e95e0dbc12615cda","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
