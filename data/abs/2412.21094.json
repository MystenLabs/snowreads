The\nquotient space $\\mathbb{C}/\\mathbb{Z}$, called `The flat cylinder', is\nrepresented by the vertical strip $[0,1)\\times \\mathbb{R}$, which tiles ${C}$\nby ${Z}$-translations and is therefore a fundamental domain for\n$\\mathbb{C}/\\mathbb{Z}$. Our main result gives a complete characterization of\nthe sets $Z\\subset \\Lambda \\left( \\mathbb{Z}\\right) $ that are sets of sampling\nor interpolation, in terms of concepts of upper and lower Beurling densities, $\nD^{+}(Z)$ and $D^{-}(Z)$, adapted to the geometry of $\\mathbb{C}/\\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe critical `Nyquist density' is the real number $\\frac{\\alpha }{\\pi }$,\nmeaning that the condition $D^{-}(Z)>\\frac{\\alpha }{\\pi }$ characterizes sets\nof sampling, while the condition $D^{+}(Z)<\\frac{\\alpha }{\\pi }$ characterizes\nsets of interpolation. The results can be reframed as a complete\ncharacterization of Gabor frames and Riesz basic sequences (given by arbitrary\ndiscrete sets in $Z\\subset \\Lambda \\left( \\mathbb{Z}\\right) $), with\ntime-periodized Gaussian windows (theta-Gaussian), for spaces of functions $f$,\nmeasurable in $\\mathbb{R}$, square-integrable in $(0,1)$, and quasi-periodic\nwith respect to integer translations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GmL6TbXqRp3wzXfeeJ-G37p32bFGV2Bddk8_EetbrI4","pdfSize":"314691"}
