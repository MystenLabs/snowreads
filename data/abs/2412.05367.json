Using a perfect sampling scheme based on an underlying\ndeterminantal point process, we compute the Stabilizer R\\'enyi Entropies (SREs)\nfor systems with hundreds of qubits. Benchmarking on random Gaussian states\nwith and without particle conservation, we reveal an extensive leading behavior\nequal to that of Haar random states, with logarithmic subleading corrections.\nWe support these findings with analytical calculations for a set of related\nquantities, the participation entropies in the computational (or Fock) basis,\nfor which we derive an exact formula. We also investigate the time evolution of\nmagic in a random unitary circuit with Gaussian gates, observing that it\nconverges in a time that scales logarithmically with the system size. Applying\nthe sampling algorithm to a two-dimensional free-fermionic topological model,\nwe uncover a sharp transition in magic at the phase boundaries, highlighting\nthe power of our approach in exploring different phases of quantum many-body\nsystems, even in higher dimensions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BDFCfp5HnNxhCWDKhE3BbQevFLST573K9e-poKydCu4","pdfSize":"1179396"}
