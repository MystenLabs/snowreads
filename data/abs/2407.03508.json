We consider a simple model of EDE that is constant up to a\ncritical time. After this critical time, the EDE transitions into either a\nradiation component that interacts with the electromagnetic plasma, a dark\nradiation component that is uncoupled from the plasma, or kination that is also\nuncoupled. We use measured values of the abundances and $N_{\\rm eff}$ as\ndetermined by CMB observations to establish limits on the input parameters of\nthis EDE model. In addition, we explore how those parameters are correlated\nwith BBN inputs; the baryon to photon ratio $\\eta_b$, neutron lifetime\n$\\tau_n$, and number of neutrinos $N_\\nu$. Finally, we study whether this setup\ncan alleviate the tension introduced by recent measurements of the primordial\nhelium abundance.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OP1JEzUEfkZofHYqakppBxilPvIcTlAQvfow5mwX7W8","pdfSize":"948734"}
