Our calculations and experimental results are\nconsistent with the modification of the low energy magnetic excitations in\nH$_3$LiIr$_2$O$_6$ only during illumination by the laser pulse, consistent with\nthe Floquet engineering of the exchange interactions. However, the penetration\nlength mismatch between the X-ray probe and laser pump and the intrinsic\ncomplexity of Kitaev magnets prevented us from unequivocally extracting towards\nwhich ground H$_3$LiIr$_2$O$_6$ was driven. We outline possible solutions to\nthese challenges for Floquet stabilization and observation of the Kitaev\nQuantum Spin Liquid limit by RIXS.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xW87gI5PvKVYaGH-mLH2BRJMFhQkq7P-k08SXcpemgE","pdfSize":"3423931"}
