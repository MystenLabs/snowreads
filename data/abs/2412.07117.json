  "abstract": "  In 1958, Anderson proposed a new insulating mechanism in random lattices, now\nknown as Anderson localization. It has been shown that a metal-insulating\ntransition occurs in three dimensions, and that one-dimensional disordered\nsystems can be solved exactly to show strong localization regardless of the\nstrength of disorders. Meanwhile, the two-dimensional case was known to be\nlocalizing from a scaling argument. Here, we report that there exists a\nmobility edge in certain random potentials which separate the extended-like\nstates from short-ranged localized states. We further observe that the location\nof the mobility edge depends on the typical wavelength of the potential, and\nthat the localization length are are related to the energy of an eigenstate.\nFinally, we apply a renormalization group theory to explain the localization\neffects and the existence of mobility edge and propose an experimental scheme\nto verify the mobility edge in photonic crystals.\n",
