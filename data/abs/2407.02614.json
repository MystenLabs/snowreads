Current learning practices heavily rely on 2D atlases and\npractice on peers, which are notably less intuitive and pose risks,\nparticularly in sensitive areas such as the eyes. To address these challenges,\nwe introduce AcuVR, a Virtual Reality (VR) based system designed to add a layer\nof interactivity and realism. This innovation aims to reduce the risks\nassociated with practicing acupuncture techniques while offering more effective\nlearning strategies. Furthermore, AcuVR incorporates medical imaging and\nstandardized anatomy models, enabling the simulation of customized acupuncture\nscenarios. This feature represents a significant advancement beyond the\nlimitations of conventional resources such as atlases and textbooks,\nfacilitating a more immersive and personalized learning experience. The\nevaluation study with eight acupuncture students and practitioners revealed\nhigh participant satisfaction and pointed to the effectiveness and potential of\nAcuVR as a valuable addition to acupuncture training.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"33_FMvQtvmfOIsG_C1NNXgx87BpGtXoS-NHoI_Nr27E","pdfSize":"8001418"}
