{"id":"2407.08378","title":"Flame spread over thin circular PMMA rods","authors":"Manu B V, Amit Kumar","authorsParsed":[["B","Manu","V"],["Kumar","Amit",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2024 10:38:23 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-12","timestamp":1720694303000,"abstract":"  This article presents a series of opposed flow flame spread experiments,\nconducted using cast cylindrical PMMA (acrylic) rods, 80 mm long and of\ndiameters 1 mm and 0.5 mm, in normal gravity and microgravity environments. The\nexperiments are primarily conducted for molar oxygen levels of 21%, 23% and 40%\nat 1 atmosphere pressure and opposed flow speed ranging from 0 cm/s to 25 cm/s.\nExperiments are also conducted in normal gravity for oxygen levels 21% to 60%\nto study the effect of oxygen level. At near ambient oxygen levels, the flame\nshape in microgravity resembles a mushroom and there are fluctuations at the\nleading edge due to sporadic fuel jets emanating from bursting bubbles at the\nfuel surface. The flame spreads faster in microgravity, which is determined to\nbe due to increased preheat length. Preheat length is measured for flame\nspreading over 1 mm diameter fuel rod under no flow condition using fine\nthermocouples and is found to be 0.98 cm in microgravity and 0.34 cm in normal\ngravity. It is found that for scaling analysis, including Stefan flow velocity\nin the definition of reference velocity results in a reasonable estimate of the\npreheat length of a flame spreading in quiescent microgravity environment. At\nhigh oxygen levels (> 35%) the flame becomes turbulent and spreads at nearly\nthe same rate in normal gravity and microgravity environments and the flame\nspread rates are not affected by external flow speed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"HuyO6iRWIj6BznHjvL2x8f8CFDzddDwIBi1XU76uEzc","pdfSize":"1933522"}
