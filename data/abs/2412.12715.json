  "abstract": "  Radial drift of icy pebbles can have a large impact on the chemistry of the\ninner regions of protoplanetary disks. Compact dust disks ($\\lesssim$50 au) are\nsuggested to have a higher (cold) H$_2$O flux than more extended disks, likely\ndue to efficient radial drift bringing H$_2$O-rich material to the inner disk,\nwhere it can be observed with JWST. We present JWST MIRI/MRS observations of\nthe disk CX Tau taken as a part of the Mid-INfrared Disk Survey (MINDS) GTO\nprogram, a prime example of a drift-dominated disk. This compact disk seems\npeculiar: the source possesses a bright CO$_2$ feature instead of the bright\nH$_2$O expected based on its efficient radial drift. We aim to provide an\nexplanation for this finding. We detect molecular emission from H$_2$O,\n$^{12}$CO$_2$, $^{13}$CO$_2$, C$_2$H$_2$, HCN, and OH in this disk, and even\ndemonstrate a potential detection of CO$^{18}$O. Analysis of the $^{12}$CO$_2$\nand $^{13}$CO$_2$ emission shows the former to be tracing a temperature of\n$\\sim$450 K, whereas the $^{13}$CO$_2$ traces a significantly colder\ntemperature ($\\sim$200 K). H$_2$O is also securely detected both at shorter and\nlonger wavelengths, tracing a similar temperature of $\\sim$500-600 K as the\nCO$_2$ emission. We also find evidence for a colder, $\\sim$200 K H$_2$O\ncomponent at longer wavelengths, which is in line with this disk having strong\nradial drift. The cold $^{13}$CO$_2$ and H$_2$O emission indicate that radial\ndrift of ices likely plays an important role in setting the chemistry of the\ninner disk of CX Tau. Potentially, the H$_2$O-rich gas has already advected\nonto the central star, which is now followed by an enhancement of comparatively\nCO$_2$-rich gas reaching the inner disk, explaining the enhancement of CO$_2$\nemission in CX Tau. The comparatively weaker H$_2$O emission can be explained\nby the source's low accretion luminosity. (abridged)\n",
