  "abstract": "  This paper demonstrates that Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation\n(PBSMT) can outperform Transformer-based Neural Machine Translation (NMT) in\nmoderate-resource scenarios, specifically for structurally similar languages,\nlike the Persian-Hindi pair. Despite the Transformer architecture's typical\npreference for large parallel corpora, our results show that PBSMT achieves a\nBLEU score of 66.32, significantly exceeding the Transformer-NMT score of 53.7\non the same dataset. Additionally, we explore variations of the SMT\narchitecture, including training on Romanized text and modifying the word order\nof Persian sentences to match the left-to-right (LTR) structure of Hindi. Our\nfindings highlight the importance of choosing the right architecture based on\nlanguage pair characteristics and advocate for SMT as a high-performing\nalternative, even in contexts commonly dominated by NMT.\n",
