In\nparticular, under the generalised Riemann hypothesis, we establish several\ninstances supporting the conjecture and extending the works of\nIwaniec-Luo-Sarnak and many others. For applications, we obtain an upper bound\nfor the average order of $L$-functions of Hilbert modular forms at\n$s=\\frac{1}{2}$ as well as a positive proportion of non-vanishing of certain\nRankin-Selberg $L$-functions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hbunNROEJ_utcKHIOofHA-xhdfVqvtz-GU5AKVG9Qhc","pdfSize":"331124"}
