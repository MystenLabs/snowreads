To do so, we present Graph Embodiment\nTransformer (GET), a transformer model that leverages the embodiment graph\nconnectivity as a learned structural bias in the attention mechanism. We use\nbehavior cloning to distill demonstration data from embodiment-specific expert\npolicies into an embodiment-aware GET model that conditions on the hardware\nconfiguration of the robot to make control decisions. We conduct a case study\non a dexterous in-hand object rotation task using different configurations of a\nfour-fingered robot hand with joints removed and with link length extensions.\nUsing the GET model along with a self-modeling loss enables GET-Zero to\nzero-shot generalize to unseen variation in graph structure and link length,\nyielding a 20% improvement over baseline methods.
