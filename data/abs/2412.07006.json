We based our\n$^\\text{23}\\text{Na}$ MRF implementation on a 3D FLORET sequence with 23\nradiofrequency pulses. To capture the complex spin\n${\\frac{\\text{3}}{\\text{2}}}$ dynamics of the $^\\text{23}\\text{Na}$ nucleus,\nthe fingerprint dictionary was simulated using the irreducible spherical tensor\noperators formalism. The dictionary contained 831,512 entries covering a wide\nrange of $\\text{T}_\\text{1}$, $\\text{T}_\\text{2,long}^{*}$,\n$\\text{T}_\\text{2,short}^{*}$, $\\Delta\\text{B}_\\text{1}^{+}$ factor and\n$\\Delta\\text{f}_\\text{0}$ parameters. Fingerprint matching was performed using\nthe Pearson correlation and the resulting relaxation maps were weighted with a\nsubset of the highest correlation coefficients corresponding to signal matches\nfor each voxel. Our $^\\text{23}\\text{Na}$ MRF method was compared against\nreference methods in a 7-compartment phantom, and applied in brain in five\nhealthy volunteers at 7 T. In phantoms, $^\\text{23}\\text{Na}$ MRF produced\nvalues comparable to those obtained with reference methods. Average sodium\nrelaxation time values in cerebrospinal fluid, gray matter and white matter\nacross five healthy volunteers were in good agreement with values previously\nreported in the literature.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"t1eyeiPBGEpmm8d0r7SMaiBlr0kfzLVY0FlMf1oADL4","pdfSize":"24233763"}
