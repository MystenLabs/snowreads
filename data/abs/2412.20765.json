  "abstract": "  The interplay between symmetry, entanglement and correlation is an\ninteresting and important topic in quantum many-body physics. Within the\nframework of matrix product states, in this paper we study the minimal\nentanglement and correlation enforced by the $SO(3)$ spin rotation symmetry and\nlattice translation symmetry in a quantum spin-$J$ chain, with $J$ a positive\ninteger. When neither symmetry is spontaneously broken, for a sufficiently long\nsegment in a sufficiently large closed chain, we find that the minimal\nR\\'enyi-$\\alpha$ entropy compatible with these symmetries is $\\min\\{\n-\\frac{2}{\\alpha-1}\\ln(\\frac{1}{2^\\alpha}({1+\\frac{1}{(2J+1)^{\\alpha-1}}})),\n2\\ln(J+1) \\}$, for any $\\alpha\\in\\mathbb{R}^+$. In an infinitely long open\nchain with such symmetries, for any $\\alpha\\in\\mathbb{R}^+$ the minimal\nR\\'enyi-$\\alpha$ entropy of half of the system is $\\min\\{\n-\\frac{1}{\\alpha-1}\\ln(\\frac{1}{2^\\alpha}({1+\\frac{1}{(2J+1)^{\\alpha-1}}})),\n\\ln(J+1) \\}$. When $\\alpha\\rightarrow 1$, these lower bounds give the\nsymmetry-enforced minimal von Neumann entropies in these setups. Moreover, we\nshow that no state in a quantum spin-$J$ chain with these symmetries can have a\nvanishing correlation length. Interestingly, the states with the minimal\nentanglement may not be a state with the minimal correlation length.\n",
