  "abstract": "  This work introduces a novel rank-based test for comparing yield quality\ndistributions across multiple spatially distributed populations while\naccounting for spatial dependence. Traditional methods often fail to address\nthe challenges posed by spatial correlation and heterogeneity, leading to\nunreliable conclusions. The proposed test integrates kernel smoothing with\nspatially weighted cumulative distribution function (CDF) estimation to ensure\nrobustness against outliers and deviations from distributional assumptions. A\ntest statistic is derived by aggregating squared differences between smoothed\nCDFs, and its asymptotic properties are established under the null hypothesis,\ndemonstrating convergence to a weighted sum of chi-squared random variables.\nPractical implementation relies on resampling techniques such as permutation\ntests and spatial bootstrap methods to approximate the null distribution. The\ntest is consistent under alternatives, making it an effective tool for\nanalyzing spatially dependent data in fields such as environmental monitoring\nand agricultural research. Extensions to multivariate and spatio-temporal\napplications are suggested for future work.\n",
