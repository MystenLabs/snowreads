Due to the nonstandard\ninteractions, different types of triple products in the cross section may\nappear. We consider several experiments in which mixed products built of the\nrecoil electron polarization and two other vector quantities (incoming neutrino\nmomentum, its polarization, polarization of the electron target and outgoing\nelectron momentum) can be identified. The observation of these effects would\nunambiguously indicate noninvariance under time reversal and the presence of\nexotic interactions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"9DSYY9C_eDcFw4GIoB8uvSRIYvgijtbSq0r9KbW7Mzk","pdfSize":"412221"}
