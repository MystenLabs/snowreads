The transmission condition specifies that the jump in the normal\nderivative of the acoustic field is proportional to its second time derivative,\nconvoluted in time with a sinusoidal kernel. This kernel has a period\ndetermined by the common subwavelength resonance (specifically, the Minnaert\nresonance in this case). This dispersive transmission condition can also be\ninterpreted as a Dirac-like surface potential that is convoluted in the time\ndomain and spatially supported on the specified hypersurface. We highlight the\nfollowing features: 1. High resonance regime: When the common resonance is\nlarge, the surface behaves as fully transparent, permitting complete\ntransmission of the acoustic field. 2. Moderate resonance regime: For moderate\nresonance values, the surface acts as a screen with memory effects, capturing\nthe dispersive behavior induced by the resonance. 3. Low resonance regime: When\nthe common resonance is small, the surface functions as a partial reflective\n(or partial transmissive) screen with no memory effect.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BurGtR_mlIpCseZ4ddWi8Dpib_x40_Q1-5-ao-xZrq0","pdfSize":"310424"}
