To address this problem, we propose a Cooperative SQL\nGeneration framework based on Multi-functional Agents (CSMA) through\ninformation interaction among large language model (LLM) based agents who own\npart of the database schema seperately. Inspired by the collaboration in human\nteamwork, CSMA consists of three stages: 1) Question-related schema collection,\n2) Question-corresponding SQL query generation, and 3) SQL query correctness\ncheck. In the first stage, agents analyze their respective schema and\ncommunicate with each other to collect the schema information relevant to the\nquestion. In the second stage, agents try to generate the corresponding SQL\nquery for the question using the collected information. In the third stage,\nagents check if the SQL query is created correctly according to their known\ninformation. This interaction-based method makes the question-relevant part of\ndatabase schema from each agent to be used for SQL generation and check.\nExperiments on the Spider and Bird benckmark demonstrate that CSMA achieves a\nhigh performance level comparable to the state-of-the-arts, meanwhile holding\nthe private data in these individual agents.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RNanvP51kzmgXXminLgHNRwwxN6KThpsM50o_8wFABM","pdfSize":"769694"}
