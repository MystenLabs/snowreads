Generally speaking, multivariate ($n \\geq 2$)\npolynomial matrices and their Smith forms may not be equivalent. However, under\ncertain specific condition, we derive the necessary and sufficient condition\nfor their equivalence. Let $F\\in K[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]^{l\\times m}$ be of rank $r$,\n$d_r(F)\\in K[x_1]$ be the greatest common divisor of all the $r\\times r$ minors\nof $F$, where $K$ is a field, $x_1,\\ldots,x_n$ are variables and $1 \\leq r \\leq\n\\min\\{l,m\\}$. Our key findings reveal the result: $F$ is equivalent to its\nSmith form if and only if all the $i\\times i$ reduced minors of $F$ generate\n$K[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]$ for $i=1,\\ldots,r$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Symbolic Computation","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2pSg0fExW0SLc9u840h58c9Oy6VqsffKElN9s_DOKPs","pdfSize":"225403"}
