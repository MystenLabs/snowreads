  "abstract": "  A free Steiner quasigroup is a free object in the variety of Steiner\nquasigroups. Free Steiner quasigroups are characterised by the existence of a\nlevelled construction that starts with a free base - that is, a set of elements\nnone of which is a product of the others, and which generate the quasigroup.\nThen each element in a free Steiner quasigroup $M$ can be obtained as a term on\nthe free base. We characterise homomorphisms between substructures of a free\nSteiner quasigroup where one generator is replaced by a term in the original\ngenerators. The characterisation depends on certain synctactic properties of\nthe term in question.\n",
