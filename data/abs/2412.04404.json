Many algorithms exist for\nAutoFE, but very few approaches exist for the federated learning (FL) setting\nwhere data is gathered across many clients and is not shared between clients or\na central server. We introduce AutoFE algorithms for the horizontal, vertical,\nand hybrid FL settings, which differ in how the data is gathered across\nclients. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to develop AutoFE\nalgorithms for the horizontal and hybrid FL cases, and we show that the\ndownstream model performance of federated AutoFE is similar to the case where\ndata is held centrally and AutoFE is performed centrally.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RECqp-OwCRahBhZbJIW8jOxGMw-o-xGld1QoXWWr0D0","pdfSize":"720501"}
