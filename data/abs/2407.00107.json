This integration enables\nfood-wine pairing based on taste and sommelier-defined rules. Leveraging a food\ndataset comprising 500,000 reviews and a wine reviews dataset with over 130,000\nentries, we computed taste descriptors for both food and wine. This information\nwas then utilised to pair food items with wine and augment FlavorGraph with\nadditional data. The results demonstrate the potential of heterogeneous graphs\nto acquire supplementary information, proving beneficial for wine pairing.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8ONJFrWvVwff4HYzbPZ00ojSjrnPXy-oaH9QLdsEjzQ","pdfSize":"1297060"}
