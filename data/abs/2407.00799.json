Changes to motion patterns in these\ncells are one of the important features to be characterized to understand how\nan introduced drug or disease may alter the human heart beat. However,\nquantifying motion accurately and efficiently from optical measurements using\nmicroscopy is currently lacking. In this work, we present a unified framework\nfor performing motion analysis on a sequence of microscopically obtained images\nof tissues consisting of hiPSC-CMs. We provide validation of our developed\nsoftware using a synthetic test case and show how it can be used to extract\ndisplacements and velocities in hiPSC-CM microtissues. Finally, we show how to\napply the framework to quantify the effect of an inotropic compound. The\ndescribed software system is distributed as a python package that is easy to\ninstall, well tested and can be integrated into any python workflow.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Tissues and Organs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"NqnZGSZeCI504FlBFlefXDTS10CJL6H08bxwLmEqX5Y","pdfSize":"4037360","objectId":"0xe8c9bfd82b1782d79a66b7894be488537432bc118f4c892df00446b4c67d5f52","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
