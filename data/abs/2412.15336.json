Drawing inspiration from\nSymmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), we construct a lattice model\nfeaturing two boundary conditions: one that encodes topological symmetry and\nanother that governs non-topological dynamics. This cluster ladder model\ngeneralizes the well-known cluster state model. We demonstrate that the model\nexhibits weak Hopf symmetry, incorporating both the weak Hopf algebra and its\ndual. On a closed manifold, the symmetry reduces to cocommutative subalgebras\nof the weak Hopf algebra. Additionally, we introduce weak Hopf tensor network\nstates to provide an exact solution for the model. As every fusion category\ncorresponds to the representation category of some weak Hopf algebra, fusion\ncategory symmetry naturally corresponds to a subalgebra of the dual weak Hopf\nalgebra. Consequently,the cluster ladder model offers a lattice realization of\narbitrary fusion category symmetries.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QXeJlMVVbww6pzZni6h97YPu7il8eWrorXB5uM_Soyk","pdfSize":"920733"}
