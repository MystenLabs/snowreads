It is well\nknown that third-order methods can suffer from order reduction when applied to\nlinearized problems involving unbounded and non-commuting operators. In this\nwork, we consider a fourth-stage third-order Runge--Kutta method, which\nsuccessfully achieves the expected order of accuracy and avoids order\nreduction, as long as all required order conditions are satisfied. The\nconvergence analysis is carried out under the assumption of higher regularity\nfor the initial data. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the\ntheoretical results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"XtbpCz6QrgQtKskuVqHBRLlixyEapAsDHbzGg9wdNeU","pdfSize":"436621"}
