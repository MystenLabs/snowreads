  "abstract": "  In fault-tolerant quantum computing, the cost of calculating Hamiltonian\neigenvalues using the quantum phase estimation algorithm is proportional to the\nconstant scaling the Hamiltonian matrix block-encoded in a unitary circuit. We\npresent a method to reduce this scaling constant for the electronic\nHamiltonians represented as a linear combination of unitaries. Our approach\ncombines the double tensor-factorization method of Burg et al. with the the\nblock-invariant symmetry shift method of Loaiza and Izmaylov. By extending the\nelectronic Hamiltonian with appropriately parametrized symmetry operators and\noptimizing the tensor-factorization parameters, our method achieves a 25%\nreduction in the block-encoding scaling constant compared to previous\ntechniques. The resulting savings in the number of non-Clifford T-gates, which\nare an essential resource for fault-tolerant quantum computation, are expected\nto accelerate the feasiblity of practical Hamiltonian simulations. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our technique on Hamiltonians of industrial\nand biological relevance, including the nitrogenase cofactor (FeMoCo) and\ncytochrome P450.\n",
