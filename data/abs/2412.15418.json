Two of the most relevant points of discussion are\nthe hole dynamics and the influence of Cu:In synthesis stoichiometry on them.\nIt has been proposed that Cu-deficiency leads to the formation of Cu2+,\naffecting the localization of holes into Cu defects. Importantly, it is\nprecisely these confined hole states which are used to explain the interesting\nphotoluminescence properties of CuInS2 quantum dots. We use static X-ray\nspectroscopy to reveal no evidence for a measurable amount of native Cu2+\nstates in Cu-deficient samples. Instead, the improved properties of these\nsamples are explained by an increase of crystallinity, reducing the\nconcentration of mid gap states. Furthermore, to understand the charge carrier\ndynamics, herein we employ ultrafast optical transient absorption, and\nfluorescence up-conversion spectroscopies in combination with ultrafast X-ray\nabsorption spectroscopy using a hard X-ray free electron laser. We demonstrate\nthat in non-passivated samples, holes are transferred from Cu atoms in\nsub-picosecond timescales. We assign this transfer to occur towards the\nthiol-based ligands. Finally, we observe that Cu-deficient samples are more\nrobust against the photothermal heating effects of using higher laser fluences.\nThis is not the case for the stoichiometric sample, where heating effects on\nthe structure are directly observed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"MAK4JErP_y3J2TBrx_REBoY6Ipus0fVWmQS8ipJ6VLY","pdfSize":"3520181"}
