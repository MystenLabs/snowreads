These systems include a variety of signalling\ngame environments as well as more complex tasks like a social deduction game\nand embodied navigation. Each corpus is annotated with metadata describing the\ncharacteristics of the source system as well as a suite of analyses of the\ncorpus (e.g., size, entropy, average message length). Currently, research\nstudying emergent languages requires directly running different systems which\ntakes time away from actual analyses of such languages, limits the variety of\nlanguages that are studied, and presents a barrier to entry for researchers\nwithout a background in deep learning. The availability of a substantial\ncollection of well-documented emergent language corpora, then, will enable new\ndirections of research which focus their purview on the properties of emergent\nlanguages themselves rather than on experimental apparatus.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-I30Z-VaoJXpZSWs2JOTW5hSnocCSVR3y6Z7LRk3HLc","pdfSize":"215622"}
