  "abstract": "  There are families of physical systems that cannot be adiabatically evolved\nto the trivial system uniformly across the parameter space, even if each system\nin the family belongs to the trivial phase. The obstruction is measured by\nhigher Berry class. We analyze families of topological systems in 1+1d using\nfamilies of invertible TQFTs and families of RG fixed states of spin chains. We\nuse the generalized matrix-product states to describe RG fixed points of all\ntranslation invariant pure splits states on spin chains. Families of such fixed\npoints correspond to bundles of Hilbert-Schmidt operators. There exists a\nglobal MPS parametrization of the family if and only if the latter bundle is\ntrivial. We propose a novel duality of parametrized topological phases which is\nan avatar of the T-duality in string theory. The duality relates families with\ndifferent parameter spaces and different higher Berry classes. Mathematically,\nthe T-duality is realized by gauging the circle action on the continuous trace\nalgebra generated by parametrized matrix-product tensors.\n",
