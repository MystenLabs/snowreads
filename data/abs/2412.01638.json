  "abstract": "  For a complex reductive Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ with Cartan subalgebra\n$\\mathfrak{h}$ and Weyl group $W$ we consider the category $\\text{Perv}(W\n\\backslash \\mathfrak{h})$ of perverse sheaves on $W \\backslash \\mathfrak{h}$\nsmooth w.r.t. the natural stratification. We construct a category\n$\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{C}}$ such that $\\text{Perv}(W\\backslash \\mathfrak{h})$ is\nidentified with the category of functors from $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{C}}$ to\nvector spaces. Objects of $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{C}}$ are labelled by standard\nparabolic subalgebras in $\\mathfrak{g}$. It has morphisms analogous to the\noperations of parabolic induction (Eisenstein series) and restriction (constant\nterm) of automorphic forms. In particular, the Langlands formula for the\nconstant term of an Eisenstein series has a counterpart in the form of an\nidentity in $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{C}}$. We define $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{C}}$ as\nthe category of $W$-invariants (in an appropriate sense) in the category $Q$\ndescribing perverse sheaves on $\\mathfrak{h}$ smooth w.r.t. the root\narrangement. This matches, in an interesting way, the definition of $W\n\\backslash \\mathfrak{h}$ itself as the spectrum of the algebra of\n$W$-invariants.\n",
