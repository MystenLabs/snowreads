  "abstract": "  Thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) bounds coherence in stochastic\noscillatory systems. In this paper, we show that both dynamical and\nthermodynamic bounds play important roles for the excitable oscillators, e.g.\nneurons. Firstly, we investigate the trade-off between coherence and\ndissipation both in the sub and super-threshold regions for a single excitable\nunit, where both the TUR and the SNIC bounds constrain the fluctuation of\ninter-spike intervals. Secondly, we show that the widely studied phenomenon\ncalled coherence resonance, where there exists a noise strength to make the\noscillatory responses of the system most coherent, is also bounded by the TUR\nin the one-dimensional excitable phase model. Finally, we study the\ncoherence-dissipation relation in ensembles of strongly coupled excitable\noscillators.\n",
