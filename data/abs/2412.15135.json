  "abstract": "  There has been considerable work on reasoning about the strategic ability of\nagents under imperfect information. However, existing logics such as\nProbabilistic Strategy Logic are unable to express properties relating to\ninformation transparency. Information transparency concerns the extent to which\nagents' actions and behaviours are observable by other agents. Reasoning about\ninformation transparency is useful in many domains including security, privacy,\nand decision-making. In this paper, we present a formal framework for reasoning\nabout information transparency properties in stochastic multi-agent systems. We\nextend Probabilistic Strategy Logic with new observability operators that\ncapture the degree of observability of temporal properties by agents. We show\nthat the model checking problem for the resulting logic is decidable.\n",
