  "abstract": "  In this study, we propose a data-driven, deep-learning-based Machine-Learning\nSymmetry Discovery (MLSD) algorithm to automate the discovery of continuous Lie\ngroup symmetries in classical mechanical systems from their time-evolution\ntrajectory data. MLSD uses neural networks (NNs) to predict conserved physical\nquantities that implement symmetry transformations of the phase space\ncoordinates. After training, MLSD is able to identify the Lie algebra,\nparticularly non-abelian ones, as indicated by the Lie algebra structure\ncoefficients. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the MLSD method, we applied\nit to simulated data from the classical three-dimensional Kepler problem and\nthe harmonic oscillator. The results show that the algorithm successfully\nidentified the hidden symmetry groups of both systems.\n",
