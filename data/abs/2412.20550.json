  "abstract": "  Achaete-scute complex homolog 2 (ASCL2) codes a part of the basic\nhelix-loop-helix (BHLH) transcription factor family. WNTs have been found to\ndirectly affect the stemness of the tumor cells via regulation of ASCL2.\nSwitching off the ASCL2 literally blocks the stemness process of the tumor\ncells and vice versa. In colorectal cancer (CRC) cells treated with\nETC-1922159, ASCL2 was found to be down regulated along with other genes. A\nrecently developed search engine ranked combinations of ASCL2-X (X, a\nparticular gene/protein) at 2nd order level after drug administration. Some\nrankings confirm the already tested combinations, while others point to those\nthat are untested/unexplored. These rankings reveal which ASCL2-X combinations\nmight be working synergistically in CRC. In this research work, I cover\ncombinations of ASCL2 with WNT, transforming growth factor beta (TGFB),\ninterleukin (IL), leucine rich repeat containing G protein-coupled receptor\n(LGR), NOTCH, solute carrier family (SLC), SRY-box transcription factor (SOX),\nsmall nucleolar RNA host gene (SNHG), KIAA, F-box protein (FBXO), family with\nsequence similarity (FAM), B cell CLL/lymphoma (BCL), autophagy related (ATG)\nand Rho GTPase activating protein (ARHGAP) family.\n",
