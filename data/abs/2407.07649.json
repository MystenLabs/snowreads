We\nconstrain the outer disk emission with both image-plane retrieval, and\nvisibility-plane modeling with non-parametric and parametric fitting tools. Our\nresults confirm emission in the outer disk regions of TW Hya (60 au <= R <= 110\nau) at 0.65 mm, 0.87 mm and 1.3 mm. With image-plane retrieval, we resolve the\nnew continuum gap and ring, namely D79 and B86, at 0.87 mm and 1.3 mm. With\nvisibility-plane modeling, we also detect this substructure at 0.65 mm in the\nform of a quasi-constant emission at the 1-sigma level. Furthermore, it has a\nhigh spectral index of 3.7, which may indicate dust grain sizes << 1 mm. It may\nbe a dust trap or a traffic jam, that has a flux density of 60 mJy and a mass\n(1.59 earth masses) that accounts for up to 2% of the dust disk at 0.65 mm. In\nconclusion, we confirm the existence of a faint ring in the outer regions of TW\nHya at multiple millimeter wavelengths. With visibility-plane modeling, we are\nable to set constrains that are 3 times better than the resolution of our Band\n8 observations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"C12OMk8AAKFX7RtqcrXgn5UU-Po5ELLmPFrm_j8xLA4","pdfSize":"1057666"}
