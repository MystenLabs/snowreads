  "abstract": "  Many structures of interest in two-dimensional category theory have aspects\nthat are inherently strict. This strictness is not a limitation, but rather\nplays a fundamental role in the theory of such structures. For instance, a\nmonoidal fibration is - crucially - a strict monoidal functor, rather than a\npseudo or lax monoidal functor. Other examples include monoidal double\ncategories, double fibrations, and intercategories. We provide an explanation\nfor this phenomenon from the perspective of enhanced 2-categories, which are\n2-categories having a distinguished subclass of 1-cells representing the strict\nmorphisms. As part of our development, we introduce enhanced 2-categorical\nlimit sketches and explain how this setting addresses shortcomings in the\ntheory of 2-categorical limit sketches. In particular, we establish the\nsymmetry of internalisation for such structures, entailing, for instance, that\na monoidal double category is equivalently a pseudomonoid in an enhanced\n2-category of double categories, or a pseudocategory in an enhanced 2-category\nof monoidal categories.\n",
