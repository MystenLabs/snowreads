  "abstract": "  The replicator-mutator equation is a model for populations of individuals\ncarrying different traits, with a fitness function mediating their ability to\nreplicate, and a stochastic model for mutation. We derive analytical solutions\nfor the replicator-mutator equation in continuous time and for continuous\ntraits for a quadratic fitness function. Using these results we can explain and\nquantify (without the need for numerical in-silico simulations) a series of\nevolutionary phenomena, in particular the flying kite effect, survival of the\nflattest, and the ability of a population to sustain itself while tracking an\noptimal feature which may be fixed, moving with bounded velocity in trait\nspace, oscillating, or randomly fluctuating.\n",
