{"id":"2412.20485","title":"Algorithmic Idealism I: Reconceptualizing Reality Through Information\n  and Experience","authors":"Krzysztof Sienicki","authorsParsed":[["Sienicki","Krzysztof",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2024 17:33:43 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-31","timestamp":1734370423000,"abstract":"  Algorithmic idealism represents a transformative approach to understanding\nreality, emphasizing the informational structure of self-states and their\nalgorithmic transitions over traditional notions of an external, objective\nuniverse. Rooted in algorithmic information theory, it redefines reality as a\nsequence of self-state transitions governed by principles such as Solomonoff\ninduction. This framework offers a unified solution to longstanding challenges\nin quantum mechanics, cosmology, and metaphysics, addressing issues like the\nmeasurement problem, the Boltzmann brain paradox, and the simulation\nhypothesis. Algorithmic idealism shifts the focus from describing an\nindependent external world to understanding first-person experiences, providing\nepistemic interpretations of physical theories and dissolving metaphysical\ndivides between \"real\" and simulated realities. Beyond resolving these\nconceptual challenges, it raises profound ethical questions regarding the\ncontinuity, duplication, and termination of informational entities, reshaping\ndiscussions on identity, consciousness, and existence in the digital and\nquantum age. By offering a mathematically rigorous yet philosophically\ninnovative framework, algorithmic idealism invites a rethinking of reality as\nan emergent property of informational dynamics rather than a static external\nconstruct.\n","subjects":["Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XKRYD4OXLcYTPqIlMzUdejbleUPXni35R0p2c3FfutE","pdfSize":"162922"}
