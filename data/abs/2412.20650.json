  "abstract": "  This paper is concerned with a general linear quadratic (LQ) control problem\nof mean-field backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE). Here, the\nweighting matrices in the cost functional are allowed to be indefinite.\nNecessary and sufficient conditions for optimality are obtained via a\nmean-field forward-backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE). By\ninvestigating the connections with LQ problems of mean-field forward systems\nand taking some limiting procedures, we establish the solvabilities of\ncorresponding Riccati equations in the case that cost functional is uniformly\nconvex. Subsequently, an explicit formula of optimal control and optimal cost\nare derived. Moreover, some sufficient conditions for the uniform convexity of\ncost functional are also proposed in terms of Riccati equations, which have not\nbeen considered in existing literatures for backward systems. Some examples are\nprovided to illustrate our results.\n",
