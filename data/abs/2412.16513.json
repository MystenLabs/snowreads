These data\noffer a unique opportunity to test modern theories of dense matter using\nmulti-messenger constraints. Covariant density functional (CDF) models of\nnuclear matter, which capture a broad range of nuclear and astrophysical\nphenomena, provide a robust theoretical framework to interpret these\nobservations. This study applies the Bayesian framework to a class of CDF\nmodels with density-dependent meson-nucleon couplings, specifically those based\non nucleonic degrees of freedom. By incorporating the latest multi-messenger\nconstraints, we impose tighter limits on the parameter space of these models\nand assess their consistency with observational data. Our analysis advances\nprevious efforts by refining the density-dependence parameterization and\nintegrating recent $M$-$R$ ellipses. This enables more stringent evaluations of\ndense matter models in light of new astrophysical observations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EDIm8Q1xmcsUXsjQ9Foc6AfoEyj1BgX_7WxjgslMqUk","pdfSize":"6937967"}
