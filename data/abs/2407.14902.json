Here, we report emergent exciton-polaritons based on\nMoTe$_2$ monolayer and bilayer in a low-temperature open micro-cavity in a\njoint experiment-theory study. Our experiments clearly evidence both the\nenhanced oscillator strength and enhanced luminescence of MoTe$_2$ bilayers,\nsignified by a 38 \\% increase of the Rabi-splitting and a strongly enhanced\nrelaxation of polaritons to low-energy states. The latter is distinct from\npolaritons in MoTe$_2$ monolayers, which feature a bottleneck-like relaxation\ninhibition. Both the polaritonic spin-valley locking in monolayers and the\nspin-layer locking in bilayers are revealed via the Zeeman effect, which we map\nand control via the light-matter composition of our polaritonic resonances.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OJ0P9QDAinAanRv9sqmyD9mj_y4XWpaVJO00a3fGrSQ","pdfSize":"1261743"}
