Its applications span telephony,\ncompression, text-to-speech synthesis, and speech recognition. This paper\npresents a novel approach using a high-fidelity generative adversarial network,\nunlike cascaded systems, our system is trained end-to-end on paired narrowband\nand wideband speech signals. Our method integrates various bandwidth upsampling\nratios into a single unified model specifically designed for speech bandwidth\nexpansion applications. Our approach exhibits robust performance across various\nbandwidth expansion factors, including those not encountered during training,\ndemonstrating zero-shot capability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst work to showcase this capability. The experimental results demonstrate\nthat our method outperforms previous end-to-end approaches, as well as\ninterpolation and traditional techniques, showcasing its effectiveness in\npractical speech enhancement applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lmEuQhPcfCp_ZFnLUv8GFIJbvk-y0Uu5p0IlDDO7UUU","pdfSize":"833489"}
