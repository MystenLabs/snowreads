  "abstract": "  We report an infrared spectroscopy study of the antiferromagnetic (AFM)\ninsulator EuZn$_2$As$_2$ over a broad frequency range, spanning temperatures\nboth above and below the AFM transition $T_{\\rm N} \\simeq$ 20 K. The optical\nresponse reveals an insulating behavior, featuring two prominent\ninfrared-active phonon modes at around 95 and 190 cm$^{-1}$, and two subtle\nabsorption peaks at around 130 ($\\alpha$ peak) and 2700 cm$^{-1}$ ($\\beta$\npeak), along with a strong absorption edge rising around 9000 cm$^{-1}$\n($\\gamma$ peak). Significantly, the temperature-dependent changes in these\npeaks show noticeable anomalies across the AFM transition, particularly the\nemergence of the $\\alpha$ peak and an unusual redshift of the $\\gamma$ peak,\nsuggesting a strong interaction between the charge excitations and the AFM\norder. Band structure calculations reveal that these anomalies arise from\nmagnetization-induced band renormalizations, including shifts and foldings.\nAdditionally, both phonon modes feature asymmetric Fano line shapes at low\ntemperatures, with the 95 cm$^{-1}$ phonon mode exhibiting strong coupling to\nthe fluctuations of Eu spins. These findings highlight a complex interplay of\nspin, charge, and lattice degrees of freedom in EuZn$_2$As$_2$.\n",
