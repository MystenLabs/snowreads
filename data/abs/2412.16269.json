A small proportion of the network has access to a private signal\nabout the component, which can be clean (information) or distorted\n(misinformation). Other agents are uninformed and can receive information only\nfrom their peers. All agents are Bayesian, adjusting their beliefs according to\nthe confidence they have in the source of information. We examine, by means of\nsimulations, how information diffuses in the network and provide a framework to\naccount for delayed absorption of shocks, that are not immediately priced as\npredicted by classical financial models. We investigate the effect of the\nnetwork topology on the resulting asset price and evaluate under which\ncondition misinformation diffusion can make the market more inefficient.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"M8k25qUKTqnp0ZNgSwm0NQzu5HdTbUgl4c-m1F73JgM","pdfSize":"2125453"}
