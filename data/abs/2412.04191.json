The \"predictive brain\" framework suggests that\nmastering these tasks relies on predictive mechanisms, raising the question of\nhow we deploy such predictions for real-time control and coordination. This\nreview highlights two lines of research: one showing that during the control of\ncomplex objects people make the interaction with 'tools' predictable; the\nsecond one examines dyadic coordination showing that people make their behavior\npredictable for their partners. These studies demonstrate that to achieve\nsophisticated motor skills, we play \"prediction tricks\": we select subspaces of\npredictable solutions and make sensorimotor interactions more predictable and\nlegible by and for others. This synthesis underscores the critical role of\npredictability in optimizing control strategies across various contexts and\nestablishes a link between predictive processing and closed-loop control\ntheories of behavior.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"-PHKuSlK-n5nBPUzNPVDE5RUXbgi9u7y1AwskNrY9PA","pdfSize":"405123"}
