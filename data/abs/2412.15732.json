The meson-quark-quark\n(MQQ) vertices are determined in the framework of the constituent quark model\n(CQM). These vertices are such that upon folding with the ground-state baryon\nquark wave functions the one-boson-exchange (OBE) amplitudes for baryon-baryon\n(BB), and in particularly for nucleon-nucleon (NN), are reproduced. This opens\nthe attractive possibility to define meson-quark interactions at the quark\nlevel which are directly related related to the interactions at the baryon\nlevel. the latter have been determined by the baryon-baryon data. Application\nof these \"realistic\" quark-quark interactions in the quark-matter phase is\npresumably of relevance for the description of highly condensed matter, as e.g.\nneutron-star matter.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1wHzE5FaV1Gew_Z1iwmC2bmmwjGEPawFvZ0ScX6LGbE","pdfSize":"469426"}
