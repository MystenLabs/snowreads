  "abstract": "  The Friedrichs extension of minimal linear relation being bounded below and\nassociated with the discrete symplectic system with a special linear dependence\non the spectral parameter is characterized by using recessive solutions. This\ngeneralizes a similar result obtained by Do\\v{s}l\\'y and Hasil for linear\noperators defined by infinite banded matrices corresponding to even-order\nSturm--Liouville difference equations and, in a certain sense, also results of\nMarletta and Zettl or \\v{S}imon Hilscher and Zem\\'anek for singular\ndifferential operators.\n",
