In this work, we present a novel approach to accelerate real time\nTDDFT based electron dynamics simulations using autoregressive neural operators\nas time-propagators for the electron density. By leveraging physics-informed\nconstraints and high-resolution training data, our model achieves superior\naccuracy and computational speed compared to traditional numerical solvers. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a class of one-dimensional\ndiatomic molecules. This method has potential in enabling real-time, on-the-fly\nmodeling of laser-irradiated molecules and materials with varying experimental\nparameters.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Qlu3S5DaPJn5G1fAz_YAGLpySnuVG7pnTAjI_2oZgvw","pdfSize":"839310"}
