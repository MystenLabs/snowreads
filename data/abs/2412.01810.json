In\nparticular, we study nonlinear Hall-like bulk electric current responses and,\naccordingly, semiclassical equations of motion induced by the presence of a\ntopological Euler invariant. We provide analytic understanding of these\nquantities by phrasing them in terms of momentum-space geodesics and geodesic\ndeviation equations and further corroborate these insights with numerical\nsolutions. Within this framework, we moreover uncover anomalous bulk dynamics\nassociated with the second- and third-order nonlinear Hall conductivities\ninduced by a patch Euler invariant. As a main finding, our results show how one\ncan reconstruct the Euler invariant on coupling to electric fields at nonlinear\norder and from the gradients of the electric fields. Furthermore, we comment on\nthe possibility of deducing the non-trivial non-Abelian Euler class invariant\nspecifically in second-order nonlinear ballistic conductance measurements\nwithin a triple-contact setup, which was recently proposed to probe the Euler\ncharacteristics of more general Fermi surfaces. Generally, our results provide\na route for deducing the topology in real materials that exhibit the Euler\ninvariant by analyzing bulk electrical currents.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"00cqB_cNadCgUO8c8GSlQk5ehBzZcbWw7XGx2Q1ohQ4","pdfSize":"6930041"}
