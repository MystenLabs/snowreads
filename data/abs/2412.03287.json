Leveraging proven text-to-image models, we introduce a novel technical\ndesign to complement art therapy. The resulting AI-based tools shall enable\npatients to refine and customize their creative work, opening up new avenues of\nexpression and accessibility. Using three illustrative examples, we demonstrate\npotential outputs of our solution and evaluate them qualitatively. Furthermore,\nwe discuss the current limitations and ethical considerations associated with\nthis integration and provide an outlook into future research efforts.
