Subsequent to the\ninitial linear acceleration, the counter-rotating muons and anti-muons are\naccelerated in a chain of rapid cycling synchrotrons (RCS) up to the multi-TeV\ncollision energy. To maximise the number of muons available in the collider, it\nis essential to exploit the time dilation of the muon lifetime by employing a\nlarge accelerating gradient.\n  The 1.3 GHz TESLA cavity serves as the baseline for the RCS chain.\nConsidering the high bunch population and the small aperture of the cavity, the\nresulting beam-induced voltage per bunch passage is considerable, resulting in\na substantial perturbation of the cavity voltage for subsequent bunch passages.\nIn this contribution, the effects of beam loading during the acceleration cycle\non the muons are calculated with the objective of determining the optimum\nparameters for minimising the cavity voltage transients. The interaction of the\ninduced voltages, considering the counter-rotating beams, is studied.\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eE1hWoN4LLbI0ABxPR0C0UOt6T5Mbi3A86RCQbmJjXE","pdfSize":"770389"}
