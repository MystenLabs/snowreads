  "abstract": "  Color confinement is a fundamental phenomenon in quantum chromodynamics. In\nthis work, the mechanisms underlying color confinement are investigated in\ndetail, with a particular focus on the role of non-perturbative phenomena such\nas center vortices and monopoles in the QCD vacuum. By exploring lattice QCD\napproaches, including the Maximal Center Gauge and center projection methods,\nwe examine how these topological structures contribute to the confining force\nbetween color charges. We also address the limitations of conventional methods\nand suggest improvements to the gauge fixing prescription to enhance the\naccuracy of string tension predictions. Our findings support the validity of\nthe center vortex model as a key candidate for understanding the dynamics of\nthe confining QCD vacuum.\n",
