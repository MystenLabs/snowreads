We focus on the use of multi-level\nqudits, specifically ququarts. Traditional mappings, such as the Jordan-Wigner\ntransformation (JWT), while useful, often result in non-local operators that\nscale unfavorably with system size. To address these challenges, we introduce\nmappings that efficiently localize fermionic operators on qudits, reducing the\nnon-locality and operator weights associated with JWT. We propose one mapping\nfor spinless fermions and two mappings for spinful fermions, comparing their\nperformance in terms of qudit-weight, circuit depth, and gate complexity. By\nleveraging the extended local Hilbert space of qudits, we show that these\nmappings enable more efficient quantum simulations in terms of two-qudit gates,\nreducing hardware requirements without increasing computational complexity. We\nvalidate our approach by simulating prototypical models such as the spinless\nt-V model and the Fermi-Hubbard model in two dimensions, using Trotterized time\nevolution. Our results highlight the potential of qudit-based quantum\nsimulations in achieving scalability and efficiency for fermionic systems on\nnear-term quantum devices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kH_kUTIQ5vEl-5P984k3tTjpt_1v2N2x1si2wnZhyOU","pdfSize":"1230072"}
