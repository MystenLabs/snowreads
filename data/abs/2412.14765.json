In contrast to their result, we show that a\nfinitely generated residually-$p$ just infinite group has trivial first\n$L^2$-Betti number. Moreover, we prove that the normal homology rank gradient\nof a finitely generated, residually finite, just infinite group vanishes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NWF47KTk3yGcIkLw8u8V7eSdIiFlEvUsa7SYEOLMgvo","pdfSize":"201623"}
