  "abstract": "  We consider mixed types of not only regular curves but also curves with\nsingular points in the Lorentz-Minkowski 3-space. In order to consider mixed\ntype of curves with singular points, we consider the lightcone frame and\nlightcone framed curves. By using lightcone frame, we can consider Bertrand\ntypes for lightcone framed curves, so-called Bertrand lightcone framed curves.\nWe clarify that the existence conditions of Bertrand lightcone framed curves in\nall cases. As a consequence, we find pseudo-circular involutes and evolutes of\nmixed type curves which appear as Bertrand lightcone framed curves.\n",
