This study explores\ntechniques for identifying AI-generated text through sentence-level evaluation\nwithin hybrid articles. Our findings indicate that ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo exhibits\ndistinct, repetitive probability patterns that enable consistent in-domain\ndetection. Empirical tests show that minor textual modifications, such as\nrewording, have minimal impact on detection accuracy. These results provide\nvaluable insights for advancing AI detection methodologies, offering a pathway\ntoward robust solutions to address the complexities of synthetic text\nidentification.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ISo5VrCkzHr2xwdKxx0MEpZ6c5wgQa6lvDZUhf33kFM","pdfSize":"149892"}
