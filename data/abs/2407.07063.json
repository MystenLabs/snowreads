From this, we\ndeduce that the same holds with $\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}_\\ell$-coefficients after\nrestricting to wild inertia, addressing questions of Gan-Harris-Sawin and\nScholze. The proof involves constructing a moduli space of nonarchimedean local\nfields and then extending Fargues-Scholze's work to this context.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UEtgAJ_MkzTvVkZgbCxo5OG5yPyvOr2TcjiLgUvxbKI","pdfSize":"1111294"}
