However, traditional methods often struggle with occlusions and\ndo not utilize language for grasping. Incorporating natural language into grasp\ndetection remains a challenging task and largely unexplored. To address this\ngap, we propose a new method for language-driven grasp detection with\nmask-guided attention by utilizing the transformer attention mechanism with\nsemantic segmentation features. Our approach integrates visual data,\nsegmentation mask features, and natural language instructions, significantly\nimproving grasp detection accuracy. Our work introduces a new framework for\nlanguage-driven grasp detection, paving the way for language-driven robotic\napplications. Intensive experiments show that our method outperforms other\nrecent baselines by a clear margin, with a 10.0% success score improvement. We\nfurther validate our method in real-world robotic experiments, confirming the\neffectiveness of our approach.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"c3gbU-fgGofNQvKz5SzLR-Ixnvxnt7GCx4IzCtqDS84","pdfSize":"11404567"}
