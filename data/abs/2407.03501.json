Due to the emergence of\nCoulomb singularities in both the hard sector and the corresponding anomalous\ndimension as the relative $t\\bar{t}$ pair velocity, $\\beta_{t\\bar{t}}$,\napproaches zero, extrapolating the soft-collinear resummation that is derived\nin the domain where the top and antitop quarks are kinematically well-separated\ninto the full phase space is not trivial. Focussing on two observables that are\ninsensitive to azimuthal asymmetric divergences, $q_{\\mathrm{T}}$ and\n$\\Delta\\phi_{t\\bar{t}}$, we will demonstrate that a literal application of a\nSCET$+$HQET based resummation onto\n$\\mathrm{d}\\sigma_{t\\bar{t}}/\\mathrm{d}q_{\\mathrm{T}}$ and\n$\\mathrm{d}\\sigma_{t\\bar{t}}/\\mathrm{d}\\Delta\\phi_{t\\bar{t}}$ is only possible\nup to NLL accuracy. Starting at NNLL, however, such a na\\\"ive procedure will\ndevelop power-like divergences in $\\beta_{t\\bar{t}}$ in the threshold regime.\nTo this end, two prescriptions, dubbed the D- and R-schemes, are introduced to\nfacilitate the extrapolation of the resummation framework from the\nwell-separated region where $\\beta_{t\\bar{t}}\\sim\\mathcal{O}(1)$ to the\nthreshold regime $\\beta_{t\\bar{t}}\\to0$, enabling us to compute\n$\\mathrm{d}\\sigma_{t\\bar{t}}/\\mathrm{d}q_{\\mathrm{T}}$ and\n$\\mathrm{d}\\sigma_{t\\bar{t}}/\\mathrm{d}\\Delta\\phi_{t\\bar{t}}$ at NNLL$+$NNLO\naccuracy throughout. Further, by comparing the results of both formulations, we\ncan assess the theoretical uncertainty caused by the truncation of the\nCoulomb-enhanced terms in the perturbative series.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SJwe3A9X-_Ln43GOhn267jl3axfVMhOeFfxszu85YeU","pdfSize":"3581683"}
