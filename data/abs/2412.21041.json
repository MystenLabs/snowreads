  "abstract": "  In both smooth and analytic categories, we construct examples of\ndiffeomorphisms of topological entropy zero with intricate ergodic properties.\nOn any smooth compact connected manifold of dimension 2 admitting a nontrivial\ncircle action, we construct a smooth diffeomorphism whose differential is\nweakly mixing with respect to a smooth measure in the projectivization of the\ntangent bundle. In case of the 2-torus, we also obtain the analytic counterpart\nof such a diffeomorphism. The constructions are based on a quantitative version\nof the ``Approximation by Conjugation'' method, which involves explicitly\ndefined conjugation maps, partial partitions, and the adaptation of a specific\nanalytic approximation technique.\n",
