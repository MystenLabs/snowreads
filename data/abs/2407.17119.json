In this\npaper we present the first automatic coda detector and annotator. The main\ninnovation in our detector is graph-based clustering, which utilizes the\nexpected similarity between the clicks that make up the coda. Results show\ndetection and accurate annotation at low signal-to-noise ratios, separation\nbetween codas and echolocation clicks, and discrimination between codas from\nsimultaneously emitting whales. Using this automatic annotator, insights into\nthe characterization of sperm whale communication are presented. The results\ninclude new types of coda signals, analyzes of the distribution of coda types\namong different whales and for different years, and evidence for\nsynchronization between communicating whales in terms of coda type and coda\ntransmission time. These results indicate a high degree of complexity in the\ncommunication system of this cetacean species. To ensure traceability, we share\nthe implementation code of our coda detector.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Sound"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"y8wxHfQ9FyhHZSqal2zuxtqoVrO3qwLVUbeyR1saO5U","pdfSize":"1447636"}
