In this talk we relate\ndiffusion models to stochastic quantisation in field theory and employ it to\ngenerate configurations for scalar fields on a two-dimensional lattice. We end\nwith some speculations on possible applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TRRObUeAuXN9mk58RkCGjFTA81VcIjVlrbdbu1SQYhY","pdfSize":"1720178"}
