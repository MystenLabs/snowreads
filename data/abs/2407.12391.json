By selecting and\nreviewing high-quality papers from prestigious ML and system venues, we\nhighlight key innovations and practical considerations for deploying and\nscaling LLMs in real-world production environments. This survey serves as a\nvaluable resource for LLM practitioners seeking to stay abreast of the latest\ndevelopments in this rapidly evolving field.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KAG7jJ4glCKTUbdFcfH3EHP8-tk12hwxx-N3ID_7kqk","pdfSize":"1391967","objectId":"0x4bd3e575895b24b7188791bb0a6eb11296b0c9257396530d93c610a2fbc7e32d","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
