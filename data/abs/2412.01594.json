  "abstract": "  This paper studies discrete-time average-cost infinite-horizon Markov\ndecision processes (MDPs) with Borel state and action sets. It introduces new\nsufficient conditions for { the} validity of optimality inequalities and\noptimality equations for MDPs with weakly and setwise continuous transition\nprobabilities. These inequalities and equations imply the existence of\ndeterministic optimal policies.\n",
