  "abstract": "  The SU(2) gauge group with two fundamental flavors is a candidate for a\ncomposite Higgs extension of the Standard Model. Central to Higgs phenomenology\nis a non-perturbative determination of observables of the theory, such as the\ndecay constant of the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Bosons. We present preliminary\nresults for the continuum limit of the pseudoscalar decay constant using a\nmixed-action setup, with non-perturbatively improved stabilized Wilson Fermions\non the sea, and maximally twisted valence quarks. Pivotal to this study is the\nrecent porting of our simulation suite HiRep to GPU architecture.\n",
