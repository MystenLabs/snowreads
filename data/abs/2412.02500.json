  "abstract": "  The stochastic gravitational-wave background originating from cosmic sources\ncontains vital information about the early universe. In this work, we\ncomprehensively study the cross-correlations between the energy-density\nanisotropies in scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) and the temperature\nanisotropies and polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In our\nanalysis of the angular power spectra for these cross-correlations, we consider\nall contributions of the local-type primordial non-Gaussianity\n$f_{\\mathrm{NL}}$ and $g_{\\mathrm{NL}}$ that can lead to large anisotropies. We\nshow that the angular power spectra are highly sensitive to primordial\nnon-Gaussianity. Furthermore, we project the sensitivity of future\ngravitational-wave detectors to detect such signals and, consequently, measure\nthe primordial non-Gaussianity.\n",
