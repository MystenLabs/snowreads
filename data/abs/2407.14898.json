We report a theoretical proposal to separate electronic and phononic\ncontributions to thermal conductance at 2D interfaces, which is validated by\nnon-equilibrium Green's function calculations and molecular dynamics\nsimulations for graphene-gold contacts. Our results reveal that while\nmetal-graphene interfaces are transparent for both electrons and phonons,\nnon-covalent graphene interfaces block electronic tunneling beyond two layers\nbut not phonon transport. This suggests that the Wiedemann-Franz law can be\nexperimentally tested by measuring transport across interfaces with varying\ngraphene layers.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qTj-lMBP_8c78EikMUrTF4ALvibVeYCmfZw-L9sBeCc","pdfSize":"23745946"}
