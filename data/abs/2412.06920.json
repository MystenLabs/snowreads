  "abstract": "  WD\\,0141--675 was reported as the first astrometrically detected white dwarf\nplanet host candidate as part of the third data release from \\textit{Gaia},\njust to be later retracted via a news item on the \\textit{Gaia} web site$^1$.\nWe present time-resolved, high-resolution optical ESPRESSO spectroscopy of\n\\obj. A radial velocity analysis of the \\Ion{Ca}~K absorption line reveals a\ntentative periodic signal of $15.6\\pm0.9$\\,d. Phase-folding the ESPRESSO\nspectroscopy on this signal exhibits weak variability in the morphology of\n\\Ion{Ca}~K close to the core of the line. A violet-to-red ratio analysis of the\nCa~K line shows a periodic signal of $16.1\\pm0.9$\\,d. The periods from both\nmethods agree, within their uncertainties, with half the period of the\nastrometric planet candidate, however, both measurements are of low statistical\nsignificance. Nonetheless, our results imply possible solutions to the mass\nfunction within the planetary regime. And when combined with existing infrared\nphotometry, which rules out a brown dwarf companion, yield a lower limit on the\norbital inclination of $\\sim7^\\circ$. Our study demonstrates that ESPRESSO\nobservations are well capable of detecting short-period (days to weeks) giant\nplanets orbiting white dwarfs.\n",
