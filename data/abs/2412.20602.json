This study evaluates GPT-4.0's\nability to identify conflicts within regulatory requirements by analyzing a\ncurated corpus with artificially injected ambiguities and contradictions,\ndesigned in collaboration with architects and compliance engineers. Using\nmetrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score, the experiment demonstrates\nGPT-4.0's effectiveness in detecting inconsistencies, with findings validated\nby human experts. The results highlight the potential of LLMs to enhance\nregulatory compliance processes, though further testing with larger datasets\nand domain-specific fine-tuning is needed to maximize accuracy and practical\napplicability. Future work will explore automated conflict resolution and\nreal-world implementation through pilot projects with industry partners.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RQ0PG4YDCSnUmV7HeF6IT6atNuSKAeBvqaNGXzHUsxs","pdfSize":"191000"}
