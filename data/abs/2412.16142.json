In four-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes the infinite\nenhancement of translations, extending the Poincar\\'e group to the BMS group,\nis the symmetry underlying Weinberg's soft graviton theorem and the\ngravitational displacement memory effect. Beyond this leading infrared\ntriangle, loop corrections alter their nature by introducing logarithms in the\nsoft expansion and late time tails to the memory, and this persists in the\nclassical limit. In this work we give the first complete description of an\n`infrared triangle' where the long-range nature of gravitational interactions\nis accounted for. Building on earlier results in 2403.13053 where we derived a\nnovel conservation law associated to the infinite dimensional enhancement of\nLorentz transformations to superrotations, we prove here its validity to all\norders in the gravitational coupling and show that it implies the classical\nlogarithmic soft graviton theorem of Saha-Sahoo-Sen in 1912.06413. We\nfurthermore extend the formula for the displacement memory and its tail from\nparticles to fields, thus completing the classical superrotation infrared\ntriangle.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"C-s1HkFSkjg4-df1D3AY6bkjg8BRdEkjR_gLTGMMjcM","pdfSize":"1053835"}
