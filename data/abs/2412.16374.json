In these lecture notes we give a self-contained introduction\nto the toy model of diffusion with stochastic resetting. We also discuss large\ndeviation properties of additive functionals of the process such as the cost of\nresetting. Finally, we consider the generalisation from Poissonian resetting,\nwhere the resetting process occurs with a constant rate, to non-Poissonian\nresetting.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JaRBDDM3tQvmFHU8Fn83-YZha0H23GscuLd0ohLmFGs","pdfSize":"539533"}
