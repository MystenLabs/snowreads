Unlike conventional deep learning\nmodels that rely on a large number of trainable parameters, Point-GN leverages\nnon-learnable components-specifically, Farthest Point Sampling (FPS), k-Nearest\nNeighbors (k-NN), and Gaussian Positional Encoding (GPE)-to extract both local\nand global geometric features. This design eliminates the need for additional\ntraining while maintaining high performance, making Point-GN particularly\nsuited for real-time, resource-constrained applications. We evaluate Point-GN\non two benchmark datasets, ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN, achieving\nclassification accuracies of 85.29% and 85.89%, respectively, while\nsignificantly reducing computational complexity. Point-GN outperforms existing\nnon-parametric methods and matches the performance of fully trained models, all\nwith zero learnable parameters. Our results demonstrate that Point-GN is a\npromising solution for 3D point cloud classification in practical, real-time\nenvironments.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8sx-oP2z4Ph4Tpl3NXb0RgXHi5stMUu3mw56lTFo7a8","pdfSize":"1160393"}
