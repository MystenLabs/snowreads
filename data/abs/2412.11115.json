We find that\nthe simple proportionality between the mean velocity and momentum holds true\nonly for the simplest quadratic dispersion (i.e., dependence of the energy on\nthe momentum). For relativistic dispersion, the mean velocity is generally not\ncollinear with the mean momentum, but velocity of the {\\it energy centroid} is\ndirected along the mean momentum. This is related to the conservation of the\nLorentz-boost momentum and has implications in possible decomposition of the\nmean orbital angular momentum into intrinsic and extrinsic parts. Neglecting\nspin/polarization effects, these properties depend solely on the dispersion\nrelation, and can be applied to any waves, including classical electromagnetic\nor acoustic fields.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vmGFaerFCKKqME0Say03ZTQIpuIFOw2fGXy6Cssx9wU","pdfSize":"973072"}
