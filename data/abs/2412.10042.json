We give various intrinsic\ndefinitions of a Type A potential on $Q_n$, then via coordinate changes we (1)\nprove a monomialization result that expresses these potentials in a\nparticularly nice form, (2) prove that Type A potentials precisely correspond\nto crepant resolutions of cAn singularities, (3) solve the Realisation\nConjecture of Brown-Wemyss in this setting.\n  For $n \\leq 3$, we furthermore give a full classification of Type A\npotentials (without loops) up to isomorphism, and those with finite-dimensional\nJacobi algebras up to derived equivalence. There are various algebraic\ncorollaries, including to certain tame algebras of quaternion type due to\nErdmann, where we describe all basic algebras in the derived equivalence class.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZR1fG4heKuR0F3wRTGGe4yQ3Qao1bJKDZB8UA_BlUZo","pdfSize":"709474"}
