Spectra are calibrated in absolute flux using concurrent\nphotometry. We present measurements of V and Ic magnitudes and V-Ic colour\nindex, classify spectra in the revised MK system and investigate how absolute\nflux in the H-alpha to H-delta emission lines varies with pulsation phase for\neach star.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IodBQUD9BMQ5DbxbUsZbvCQ0-lJ0B1J-1iI0lrGW5MQ","pdfSize":"2069848","objectId":"0xe2badf9676a4d4272e345541290e3fb5a7b208d003862492918e3063702e0b93","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
