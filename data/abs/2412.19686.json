  "abstract": "  T1 transitions, which are localised cell rearrangements, play an important\nrole in the fluidization of epithelial monolayers. Using a multi-phase field\nmodel and an active elastic solid model, we show that although each cell\nundergoes T1 transitions in time as uncorrelated, random events, the spatial\ndistribution of these events is highly correlated and is dependent on cell\nshape. T1 transitions have a dual effect. Cells losing neighbours tend to relax\ntheir shape, while those gaining neighbours tend to elongate. By analysing the\nstatistics of successive T1 transitions undergone by a deformable cell, we find\nasymmetric spatial distributions related to how cells lose or gain neighbours.\nThese asymmetric spatial patterns of T1 transitions promote directed cell\nmigration, and form the backbone for coherent flow patterns at tissue scales.\n",
