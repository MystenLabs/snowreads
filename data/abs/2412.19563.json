Existing label denoising models often treat the\ndenoising process as a separate preprocessing step, leading to a disconnect\nbetween label denoising and AVVP tasks. To bridge this gap, we present a novel\njoint reinforcement learning-based label denoising approach (RLLD). This\napproach enables simultaneous training of both label denoising and video\nparsing models through a joint optimization strategy. We introduce a novel\nAVVP-validation and soft inter-reward feedback mechanism that directly guides\nthe learning of label denoising policy. Extensive experiments on AVVP tasks\ndemonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method compared to label\ndenoising techniques. Furthermore, by incorporating our label denoising method\ninto other AVVP models, we find that it can further enhance parsing results.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VuPu8YxTGkfkbo3qg3cUzbkp4jx30XbD0laZRjAZSE4","pdfSize":"967047"}
