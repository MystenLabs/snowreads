This version of the Equivalence Theorem is then used to\nreexpress the Abelian Higgs model action, originally written in terms of\nundesirable gauge variant field excitations, in terms of gauge-invariant,\nphysical variables, corresponding to the Fr\\\"ohlich-Morchio-Strocchi composite\noperators in the original field formulation. Although the ensuing action\nencompasses an infinite number of vertices and appears to be nonrenormalizable\nfrom the powercounting viewpoint, it nevertheless is renormalizable, thanks to\nthe hidden equivalence with the original model. Hence, manifestly\ngauge-invariant computations are possible. We present an explicit illustration\nin terms of the gauge-invariant scalar field, its Green's function and\ncorresponding pole mass.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hyoUUYoijqZN-bH3ieSqvYHXY-AoAkKFvZ5xp2fGY1c","pdfSize":"293160"}
