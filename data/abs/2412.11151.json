In this paper, we factor the ADRT into a\nproduct of linear transforms that resemble convolutions, and derive an explicit\nspectral decomposition of each factor. We further show that this implies - for\ndata lying in the range of the ADRT - that the transform of an $N \\times N$\nimage can be formally inverted with complexity $\\mathcal{O}(N^2 \\log^2 N)$. We\nnumerically test the accuracy of the inverse on images of moderate sizes and\nfind that it is competitive with existing iterative algorithms in this special\nregime.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"0yu1WP-iHqs69bYvk5tTK9a18WfvyShL8J9RMUaz9u8","pdfSize":"1205438"}
