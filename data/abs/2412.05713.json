Successful settlement of founder bacteria, early microcolony\ndevelopment and later macroscopic spreading of these biofilms on surfaces rely\non complex physical mechanisms. Recent data show that on soft hydrogels,\nsubstrate rigidity is an important determinant for biofilm initiation and\nspreading, through mostly unknown mechanisms. Using a thermodynamically\nconsistent thin-film approach for suspensions on soft elastic surfaces\nsupplemented with biomass production we investigate in silico the role of\nsubstrate softness in the osmotic spreading of biofilms. We show that on soft\nsubstrates with an imposed osmotic pressure spreading is considerably slowed\ndown and may be completely halted depending on the biomass production rate. We\nfind, that the critical slowing down of biofilm spreading on soft surfaces is\ncaused by a reduced osmotic influx of solvent into the biofilm at the edges,\nwhich results from the thermodynamic coupling between substrate deformation and\ninterfacial forces. By linking substrate osmotic pressure and mechanical\nsoftness through scaling laws, our simple model semi-quantitatively captures a\nrange of experimentally observed biofilm spreading dynamics on hydrogels with\ndifferent architectures, underscoring the importance of inherent substrate\nproperties in the spreading process.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2f7MXocb-fqUyTyDXnUYngV0ezk15p6R2VX-iJ_6rsk","pdfSize":"5168544"}
