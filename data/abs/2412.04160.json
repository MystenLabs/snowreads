  "abstract": "  We consider the renormalization group equations of axion-like particle\neffective field theories and determine the corresponding anomalous dimensions\nat one loop via on-shell and unitarity-based methods. The calculation of the\nphase-space cut-integrals is carried out using different integration methods,\namong which the double-cut integration via Stokes' theorem proves to be\ntechnically simpler. A close comparison between the standard Feynman\ndiagrammatic approach and the unitarity-based method enables us to explicitly\nverify the reduction of complexity in the latter case, along with a more direct\nand elegant way to establish a connection among anomalous dimensions of\noperators that are dual under the CP symmetry.\n",
