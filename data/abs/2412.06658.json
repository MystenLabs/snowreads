  "abstract": "  Prior work using synchronized, geographically spaced radio telescopes, and a\nradio interferometer, suggests that narrow-bandwidth polarized pulse pair\nmeasurements repeatedly falsify a noise-cause hypothesis, given a prior\ncelestial direction of interest. A four-step method was proposed, tested, and\nreported, using interferometer phase measurements, to seek common celestial\ndirections among pulse pair components, during 92 days of observation. In the\nwork reported here, the proposed four-step signal discovery method is\nsimplified to have a single step. A 123.8 day interferometer experiment\nprovides measurement evidence supporting a hypothesis that the prior direction\nof interest, and a second direction of interest, are associated with celestial\ncoordinates. Each pointing direction measures statistical power at greater than\nsix standard deviations, with some indications of associated\ninterferometer-induced Right Ascension aliasing. Explanations are proposed and\ndiscussed.\n",
