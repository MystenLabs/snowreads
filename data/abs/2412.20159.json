We show that\n$\\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{E}}$ is a subalgebra of $B(H)$ if and only if\n$\\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{E}}$ is a left ideal of a certain nest algebra, and if\nso,\n  $\\mathcal{E}$ consists of power partial isometries, except possibly for its\nsupremum $\\vee \\mathcal{E}$, in which case the range $\\operatorname{ran}(\\vee\n\\mathcal{E})$ is $H$. It is also shown that any left ideal\n$\\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{E}}$ is decomposable and that the subset of finite rank\noperators in its closed unit ball is strongly dense in the ball.
