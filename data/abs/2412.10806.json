  "abstract": "  A novel proposal is made to account for the dark matter component of the\nUniverse. Ultralight dark matter with mass $\\leq {\\cal{O}}(10^{-22})~eV$ is one\nof the strong candidates for the missing mass which aids the formation of\ngalaxies as well as holding them together. They are also known as fuzzy dark\nmatter(FDM) which will come under Cold Dark matter. The question is what is\nthis particle and its implications. How do we experimentally see it is an\noutstanding question. We propose to answer some of these questions with some\nevidences and the estimates.\n",
