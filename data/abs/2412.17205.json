Results show a persistence of deformation when going\nbeyond the N = 60 threshold of the transition between spherical to deformed\nground states at N < 60 and N > 60, respectively. Close to 78Ni, a more\ndetailed image of the N > 50 Zn isotopes shows an erosion of the N = 50 shell\nclosure, with core-breaking effects needed from theoretical models to replicate\nobservation. As well as the experimental results indicating collective effects,\nthe projected generator coordinate method is discussed in detail within the\ncontext of the neutron-rich Ge isotopes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xbCidI-lZ6-hXYVOmg-797r4mhh868KBS3QrxKr9GI4","pdfSize":"6424372"}
