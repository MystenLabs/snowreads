  "abstract": "  The paper will provide an overview of the capabilities of the Methodical\nAccelerator Design Next Generation (MAD-NG) tool. MAD-NG is a standalone,\nall-in-one, multi-platform tool well-suited for linear and nonlinear optics\ndesign and optimization, and has already been used in large-scale studies such\nas HiLumi-LHC or FCC-ee. It embeds LuaJIT, an extremely fast tracing\njust-in-time compiler for the Lua programming language, delivering exceptional\nversatility and performance for the forefront of computational physics. The\ncore of MAD-NG relies on the fast Generalized Truncated Power Series Algebra\n(GTPSA) library, which has been specially developed to handle many parameters\nand high-order differential algebra, including Lie map operators. This\necosystem offers powerful features for the analysis and optimization of linear\nand nonlinear optics, thanks to the fast parametric nonlinear normal forms and\nthe polyvalent matching command. A few examples and results will complete this\noverview of the MAD-NG application.\n",
