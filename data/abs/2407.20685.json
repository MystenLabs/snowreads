The suite employs Generative AI\ntechniques to automate the assessment of learner knowledge, analyze behavioral\npatterns, and manage interactions with non-player characters using real time\nlearner assessment. Additionally, ICLS provides contextual hint and recommend\ncourse content by assessing learner proficiency, while Generative AI\nfacilitates the automated creation and validation of educational content.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"nhjIWel6mVrdEzVzOvOH9oUlHf-xn4wU00HWNOlR_YY","pdfSize":"803119","objectId":"0xccb10fe21694edff5ae6e3e4edecefce066c2901497ae85cb66bd08e09fbd762","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
