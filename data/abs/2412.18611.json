As a first goal, a graph theoretic\ncharacterization for an off-diagonal entry of the inverse of an $M$-matrix to\nbe positive, is presented. This result, in turn, is used in providing\nalternative graph theoretic proofs of the following: (1) a characterization for\na tridiagonal $M$-matrix to have a tridiagonal inverse. (2) a necessary\ncondition for an $M$-matrix to have a pentadiagonal inverse. The results are\nillustrated by several numerical examples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"aGmz1cKpVoB7eLA7rcQj65oxSnDnxU6Toa2Q_z1CjTY","pdfSize":"149781"}
