Moreover,\nunder the condition that there exists a finite order solution of (+) with\nexponential sum coefficients having rational frequencies and constant\ncoefficients, we give the precise form of all finite order solutions, which are\nexponential sums. It is a partial answer to Gol'dberg-Ostrovski\\v{i} Problem\nand Problem 5 in \\cite{HITW2022} since exponential sums are of completely\nregular growth.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"H3xVlfsbaTIpKuOHU7zVVeP8v_P68vPPtOG3folHJ14","pdfSize":"213983"}
