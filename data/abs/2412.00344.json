  "abstract": "  The light, strange baryons have been studied through various approaches and\nattempted to be looked for rigorously in experiments. The screened potential\nhas been applied to heavy baryon sector as well as meson systems in earlier\nworks. Here, this article attempts to compare the results for linear and\nscreened potential for light strange baryons. Also, the Regge trajectories\ndepict the linear nature.\n",
