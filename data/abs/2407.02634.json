These seemingly contradictory results suggest that\nconcatenated parsimony may fail to be consistent for trees with more than 5\ntaxa, for all unrooted trees, or for some combination of the two. Here, we\npresent a technique for computing the expected internal branch lengths of gene\ntrees under the MSC. This technique allows us to determine the regions of the\nparameter space of the species tree under which concatenated parsimony fails\nfor different numbers of taxa, for rooted or unrooted trees. We use our new\napproach to demonstrate that there are always regions of statistical\ninconsistency for concatenated parsimony for the 5- and 6-taxa cases,\nregardless of rooting. Our results therefore suggest that parsimony is not\ngenerally dependable under the MSC.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dNo4kjwZmsFkKDxT4VLlLZljr9tWDLnpPy6NAc5CyNk","pdfSize":"709170"}
