While previous research has mainly\nfocused on challenges like pose variations and lighting changes, the impact of\nextreme capture conditions is often not adequately addressed. These extreme\nconditions, including varied lighting, camera styles, angles, and image\ndistortions, can significantly affect data distribution and re-ID accuracy.\n  Current research typically improves model generalization under normal\nshooting conditions through data augmentation techniques such as adjusting\nbrightness and contrast. However, these methods pay less attention to the\nrobustness of models under extreme shooting conditions. To tackle this, we\npropose a multi-mode synchronization learning (MMSL) strategy . This approach\ninvolves dividing images into grids, randomly selecting grid blocks, and\napplying data augmentation methods like contrast and brightness adjustments.\nThis process introduces diverse transformations without altering the original\nimage structure, helping the model adapt to extreme variations. This method\nimproves the model's generalization under extreme conditions and enables\nlearning diverse features, thus better addressing the challenges in re-ID.\nExtensive experiments on a simulated test set under extreme conditions have\ndemonstrated the effectiveness of our method. This approach is crucial for\nenhancing model robustness and adaptability in real-world scenarios, supporting\nthe future development of person re-identification technology.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"cS25PSyzzalFbcKgCrxeUB6RuiMype_B6N7sBZ3E27E","pdfSize":"2677524","objectId":"0xa0ff850ac800b75b287848c646e23796550f5fce467a579a55902a21ffe86f08","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
