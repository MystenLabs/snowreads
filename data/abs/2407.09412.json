It is shown that when\ncanonical vorticities and velocities of all the plasma fluids are aligned, the\nmagnetic field self-organizes to Quadruple Beltrami state (superposition of\nfour Beltrami fields). The self-organized magnetic and velocity fields strongly\ndepend on the relative strengths of the generalized vorticities, flows, inertia\nand densities of the plasma species. Thus, it is possible to generate a wide\nvariety of multiscale magnetic field and flow structures. It is also shown that\nrelaxed magnetic fields and velocities can vary on vastly different length\nscales simultaneously and are coupled together through singular perturbation\ngenerated by Hall effect. In this multi Beltrami self-organized states, then,\nthe dynamo mechanism emerges naturally. The scale separation also suggests the\nheating of the plasma through a dissipative process. The work could be useful\nto study the dynamics and morphology of the multiscale magnetic field\nconfigurations in laboratory and astrophysical plasmas.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"5gdeblxrdQT2msg8gXNy5eu2iX9Ex4Kda-tFbOhgJdA","pdfSize":"222073","objectId":"0xb8f9d70f9254ddb76f235ccda4bef189b91750885bc9f8e62e4622ca3186f82d","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
