Yet, the experimental\nbranching ratio for the $\\rho^0 \\phi$ mode is twice as big as that for the\n$\\omega \\phi$ mode. We find a natural explanation based on the extra indirect\nmechanism where $K^{*+} K^{*-}$ is produced via external emission and that\nchannel undergoes final state interaction with other vector--vector channels to\nlead to the $\\rho^0 \\phi$, $\\omega \\phi$ final states, with transition\namplitudes dominated by the $a_0(1710)$ resonance, recently discovered, and\n$f_0(1710)$ respectively. The large coupling of the $a_0(1710)$ to the $\\rho^0\n\\phi$ channel is mostly responsible for this large ratio of the production\nrates.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uUJAMiGlO5WAXG4KiseL1a3uds6MLqaDkzkYcKYUUWo","pdfSize":"370500"}
