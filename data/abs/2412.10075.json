  "abstract": "  In this work, we study the impact of carrier localization on three quantities\nsensitive to carrier gas density at the micrometer scale: charged exciton (X+)\noscillator strength, local free carrier conductivity, and the Knight shift. The\nlast two are observed in a micrometer-scale, spatially resolved optically\ndetected magnetic resonance experiment (ODMR). On the surface of MBE-grown\n(Cd,Mn)Te quantum well we identify defected areas in the vicinity of\ndislocations. We find that these areas show a much lower conductivity signal\nwhile maintaining the same Knight shift values as the pristine areas of the\nquantum well. We attribute this behavior to carrier localization in the\ndefected regions.\n",
