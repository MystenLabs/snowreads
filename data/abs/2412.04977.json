  "abstract": "  Purpose: Finding scholarly articles is a time-consuming and cumbersome\nactivity, yet crucial for conducting science. Due to the growing number of\nscholarly articles, new scholarly search systems are needed to effectively\nassist researchers in finding relevant literature.\n  Methodology: We take a neuro-symbolic approach to scholarly search and\nexploration by leveraging state-of-the-art components, including semantic\nsearch, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Knowledge Graphs (KGs). The semantic\nsearch component composes a set of relevant articles. From this set of\narticles, information is extracted and presented to the user.\n  Findings: The presented system, called ORKG ASK (Assistant for Scientific\nKnowledge), provides a production-ready search and exploration system. Our\npreliminary evaluation indicates that our proposed approach is indeed suitable\nfor the task of scholarly information retrieval.\n  Value: With ORKG ASK, we present a next-generation scholarly search and\nexploration system and make it available online. Additionally, the system\ncomponents are open source with a permissive license.\n",
