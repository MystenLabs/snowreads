The properties of elliptic fields are analyzed,\nwith particular emphasis on scalar fields and normal tensor fields.\nTime-harmonic electromagnetic problems with general elliptic material fields\nare then studied. Well-posedness results for classical variational formulations\nwith different boundary conditions are reviewed, and hypotheses for the\ncoercivity of the corresponding sesquilinear forms are investigated. Finally,\nthe proposed framework is applied to examples of media used in the literature:\nisotropic lossy media, geometric media, and gyrotropic media.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"coEOI1zQ6DJY3cUSY3FO6-6AhwRpS3Iwa6idscNKk_U","pdfSize":"305202"}
