Expanding on the\nrecently introduced module-theoretic generalized cohomology for symmetric\nquandles, we derive a four-term exact sequence that relates 1-cocycles, second\ncohomology, and a specific group of automorphisms associated with the\nextensions of symmetric quandles. This exact sequence shows that the\nobstruction to lifting and extending automorphisms is found in the second\nsymmetric quandle cohomology. Additionally, some general aspects of dynamical\ncocycles and extensions are discussed.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jt5QlM9ikXqEawoAIgott-JFC1wBu0MOLoX8rLyqbpU","pdfSize":"235754"}
