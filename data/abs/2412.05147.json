  "abstract": "  Selfie taking is a popular social pastime, and is an important part of\nsocialising online. This activity is popular with young people but is also\nbecoming more prevalent with older generations. Despite this, there are a\nnumber of accessibility issues when taking selfies. In this research, we\ninvestigate preferences from elderly citizens when taking a selfie, to\nunderstand the current challenges. As a potential solution to address the\nchallenges identified, we propose the use of drones and present a novel concept\nfor hands free selfie taking. With this work, we hope to trigger conversation\naround how such a technology can be utilised to enable elderly citizens, and\nmore broadly people with physical disabilities, the ability to easily take part\nin this social pastime.\n",
