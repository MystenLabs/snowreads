The model extends\nthe two primary treatments of endogeneity in existing bundle choice models: (1)\nendogenous market-level prices and (2) time-invariant unobserved individual\nheterogeneity. A Bayesian sparse factor approach is employed to capture\nhigh-dimensional error correlations that induce taste correlation and\nendogeneity. Time-varying factor loadings allow for more general\nindividual-level and time-varying heterogeneity and endogeneity, while the\nsparsity induced by the shrinkage prior on loadings balances flexibility with\nparsimony. Applied to a soda tax in the context of complementarities, the new\napproach captures broader effects of the tax that were previously overlooked.\nResults suggest that a soda tax could yield additional health benefits by\nmarginally decreasing the consumption of salty snacks along with sugary drinks,\nextending the health benefits beyond the reduction in sugar consumption alone.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"q1FR2tGo8hnhPOKe6RnBLJZDOivOWei7mNilI3GmMT4","pdfSize":"486411"}
