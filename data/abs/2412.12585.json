  "abstract": "  Unitarity provides mathematical and physical constraints on quantum\ninformation systems. e.g., in entanglement swapping, unitarity requires that\nthe same entanglement generation occurs for either an act of measurement or\nparticle interaction. The article's presentation allows particle physicists to\nreadily begin calculating quantum information metrics for any particle\ninteraction. The language of non-relativistic quantum mechanics is presented to\nderive the density matrix for hard scattering. Unitarity allows for finding the\nlatter's cross section without using the scattering amplitude or the\nLippmann-Schwinger equation plus Green's function. For the inelastic scattering\nof an electron from a proton, the language of relativistic quantum mechanics is\nused to derive the momentum entropy or Sackur-Tetrode equation. The latter\nentropy derives from a Shannon entropy and another entropy that evokes the\nuncertainty principle.\n",
