  "abstract": "  Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is indispensable for deploying reliable\nmachine learning systems in real-world scenarios. Recent works, using auxiliary\noutliers in training, have shown good potential. However, they seldom concern\nthe intrinsic correlations between in-distribution (ID) and OOD data. In this\nwork, we discover an obvious correlation that OOD data usually possesses\nsignificant ID attributes. These attributes should be factored into the\ntraining process, rather than blindly suppressed as in previous approaches.\nBased on this insight, we propose a structured multi-view-based\nout-of-distribution detection learning (MVOL) framework, which facilitates\nrational handling of the intrinsic in-distribution attributes in outliers. We\nprovide theoretical insights on the effectiveness of MVOL for OOD detection.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework to others.\nMVOL effectively utilizes both auxiliary OOD datasets and even wild datasets\nwith noisy in-distribution data. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/UESTC-nnLab/MVOL.\n",
