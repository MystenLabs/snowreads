Measuring magnetization switching in an Fe atomic chain under a\ncarefully tuned transverse magnetic field, we observe a non-monotonic variation\nof magnetization lifetimes around a level crossing, known as the diabolic point\n(DP). Near DPs, local environment effects causing QTM are efficiently\nsuppressed, enhancing lifetimes by three orders of magnitude. Adjusting\ninteratomic interactions further facilitates multiple DPs. Our study provides a\ndeeper understanding of quantum dynamics near DPs and enhances our ability to\nengineer a quantum magnet.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aswLdG3LhpQ75KmySBQrrNZk-53XW56E2puKKWLedkM","pdfSize":"4469873"}
