We first present\nnecessary channel conditions for the $\\gamma$ partially correcting\nauthentication capacity region to have nonempty interior. We then give a block\nlength extension scheme which preserves positive rate tuples from a short code\nwith zero probability of $\\gamma$ partial correction error, noting that the\nflexibility of $\\gamma$ partial correction prevents pure codeword concatenation\nfrom being successful. Finally, we offer a case study of a particular AV-MAC\nsatisfying the necessary conditions for partial correction.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"y_iuzgg0Ey8Szjle8IqhYyGP5yK-TofTqqn6HyP5NyM","pdfSize":"209557"}
