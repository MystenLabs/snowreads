In this setting, elementary vectors are\nsupport-minimal vectors that can be determined from maximal minors of a real\nmatrix representing a subspace. By applying the sign function, we obtain the\ncocircuits of the corresponding oriented matroid, which in turn allow the\ncomputation of all sign vectors of a real subspace.\n  As an application, we discuss sign vector conditions for existence and\nuniqueness of complex-balanced equilibria of chemical reaction networks with\ngeneralized mass-action kinetics. The conditions are formulated in terms of\nsign vectors of two subspaces arising from the stoichiometric coefficients and\nthe kinetic orders of the reactions. We discuss how these conditions can be\nchecked algorithmically, and we demonstrate the functionality of our package\nsign_vector_conditions in several examples.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Symbolic Computation","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"idf-Uiz_qawFIweD_uzLcsw9wBuwqdS3vLksrjP9QSs","pdfSize":"206458","objectId":"0x26937b26acda20d6430247d5f7c48f0470aea0d1a5e64964b25b755f66c4d6b2","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
