We find that these solutions describe a non-trivial Kantowski-Sachs\nuniverse, for which we provide an explicit analytical example with all the\ndetails and describe some general features of the singularity.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KNZMbTc42s8Asj4vtofLdmgHJL2zGC6RoPe0lBlVC8Q","pdfSize":"445680"}
