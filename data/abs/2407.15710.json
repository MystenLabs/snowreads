We\nshow that introducing a tilt along the rungs results in a rich phase diagram at\nunit filling. In particular, for a sufficiently strong dipolar strength, the\ninterplay between the long-range tail of the dipolar interactions and the\ntilting leads to the emergence of a quantum floating phase, a critical phase\nwith incommensurate density-density correlations. Interestingly, the study of\nthe entanglement spectrum, reveals that the floating phase is topological,\nconstituting an intermediate gapless stage in the melting of a crystal into a\ngapped topological Haldane phase. This novel scenario for topological floating\nphases in dipolar XXZ ladders can be investigated in on-going experiments.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Whk-9tIXuok3kkxn4b92NS7cfvdScrPRCPLEvKtnXNg","pdfSize":"2282522"}
