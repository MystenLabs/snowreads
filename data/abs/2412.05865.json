Synthesis time and cost remain challenging,\nsignificantly limiting some applications at this stage. In this paper we\ninvestigate efficient synthesis, as it relates to cyclic synchronized synthesis\ntechnologies, such as photolithography. We define performance metrics related\nto the number of cycles needed for the synthesis of any fixed number of bits.\nWe first expand on some results from the literature related to the channel\ncapacity, addressing densities beyond those covered by prior work. This leads\nus to develop effective encoding achieving rate and capacity that are higher\nthan previously reported. Finally, we analyze cost based on a parametric\ndefinition and determine some bounds and asymptotics. We investigate alphabet\nsizes that can be larger than 4, both for theoretical completeness and since\npractical approaches to such schemes were recently suggested and tested in the\nliterature.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"YDv2z9L-GE6Lbl14d0xMlQK-BBWM2aGxKb3tSbKIM5k","pdfSize":"644757"}
