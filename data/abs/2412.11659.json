We provide a full characterization of\nthe conditions under which a QOOT can be properly defined, via a no-go theorem.\nWe use QOOTs to establish a notion of time-reversal for generic quantum\nchannels with respect to a reference observable, enabling the systematic\nconstruction of recovery maps that preserve the latter. These recovery maps,\nalthough generally non-physical, can be decomposed into realizable channels,\nenabling their application in noiseless expectation value estimation tasks. We\nprovide explicit examples and compare our protocol with other error mitigation\nmethods. We show that our protocol retrieves the noiseless expectation value of\nthe reference observable and can achieve optimal sampling overhead,\noutperforming probabilistic error cancellation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"A1T9vV1yekphl2PnbBaw2aI-7DFI6sb_FFEXbcyH6Bk","pdfSize":"583405"}
