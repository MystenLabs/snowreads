In the\nlimit $N\\rightarrow\\infty$, we obtain the semiclassical Einstein equation for\nevery single cloneworld. In the non-relativistic limit, De Filippo had already\nobtained the semiclassical Schr\\\"odinger-Newton equation, we present an\nalternative elementary proof. In the general relativistic case we complete the\nsemi-finished derivation of Hartle and Horowitz. We compare our simple\ncorrelated cloneworlds with Stamp's more complicated proposal of correlated\nworldlines and show why they differ despite the conceptual similarity.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rCZIDU4f54DbvZMCAkkXIzofi1hpcawyrvsYATHsdb0","pdfSize":"121714"}
