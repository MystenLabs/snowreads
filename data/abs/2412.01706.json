We first compute the stress-energy tensor for a\nbinary system, that requires the evaluation of two-point Feynman integrals, up\nto two loops. Then, we extract the multipole moments of the system, which we\npresent for generic orbits in center-of-mass coordinates, and which are needed\nfor the evaluation of the total gravitational energy and the angular momentum\nflux, for generic orbits. Finally, we provide the expression of gauge invariant\nquantities such as the fluxes, and the mode amplitudes and phase of the emitted\ngravitational wave, for circular orbits. Our findings are useful to update\nearlier theoretical studies as well as related phenomenological analyses, and\nwaveform models\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XGqzCa35CjcPfFn4sjIbDDH2FYa-NzVAuTXtk_ceYIE","pdfSize":"381651"}
