  "abstract": "  Hidden sector SUSY breaking where charged hidden sector fields obtain SUSY\nbreaking vevs once seemed common in dynamical SUSY breaking (DSB). In such a\ncase, scalars can obtain large masses but gauginos and A-terms gain\nloop-suppressed anomaly-mediated contributions which may be smaller by factors\nof 1/16\\pi^2 ~1/160. This situation leads to models such as PeV or mini-split\nsupersymmetry with m(scalars)~ 160 m(gauginos). In order to generate a light\nHiggs mass m_h~ 125 GeV, the scalar mass terms are required in the 10-100 TeV\nrange, leading to large, unnatural contributions to the weak scale.\nAlternatively, in gravity mediation with singlet hidden sector fields, then\nm(scalars)~ m(gauginos)~ A-terms and the large A-terms lift m_h ->125 GeV even\nfor natural values of m(stop1)~ 1-3 TeV. Requiring naturalness, which is\nprobabilistically preferred by the string landscape, then the measured Higgs\nmass seems to favor singlets in the hidden sector, which can be common in\nmetastable and retrofitted DSB models.\n",
