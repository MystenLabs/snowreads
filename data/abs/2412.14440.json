  "abstract": "  This paper proposes a dual-color grating chip design method for\nsimultaneously capturing dual atomic clouds (87Rb and 133Cs). By simulating key\nparameters such as the grating period, etching depth, duty cycle, coating\nmaterial, and thickness, the optimal design parameters were determined to\nensure efficient dual-wavelength diffraction and maximize the number of\ncaptured atoms. Experimental results demonstrate the simultaneous trapping of\n1.6E8 87Rb atoms and 7.8E6 133Cs atoms, thereby offering an approach for\nmulti-species cold atom systems. This dual-species grating magneto-optical trap\n(GMOT) system has potential applications in precision measurements such as cold\natom clocks, quantum interferometers, and quantum electrometry.\n",
