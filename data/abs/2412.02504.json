This distribution shows the great differences from the distributions of\npartons in the wave function of the projectile. However, in spite of this\ndifference the entropy of the produced dipoles turns out to be the same as the\nentropy of the dipoles in the wave function. This fact is not surprising since\nin the parton approach only dipoles in the hadron wave function which can be\nproduced at $t = +\\infty$ and measured by the detectors. We can also confirm\nthe result of Kharzeev and Levin that this entropy is equal to $S_E =\n\\ln\\bigl(xG(x)\\bigr)$, where we denote by $xG$ the mean multiplicity of the\ndipoles in the deep inelastic scattering. The evolution equations for\n$\\sigma_n$ are derived.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CKyPBwcqS24bfO1XE0uOK3jgm8T0MwbmSh9fLdjvEUk","pdfSize":"2988891"}
