About 15-20% of the world population is affected by\ndyslexia, which signals it is a concerning subject. A systematic literature\nreview was conducted on this research to evaluate trending interventions,\ncommon accessibility features, and potential barriers to existing assistive\ndevices and to identify any research gaps. Papers published over the period\n(2015-2023) of 8 years were reviewed, and the data was meticulously analyzed.\nThis research shows that technological-based interventions are leading\ninterventions, especially with the use of mobile apps and augmentative\nrealities. More innovative technologies like virtual reality, NLP, haptic, and\ntangible user interfaces are emerging to provide unique solutions addressing\nthe user's needs. Non-computing devices are less effective compared to modern\ndigital solutions however, they provide a promising alternative.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GGsqGRikk5B7c0T6aGuoZDDodH_oSXGL-pSvVcMOmDM","pdfSize":"2605772"}
