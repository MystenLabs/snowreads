  "abstract": "  Let $f$ be a conformal (analytic and univalent) map defined on the open unit\ndisk $\\D$ of the complex plane $\\IC$ that is continuous on the semi-circle\n$\\partial \\D^{+}=\\{z\\in\\IC:|z|=1, {\\rm{Im}}\\,z>0\\}$. The existence of a uniform\nupper bound for the ratio of the length of the image of the horizontal diameter\n$(-1,1)$ to the length of the image of $\\partial \\D^{+}$ under $f$ was proved\nby Gehring and Hayman. In this article, at first, we generalize this result by\nintroducing a simple pole for $f$ in $\\D$ and considering the ratio of the\nlength of the image of the vertical diameter $I=\\{z: {\\rm{Re}}\\,z=0;\n~|{\\rm{Im}}\\,z|<1\\}$ to the length of the image of the semi-circle $C'=\\{z:\n|z|=1;~ {\\rm{Re}}\\,z<0\\}$ under such $f$. Finally, we further generalize this\nresult by replacing the vertical diameter $I$ with a hyperbolic geodesic\nsymmetric with respect to the real line, and by replacing $C'$ with the\ncorresponding arc of the unit circle passing through the point $-1$.\n",
