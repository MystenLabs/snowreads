In particular, we\nstudy the edge Laplacian of a graph twisted by the Kahler structure introduced\nin this paper. We also discuss a metric aspect from a twisted holomorphic\nDolbeault-Dirac spectral triple and show that the points have a finite diameter\nwith respect to Connes' distance.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4MjUSgxgC0JcFnaJBiGA7ublNmDtV_Ios1Cm4ILEDVk","pdfSize":"201660"}
