However, its integration into medical\nsettings brings significant ethical challenges that need careful consideration.\nThis paper examines the current state of AI in healthcare, focusing on five\ncritical ethical concerns: justice and fairness, transparency, patient consent\nand confidentiality, accountability, and patient-centered and equitable care.\nThese concerns are particularly pressing as AI systems can perpetuate or even\nexacerbate existing biases, often resulting from non-representative datasets\nand opaque model development processes. The paper explores how bias, lack of\ntransparency, and challenges in maintaining patient trust can undermine the\neffectiveness and fairness of AI applications in healthcare. In addition, we\nreview existing frameworks for the regulation and deployment of AI, identifying\ngaps that limit the widespread adoption of these systems in a just and\nequitable manner. Our analysis provides recommendations to address these\nethical challenges, emphasizing the need for fairness in algorithm design,\ntransparency in model decision-making, and patient-centered approaches to\nconsent and data privacy. By highlighting the importance of continuous ethical\nscrutiny and collaboration between AI developers, clinicians, and ethicists, we\noutline pathways for achieving more responsible and inclusive AI implementation\nin healthcare. These strategies, if adopted, could enhance both the clinical\nvalue of AI and the trustworthiness of AI systems among patients and healthcare\nprofessionals, ensuring that these technologies serve all populations\nequitably.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computers and Society","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tyjjvUbXHgufpbVtTVO4yr9RHnrzogUR-KaVSdM3oVc","pdfSize":"495168"}
