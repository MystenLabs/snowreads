These are given by balance equations for volume\nfractions, density and momentum for each component accounting for the\nrelaxation to equilibrium by means of relaxation terms. Mathematical properties\nof the models are derived such as hyperbolicity and symmetrization. The fields\nare characterized and corresponding Riemann invariants are determined.\nAppropriate entropy-entropy flux pairs are derived taking into account the\nphasic energy equations including the heat flux. Physically meaningful\nconstraints are presented that ensure the entropy inequality to hold.\nInstantaneous relaxation to equilibrium is investigated and appropriate\nalgorithms are presented. Numerical results for the isothermal Baer-Nunziato\nmodel are compared to an isothermal Euler model and to an isothermal\nphase-field model.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nf0ztZG4tU3z0nJvDZrTFREw6f4WSVGFd_vxrUQHhYs","pdfSize":"1008118"}
