Our model classifies disagreements into three\ncategories: agree, disagree, and neutral. Leveraging the inherent graph\nstructure of Reddit comment-reply pairs, the model significantly outperforms\nexisting benchmarks by capturing complex interaction patterns and sentiment\ndynamics. This research advances graph-based NLP methodologies and provides\nactionable insights for policymakers and educators in climate science\ncommunication.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vtANIgZ9LPOzWW6VLhPNcOBwNE11Ai794FzmbWRKvU4","pdfSize":"768080"}
