At the same time, our notion\ngives a constructive approach to the Kigami-Kameyama notion of topological\nfractals, since a similarity scheme produces a topological fractal a la\nKigami-Kameyama, and many Kigami-Kameyama topological fractals may be\nconstructed via similarity schemes. Our scheme consists of objects\n$X_0\\stackrel{\\varphi}{\\rightarrow}X_1\\stackrel{\\pi}{\\leftarrow} Y\\times X_0$,\nwhere $X_0,X_1$ and $Y$ are compact Hausdorff spaces, the map $\\varphi$ is\ncontinuous injective and the map $\\pi$ is continuous surjective. This scheme\nproduces a sequence $X_n$, $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$, of compact Hausdorff spaces, $X_n$\nembedded in $X_{n+1}$, and a compact Hausdorff space $X_\\infty$ giving a sort\nof injective limit space, which turns out to be self-similar. We observe that\nthe space $Y$ parametrizes the generalized similarity maps, and finiteness of\n$Y$ is not required.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"CCuv8L0SbJwD9xo7DYqnQ1XN89WYO2az83fRPZeVF6E","pdfSize":"286784"}
