It is found that the theoretical results can describe\nthe current experimental measurements. In particular, the results for the\nangular distribution parameters about the differential cross section are\nconsistent with the experiments from BESIII Collaboration. In addition, the\nrelative phase $\\Delta \\Phi$ of the electromagnetic form factors was given, and\nthe spin polarization of $\\Lambda_c^+$ is predicted at center-mass energy $4.7\n\\ \\rm GeV$. It is hopeful to provide a new perspective on the characteristics\nof the charmed baryon $\\Lambda_c^+$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9CVVTpTeLCfop358GtyR47ClnAYkOoHZpuG9-MGsjso","pdfSize":"518622"}
