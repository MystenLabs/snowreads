We conjecture that the\n(1,1)-form $-d(I\\theta)$ is Bott--Chern homologous to a positive (1,1)-current.\nThis conjecture implies that $(M,I)$ does not admit a balanced Hermitian\nmetric. We verify this conjecture for all known classes of LCK manifolds.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"X7MAijjrpy2oAGfG4Qd_OeEdJtMIA-6XoYFVL0d7RJg","pdfSize":"238449"}
