  "abstract": "  Large Language Models (LLMs) show promising learning and reasoning abilities.\nCompared to other NLP tasks, multilingual and multi-label emotion evaluation\ntasks are under-explored in LLMs. In this paper, we present EthioEmo, a\nmulti-label emotion classification dataset for four Ethiopian languages,\nnamely, Amharic (amh), Afan Oromo (orm), Somali (som), and Tigrinya (tir). We\nperform extensive experiments with an additional English multi-label emotion\ndataset from SemEval 2018 Task 1. Our evaluation includes encoder-only,\nencoder-decoder, and decoder-only language models. We compare zero and few-shot\napproaches of LLMs to fine-tuning smaller language models. The results show\nthat accurate multi-label emotion classification is still insufficient even for\nhigh-resource languages such as English, and there is a large gap between the\nperformance of high-resource and low-resource languages. The results also show\nvarying performance levels depending on the language and model type. EthioEmo\nis available publicly to further improve the understanding of emotions in\nlanguage models and how people convey emotions through various languages.\n",
