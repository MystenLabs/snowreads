  "abstract": "  In this paper, through analysis, modelings, and simulations, we show that if\nthe spectra of fast radio bursts (FRBs) are intrinsically quasi-periodic\nspectra, likely produced by coherent curvature radiation from quasi-periodic\nstructured bunches, then the observed steep and shallow spectra, narrow and\nbroadband spectra, multi-frequency simultaneous spectra, as well as possible\nstatistical fringe spectra in FRBs, could all be various manifestations of\nthese intrinsically quasi-periodic spectra. If so, the period properties of the\nstructured bunches, as inferred from the observed multi-frequency simultaneous\nspectra and potential statistical fringe spectra, may provide valuable insights\ninto the mechanisms behind the formation of such structured bunches.\n",
