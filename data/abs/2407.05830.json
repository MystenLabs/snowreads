We investigate the system\nsize scaling properties of the channel conductance and the overall junction\nconductance of an OQR. Ballistic transport is the unhindered flow of a charge\ncarrier within a conductor. Here we find beyond-ballistic transport near both\nthe degenerate and non-degenerate eigenenergies of the ring-Hamiltonian,\ndepending on the ring-to-lead configuration. This is a purely OQR phenomenon\nassociated with the quantum interference effect between two counter-propagating\nelectronic waves having nearly equal and opposite momenta. Thus there is no\nequivalent phenomenon in open quantum junctions with linear channel.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7-FaTWWSFA2tplLZH_TNurRYfWvQho5RA8Lf4t8ajUs","pdfSize":"876097"}
