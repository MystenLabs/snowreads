The trap is imperfect because it is randomly turned off and on, and as a\nresult, particles fail to equilibrate. Another way to think about this is to\nsay that a harmonic trap is time-dependent on account of its strength evolving\nstochastically in time. Particles in such a system are passive and activity\narises through external control of a trapping potential, thus, no internal\nenergy is used to power particle motion. A stationary Fokker-Planck equation of\nthis system can be represented as a third-order differential equation, and its\nsolution, a stationary distribution, can be represented as a superposition of\nGaussian distributions for different strengths of a harmonic trap. This permits\nus to interpret a stationary system as a system in equilibrium with quenched\ndisorder.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6hkFY20uwD0nqBGeNPSRe4cFnnOeMxPW_754C9IrPlk","pdfSize":"481871"}
