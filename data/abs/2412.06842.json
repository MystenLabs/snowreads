  "abstract": "  Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) commonly address ill-posed inverse\nproblems by uncovering unknown physics. This study presents a novel\nunsupervised learning framework that identifies spatial subdomains with\nspecific governing physics. It uses the partition of unity networks (POUs) to\ndivide the space into subdomains, assigning unique nonlinear model parameters\nto each, which are integrated into the physics model. A vital feature of this\nmethod is a physics residual-based loss function that detects variations in\nphysical properties without requiring labeled data. This approach enables the\ndiscovery of spatial decompositions and nonlinear parameters in partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs), optimizing the solution space by dividing it\ninto subdomains and improving accuracy. Its effectiveness is demonstrated\nthrough applications in porous media thermal ablation and ice-sheet modeling,\nshowcasing its potential for tackling real-world physics challenges.\n",
