Model Checking and type checking are currently separate\ntechniques for automatically verifying the correctness of programs. Using\nProperty Based Testing (PBT), Indexed State Monads (ISMs), and dependent types,\nwe are able to model several interesting systems and network protocols, have\nthe type checker verify that our implementation behaves as specified, and test\nthat our model matches the specification's semantics; a step towards combining\nmodel and type checking.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"mm2vC9haLjVZLXlJF08T4Qq6liIWaGsfAsQBlMRj51I","pdfSize":"710773"}
