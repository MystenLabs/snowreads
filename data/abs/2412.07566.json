For three different types of deformations\n(unfoldings, holomorphic, transversally holomorphic) there exist Kuranishi\nspaces $K^f,K^h,K^{tr}$ parametrizing the corresponding families of\ndeformations. We show that $K^f$ is smooth, and that we can obtain $K^h$ as the\nproduct $K^f\\times K^{tr}$. At last, we show that we can see the\n$f$-deformations of $\\mathcal{F}$ as the $tr$-deformations of a supplementary\nfoliation $\\mathcal{G}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QxkYXZvB0qf58jc33YLog7OKjudYHuh2Ee_ZfU2X-sk","pdfSize":"346953"}
