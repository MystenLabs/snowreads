A base station\nequipped with an analog array authenticates users based on the AoA estimated\nfrom certified pilot transmissions, while active attackers manipulate their\ntransmitted signals to mount impersonation attacks. We study several attacks of\nincreasing intensity (captured through the availability of side information at\nthe attackers) and assess the performance of AoA-based authentication using\none-class classifiers. Our results show that some attack techniques with\nknowledge of the combiners at the verifier are effective in falsifying the AoA\nand compromising the security of the considered type of physical layer\nauthentication.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4tAdK0OF1Ulx5iLcIFU_DMJUxWuPJxKLXVG0VE7kfHE","pdfSize":"460875"}
