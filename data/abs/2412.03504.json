  "abstract": "  In a recent article, Donoso, Le, Moreira and Sun studied sets of recurrence\nfor actions of the multiplicative semigroup $(\\mathbb{N}, \\times)$ and provided\nsome sufficient conditions for sets of the form $S=\\{(an+b)/(cn+d) \\colon n \\in\n\\mathbb{N} \\}$ to be sets of recurrence for such actions. A necessary condition\nfor $S$ to be a set of multiplicative recurrence is that for every completely\nmultiplicative function $f$ taking values on the unit circle, we have that\n$\\liminf_{n \\to \\infty} |f(an+b)-f(cn+d)|=0.$ In this article, we fully\ncharacterize the integer quadruples $(a,b,c,d)$ which satisfy the latter\nproperty. Our result generalizes a result of Klurman and Mangerel concerning\nthe pair $(n,n+1)$, as well as some results of Donoso, Le, Moreira and Sun. In\naddition, we prove that, under the same conditions on $(a,b,c,d)$, the set $S$\nis a set of recurrence for finitely generated actions of $(\\mathbb{N},\n\\times)$.\n",
