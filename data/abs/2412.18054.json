Here, a detailed\nanalysis of marginally bound Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi space-times is given in\nemergent modified gravity, which in particular includes a covariant formulation\nof holonomy modifications usually considered in models of loop quantum gravity.\nAs a result, generic collapse in this setting is shown to imply a physical\nsingularity that removes the bouncing behavior seen in vacuum space-times with\nthe same type of modifications.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"l2IIGDWROEdA4Jqfkz05aPq47JZD_tVduC4ZRAjLjSw","pdfSize":"355922"}
