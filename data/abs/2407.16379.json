In 2018 Korhonen showed that if $H$ is a\nconnected reductive subgroup of $G$ which contains a distinguished unipotent\nelement $u$ of $G$ of order $p$, then $H$ is $G$-irreducible in the sense of\nSerre. We present a short and uniform proof of this result using so-called good\n$A_1$ subgroups of $G$, introduced by Seitz. We also formulate a counterpart of\nKorhonen's theorem for overgroups of $u$ which are finite groups of Lie type.\nMoreover, we generalize both results above by removing the restriction on the\norder of $u$ under a mild condition on $p$ depending on the rank of $G$, and we\npresent an analogue of Korhonen's theorem for Lie algebras.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NWOixJmFXMjw4fLM34WDdf5T5TXEthfNWwTfefIBsfk","pdfSize":"317217"}
