As the backbone of next-generation solutions,\nthese robots face a critical challenge: managing and minimizing the swept\nvolume during turns while maintaining precise control. Traditional systems\ndesigned for standard vehicles often struggle with the complex dynamics of\nmulti-axle configurations, leading to inefficiency and increased safety risk in\nconfined spaces. Our innovative framework overcomes these limitations by\ncombining swept volume minimization with Signed Distance Field (SDF) path\nplanning and model predictive control (MPC) for independent wheel steering.\nThis approach not only plans paths with an awareness of the swept volume but\nactively minimizes it in real-time, allowing each axle to follow a precise\ntrajectory while significantly reducing the space the vehicle occupies. By\npredicting future states and adjusting the turning radius of each wheel, our\nmethod enhances both maneuverability and safety, even in the most constrained\nenvironments. Unlike previous works, our solution goes beyond basic path\ncalculation and tracking, offering real-time path optimization with minimal\nswept volume and efficient individual axle control. To our knowledge, this is\nthe first comprehensive approach to tackle these challenges, delivering\nlife-saving improvements in control, efficiency, and safety for multi-axle\nAMRs. Furthermore, we will open-source our work to foster collaboration and\nenable others to advance safer, more efficient autonomous systems.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6Tja69-_dR4T6oFne5-5hVCb3cN6LLJESbxZu2pS94I","pdfSize":"3098245"}
