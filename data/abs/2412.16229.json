In this research, we introduce a simple\napproach for estimating a bird's eye view from images without prior knowledge\nof a given camera's intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. The model is based on\nthe orthogonal projection of objects from various fields of view to a bird's\neye view by learning the vanishing point of a given scene. Additionally, we\nutilised the learned vanishing point alongside the trajectory line to transform\nthe 2D bounding boxes of road users into 3D bounding information. The\nintroduced framework has been applied to several applications to generate a\nlive Map from camera feeds and to analyse social distancing violations at the\ncity scale. The introduced framework shows a high validation in geolocating\nroad users in various uncalibrated cameras. It also paves the way for new\nadaptations in urban modelling techniques and simulating the built environment\naccurately, which could benefit Agent-Based Modelling by relying on deep\nlearning and computer vision.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"EIFPStkDwFmRY8cHe6FxuSUCyUFIK9eX9YmAU4gl9-o","pdfSize":"5829113"}
