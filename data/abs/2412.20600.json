It shows that the\nsmooth deformations of an ideal $\\mathfrak i$ in a Lie algebra $\\mathfrak g$\ndifferentiate to cohomology classes in the cohomology of $\\mathfrak g$ with\nvalues in its adjoint representation on $\\operatorname{Hom}(\\mathfrak i,\n\\mathfrak g/\\mathfrak i)$. The cohomology associated with the ideal $\\mathfrak\ni$ in $\\mathfrak g$ is compared with other Lie algebra cohomologies defined by\n$\\mathfrak i$, such as the cohomology defined by $\\mathfrak i$ as a Lie\nsubalgebra of $\\mathfrak g$ (Richardson, 1969), and the cohomology defined by\nthe Lie algebra morphism $\\mathfrak g \\to \\mathfrak g/\\mathfrak i$.\n  After a choice of complement of the ideal $\\mathfrak i$ in the Lie algebra\n$\\mathfrak g$, its deformation complex is enriched to the differential graded\nLie algebra that controls its deformations, in the sense that its Maurer-Cartan\nelements are in one-to-one correspondence with the (small) deformations of the\nideal. Furthermore, the $L_{\\infty}$-algebra that simultaneously controls the\ndeformations of $\\mathfrak{i}$ and of the ambient Lie bracket is identified.\n  Under appropriate assumptions on the low degrees of the deformation\ncohomology of a given Lie ideal, the (topological) rigidity and stability of\nideals are studied, as well as obstructions to deformations of ideals of Lie\nalgebras.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bBkNchuR7iJlRbg0cRltzdoVtPWd8IqSUxpsduyMGH4","pdfSize":"558938"}
