Our approach focuses on examining the\nrelationships between variable occurrences within conflicts. We propose two\ndual concepts: Minimal Inconsistency Relation (MIR) and Maximal Consistency\nRelation (MCR). Each MIR is a minimal equivalence relation on variable\noccurrences that results in inconsistency, while each MCR is a maximal\nequivalence relation designed to prevent inconsistency. Notably, MIRs capture\nconflicts overlooked by minimal inconsistent subsets. Using MCRs, we develop a\nseries of non-explosive inference relations. The main strategy involves\nrestoring consistency by modifying the propositional base according to each\nMCR, followed by employing the classical inference relation to derive\nconclusions. Additionally, we propose an unusual semantics that assigns truth\nvalues to variable occurrences instead of the variables themselves. The\nassociated inference relations are established through Boolean interpretations\ncompatible with the occurrence-based models.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xng1ZYr0o22jmIjXTYXw7OGg18KONGJATSFsSnqWzgk","pdfSize":"267861"}
