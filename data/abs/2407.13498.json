These form factors are\ncalculated via the distribution amplitudes of the $B_s$-meson. We then\ninterpolate the obtained results by a formula that contains pole at\n$q'^2=M_\\phi^2$ and extract the residue which gives the $B_s\\to \\phi$\ntransition form factors $V(q^2)$ and $T_1(q^2)$. In this way we obtain\ntheoretical predictions for these form factors without invoking quark-hadron\nduality and QCD sum rules. Furthermore, we calculate the relationship between\n$V(0)$ and $T_1(0)$ and the parameter $\\lambda_{B_s}(\\mu)$, the inverse moment\nof the $B_s$-meson distribution amplitude. Using the available predictions for\n$V(0)$ and $T_1(0)$ coming from approaches not referring to the $B_s$-meson\ndistribution amplitudes, we obtain the estimate $\\lambda_{B_s}(\\mu\\simeq\nm_b)=(0.62\\pm 0.10)$ GeV.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AFErPmeYYTUK1LkbCjy5XWbQ6NEpfB_TWVk08RlocYg","pdfSize":"260354"}
