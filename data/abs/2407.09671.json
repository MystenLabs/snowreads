The pair $({\\cal\nH},{\\cal G})$ is an Erd\\H{o}s-P\\'osa pair (EP-pair) if there is a function $f$\nwhere, for every $k$ and every $G\\in{\\cal G},$ either $G$ has $k$ pairwise\nvertex-disjoint subgraphs not belonging to ${\\cal H},$ or there is a set\n$S\\subseteq V(G)$ where $|S|\\leq f(k)$ and $G-S\\in{\\cal H}.$ The classic result\nof Erd\\H{o}s and P\\'osa says that if $\\mathcal{F}$ is the class of forests,\nthen $({\\cal F},{\\cal G})$ is an EP-pair for every ${\\cal G}$. The class ${\\cal\nG}$ is an EP-counterexample for ${\\cal H}$ if ${\\cal G}$ is minimal with the\nproperty that $({\\cal H},{\\cal G})$ is not an EP-pair. We prove that for every\n${\\cal H}$ the set $\\mathfrak{C}_{\\cal H}$ of all EP-counterexamples for ${\\cal\nH}$ is finite. In particular, we provide a complete characterization of\n$\\mathfrak{C}_{\\cal H}$ for every ${\\cal H}$ and give a constructive upper\nbound on its size. Each class ${\\cal G}\\in \\mathfrak{C}_{\\cal H}$ can be\ndescribed as all minors of a sequence of grid-like graphs $\\langle\n\\mathscr{W}_{k} \\rangle_{k\\in \\mathbb{N}}.$ Moreover, each $\\mathscr{W}_{k}$\nadmits a half-integral packing: $k$ copies of some $H\\not\\in{\\cal H}$ where no\nvertex is used more than twice. This gives a complete delineation of the\nhalf-integrality threshold of the Erd\\H{o}s-P\\'osa property for minors and\nyields a constructive proof of Thomas' conjecture on the half-integral\nErd\\H{o}s-P\\'osa property for minors (recently confirmed, non-constructively,\nby Liu). Let $h$ be the maximum size of a graph in ${\\cal H}.$ For every class\n${\\cal H},$ we construct an algorithm that, given a graph $G$ and a $k,$ either\noutputs a half-integral packing of $k$ copies of some $H \\not\\in {\\cal H}$ or\noutputs a set of at most ${2^{k^{\\cal O}_h(1)}}$ vertices whose deletion\ncreates a graph in ${\\cal H}$ in time $2^{2^{k^{{\\cal O}_h(1)}}}\\cdot |G|^4\\log\n|G|.$\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bYiTFjgfhLPMES0Zocu9_S_GBCTdb1I5AjTEyOhbEyw","pdfSize":"6426543","objectId":"0x0bdbf7951755f7ad7fed89eee50525f2d7f7851491121be2d6a1a37dd39c63ed","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
