While\nless precise than previously known doubly exponential bounds derived from\nmethods such as Stratified Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition, our results are\nobtained with minimal additional work, emphasizing simplicity and uniformity.\n  Additionally, we establish the existence of an effective bound on the\ncomplexity of the semialgebraic homeomorphisms that describe representatives of\nthe topological equivalence classes, offering a novel perspective on their\nexplicit classification. These findings complement existing results by\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of uniform bounds within a logical and\ngeometric framework. The paper concludes with an extension of these results to\nsemialgebraic sets of bounded complexity, further emphasizing the uniformity of\nthe approach across varying real closed fields.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-tg7M_fxtANInLFET2fY52HfCgqrWVFXhFOOy4Rz-XI","pdfSize":"150544"}
