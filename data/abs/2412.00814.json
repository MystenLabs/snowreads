By\ncustomizing the Material Point Method (MPM) for real-time simulation of\nhand-induced large deformations and enhancing 3D Gaussian Splatting for\nseamless rendering, VR-Doh provides an interactive and immersive 3D modeling\nexperience. Users can naturally sculpt, deform, and edit objects through both\ncontact- and gesture-based hand-object interactions. To achieve real-time\nperformance, our system incorporates localized simulation techniques,\nparticle-level collision handling, and the decoupling of physical and\nappearance representations, ensuring smooth and responsive interactions. VR-Doh\nsupports both object creation and editing, enabling diverse modeling tasks such\nas designing food items, characters, and interlocking structures, all resulting\nin simulation-ready assets. User studies with both novice and experienced\nparticipants highlights the system's intuitive design, immersive feedback, and\ncreative potential. Compared to existing geometric modeling tools, VR-Doh\noffers enhanced accessibility and natural interaction, making it a powerful\ntool for creative exploration in VR.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Graphics","Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6CqAj8P1cBjE-YbGPlDxQlTjfOzTidrTPU1gAztEKqE","pdfSize":"22498212"}
