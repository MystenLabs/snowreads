  "abstract": "  In this paper, we focus upon the behaviour of spacetime of charged black\nholes described by Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) gravity. With a static\nand spherically symmetric metric, we solve the ensuing field equations obtained\nfrom the EiBI-Maxwell action in the Palatini formalism. Consequently we carry\nout, for the first time, an in-depth analysis of the structure of spacetime\ngeometry in several regions of the charged EiBI black hole. In particular, we\nconsider the analytical behaviours of the metric coefficients and the\nKretschmann scalar by probing their asymptotic nature {\\em analytically} in\ndifferent regions of the black hole spacetime, such as, near the center, in the\nintermediate region, and near the horizon, for both positive and negative EiBI\ncoupling. These analyses give a thorough understanding of the nature of\nspacetime of EiBI-Maxwell black holes. In order to aide our understanding\nfurther, we solve the EiBI-Maxwell field equation numerically with different\nvalues of the parameters involved. We find close agreement between the\nanalytical behaviours and those obtained from numerical integration of the\nEiBI-Maxwell field equation.\n",
