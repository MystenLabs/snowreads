However, the\ninaccuracy and aging variability of battery models and the unavailability of\nadequate ISC datasets pose several challenges for both model-based and\ndata-driven approaches. Thus, in this paper, we proposed a model-free Koopman\nMode-based module-level ISC detection algorithm for battery packs. The\nalgorithm adopts two parallel Koopman mode generation schemes with the Arnoldi\nalgorithm to capture the Kullback-Leibler divergence-based distributional\ndeviations in Koopman mode statistics in the presence of ISC. Our proposed\nalgorithm utilizes module-level voltage measurements to accurately identify the\nshorted battery module of the pack without using specific battery models or\npre-training with historical battery data. Furthermore, we presented two case\nstudies on shorted battery module detection under both resting and charging\nconditions. The simulation results illustrated the sensitivity of the proposed\nalgorithm toward ISC and the robustness against measurement noise.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computer Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8TkaXkdI3luXGd6OfEBMkueKoXPCMe33SUcnwd97Fdg","pdfSize":"1173653"}
