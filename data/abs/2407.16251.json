In order to\nidentify possible attack vectors and take countermeasures at an early stage, it\nis important for individuals and organizations to systematically search for and\nanalyze the data. This paper proposes a classification of data and open-source\nintelligence (OSINT) tools related to identities. This classification helps to\nsystematically search for data. In the next step, the data can be analyzed and\ncountermeasures can be taken. Last but not least, an OSINT framework approach\napplying this classification for searching and analyzing data is presented and\ndiscussed.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"W34UpYywgKDmtfhHGiUva144-1PRVsCvLXQRTadmBho","pdfSize":"446617","objectId":"0xff9494379cd47706edeaa391e7018977203348fe55429c1da191fc61b7dd31e8","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
