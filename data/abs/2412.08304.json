  "abstract": "  We introduce an entanglement measure, the Modified Bloch Norm ($MBN$), for\nfinite-dimensional bipartite mixed states, based on the improved Bloch matrix\ncriteria. $MBN$ is demonstrated to be effective in analyzing the dynamics of\nbound entanglement--a valuable resource for quantum protocols where free\nentanglement may not be available. Through examples, we illustrate the\napplications of $MBN$ in accurately estimating the Entanglement Sudden Death\n(ESD) time and detecting behaviour such as the freezing of bound entanglement.\nAdditionally, we show that the error rate for entanglement measured using state\nestimation from a limited number of measurement copies is significantly lower\nwhen using $MBN$ compared to negativity. This demonstrates the robustness of\n$MBN$ under practical constraints.\n",
