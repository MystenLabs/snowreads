At small Reynolds numbers, 2D Stokes flows\ncan be represented by two analytic functions, known as Goursat functions. Xue,\nWaters and Trefethen [SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 46 (2024), pp. A1214-A1234]\nrecently introduced the LARS algorithm (Lightning-AAA Rational Stokes) for\ncomputing 2D Stokes flows in general domains by approximating the Goursat\nfunctions using rational functions. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm\nfor computing 2D Stokes flows in periodic channels using trigonometric rational\nfunctions, with poles placed via the AAA-LS algorithm [Costa and Trefethen,\nEuropean Congr. Math., 2023] in a conformal map of the domain boundary. We\napply the algorithm to Poiseuille and Couette problems between various periodic\nchannel geometries, where solutions are computed to at least 6-digit accuracy\nin less than 1 second. The applicability of the algorithm is highlighted in the\ncomputation of the dynamics of fluid particles in unsteady Couette flows.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3PG2o_uawqlZ6G_DwXzwQgclKtEIAsMoeIQy4GbCkeE","pdfSize":"4794561","objectId":"0x686252cf9f803fd6b47a6a2b8ed1630c56293d2fc48251b9a165b176de036eac","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
