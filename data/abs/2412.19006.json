  "abstract": "  High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are potential candidates for applications as\nrefractory materials. While dual-phase refractory HEAs containing an ordered\nphase exhibit high hardness, there is high interest in developing\nintermetallic-free and single-phase refractory HEAs with high hardness. In this\nstudy, a new equiatomic HEA ZrHfNbTaW with an ultrahigh hardness of 860 Hv is\ndeveloped. The alloy is first synthesized with a dual-phase structure via arc\nmelting and further homogenized to a single body-centered cubic (BCC) structure\nby phase transformation via high-pressure torsion (HPT), using the concept of\nultra-severe plastic deformation process. The ultrahigh hardness of the alloy,\nwhich is higher than those reported for refractory alloys and single-phase\nHEAs, is attributed to (i) solution hardening by severe lattice distortion,\n(ii) Hall-Petch grain boundary hardening by the formation of nanograins with 12\nnm average size, and (iii) dislocation hardening confirmed by high-resolution\ntransmission electron microscopy.\n",
