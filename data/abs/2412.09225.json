Geostatistical models often rely on the assumptions of stationarity\nand isotropy for practical and conceptual simplicity. However, an alternative\nperspective involves considering non-stationarity, where statistical\ncharacteristics vary across the study area. While previous work has explored\nnon-stationary processes, particularly those leveraging covariate information\nto address non-stationarity, this research expands upon these concepts by\nincorporating multiple covariates and proposing different ways for constructing\nnon-stationary processes. Through a simulation study, the significance of\nselecting the appropriate non-stationary process is demonstrated. The proposed\napproach is then applied to analyse malaria prevalence data in Mozambique,\nshowcasing its practical utility\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"c99flvu2vlJvAv_1xViL2V_2v2TBS3eWNidVqB31hOo","pdfSize":"326125"}
