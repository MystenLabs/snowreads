One of the flow-focusing junctions generates alginate\nhydrogel droplets without the addition of surfactants, while the other junction\nintroduces corn oil with acetic acid, which facilitates the solidification of\nthe homogeneous alginate hydrogel droplets and prevents coalescence. These\nhydrogel microspheres can be easily separated from the oil phase using an\noscillation state, eliminating the need for a demulsifier. This microfluidic\nsystem for hydrogel microsphere formation is notable for its simplicity, ease\nof fabrication, and user-friendliness.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ik0E5F4sElwONrRP4rKzEBzxu6dUOtYK5A6GVdXCFDg","pdfSize":"673484"}
