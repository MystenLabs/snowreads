Starlight is fast: It can provide 6,500 predictions\nper second, allowing the evaluation of millions of configurations per hour.\nStarlight is accurate: It predicts the energy-delay product measured by RTL\nsimulation with 99\\% accuracy. And Starlight can be trained efficiently: It can\nbe trained with 61\\% fewer samples than DOSA's state-of-the-art data-driven\nperformance predictor.\n  Our second contribution is Polaris, a design-space exploration tool that uses\nStarlight to efficiently search the large, complex hardware/software co-design\nspace of DLAs. In under 35 minutes, Polaris produces DLA designs that match the\nperformance of designs that take six hours to produce with DOSA. And in under\n3.3 hours, Polaris produces DLA designs that reduce energy-delay product by\n2.7$\\times$ over the best designs found by DOSA.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iJZemHi6iUZ7RKqZdCXcTSl22nbK8NLX8sXbJzZMLSE","pdfSize":"722079"}
