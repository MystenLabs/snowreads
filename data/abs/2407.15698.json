The slow signal is significantly amplified for a pump field with a\nfrequency higher than that of the signal, and attenuated for a lower pump\nfrequency. We introduce a configuration for obtaining a propagating slow signal\nwithout gain or loss and with a relatively wide bandwidth. This process\ninvolves two strong pump fields with frequencies both higher and lower than\nthat of the signal, where the effects of signal amplification and attenuation\ncompensate each other. We account for thermal fluctuations due to the\nscattering off thermal phonons and identify conditions under which thermal\ncontributions to the signal field are negligible. The slowing of light through\nBrillouin optomechanics may serve as a vital tool for optical quantum\ninformation processing and quantum communications within nanophotonic\nstructures.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"D_oBZ5WxYJKMzn4c4i4Oc_-2vDdehrcHgrYIOwhWNiw","pdfSize":"1303273"}
