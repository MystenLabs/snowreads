By analyzing active filaments\nwith varying degrees of flexibility, we find that fluid-mediated interactions\nsignificantly influence both their conformation and dynamics. These\ninteractions cause polymer conformations to shrink, especially for semiflexible\npolymers at high activity levels, where the average size of wet chains becomes\nnearly three times smaller, due to formation of helix-like structures. This\nhydrodynamic-induced shrinkage is a hallmark of active polymers, as\nfluid-mediated interactions have a minimal effect on the mean conformation of\npassive polymers. Furthermore, for tangentially-driven polymers where activity\nand conformation are coupled, hydrodynamic interactions significantly enhance\nthe orientational and translational dynamics compared to their dry\ncounterparts.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hDG6q3WV_DMgaAeKRVT6RQsR-v_qTzpJvWtJE_tpZzE","pdfSize":"2075421"}
