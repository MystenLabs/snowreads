  "abstract": "  Recent advances in vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated the advantage\nof global modeling capabilities, prompting widespread integration of\nlarge-kernel convolutions for enlarging the effective receptive field (ERF).\nHowever, the quadratic scaling of parameter count and computational complexity\n(FLOPs) with respect to kernel size poses significant efficiency and\noptimization challenges. This paper introduces RecConv, a recursive\ndecomposition strategy that efficiently constructs multi-frequency\nrepresentations using small-kernel convolutions. RecConv establishes a linear\nrelationship between parameter growth and decomposing levels which determines\nthe effective kernel size $k\\times 2^\\ell$ for a base kernel $k$ and $\\ell$\nlevels of decomposition, while maintaining constant FLOPs regardless of the ERF\nexpansion. Specifically, RecConv achieves a parameter expansion of only\n$\\ell+2$ times and a maximum FLOPs increase of $5/3$ times, compared to the\nexponential growth ($4^\\ell$) of standard and depthwise convolutions.\nRecNeXt-M3 outperforms RepViT-M1.1 by 1.9 $AP^{box}$ on COCO with similar\nFLOPs. This innovation provides a promising avenue towards designing efficient\nand compact networks across various modalities. Codes and models can be found\nat \\url{https://github.com/suous/RecNeXt}.\n",
