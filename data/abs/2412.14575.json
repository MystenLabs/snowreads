  "abstract": "  The umbral approach provides methods for comprehending and redefining special\nfunctions. This approach is employed efficiently in order to uncover\nintricacies and introduce new families of special functions. In this article,\nthe umbral perspective is adopted to introduce a hybrid family of\nhypergeometric and Mittag-Leffler functions. The umbral-operational procedures\nare used to derive the generating functions, explicit representations,\ndifferential recurrence formulae, and specific integral formulae. Further, the\nLaplace and Sumudu transforms for the hypergeometric-Mittag-Leffler functions\nare established. The graphical representation and pattern for distribution of\nzeros for suitable values of parameters are also presented.\n",
