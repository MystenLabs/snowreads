  "abstract": "  This review article provides an overview of random matrix theory (RMT) with a\nfocus on its growing impact on the formulation and inference of statistical\nmodels and methodologies. Emphasizing applications within high-dimensional\nstatistics, we explore key theoretical results from RMT and their role in\naddressing challenges associated with high-dimensional data. The discussion\nhighlights how advances in RMT have significantly influenced the development of\nstatistical methods, particularly in areas such as covariance matrix inference,\nprincipal component analysis (PCA), signal processing, and changepoint\ndetection, demonstrating the close interplay between theory and practice in\nmodern high-dimensional statistical inference.\n",
