We uncover a phase transition from a\nzero-field Dirac spin liquid to a field-induced magnetically disordered phase\nthat exhibits the 1/9 magnetization plateau. Through a comprehensive analysis\nencompassing the magnetization distribution, spin correlations, chiral order\nparameter, topological entanglement entropy, ground-state degeneracy, Chern\nnumber and excitation spectrum, we pinpoint the phase associated with this\nmagnetization plateau as a chiral $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ topological quantum spin\nliquid and elucidate its diverse physical properties.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"389a5XfwgRn_Vqgfcf_D6ANCPrjkUqRJvb0RLVKwhCA","pdfSize":"4331512"}
