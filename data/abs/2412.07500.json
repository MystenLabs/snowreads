  "abstract": "  We study the admissible values of the wave speed $c$ for which the beam\nequation with jumping nonlinearity possesses a travelling wave solution. In\ncontrast to previously studied problems modelling suspension bridges, the\npresence of the term with negative part of the solution in the equation results\nin restrictions of $c$. In this paper, we provide the maximal wave speed range\nfor which the existence of the travelling wave solution can be proved using the\nMountain Pass Theorem. We also introduce its close connection with related\nDirichlet problems and their Fu\\v{c}\\'{i}k spectra. Moreover, we present\nseveral analytical approximations of the main existence result with assumptions\nthat are easy to verify. Finally, we formulate a conjecture that the infimum of\nthe admissible wave speed range can be described by the Fu\\v{c}\\'{i}k spectrum\nof a simple periodic problem.\n",
