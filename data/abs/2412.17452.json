This study proposes a Temporal Convolutional Network(TCN) model\nfeaturing a residual block architecture with dilated convolutions to capture\ndependencies in network traffic data while ensuring training stability. The\nTCN's ability to process sequences in parallel enables faster, more accurate\nsequence modeling than Recurrent Neural Networks. Evaluated on the Edge-IIoTset\ndataset, which includes 15 classes with normal traffic and 14 cyberattack\ntypes, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 96.72% and a loss of 0.0688,\noutperforming 1D CNN, CNN-LSTM, CNN-GRU, CNN-BiLSTM, and CNN-GRU-LSTM models. A\nclass-wise classification report, encompassing metrics such as recall,\nprecision, accuracy, and F1-score, demonstrated the TCN model's superior\nperformance across varied attack categories, including Malware, Injection, and\nDDoS. These results underscore the model's potential in addressing the\ncomplexities of network intrusion detection effectively.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Cryptography and Security","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Wm6GvF5-6n4_zvf8d1oYKsGeD4kP5xUwWWWOKCDYf5w","pdfSize":"405198"}
