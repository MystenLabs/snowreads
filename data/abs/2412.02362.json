The latter are poorly characterised at low temperatures. So\nwe cool-down polarising components from room temperature to 4K and monitor the\nevolution of the polarisation properties in this range. We test a zero-order\nhalf-wave plate, a polarising beamsplitting cube and a dichroic polariser in\nthe optical telecommunication range at 1.5$\\mu$m. We show that the polarisation\nis maintained at the $10^{-4}$ level within the whole temperature range. This\nis consistent with the typical thermal contraction of optical materials. This\nlevel of precision is sufficient for many optics experiments at low\ntemperature. We argue that these experiments will allow the design of compact\nfibre based probes for cryogenic surfaces.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rpHj-S9K0J6GbycQIIrojssjCTwrPDmhYIF2vXPEpOc","pdfSize":"404020"}
