We\nargue that applying the monomiality principle yields novel results while\nremaining consistent with established findings. The primary focus of this study\nis the introduction of degenerate multidimensional Hermite-based Appell\npolynomials (DMHAP), denoted as ${}_{\\mathbb{H}}\\mathbb{A}^{[r]}_n(l_1, l_2,\nl_3, \\dots, l_r; \\vartheta)$. These DMHAP form essential families of orthogonal\npolynomials, demonstrating strong connections with classical Hermite and Appell\npolynomials. Additionally, we derive symmetric identities and examine the\nfundamental properties of these polynomials. Finally, we establish an\noperational framework to investigate and develop these polynomials further.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"yBjNh0eFZ-2NbnVvPP225X065rXv1Qu_BzI64KeqgEM","pdfSize":"219721"}
