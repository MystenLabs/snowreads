A recommender system is a subclass of information filtering system\nthat provide suggestions for items that are most pertinent to a particular\nuser. A perceptron or a neural network is a machine learning model designed for\nfitting complex datasets using backpropagation and gradient descent. When\ncoupled with advanced optimization techniques, the model may prove to be a\ngreat substitute for classical logistic classifiers. The optimizations include\nfeature scaling, mean normalization, regularization, hyperparameter tuning and\nusing stochastic/mini-batch gradient descent instead of regular gradient\ndescent. In this use case, we will use the perceptron in the recommender system\nto fit the parameters i.e., the data from a multitude of users and use it to\npredict the preference/interest of a particular user.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tutp4RDsZdRUXiLUS2n1KFz2u8rlEroYms7qpGIS6zA","pdfSize":"1271430"}
