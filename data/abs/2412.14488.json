  "abstract": "  In this paper, we consider an unconstrained stochastic optimization problem\nwhere the objective function exhibits high-order smoothness. Specifically, we\npropose a new stochastic first-order method (SFOM) with multi-extrapolated\nmomentum, in which multiple extrapolations are performed in each iteration,\nfollowed by a momentum update based on these extrapolations. We demonstrate\nthat the proposed SFOM can accelerate optimization by exploiting the high-order\nsmoothness of the objective function $f$. Assuming that the $p$th-order\nderivative of $f$ is Lipschitz continuous for some $p\\ge2$, and under\nadditional mild assumptions, we establish that our method achieves a sample\ncomplexity of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\epsilon^{-(3p+1)/p})$ for finding a\npoint $x$ such that $\\mathbb{E}[\\|\\nabla f(x)\\|]\\le\\epsilon$. To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first SFOM to leverage arbitrary-order smoothness of\nthe objective function for acceleration, resulting in a sample complexity that\nimproves upon the best-known results without assuming the mean-squared\nsmoothness condition. Preliminary numerical experiments validate the practical\nperformance of our method and support our theoretical findings.\n",
