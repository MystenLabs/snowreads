In this work, we explore the remarkably powerful\nformalism of detector error models, which fully captures fault-tolerance at the\ncircuit level. We introduce the detector error model formalism in a pedagogical\nmanner and provide several examples. Additionally, we apply the formalism to\nthree different levels of abstraction in the engineering cycle of\nfault-tolerant circuit designs: finding robust syndrome extraction circuits,\nidentifying efficient measurement schedules, and constructing fault-tolerant\nprocedures. We enhance the surface code's resistance to measurement errors,\ndevise short measurement schedules for color codes, and implement a more\nefficient fault-tolerant method for measuring logical operators.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pkBrKNGOMi8pOOUpx9e-PPIGrn1-CWY7vvnRDy1Ykdw","pdfSize":"1290770"}
