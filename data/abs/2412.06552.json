  "abstract": "  Direct sum theorems state that the cost of solving $k$ instances of a problem\nis at least $\\Omega(k)$ times the cost of solving a single instance. We prove\nthe first such results in the randomised parity decision tree model. We show\nthat a direct sum theorem holds whenever (1) the lower bound for parity\ndecision trees is proved using the discrepancy method; or (2) the lower bound\nis proved relative to a product distribution.\n",
