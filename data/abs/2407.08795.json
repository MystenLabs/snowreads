We focus on three main innovations of NeRF when it comes to\nreconstructing crime scenes: Multi-object Synthesis, Deformable Synthesis, and\nLighting. From there, we analyse its innovation progress against the\nrequirements to be met in order to be able to reconstruct crime scenes with\ngiven videos of such scenes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"d9oJHQ43Onc9BzM6AIj27YiahFvfVnDgz11S6SGAli8","pdfSize":"80872"}
