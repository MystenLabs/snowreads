In this work, Ni NPs are synthesized in aqueous solution\nby a simple and rapid procedure with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as a\ncapping agent, and are extensively characterized by dynamic light scattering\n(DLS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM).\nWe investigated their shape, dimension, and their distribution on the surfaces\nof SiO2 and epitaxial graphene (EG) samples. Ni NPs have an average diameter of\n~11 nm, with a narrow size dispersion, and their arrangement on the surface is\nstrongly dependent on the substrate. EG samples functionalized with Ni NPs are\nfurther characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as made and\nafter thermal annealing above 350{\\deg}C to confirm the degradation of CTAB and\nthe presence of metallic Ni(0). Moreover, high resolution scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy (STM) topographies reveal the structural stability of the NPs up to\n550 {\\deg}C.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cs3CLdzVvaRadff8fTZpRuDY0d4FNeR30lARkOSzI3Q","pdfSize":"2138370"}
