There are certain challenges\nassociated with route planning, such as high cost of implementation, need for\nadequate resource & infrastructure and resistance to change. The goal of this\nresearch is to examine the working, applications, complexity factors,\nadvantages & disadvantages of Floyd- Warshall, Bellman-Ford, Johnson, Ant\nColony Optimization (ACO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), & Grey Wolf\nOptimizer (GWO), to find the best choice for the above application. In this\npaper, comparative analysis of above-mentioned algorithms is presented. The\nFloyd-Warshall method and ACO algorithm are chosen based on the comparisons.\nAlso, a combination of modified Floyd-Warshall with ACO algorithm is proposed.\nThe proposed algorithm showed better results with less time complexity, when\napplied on randomly structured points within a boundary called quasi-structured\npoints. In addition, this paper also discusses the future works of integrating\nFloyd-Warshall with ACO to develop a real-time model for overcoming above\nmentioned-challenges during transportation route planning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"95pGbjyjoEE06rWcdx2R1w1tAmn7bCLU0b6snIt5IEc","pdfSize":"16807134"}
