We provide an example\ndemonstrating that the class of homogeneous derivations is strictly contained\nwithin the class of generalized homogeneous derivations. Furthermore, we extend\nseveral significant results, originally established for prime rings, to the\ncontext of gr-prime rings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"s93C5Bj-Edorp5twsUOk5i-JL7yv9BvznOiF91kzFg8","pdfSize":"142690"}
