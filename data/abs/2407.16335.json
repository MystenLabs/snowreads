We verify that the LAPPD is capable of achieving transit time spreads\nof less than 70 ps and spatial resolutions on the order of millimetres when\nilluminated with single photons. Isolation of the single photoelectron peak is\neasily possible in the pulse height distribution and the mean single\nphotoelectron gain is measured to be greater than $10^{6}$ with gains above\n$10^{7}$ possible in certain voltage configurations. We judge the performance\nof the LAPPD sufficient for application in large-scale water or\nscintillator-based neutrino experiments, with additional work required to\ndevelop the digital signal processing algorithms necessary for processing\nphoton hits in high photon occupancy environments.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZZe8BYOmBvrILBllGGymOwyytqQqA7qX-eXrly982eE","pdfSize":"3099243","objectId":"0xaf811c7e5caa2bc90aa64d8f570e3784d6277f78aa391b6829b76301c6dd6dff","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
