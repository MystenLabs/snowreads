The evolution of\na defect pair exhibits dependence upon their corresponding topological charges,\ninitial separation, and the non-reciprocity coupling constant $\\alpha$. We find\nthat the stability of isolated topologically neutral targets significantly\naffects the pairwise defect interactions. At large separations, defect\ninteractions are negligible and a defect pair is stable. When positioned in\nrelatively close proximity, a pair of oppositely charged spirals or targets\nmerge to form a single target. At low $\\alpha$, like-charged spirals form\nrotating bound pairs, which are however torn apart by spontaneously formed\ntargets at high $\\alpha$. Similar preference for charged or neutral solutions\nis also seen for a spiral target pair where the spiral dominates at low\n$\\alpha$, but concedes to the target at large $\\alpha$. Our work sheds light on\nthe complex phenomenology of non-reciprocal active matter systems when their\ncollective dynamics involves topological defects.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"toibZNSeNxW1Ml7tFVsA3YVGxvX_pjWoAQhGJC3Y-KY","pdfSize":"2914261"}
