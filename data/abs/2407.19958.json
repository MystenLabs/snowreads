A salient feature\nof plasmonic time crystals is their ability to support amplification of both\nlongitudinal and transverse modes. In particular, we show that such systems\nsupport collective resonances of longitudinal modes, independently of the wave\nvector $k$. These resonances originate from the interaction between the\npositive and negative frequency branches of the plasmonic dispersion relation\nof the unmodulated system, and from the divergence of the density of states\nnear the plasma frequency $\\omega_p$. The strongest resonance occurs at a\nmodulation frequency of $\\Omega = 2 \\omega_p$, associated with a direct\ninter-band transition. Higher-order resonances are associated with related\nmechanisms but at lower modulation frequencies. We demonstrate these resonances\nfor various periodic modulation profiles, and also provide a generic\nperturbative formula for resonance widths in the limit of weak modulation\namplitude, in the absence of losses. Our findings offer insights into using\ntime-modulated plasmonic media to enhance optical gain.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_e4GghiOWWQOFER04DH0cWKAEqJs2WZEb1nrxwHCxGY","pdfSize":"857596"}
