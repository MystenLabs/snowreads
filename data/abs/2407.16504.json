Currently, proof methods for\nlow-level MPC protocols are primarily manual and thus tedious and error-prone,\nand are also non-standardized and unfamiliar to most PL theorists. As a step\ntowards better language support and language-based enforcement, we develop a\nnew staged PL for defining a variety of low-level probabilistic MPC protocols.\nWe also formulate a collection of confidentiality and integrity hyperproperties\nfor our language model that are familiar from information flow, including\nconditional noninterference, gradual release, and robust declassification. We\ndemonstrate their relation to standard MPC threat models of passive and\nmalicious security, and how they can be leveraged in security verification of\nprotocols. To prove these properties we develop automated tactics in\n$\\mathbb{F}_2$ that can be integrated with separation logic-style reasoning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"flmtHg7tVpr5z_5J1p40mnnxEJ6ExmeOYoKjtwL2sEY","pdfSize":"339442"}
