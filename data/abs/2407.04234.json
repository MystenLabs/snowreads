Our\nfindings underscore the practicality of metric functionals when searching for\nfixed points of nonexpansive mappings. To demonstrate this, we additionally\ninvestigate subsets of Banach spaces that have only nontrivial metric\nfunctionals. We particularly show that in certain cases every metric functional\nhas a unique minimizer; thus, subinvariance implies the existence of a fixed\npoint.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KGS8vsv0YwZ2cMtCkISVcRDyQE9yYTxn-3Do6xJqCXI","pdfSize":"198931"}
