The system model employs Gaussian prime numbers, ensuring\nthe collaborative generation of a secret key. Pre-processing and\npost-processing functions enable to generate a secret key across the network.\nAn error model evaluates aspects like thermal noise power and channel\nestimation errors, while simulations assess the success rate to factorize the\nnorm of the secret key. It is observed that path loss-induced large scale\nfading emerges as a critical component impacting information and power loss.\nThe robustness of the proposed model under fading channel conditions is\nevaluated with a success rate. Additionally, it is also observed that the\ntolerance value set in the factorization algorithms has a significant impact on\nthe success rate. Furthermore, the success rate is compared in two scenarios,\none with 2 users and another with 3 users, to provide a comprehensive\nevaluation of the system performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7WeMd8BaHZgQh27UJuLY5wpFp263LoK8i9rbdSD42G0","pdfSize":"571574"}
