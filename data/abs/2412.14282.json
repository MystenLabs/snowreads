While\nprevious work has established their capability to detect scalar and vector\nULDM, their potential for detecting spin-2 ULDM remains unexplored. This work\ninvestigates the sensitivity of atom interferometers to spin-2 ULDM by\nconsidering several frameworks for massive gravity: a Lorentz-invariant\nFierz-Pauli case and two Lorentz-violating scenarios. We find that coherent\noscillations of the spin-2 ULDM field induce a measurable phase shift through\nthree distinct channels: coupling of the scalar mode to atomic energy levels,\nand vector and tensor effects that modify the propagation of atoms and light.\nAtom interferometers uniquely probe all of these effects, while providing\nsensitivity to a different mass range from laser interferometers. Our results\ndemonstrate the potential of atom interferometers to advance the search for\nspin-2 dark matter through accessing unexplored parameter space and uncovering\nnew interactions between ULDM and atoms.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_r8VrGZNySzW2vm1TIr914UMK-y9jh4LSg_r9_8OPYQ","pdfSize":"1095001"}
