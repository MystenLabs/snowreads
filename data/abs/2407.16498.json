The\nscheme is based on the $Q_k$ finite element with mass lumping on rectangular\ngrids, the second-order convex splitting method, and the pressure correction\nmethod. The unique solvability, unconditional stability, and bound-preserving\nproperties are rigorously established. The key to bound-preservation is the\ndiscrete $L^1$ estimate of the singular potential. Ample numerical experiments\nare performed to validate the desired properties of the proposed numerical\nscheme.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"G17WOvj_6tIy0g4ekMj1M4htv2d9ZH-Xlv6KAPtmc-o","pdfSize":"6025523"}
