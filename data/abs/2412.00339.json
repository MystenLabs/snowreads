  "abstract": "  Previously, gradual verification has been developed using overapproximating\nlogics such as Hoare logic. We show that the static verification component of\ngradual verification is also connected to underapproximating logics like\nincorrectness logic. To do this, we use a novel definition of gradual\nverification and a novel gradualization of exact logic [Maksimovic et al. 2023]\nwhich we call gradual exact logic. Further, we show that Hoare logic,\nincorrectness logic, and gradual verification can be defined in terms of\ngradual exact logic. We hope that this connection can be used to develop tools\nand techniques that apply to both gradual verification and bug-finding. For\nexample, we envision that techniques defined in terms of exact logic can be\ndirectly applied to verification, bug-finding, and gradual verification, using\nthe principles of gradual typing [Garcia et al. 2016].\n",
