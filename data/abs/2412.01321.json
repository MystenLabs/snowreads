Currently, no efforts have achieved the inverse design of\nFRPCs that target the entire stress-strain curve. Here, we develop\nPC3D_Diffusion, a 3D spatial diffusion model designed for the inverse design of\nFRPCs. We generate 1.35 million FRPCs and calculate their stress-strain curves\nfor training. Although the vanilla PC3D_Diffusion can generate visually\nappealing results, less than 10% of FRPCs generated by the vanilla model are\ncollision-free, in which fibers do not intersect with each other. We then\npropose a loss-guided, learning-free approach to apply physical constraints\nduring generation. As a result, PC3D_Diffusion can generate high-quality\ndesigns with tailored mechanical behaviors while guaranteeing to satisfy the\nphysical constraints. PC3D_Diffusion advances FRPC inverse design and may\nfacilitate the inverse design of other 3D materials, offering potential\napplications in industries reliant on materials with custom mechanical\nproperties.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8jQrCAhFAgZFGPrj8D0UEa89_z_KfEqLv9HHh9jlsg8","pdfSize":"2337567"}
