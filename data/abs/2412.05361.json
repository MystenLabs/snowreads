YIG is a compelling\nmaterial for quantum technologies due to its unique magnetic and optical\nproperties; however, experiments involving YIG have primarily been limited to\nmillimeter-scale spheres. The successful nanofabrication of YIG structures\nopens new avenues for advancing quantum technology applications. Notably, the\nability to co-localize magnons, phonons, and optical photons within a\nnanostructured environment paves the way for novel approaches in quantum\ninformation processing, including quantum wavelength transduction and enhanced\nmagnon-photon interactions. This work marks a significant step toward\nintegrating YIG-based devices into scalable quantum platforms.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"znet7qf1xEUIVdyYTVp5z2qM4E7TlQY8Er9lqRqHQVk","pdfSize":"14676285"}
