  "abstract": "  Panel data consists of a collection of $N$ units that are observed over $T$\nunits of time. A policy or treatment is subject to staggered adoption if\ndifferent units take on treatment at different times and remains treated (or\nnever at all). Assessing the effectiveness of such a policy requires estimating\nthe treatment effect, corresponding to the difference between outcomes for\ntreated versus untreated units. We develop inference procedures that build upon\na computationally efficient matrix estimator for treatment effects in panel\ndata. Our routines return confidence intervals (CIs) both for individual\ntreatment effects, as well as for more general bilinear functionals of\ntreatment effects, with prescribed coverage guarantees. We apply these\ninferential methods to analyze the effectiveness of Medicaid expansion portion\nof the Affordable Care Act. Based on our analysis, Medicaid expansion has led\nto substantial reductions in uninsurance rates, has reduced infant mortality\nrates, and has had no significant effects on healthcare expenditures.\n",
