By employing simultaneous\nlocalization and mapping (SLAM)in tandem with a space carving method (CARV),\nTTI creates a real time 3D surface mesh of remote environments from an RGB\ncamera mounted on a Barrett WAM arm. The generated mesh is integrated into a\nphysics simulator, featuring a digital twin of the WAM robot arm to create a\nvirtual environment. In this virtual environment, TTI provides haptic feedback\ndirectly in response to the operator's movements, eliminating the problem with\ndelayed response from the haptic follower robot. Furthermore, texturing the 3D\nmesh with keyframes from SLAM allows the operator to control the viewpoint of\ntheir Head Mounted Display (HMD) independently of the arm-mounted robot camera,\ngiving a better visual immersion and improving manipulation speed.\nIncorporating predictive visual and haptic feedback significantly improves\nteleoperation in applications such as search and rescue, inspection, and remote\nmaintenance.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gF2KWiV_rNSXKOu1zmwbbjdK5sH0HsApDOB3-r_QrhU","pdfSize":"2293170"}
