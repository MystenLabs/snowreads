For $e$\nlarge compared to $g$, we show that these moduli spaces have at worst terminal\nsingularities. Our main approach is to study the jet schemes of these moduli\nspaces by developing a suitable form of the circle method.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LFuSYN9JvznTC9zB1qfW2CTP4-n6rveIKzi37be4kco","pdfSize":"410551"}
