Taken together, these\nobservations indicate that SDSS J100711.74+193056.2 is a very widely-separated\nand potentially physically-bound companion to Regulus, with a binding energy\nand mass ratio comparable to other wide star-brown dwarf systems. It joins a\ngrowing list of brown dwarfs at the L dwarf/T dwarf transition with independent\nconstraints on physical properties such as age and metallicity.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"0E1OvzCkmDVoViYnAq-UtBlX1asEUesC7a5XPSu8AC8","pdfSize":"1193413"}
