I challenge the view that there is little to no catch-up, and that\nchanges in total factor productivity (TFP) drives cross-country income\ndifferences. Since 2000, income levels in poor countries have converged with\nrich countries at 0.8% annually, rising to 1.5% when excluding Sub-Saharan\nAfrica. A growth accounting exercise incorporating capital income share\nheterogeneity shows that most convergence since 1980, and over half since 2000\noutside Sub-Saharan Africa, results from convergence in physical and human\ncapital inputs rather than TFP.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fyqDjfvL6_uyQ7ygcrKKumf6Df5z5dfoml6lfl-JhHo","pdfSize":"519340"}
