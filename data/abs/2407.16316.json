By capturing light flavor quarks\nand anti-quarks from the vacuum, charm and anti-charm quarks form virtual\ncharmed mesons, which mediate an effective one-boson exchange process. This\napproach accurately reproduces the di-$J/\\psi$ invariant mass spectrum observed\nby CMS and LHCb, demonstrating its validity. Our mechanism offers a\ncomprehensive framework for understanding charmonium scattering and is\napplicable to the scattering problems involving all fully heavy hadrons, an\narea of increasing interest.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"WRaAupydhDZhXUEpHjakZbKFXQLHpNbT9681iS3Rncs","pdfSize":"2185866"}
