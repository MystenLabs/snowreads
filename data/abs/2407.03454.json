For instance,\nevolutionary algorithms have a niche in handling complexities like\ndiscontinuity, non-differentiability, discreteness and non-convexity. However,\nevolutionary algorithms may get computationally expensive for mathematically\nwell behaved problems with large number of variables for which classical\nmathematical programming approaches are better suited. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate a decomposition strategy that allows us to synergistically apply\ntwo complementary approaches at the same time on a complex optimization\nproblem. Evolutionary algorithms are useful in this context as their\nflexibility makes pairing with other solution approaches easy. The\ndecomposition idea is a special case of bilevel optimization that separates the\ndifficulties into two levels and assigns different approaches at each level\nthat is better equipped at handling them. We demonstrate the benefits of the\nproposed decomposition idea on a wide range of test problems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Pok3ITOsAWThd6lLrCyVnugTnyi7lPv6mLmOYAS8b70","pdfSize":"673998"}
