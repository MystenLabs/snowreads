We present a general theoretical framework of reliability,\nplacing emphasis on measuring the association between latent and observed\nscores. This framework was inspired by McDonald's (2011) regression framework,\nwhich highlighted the coefficient of determination as a measure of reliability.\nWe extend McDonald's (2011) framework beyond coefficients of determination and\nintroduce four desiderata for reliability measures (estimability,\nnormalization, symmetry, and invariance). We also present theoretical examples\nto illustrate distinct measures of reliability and report on a numerical study\nthat demonstrates the behavior of different reliability measures. We conclude\nwith a discussion on the use of reliability coefficients and outline future\navenues of research.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"M5U-Q3IpLOvXKOh1zpVtGRIrTF2uY_D_7shLwv8ftNk","pdfSize":"497339"}
