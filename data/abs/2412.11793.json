  "abstract": "  Laser cooling, which cools atomic and molecular gases to near absolute zero,\nis the crucial initial step for nearly all atomic gas experiments. However,\nfast achievement of numerous sub-$\\mu$K cold atoms is challenging. To resolve\nthe issue, we propose and experimentally validate an intelligent polarization\ngradient cooling approach enhanced by optical lattice, utilizing Maximum\nHypersphere Compensation Sampling Bayesian Optimization (MHCS-BO). MHCS-BO\ndemonstrates a twofold increase in optimization efficiency and superior\nprediction accuracy compared to conventional Bayesian optimization. Finally,\napproximate $10^8$ cold atoms at a temperature of 0.4$\\pm$0.2 $\\mu$K can be\nachieved given the optimal parameters within 15 minutes. Our work provides an\nintelligent protocol, which can be generalized to other high-dimension\nparameter optimization problems, and paves way for preparation of ultracold\natom in quantum experiments.\n",
