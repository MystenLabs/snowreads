XL-MIMO uses more\nantennas to both achieve unprecedented spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) and\nexploit new electromagnetic (EM) phenomena occurring in the radiative\nnear-field. The near-field effects provide the XL-MIMO array with depth\nperception, enabling precise localization and spatially multiplexing jointly in\nthe angle and distance domains. This article delineates the distinctions\nbetween near-field and far-field propagation, highlighting the unique EM\ncharacteristics introduced by having large antenna arrays. It thoroughly\nexamines the challenges these new near-field characteristics pose for user\nlocalization and channel estimation and provides a comprehensive review of new\nalgorithms developed to address them. The article concludes by identifying\ncritical future research directions.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"LPASgAISaWW6rUsqzGjFuaPtH7xATHj4njj5G4zkabA","pdfSize":"4308516","objectId":"0x66ad6585e34623e3796b1dd37390407fd7ea48416d27c6284674de471594599b","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
