We observe a well-ordered surface state referred to as a\ndistorted tilted conical spiral (TC) phase over a wide range of magnetic\nfields. The distorted TC phase shows characteristic higher harmonic magnetic\nsatellites in the REXS reciprocal space maps. Skyrmions emerge following static\nmagnetic field cycling and appear to coexist with the distorted TC phase. Our\nresults indicate that this phase represents a distinct and stable surface state\nthat does not disappear with field cycling and persists until the field\nstrength is increased sufficiently to create the field-polarized state.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fMkOG0bE8zmy-vtyqkn45nT6GlFlrLtOMTeZk889UPg","pdfSize":"25359913"}
