We decompose the category into simpler pieces that can be\ndescribed combinatorially, and prove a number of finiteness results, such as\nfinite generation of local cohomology and rationality of Hilbert series.\nFurthermore, we show that this category is equivalent to the category of\nrepresentations of a particular combinatorial category generalizing\n$\\mathbf{FI}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"c7f9t7r1eLies7DLZ7sxo4wWsVmlZz6wQHDhDFM0-yI","pdfSize":"345261"}
