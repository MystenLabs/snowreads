The upgrades of the detector systems used for analysing double gap\nevents are described, and the improvement in data taking capability for such\ndouble gap events is presented.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SEx83DEQUe_Z-xTtmA8rbJrMuRIiODf1stWVimuEosk","pdfSize":"611591"}
