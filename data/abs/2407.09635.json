They have shown potential in a variety of tasks, including\nlinear algebra, search problems, Gibbs and ground state preparation.\nNevertheless, the presence of noise in current day quantum hardware, severely\nlimits their performance. In this work, we introduce dissipative variational\nquantum algorithms (D-VQAs) by incorporating dissipative operations, such as\nqubit RESET and stochastic gates, as an intrinsic part of a variational quantum\ncircuit. We argue that such dissipative variational algorithms posses some\nnatural resilience to dissipative noise. We demonstrate how such algorithms can\nprepare Gibbs states over a wide range of quantum many-body Hamiltonians and\ntemperatures, while significantly reducing errors due to both coherent and\nnon-coherent noise. An additional advantage of our approach is that no ancilla\nqubits are need. Our results highlight the potential of D-VQAs to enhance the\nrobustness and accuracy of variational quantum computations on NISQ devices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"m94_7LPnIL-y-mZezklSaNegB2mB9fLg8h00X8s6CtI","pdfSize":"815608"}
