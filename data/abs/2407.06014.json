This paper examines and\ncompares various machine learning as well as deep learning models to choose the\nmost suitable ones for detecting and fighting against cybersecurity risks. The\ntwo datasets are used in the study to assess models like Naive Bayes, SVM,\nRandom Forest, and deep learning architectures, i.e., VGG16, in the context of\naccuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Analysis shows that Random Forest\nand Extra Trees do better in terms of accuracy though in different aspects of\nthe dataset characteristics and types of threat. This research not only\nemphasizes the strengths and weaknesses of each predictive model but also\naddresses the difficulties associated with deploying such technologies in the\nreal-world environment, such as data dependency and computational demands. The\nresearch findings are targeted at cybersecurity professionals to help them\nselect appropriate predictive models and configure them to strengthen the\nsecurity measures against cyber threats completely.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"4IqGc6Hf756zJmkW_C9jlgJww5hCJfxtZwcPVJOYZu4","pdfSize":"374996"}
