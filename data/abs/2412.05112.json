However, excessive\narousal in a single task has drawbacks, such as overlooking events outside of\nthe task. To examine such a negative aspect, this study constructs a\ncomputational model of arousal dynamics where the excessively increased arousal\nmakes the task transition difficult. The model was developed using functions\nintegrated into the cognitive architecture Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational\n(ACT-R). Under the framework, arousal is treated as a coefficient affecting the\noverall activation level in the model. In our simulations, we set up two\nconditions demanding low and high arousal, trying to replicate corresponding\nhuman experiments. In each simulation condition, two sets of ACT-R parameters\nwere assumed from the different interpretations of the human experimental\nsettings. The results showed consistency of behavior between humans and models\nboth in the two different simulation settings. This result suggests the\nvalidity of our assumptions and has implications of controlling arousal in our\ndaily life.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kybGNpChmxd8ftsagf0oC2Q_oxQ7L5P_vFTdDYem0Sk","pdfSize":"1744381"}
