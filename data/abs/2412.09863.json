In this paper, we\nobtain the best $L^1$-convergence rates to date, for any $\\gamma\\in(1,+\\infty)$\nand $\\nu\\in[0,1)$. Here, $\\gamma$ is the adiabatic gas exponent, and $\\nu$ is\nthe physical parameter in the damping term. The key to the analysis lies in a\nnew perspective on the relationship between the density function and the\nBarenblatt solution of the porous medium equation, and finding the relevant\nlower bound for the case of $\\gamma<2$ is a tricky problem. Specialized to\n$\\nu=0$, these convergence rates also show an essential improvement over the\noriginal rates. Moreover, for all $\\gamma\\in(1,+\\infty)$, the results in this\nwork are the first to present a unified form of $L^1$-convergence rates.\nIndeed, even for $\\nu=0$, as noted in 2011, ``the current rate is difficult to\nimprove with the current method\". Our results are therefore an encouraging\nadvancement.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"rRsFlgVp6VMD8HkfSsgHSAf1N9Wl-pg-LCB46DHjyp8","pdfSize":"296711"}
