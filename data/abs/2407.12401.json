Remove-and-Retrain (ROAR) is a widely accepted approach for\nassessing the importance of individual pixels by measuring changes in accuracy\nfollowing their removal and subsequent retraining of the modified dataset.\nHowever, we uncover notable limitations in pixel-perturbation strategies. When\nviewed from a geometric perspective, we discover that these metrics fail to\ndiscriminate between differences among feature attribution methods, thereby\ncompromising the reliability of the evaluation. To address this challenge, we\nintroduce an alternative feature-perturbation approach named Geometric\nRemove-and-Retrain (GOAR). Through a series of experiments with both synthetic\nand real datasets, we substantiate that GOAR transcends the limitations of\npixel-centric metrics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"N1pevuqsSmGP1fshP5fjBiBzPf2pP0CLwvzzn5d2ac4","pdfSize":"2324235","objectId":"0xf99ee73820c560ef185a0d856d51e01d7b2f353d3bacd7319c3ea0778ff405b6","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
