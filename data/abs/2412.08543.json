  "abstract": "  We develop a ray-tracing model for laser-plasma interaction suitable for\ncoupling in-line into kinetic particle-in-cell plasma simulation. The model is\nbased on inverse Bremsstrahlung absorption and includes oblique incidence\neffects and reflection at the critical surface. The energy deposition is given\nto electrons by randomized kicks to momentum. The model is verified against\nanalytic solutions and a 2-D laser ray-tracing code.\n",
