(SODA'02),\nwhere the goal is to wake up a group of $n$ robots, starting from a single\nactive robot. Our focus is on the geometric version of the problem, where\nrobots are positioned in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, and once activated, a robot can move\nat a constant speed to wake up others. The objective is to minimize the time it\ntakes to activate the last robot, also known as the makespan.\n  We present new upper bounds for the $l_1$ and $l_2$ norms in $\\mathbb{R}^2$\nand $\\mathbb{R}^3$. For $(\\mathbb{R}^2, l_2)$, we achieve a makespan of at most\n$5.4162r$, improving on the previous bound of $7.07r$ by Bonichon et al.\n(DISC'24). In $(\\mathbb{R}^3, l_1)$, we establish an upper bound of $13r$,\nwhich leads to a bound of $22.52r$ for $(\\mathbb{R}^3, l_2)$. Here, $r$ denotes\nthe maximum distance of a robot from the initially active robot under the given\nnorm. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first known bounds for the\nmakespan in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ under these norms.\n  We also explore the FTP in $(\\mathbb{R}^3, l_2)$ for specific instances where\nrobots are positioned on a boundary, providing further insights into practical\nscenarios.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YVSjTtMangUTUncvE97xhbjCv5uAc0X6I4mYlc2R1PM","pdfSize":"600930"}
