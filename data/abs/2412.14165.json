  "abstract": "  Symmetry-resolved entanglement, capturing the refined structure of quantum\nentanglement in systems with global symmetries, has attracted a lot of\nattention recently. In this manuscript, introducing the notion of\nsymmetry-resolved generalized entropies, we aim to develop a computational\nframework suitable for the study of excited state symmetry-resolved\nentanglement as well as the dynamical evolution of symmetry-resolved\nentanglement in symmetry-preserving out-of-equilibrium settings. We illustrate\nour framework using the example of (1+1)-d free massless compact boson theory,\nand benchmark our results using lattice computation in the XX chain. As a\nbyproduct, our computational framework also provides access to the probability\ndistribution of the symmetry charge contained within a subsystem and the\ncorresponding full counting statistics.\n",
