Our approach is\ndivided into three steps. (1) Firstly, we leverage domain expertise and the\nUnified Architecture Framework to establish a reference model that\nfundamentally describes some domain. (2) Subsequently, we instantiate the\nreference model as specific models tailored to different scenarios within the\ndomain. (3) Finally, we incorporate corresponding run logic directly into both\nthe reference model and the specific models. In total, we thus provide a\npractical means to ensure that every implementation result is justified by\nbusiness demand. We demonstrate our approach using the example of maritime\nobject detection as a specific application (specific model / implementation\nelement) of automatic target recognition as a service reoccurring in various\nforms (reference model element). Our approach facilitates a more seamless\nintegration of models and implementation, fostering enhanced Business-IT\nalignment.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"3-0M_1U9fTEB-6Z1QajD3Rcqav0W46uGL1hgH8gimPs","pdfSize":"718783"}
