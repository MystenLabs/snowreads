As all models are wrong, it is desirable to understand these\nestimators' behaviours under model misspecification. We study semiparametric\nmultilevel generalized linear models, where only the conditional mean of the\nresponse is taken to follow a specific parametric form. Pre-existing estimators\nfrom mixed effects models and generalized estimating equations require\nspecificaiton of a conditional covariance, which when misspecified can result\nin inefficient estimates of fixed effects parameters. It is nevertheless often\ncomputationally attractive to consider a restricted, finite dimensional class\nof estimators, as these models naturally imply. We introduce sandwich\nregression, that selects the estimator of minimal variance within a parametric\nclass of estimators over all distributions in the full semiparametric model. We\ndemonstrate numerically on simulated and real data the attractive improvements\nour sandwich regression approach enjoys over classical mixed effects models and\ngeneralized estimating equations.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hdpFXI4mqWOP_GQWW5BgrwLGYmLO4PL-CPMekTXbp5A","pdfSize":"608489"}
