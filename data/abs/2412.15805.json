In this theory, minimum length geodesics are distinct from\nautoparallel geodesics, that is, the ``shortest'' paths are not the\n``straightest'' paths. We show that a standard argument that singles out metric\ngeodesics in general relativity does not apply in modified symmetric\nteleparallel gravity. This is because the latter theory does not obey the\nequivalence principle in the sense of Weinberg. We argue, however, that the\nstructure of the theory makes it inevitable that a freely falling test particle\nfollows a shortest path, a geodesic of the metric. The geodesic equation that\ngoverns the motion of a freely falling test particle involves the Levi-Civita\nconnection, not some other connection obtained by solving the connection field\nequations of the theory. This also has bearing on whether, under appropriate\nconditions, modified symmetric teleparallel gravity is fully equivalent to\ngeneral relativity.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UFdyVEJER-udbaxGoqsOM6LhU6y7BBPy0fpvZ-KKqs8","pdfSize":"124419"}
