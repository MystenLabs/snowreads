I present two\nfamiliar type systems in pursuit of an `Information Aware' style, using\ninformation effects to reveal data flow and help in implementing them. I also\ncalculate a general, scoped, constraint-based representation of typechecking\nproblems from the typing rules.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Programming Languages"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"7xQMgNQNIM7Pq7ClIxofm4JrpwcaOK6nvpMIJP8q13o","pdfSize":"81555"}
