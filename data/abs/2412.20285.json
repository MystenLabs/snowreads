Using empirical data from timber auctions, we\nidentify buyers' tendency to delay consumption to resolve payoff uncertainty\nand reveal heterogeneous motivations among buyers. Through structural\nestimation, we uncover key parameters for each buyer type, including\nsensitivity to realized payoffs and consumption-related costs. Leveraging these\nestimates, we perform counterfactual analyses to propose revenue-enhancing\nconsumption periods and selling mechanisms. Our findings suggest that extending\nthe consumption periods is likely to increase revenue, with the magnitude\ndepending on the selling mechanism, the composition of buyer types, and the\nnumber of interested buyers.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eFXhdsNy9aKTxSa7rANeTanpigL-YOm_A0mWTsoyb90","pdfSize":"1092607"}
