  "abstract": "  We predict the giant ferroelectric control of interfacial properties of\nNi/HfO2, namely, (i) the magnetocrystalline anisotropy and (ii) the inverse\nspin and orbital Rashba effects. The reversible control of magnetic properties\nusing electric gating is a promising route to low-energy consumption magnetic\ndevices, including memories and logic gates. Synthetic multiferroics, composed\nof a ferroelectric in proximity to a magnet, stand out as a promising platform\nfor such devices. Using a combination of $ab$ $initio$ simulations and\ntransport calculations, we demonstrate that reversing the electric polarization\nmodulates the interface magnetocrystalline anisotropy from in-plane to\nout-of-plane. This modulation compares favorably with recent reports obtained\nupon electromigration induced by ionic gating. In addition, we find that the\ncurrent-driven spin and orbital densities at the interface can be modulated by\nabout 50% and 30%, respectively. This giant modulation of the spin-charge and\norbit-charge conversion efficiencies opens appealing avenues for\nvoltage-controlled spin- and orbitronics devices.\n",
