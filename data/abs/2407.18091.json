The OSEFT describes the so\ncalled eikonal or semi-classical optical limit, allowing for corrections\norganized in a systematic expansion on inverse powers of the photon energy. We\nderive the OSEFT from the Maxwell Lagrangian, and study its different\nproperties, such as the gauge symmetry and reparametrization invariance. The\ntheory can be finally formulated in terms of a gauge invariant vector gauge\nfield, without the need to introduce gauge-fixing. We then use the OSEFT to\ncompute corrections to the Wigner photon function, and derive its associated\nside jump effect from reparametrization invariance. Finally, we discuss how to\nproperly define the Stokes parameters from transport theory once quantum\neffects are considered, so as to preserve their well-defined properties under\nLorentz transformations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TEl84wtXLU62VfNzhASFT9PNE8bDTdHnFD-P3O70AkE","pdfSize":"307141"}
