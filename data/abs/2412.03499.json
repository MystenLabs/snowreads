{"id":"2412.03499","title":"Testing the Universality of Self-Organized Criticality in Galactic,\n  Extra-Galactic, and Black-Hole Systems","authors":"Markus Aschwanden and Ersin Gogus","authorsParsed":[["Aschwanden","Markus",""],["Gogus","Ersin",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2024 17:40:44 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-05","timestamp":1733334044000,"abstract":"  In this study we are testing whether the power law slopes ($\\alpha_F$,\n$\\alpha_E$) of fluxes $(F)$, fluences or energies $(E)$ are universal in their\nsize distributions, $N(F) \\propto F^{-\\alpha_F}$ and $N(E) \\propto\nE^{-\\alpha_E}$, in astrophysical observations of galactic, extragalactic, and\nblack-hole systems. This is a test of fundamental importance for self-organized\ncriticality (SOC) systems. The test decides whether (i) power laws are a\nnatural consequence of the scale-freeness and inherent universality of SOC\nsystems, or (ii) if they depend on more complex physical scaling laws. The\nformer criterion allows quantitative predictions of the power law-like size\ndistributions, while the later criterion requires individual physical modeling\nfor each SOC variable and data set. Our statistical test, carried out with 61\npublished data sets, yields strong support for the former option, which implies\nthat observed power laws can simply be derived from the scale-freeness and do\nnot require specific physical models to understand their statistical\ndistributions. The observations show a mean and standard deviation of\n$\\alpha_F=1.78\\pm0.29$ for SOC fluxes, and $\\alpha_E=1.66\\pm0.22$ for SOC\nfluences, and thus are consistent with the prediction of the fractal-diffusive\nSOC model, with $\\alpha_F=1.80$ and $\\alpha_E=1.67$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XMUykFeDiNd06YgMeHuXRqBt6nRjRHavxbBysPBUeus","pdfSize":"256849"}
