  "abstract": "  We show that a nonchiral atom can act as an antenna to induce a photoelectron\ncircular dichroism in a nearby chiral molecule in a three-step process: The\ndonor atom (antenna) is initially resonantly excited by circularly polarized\nradiation. It then transfers its excess energy to the acceptor molecule by\nmeans of resonant interatomic Coulombic decay. The latter finally absorbs the\nenergy and emits an electron which exhibits the aforementioned circular\ndichroism in its angular distribution. We study the process on the basis of the\nretarded dipole--dipole interaction and report an asymptotic analytic\nexpression for the distance-dependent chiral asymmetry of the photoelectron as\ninduced by resonant interatomic Coulombic decay for random line-of-sight and\nacceptor orientations. In the nonretarded limit, the predicted chiral asymmetry\nis reversed as compared to that of a direct photoelectron circular dichroism of\nthe molecule.\n",
