Therefore, we propose a data-centric evaluation framework.\nWe select 10 relevant datasets from Kaggle competitions and implement\nexpert-level preprocessing pipelines for each dataset. We conduct experiments\nwith different preprocessing pipelines and hyperparameter optimization (HPO)\nregimes to quantify the impact of model selection, HPO, feature engineering,\nand test-time adaptation. Our main findings are: 1. After dataset-specific\nfeature engineering, model rankings change considerably, performance\ndifferences decrease, and the importance of model selection reduces. 2. Recent\nmodels, despite their measurable progress, still significantly benefit from\nmanual feature engineering. This holds true for both tree-based models and\nneural networks. 3. While tabular data is typically considered static, samples\nare often collected over time, and adapting to distribution shifts can be\nimportant even in supposedly static data. These insights suggest that research\nefforts should be directed toward a data-centric perspective, acknowledging\nthat tabular data requires feature engineering and often exhibits temporal\ncharacteristics.
