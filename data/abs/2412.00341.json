This review focuses on\nsystematically analyzing how these two approaches can be synergistically\nintegrated to enhance performance and robustness across diverse application\ndomains. By addressing key obstacles such as modality discrepancies, limited\ndata availability, and insufficient model robustness, this paper highlights the\nrole of physics-based optimization frameworks in facilitating efficient and\ninterpretable adversarial perturbation generation. The review also explores\nsignificant advancements in cross-modal adversarial learning, including\napplications in tasks such as image cross-modal retrieval (e.g., infrared and\nRGB matching), scientific computing (e.g., solving partial differential\nequations), and optimization under physical consistency constraints in vision\nsystems. By examining theoretical foundations and experimental outcomes, this\nstudy demonstrates the potential of combining these approaches to handle\ncomplex scenarios and improve the security of multi-modal systems. Finally, we\noutline future directions, proposing a novel framework that unifies physical\nprinciples with adversarial optimization, providing a pathway for researchers\nto develop robust and adaptable cross-modal learning methods with both\ntheoretical and practical significance.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"iAD4TSaoLnDiNZNn1FUf5Wd-nGQApbb6sfg98a39WUU","pdfSize":"89321"}
