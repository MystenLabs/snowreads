In this scheme, the adaptive spatial modulation\n(ASM)-based antennas selection works at the receiver by employing the\ncharacteristics of the RIS in each time slot, where the signal-to-noise ratio\nat specific selected antennas can be further enhanced with near few powers.\nBesides for the bits from constellation symbols, the extra bits can be mapped\ninto the indices of receive antenna combinations and conveyed to the receiver\nthrough the ASM-based antenna-combination selection, thus providing higher\nspectral efficiency. To explicitly present the RASM scheme, the analytical\nperformance of bit error rate of it is discussed in this paper. As a trade-off\nselection, the proposed scheme shows higher spectral efficiency and remains the\nsatisfactory error performance. Simulation and analytical results demonstrate\nthe better performance and exhibit more potential to apply in practical\nwireless communication.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Performance","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dGH8kikrcorO3_LdvlNdjZ7RcdboM7HPOOZH4UC61oQ","pdfSize":"3545355"}
