  "abstract": "  This study develops a systematic approach for evaluating the effect of a\ntreatment on a time-to-event outcome in a matched-pair study. While most\nmethods for paired right-censored outcomes allow determining an overall\ntreatment effect over the course of follow-up, they generally lack in providing\ndetailed insights into how the effect changes over time. To address this gap,\nwe propose novel tests for paired right-censored outcomes using randomization\ninference. We further extend our tests to matched observational studies by\ndeveloping corresponding sensitivity analysis methods to take into account\ndepartures from randomization. Simulations demonstrate the robustness of our\napproach against various non-proportional hazards alternatives, including a\ncrossing survival curves scenario. We demonstrate the application of our\nmethods using a matched observational study from the Korean Longitudinal Study\nof Aging (KLoSA) data, focusing on the effect of social engagement on survival.\n",
