  "abstract": "  Autonomous driving systems (ADS) have achieved remarkable progress in recent\nyears. However, ensuring their safety and reliability remains a critical\nchallenge due to the complexity and uncertainty of driving scenarios. In this\npaper, we focus on simulation testing for ADS, where generating diverse and\neffective testing scenarios is a central task. Existing fuzz testing methods\nface limitations, such as overlooking the temporal and spatial dynamics of\nscenarios and failing to leverage simulation feedback (e.g., speed,\nacceleration and heading) to guide scenario selection and mutation. To address\nthese issues, we propose SimADFuzz, a novel framework designed to generate\nhigh-quality scenarios that reveal violations in ADS behavior. Specifically,\nSimADFuzz employs violation prediction models, which evaluate the likelihood of\nADS violations, to optimize scenario selection. Moreover, SimADFuzz proposes\ndistance-guided mutation strategies to enhance interactions among vehicles in\noffspring scenarios, thereby triggering more edge-case behaviors of vehicles.\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate that SimADFuzz outperforms\nstate-of-the-art fuzzers by identifying 32 more unique violations, including 4\nreproducible cases of vehicle-vehicle and vehicle-pedestrian collisions. These\nresults demonstrate SimADFuzz's effectiveness in enhancing the robustness and\nsafety of autonomous driving systems.\n",
