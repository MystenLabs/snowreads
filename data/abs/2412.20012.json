(2024)\nintroduced a family of metrics on Cayley trees (the $k$-RF distance, for $k=0,\n\\ldots, n-2$) and explored their distribution on pairs of random Cayley trees\nvia simulations. In this paper, we investigate this distribution\nmathematically, and derive exact asymptotic descriptions of the distribution of\nthe $k$-RF metric for the extreme values $k=0$ and $k=n-2$, as $n$ becomes\nlarge. We show that a linear transform of the $0$-RF metric converges to a\nPoisson distribution (with mean 2) whereas a similar transform for the\n$(n-2)$-RF metric leads to a normal distribution (with mean $\\sim ne^{-2}$).\nThese results (together with the case $k=1$ which behaves quite differently,\nand $k=n-3$) shed light on the earlier simulation results, and the predictions\nmade concerning them.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"zBWSJygZo95lP7KHtlH5mjIK0mAmkpWC6SHhfy1h4SU","pdfSize":"805043"}
