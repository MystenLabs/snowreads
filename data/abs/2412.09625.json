Traditional methods, such as shadow art and wire art,\ncreate interesting 3D illusions but are limited to simple visual outputs (i.e.,\nfigure-ground or line drawing), restricting their artistic expressiveness and\npractical versatility. Recent diffusion-based illusion generation methods can\ngenerate more intricate designs but are confined to 2D images. In this work, we\npresent a simple yet effective approach for creating 3D multiview illusions\nbased on user-provided text prompts or images. Our method leverages a\npre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to optimize the textures and geometry\nof neural 3D representations through differentiable rendering. When viewed from\nmultiple angles, this produces different interpretations. We develop several\ntechniques to improve the quality of the generated 3D multiview illusions. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments and\nshowcase illusion generation with diverse 3D forms.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7bxDbWGTCENZfvScc7CJ6TlMG3bZe-VomV5VdPXFiKk","pdfSize":"39573862"}
