Existing retrieval-augmented-based hallucination detection\napproaches typically address this by framing it as a classification task,\nevaluating hallucinations based on their consistency with retrieved evidence.\nHowever, this approach usually lacks detailed explanations for these\nevaluations and does not assess the reliability of these explanations.\nFurthermore, deficiencies in retrieval systems can lead to irrelevant or\npartially relevant evidence retrieval, impairing the detection process.\nMoreover, while real-world hallucination detection requires analyzing multiple\npieces of evidence, current systems usually treat all evidence uniformly\nwithout considering its relevance to the content. To address these challenges,\nwe introduce Halu-J, a critique-based hallucination judge with 7 billion\nparameters. Halu-J enhances hallucination detection by selecting pertinent\nevidence and providing detailed critiques. Our experiments indicate that Halu-J\noutperforms GPT-4o in multiple-evidence hallucination detection and matches its\ncapability in critique generation and evidence selection. We also introduce\nME-FEVER, a new dataset designed for multiple-evidence hallucination detection.\nOur code and dataset can be found in https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/factool .\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jLfif6w0iBtZ5crOLGsuZxsdpZ9HtNGYBU8_vkxzr7M","pdfSize":"542448"}
