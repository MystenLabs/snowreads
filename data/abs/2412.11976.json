  "abstract": "  Synchronization is ubiquitous in nature at various scales and fields. This\nphenomenon not only offers a window into the intrinsic harmony of complex\nsystems, but also serves as a robust probe for many-body quantum systems. One\nsuch system is a supersolid: an exotic state that is simultaneously superfluid\nand solid. Here, we show that putting a supersolid under rotation leads to a\nsynchronization of the crystal's motion to an external driving frequency\ntriggered by quantum vortex nucleation, revealing the system's dual\nsolid-superfluid response. Benchmarking the theoretical framework against\nexperimental observations, we exploit this model as a novel method to\ninvestigate the critical frequency required for vortex nucleation. Our results\nunderscore the utility of synchronization as a powerful probe for quantum\nsystems.\n",
