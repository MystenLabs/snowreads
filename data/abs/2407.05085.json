In essence, our\ncharacterization relates the presence of canonical CS to basis-covariant\nvectors corresponding to particular bases of the defining representation of the\northogonal Lie algebras. For N=3,4 and 5, the conditions demand little\ncomputational effort to be evaluated, and we provide practical algorithms that\nmay be efficiently implemented in a computer program, for deciding whether or\nnot a potential is custodial-symmetric.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XwKam3N6SO5ajYEr4HKnhLhDhBwl7tfGHF3WihLlvr0","pdfSize":"326339"}
