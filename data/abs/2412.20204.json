When dynamics are\nmisspecified, filtered values of state variables often do not satisfy model\nrestrictions, making them hard to interpret, and parameter estimates may fail\nto characterize the dynamics of filtered variables. To address this, a\nsequential optimal transportation approach is used to generate a\nmodel-consistent sample by mapping observations from a flexible reduced-form to\nthe structural conditional distribution iteratively. Filtered series from the\ngenerated sample are model-consistent. Specializing to linear processes, a\nclosed-form Optimal Transport Filtering algorithm is derived. Minimizing the\ndiscrepancy between generated and actual observations defines an Optimal\nTransport Estimator. Its large sample properties are derived. A specification\ntest determines if the model can reproduce the sample path, or if the\ndiscrepancy is statistically significant. Empirical applications to trend-cycle\ndecomposition, DSGE models, and affine term structure models illustrate the\nmethodology and the results.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wLN4TIIiJuxE1aKoSn3eKrAkZWa9sqAws7PVpUvJkTg","pdfSize":"2749935"}
