Our study shows\ndifferences in the professionalisation of content monetisation between\ncountries, yet consistent patterns; significant differences in the frequency of\nposts yet similar user engagement trends; and significant differences in the\ndisclosure of sponsored content in some countries, with a direct connection\nwith national legislation. We analyse shifts in marketing strategies due to\nlegislative and platform feature changes, focusing on how content creators\nadapt disclosure methods to different legal environments. We also analyse the\nimpact of disclosures and sponsored posts on engagement and conclude that,\nalthough sponsored posts have lower engagement on average, properly disclosing\nads does not reduce engagement further. Our observations stress the importance\nof disclosure compliance and can guide authorities in developing and monitoring\nthem more effectively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qH53lPTzX38FeqvRoqV7hiFEK96kOSrrKk8giBlDjgQ","pdfSize":"743402","objectId":"0x3baddcd7954470ad1c0ffd398819f117928cfb12d0988749ede05bb4c09fc1e2","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
