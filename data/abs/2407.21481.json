However, implementing MTHD presents challenges for design researchers\nand practitioners, such as understanding non-verbal species. Despite the\ntechniques developed to facilitate such an understanding (e.g. contact zone),\nthe growing literature on MTHD lacks studies reflecting on how these techniques\nare utilized in the design process. In this paper, we present a case study on\ndesigning olive harvesting tools from a MTH lens, where designers used contact\nzone, plant interviews, plant persona, and experience map to explore the\nperspectives of olive trees and incorporate them into ideas in collaboration\nwith farmers and agricultural engineers. The results indicate the significance\nof reconsidering decentralization in MTHD from the standpoint of entanglements\namong techniques and incorporating various knowledge types to manage tensions\narising from perspective shifts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EKRgU9hCkXpXuNuWNau8vtyosNcbKpDiZI6QNtyZuLo","pdfSize":"1506719"}
