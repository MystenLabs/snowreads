In the quaternionic projective\nspace they include geodesic hyperspheres of arbitrary radius $r \\in (0, \\pi/2)$\nexcept one, two series of tubes about canonically embedded quaternionic\nprojective spaces of lower dimensions and two particular tubes about a\ncanonically embedded $\\mathbb CP^m \\subset \\mathbb HP^m $. On the other hand,\nthe list of 2-type curvature-adapted hypersurfaces with constant principal\ncurvatures in $\\mathbb HH^m$ is reduced to geodesic spheres and tubes of\narbitrary radius about totally geodesic quaternionic hyperplane $\\mathbb\nHH^{m-1}.$ Among these hypersurfaces we determine those that are mass-symmetric\nor minimal. We also show that the horosphere $H_3$ in $\\mathbb HH^m $ is not of\nfinite type but satisfies $\\Delta^2\\widetilde x =$ const.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SNHE9vhc7rsDZiXuP6P7fJr4FWNqaAaMdyY-APFYzwk","pdfSize":"366447","objectId":"0xc5ffc4dcc4e0c6248ac64fdedb827a578120507bf1e298e34c7e890c03310612","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
