This paper introduces a novel Bayesian\napproach using Quantum Bayesian Networks (QBNs) to classify imbalanced\ndatasets, focusing on differentiating ``oil-spill'' from ``non-spill'' classes\nin satellite-derived data. By employing QBNs, which combine probabilistic\nreasoning with quantum state preparation, we effectively address the challenge\nof integrating quantum enhancements with classical machine learning\narchitectures. While the integration improves key performance metrics, it also\nuncovers areas for refinement, highlighting the need for customized strategies\nto address specific challenges and optimize outcomes. Our study demonstrates\nsignificant advances in detecting and classifying anomalies, contributing to\nmore effective and precise environmental monitoring and management.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JtBa5GcUBH05sIjCKsMDdjaDq0qpUo-kp7uw9X4YnX8","pdfSize":"5791724"}
