This paper presents a robust fault tolerant control scheme that\nis designed to meet the control challenges encountered by such robots, i.e.,\ndiscrete actuator inputs, complex system modeling and cross-coupling between\nactuators. In the proposed scheme, a desired vectorial system output, such as a\nposition or a force, is commanded by recruiting actuators based on their\ninfluence vectors on the output. No analytical model of the system is needed;\ninfluence vectors are identified experimentally by sequentially activating each\nactuator. For position control tasks, the controller uses a probabilistic\napproach and a genetic algorithm to determine an optimal combination of\nactuators to recruit. For motion control tasks, the controller uses a sliding\nmode approach and independent recruiting decision for each actuator.\nExperimental results on a four degrees of freedom binary manipulator with\ntwenty actuators confirm the method's effectiveness, and its ability to\ntolerate massive perturbations and numerous actuator failures.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KNHTGGyHnHBwgQGWbu0dFJi2tbzdytW7-ya1QxjTKUI","pdfSize":"1956014"}
