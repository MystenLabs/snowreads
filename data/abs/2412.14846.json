  "abstract": "  Head and neck tumors and metastatic lymph nodes are crucial for treatment\nplanning and prognostic analysis. Accurate segmentation and quantitative\nanalysis of these structures require pixel-level annotation, making automated\nsegmentation techniques essential for the diagnosis and treatment of head and\nneck cancer. In this study, we investigated the effects of multiple strategies\non the segmentation of pre-radiotherapy (pre-RT) and mid-radiotherapy (mid-RT)\nimages. For the segmentation of pre-RT images, we utilized: 1) a fully\nsupervised learning approach, and 2) the same approach enhanced with\npre-trained weights and the MixUp data augmentation technique. For mid-RT\nimages, we introduced a novel computational-friendly network architecture that\nfeatures separate encoders for mid-RT images and registered pre-RT images with\ntheir labels. The mid-RT encoder branch integrates information from pre-RT\nimages and labels progressively during the forward propagation. We selected the\nhighest-performing model from each fold and used their predictions to create an\nensemble average for inference. In the final test, our models achieved a\nsegmentation performance of 82.38% for pre-RT and 72.53% for mid-RT on\naggregated Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) as HiLab.
