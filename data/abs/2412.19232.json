To accomplish this, we present an efficient\napproach for decomposing $d$-band diagonal matrices into Pauli strings that are\ngrouped into mutually commuting sets.\n  Using numerical simulations of the one-dimensional wave equation, we show\nthat higher-order methods can reduce the number of qubits necessary for\ndiscretization, similar to the classical case, although they do not decrease\nthe number of Trotter steps needed to preserve solution accuracy. This result\nhas important consequences for the practical application of quantum algorithms\nbased on Hamiltonian evolution.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computer Science/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_uzvu6E5psUN89eNot1OLY7901mbY4sxKpchaI7ckmw","pdfSize":"977798"}
