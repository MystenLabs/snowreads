This work formulates a data-driven (semi-blind) joint channel and\nsymbol estimation algorithm for beyond diagonal RIS that avoids a prior\npilot-assisted stage while providing decoupled estimates of the involved\ncommunication channels. The proposed receiver builds upon a PARATUCK tensor\nmodel for the received signal, from which a trilinear alternating estimation\nscheme is derived. Preliminary numerical results demonstrate the proposed\nmethod's performance for selected system setups. The symbol error rate\nperformance is also compared with that of a linear receiver operating with\nperfect knowledge of the cascaded channel.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0iCcbUFj924AaJJLVmXhUSbKnTTqk_kqgtlnVUJMuc4","pdfSize":"520919"}
