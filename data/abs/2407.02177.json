The minsum flow\nproblem has been widely studied for its relevance in finding evacuation routes\nduring emergencies such as earthquakes. However, previous approaches often\nassume that individuals are separable and identical, which does not adequately\naccount for the fact that some groups of people, such as families, need to move\ntogether and that some groups may be more important than others. To address\nthese limitations, we modify the minsum flow problem to support flows\nrepresented as discrete and weighted sets. We also propose a 2-approximation\npseudo-polynomial time algorithm to solve this modified problem for path\nnetworks with uniform capacity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"j6sXIH3j3gH2jkb309RfirUE5iu0VLl1uIVtIiqoZzs","pdfSize":"534900"}
