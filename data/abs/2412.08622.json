We particularly focus\non Leray-Hopf solutions, i.e. on analytically weak solutions satisfying energy\ninequality. Introducing a new kind of energy related functional into the\ntechnique of convex integration enables the construction of infinitely many\nsuch solutions that are probabilistically strong for a certain initial value.\nFurthermore, we provide global i time estimates which lead to the existence of\ninfinitely many stationary and even ergodic Leray--Hopf solutions. These\nresults represent the first construction of Leray-Hopf solutions in the\nframework of stochastic shear-thinning fluids within this range of power-law\nindices.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Kdp3qoyBKHzO-Kc7tVkRPMvh7ZG7S2NAyAddYTa97zw","pdfSize":"1589843"}
