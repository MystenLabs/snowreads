Subtracting\ninterstellar polarization, estimated from a sample of field stars, we derive\nthe intrinsic polarization of A0620$\\unicode{x2013}$00. We show that the\nintrinsic polarization degree (PD) is variable with the orbital period with the\namplitude of $\\sim0.3\\%$ at least in the $R$ band, where the signal-to-noise\nratio of our observations is the best. It implies that some fraction of the\noptical polarization is produced by scattering of stellar radiation off the\nmatter that follows the black hole in its orbital motion. In addition, we see a\nrotation of the orbit-average intrinsic polarization angle (PA) with the\nwavelength from $164\\deg$ in the $R$ to $180\\deg$ in the $B$ band. All of the\nabove, combined with the historical NIR to optical polarimetric observations,\nshows the complex behavior of average intrinsic polarization of\nA0620$\\unicode{x2013}$00 with the PA making continuous rotation from infrared\nto blue band by $\\sim56\\deg$ in total, while the PD $\\sim1\\%$ remains nearly\nconstant over the entire spectral range. The spectral dependence of the PA can\nbe described by Faraday rotation with the rotation measure of RM=$-0.2$ rad\n$\\mu$m$^{-2}$, implying a few Gauss magnetic field in the plasma surrounding\nthe black hole accretion disk. However, our preferred interpretation for the\npeculiar wavelength dependence is the interplay between two polarized\ncomponents with different PAs. Polarimetric measurements in the UV range can\nhelp distinguishing between these scenarios.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LVYKmpYuIlFCL3QFH_eknHAwyDljxagoqR80kgZWcz0","pdfSize":"1607988"}
