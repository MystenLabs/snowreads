The key step in\nthe proof is identifying the limits of the contributions from deformations as\nthe area derivatives of the Wilson loop expectations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"cOdMEExxQ-iS2c8bXgJePt4K4aGzS-VRA8PXrXTcOaY","pdfSize":"537585"}
