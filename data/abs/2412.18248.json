  "abstract": "  Accurate diagnosis of Parkinson disease, especially in its early stages, can\nbe a challenging task. The application of machine learning techniques helps\nimprove the diagnostic accuracy of Parkinson disease detection but only few\nstudies have presented work towards the prediction of disease progression. In\nthis research work, Long Short Term Memory LSTM was trained using the\ndiagnostic features on Parkinson patients speech signals, to predict the\ndisease progression while a Multilayer Perceptron MLP was trained on the same\ndiagnostic features to detect the disease. Diagnostic features selected using\ntwo well-known feature selection methods named Relief-F and Sequential Forward\nSelection and applied on LSTM and MLP have shown to accurately predict the\ndisease progression as stage 2 and 3 and its existence respectively.\n",
