  "abstract": "  CeRh2As2 is rare among superconductors, in that magnetic field tunes it\nbetween two distinct superconducting phases. Combined with a lack of local\ninversion symmetry and an upper critical field exceeding the Pauli paramagnetic\nlimit, this excitingly suggests triplet multicomponent superconductivity.\nPreceding the superconducting onset, f-electron correlations cause long-range\norder, attributed both to local antiferromagnetism and itinerant (quadrupole)\ndensity-waves. Magnetic field provides a significant perturbation of the\nf-electron and may reveal the nature of the many-body correlations. Thus, we\nreport comprehensive magnetization and magnetotransport studies on\nmicrostructured devices in fields of up to 73 T. Applied along the c-axis,\nfield causes a low-temperature valence transition at {\\mu}0H ~ 24 T. By\ncontrast, in-plane fields produce a cascade of phase transitions; the\nfield-induced in-plane conductivity anisotropy and lack of accompanying\nmagnetic features, plus the closed-dome nature of the overall phase boundary is\nconsistent with a hierarchy of field-induced density-wave states.\n",
