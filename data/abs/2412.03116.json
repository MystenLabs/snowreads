For this reason,\ntemperature sensing and imaging using lifetime-based luminescence thermometers\nis of high interest for wide range of specific applications. However, for most\nsuch thermometers, an increase in temperature leads to a shortening in\nlifetime, which can hinder the specificity and accuracy of the readout. In this\nwork, we present an approach that utilizes a thermally induced increase in the\nsymmetry of the host material associated with a structural phase transition in\nLiYO2:Yb3+. Consequently, the lifetime of the excited level 2F5/2 of the Yb3+\nion is thermally prolonged, achieving a relative sensitivity of 0.5%/K. The\nphase transition temperature can be controlled by adjusting the dopant\nconcentration. Additionally, thermal changes in the emission spectrum enable\nthe use of LiYO2:Yb3+ for ratiometric temperature readout with a relative\nsensitivity of 5.3%/K at 280K for LiYO2:5%Yb3+.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"79YGdrRBCedtTGNXQguzgzmfLCuvIRHExZhdkZLdTDc","pdfSize":"1564115"}
