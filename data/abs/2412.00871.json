Heavy-ion\ncollisions from the RHIC beam energy scan phase II (BES-II) provide an unique\nopportunity to understand these at high baryon densities.\n  In these proceedings, we present a systematic study on energy dependence of\nthe directed flow ($v_{1}$) for $\\Lambda$ and hyper-nuclei ($^{3}_{\\Lambda}{\\rm\nH}$, $^{4}_{\\Lambda}{\\rm H}$) from mid-central Au+Au collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 3.2, 3.5, 3.9 and 4.5 GeV, collected by the STAR\nexperiment with the fixed-target mode during BES-II. The rapidity (y)\ndependence of the hyper-nuclei $v_{1}$ is studied in mid-central collisions.\nThe extracted $v_{1}$ slopes ($\\mathrm{d}v_{1}/\\mathrm{d}y|_{y=0}$) of the\nhyper-nuclei are positive and decrease gradually as the collision energy\nincreases. These hyper-nuclei results are compared to that of light-nuclei\nincluding p, d, t/$\\rm ^{3}He$ and $\\rm ^{4}He$. Finally, these results are\ncompared with a hadronic transport model including coalescence after-burner.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CwvLTQEJdHJtCtL4rPPhS976n9U4Mo0NPH7sqk8EQDc","pdfSize":"210975"}
