  "abstract": "  Let $k\\geq 2$ and fix a $k$-uniform hypergraph $\\mathcal{F}$. Consider the\nrandom process that, starting from a $k$-uniform hypergraph $\\mathcal{H}$ on\n$n$ vertices, repeatedly deletes the edges of a copy of $\\mathcal{F}$ chosen\nuniformly at random and terminates when no copies of $\\mathcal{F}$ remain. Let\n$R(\\mathcal{H},\\mathcal{F})$ denote the number of edges that are left after\ntermination. We show that $R(\\mathcal{H},\\mathcal{F})=n^{k-1/\\rho\\pm o(1)}$,\nwhere $\\rho:=(\\lvert E(\\mathcal{F})\\rvert-1)/(\\lvert V(\\mathcal{F})\\rvert -k)$,\nholds with high probability provided that $\\mathcal{F}$ is strictly\n$k$-balanced and $\\mathcal{H}$ is sufficiently dense with pseudorandom\nproperties. Since we may in particular choose $\\mathcal{F}$ and $\\mathcal{H}$\nto be complete graphs, this confirms the major folklore conjecture in the area\nin a very strong form.\n",
