  "abstract": "  This paper presents an easy-to-implement approach to mitigate the challenges\nposed by barren plateaus (BPs) in randomly initialized parameterized quantum\ncircuits (PQCs) within variational quantum algorithms (VQAs). Recent\nstate-of-the-art research is flooded with a plethora of specialized strategies\nto overcome BPs, however, our rigorous analysis reveals that these challenging\nand resource heavy techniques to tackle BPs may not be required. Instead, a\ncareful selection of distribution \\emph{range} to initialize the parameters of\nPQCs can effectively address this issue without complex modifications. We\nsystematically investigate how different ranges of randomly generated\nparameters influence the occurrence of BPs in VQAs, providing a straightforward\nyet effective strategy to significantly mitigate BPs and eventually improve the\nefficiency and feasibility of VQAs. This method simplifies the implementation\nprocess and considerably reduces the computational overhead associated with\nmore complex initialization schemes. Our comprehensive empirical validation\ndemonstrates the viability of this approach, highlighting its potential to make\nVQAs more accessible and practical for a broader range of quantum computing\napplications. Additionally, our work provides a clear path forward for quantum\nalgorithm developers seeking to mitigate BPs and unlock the full potential of\nVQAs.\n",
