In this paper, we address the challenge\nof optimizing fantasy cricket team selection using reinforcement learning (RL)\ntechniques. By framing the team creation process as a sequential\ndecision-making problem, we aim to develop a model that can adaptively select\nplayers to maximize the team's potential performance. Our approach leverages\nhistorical player data to train RL algorithms, which then predict future\nperformance and optimize team composition. This not only represents a huge\nbusiness opportunity by enabling more accurate predictions of high-performing\nteams but also enhances the overall user experience. Through empirical\nevaluation and comparison with traditional fantasy team drafting methods, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of RL in constructing competitive fantasy teams.\nOur results show that RL-based strategies provide valuable insights into player\nselection in fantasy sports.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"SHEH9Wbvs65iFIaJCLgwEIXoHlkLi1aHn3mtl3ZF3LA","pdfSize":"998580"}
