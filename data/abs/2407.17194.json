We have identified and\napplied the conditions for adsorption-controlled homoepitaxial growth of\nc-plane sapphire. The films thus grown are atomically smooth, have a controlled\ntermination, and are of outstanding crystallinity. Their chemical purity\nexceeds that of the substrates. The films exhibit exceptional optical\nproperties such as a single-crystal-like bandgap and a low density of F+\ncenters.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"6oYO-2Q6AGfNzszbYhlNRgkOzS3_tcOFv8Vaxp-MtTk","pdfSize":"1023454"}
