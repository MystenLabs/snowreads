A relevant discussion and\nrelated technical challenge is the potential replication and plagiarism of the\ntraining set in AI-generated music, which could lead to misuse of data and\nintellectual property rights violations. To tackle this issue, we present the\nMusic Replication Assessment (MiRA) tool: a model-independent open evaluation\nmethod based on diverse audio music similarity metrics to assess data\nreplication. We evaluate the ability of five metrics to identify exact\nreplication by conducting a controlled replication experiment in different\nmusic genres using synthetic samples. Our results show that the proposed\nmethodology can estimate exact data replication with a proportion higher than\n10%. By introducing the MiRA tool, we intend to encourage the open evaluation\nof music-generative models by researchers, developers, and users concerning\ndata replication, highlighting the importance of the ethical, social, legal,\nand economic consequences. Code and examples are available for reproducibility\npurposes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ay97Ek2llzQ2CNDyLyI49BGssND5QuHfyKF-8_mzojk","pdfSize":"445713"}
