We first present the black brane solution for this model\nand subsequently calculate the color non-abelian DC conductivity for this\nsolution using AdS/CFT duality. Our results retrieve the Yang-Mills model in\nthe limit as $q_1$ approaches zero.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_HsSD9P0MFjU3Lj1eWhwCPVO77kJwE7q29P-FLmM4EU","pdfSize":"150924"}
