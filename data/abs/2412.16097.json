While BD-RIS has been\nprimarily analyzed assuming uni-polarized systems, modern wireless deployments\nare dual-polarized. To address this gap, this paper investigates the\nfundamental limits of dual-polarized BD-RIS-aided systems. We derive the\nscaling laws governing the performance of BD-RIS and the Pareto frontier of the\ntrade-off between performance and circuit complexity enabled by BD-RIS.\nTheoretical results show that the group-connected RIS with group size 2\nprovides remarkable gains over conventional RIS in both Rayleigh and\nline-of-sight (LoS) channels, while maintaining a reduced circuit complexity.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bvN_6fVCbgnwDNLnyynHYrl5wPTJ8gVvDxO2_0U4fEo","pdfSize":"368221"}
