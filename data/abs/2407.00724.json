Dealing with quantum\nsystems, a serious challenge arises due to substantial growth of the underlying\nHilbert space with the system size. As the statistics of the measurement data\nobserved, i.e. the likelihood, can no longer be easily computed, common\napproaches such as maximum-likelihood estimators or particle filters become\nimpractical. To address this issue, we propose the use of the Approximate\nBayesian Computation (ABC) algorithm, which evades likelihood computation by\nsampling from a library of measurement data -- a priori prepared for a given\nquantum device. We apply ABC to interpret photodetection click-patterns arising\nwhen probing in real time a two-level atom and an optomechanical system. For\nthe latter, we consider both linear and non-linear regimes, in order to show\nhow to tailor the ABC algorithm by understanding the quantum measurement\nstatistics. Our work demonstrates that fast parameter inference may be possible\nno matter the complexity of a quantum device and the measurement scheme\ninvolved.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"m237P5cuet5DjOHAhSEHSMmIUmoIGEN4J0l43cojrow","pdfSize":"1593994"}
