The narrow openings provide drones with access to\nan infrastructure component such as charging stations to charge their depleted\nbatteries and hangars for storage. The flight patterns are a staging area\n(queues) that match the rate at which an infrastructure component and its\nopenings process drones. They prevent collisions and may implement different\npolicies that control the order in which drones pass through an opening. We\nillustrate the flight patterns with a 3D display that uses drones configured\nwith light sources to illuminate shapes.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Multimedia","Computer Science/Emerging Technologies","Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"y0rnHfX1r1Y5oV0SfuhG4yOOto4b51pQRMq77C5hZ4I","pdfSize":"2255497"}
