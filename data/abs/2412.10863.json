However, by studying\nits Dedekind-MacNeille completion DM(RS), one may reveal new important\nproperties of rough set structures. Building upon D. Umadevi's work on\ndescribing joins and meets in DM(RS), we previously investigated pseudo-Kleene\nalgebras defined on DM(RS) for reflexive relations. This paper delves deeper\ninto the order-theoretic properties of DM(RS) in the context of reflexive\nrelations. We describe the completely join-irreducible elements of DM(RS) and\ncharacterize when DM(RS) is a spatial completely distributive lattice. We show\nthat even in the case of a non-transitive reflexive relation, DM(RS) can form a\nNelson algebra, a property generally associated with quasiorders. We introduce\na novel concept, the core of a relational neighborhood, and use it to provide a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for DM(RS) to determine a Nelson algebra.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Computer Science/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hrCZceX6znWD7YBiDvDPQN7hK0sRF_qLqejQ3Dd5BMQ","pdfSize":"488849"}
