  "abstract": "  Let $G$ be a connected simple graph on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. Denote\n$N_{i}^{(j)}(G)$ the number of spanning subgraphs of $G$ having precisely $i$\nedges and not more than $j$ connected components. The graph $G$ is\n\\emph{strong} if $N_{i}^{j}(G)\\geq N_{i}^{j}(H)$ for each pair of integers\n$i\\in \\{0,1,\\ldots,m\\}$ and $j\\in \\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}$ and each connected simple\ngraph $H$ on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. The graph $G$ is\n\\emph{Whitney-maximum} if for each connected simple graph $H$ on $n$ vertices\nand $m$ edges there exists a polynomial $P_H(x,y)$ with nonnegative\ncoefficients such that $W_{G}(x,y)-W_H(x,y)=(1-xy)P_H(x,y)$, where $W_G$ and\n$W_H$ stand for the Whitney polynomial of $G$ and $H$. In this work it is\nproved that a graph is strong if and only if it is Whitney-maximum.\nConsequently, the $0$-element conjecture proposed by Boesch [J.\\ Graph Theory\n10 (1986), 339--352] is true when restricted to graph classes in which\nWhitney-maximum graphs exist.\n",
