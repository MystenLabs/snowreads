In two dimensions, we find a topological nodal superconducting\nphase, which exhibits a chiral Majorana mode propagating along the edges of\nnanoribbons with cylindrical boundary conditions. This phase is however\nunstable in a finite two-dimensional rectangular-shaped lattice, yielding\ncorner states close to zero energy in a flake with alternating zigzag and\narmchair edges. When we reduce one of the dimensions, quantum confinement gaps\nout the bulk bands faster than the edge states. In this scenario, hybridization\nbetween the edge states can then result in Majorana zero modes. Our results\nhence suggest quantum confinement as a crucial ingredient in building\nquasi-one-dimensional topological superconducting phases out of two-dimensional\nnodal topological superconductors. Furthermore, we characterize the emergence\nof this novel topological phase by means of its topological invariant,\ncoinciding with a quantized conductance of $2 e^2/h$ in a\nnormal-superconducting junction.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lKN2-FHvNWrptoPA_bP_e6fMG9qqx5Ro5VcY-UTScoo","pdfSize":"9133352"}
