  "abstract": "  It is known that there exist complex solvmanifolds $(\\Gamma\\backslash G,J)$\nwhose canonical bundle is trivialized by a holomorphic section which is not\ninvariant under the action of $G$. The main goal of this article is to classify\nthe six-dimensional Lie algebras corresponding to such complex solvmanifolds,\nthus extending the previous work of Fino, Otal and Ugarte for the invariant\ncase. To achieve this, we complete the classification of six-dimensional\nsolvable strongly unimodular Lie algebras admitting complex structures and\nidentify among them, the ones admitting complex structures with Chern-Ricci\nflat metrics. Finally we construct complex solvmanifolds with non-invariant\nholomorphic sections of their canonical bundle. In particular, we present an\nexample of one such solvmanifold that is not biholomorphic to a complex\nsolvmanifold with an invariant section of its canonical bundle. Additionally,\nwe discover a new $6$-dimensional solvable strongly unimodular Lie algebra\nequipped with a complex structure that has a non-zero holomorphic $(3,0)$-form.\n",
