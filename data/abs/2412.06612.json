  "abstract": "  Leveraging reciprocal-space proximity effect between superconducting bulk and\ntopological surface states (TSSs) offers a promising way to topological\nsuperconductivity. However, elucidating the mutual influence of bulk and TSSs\non topological superconductivity remains a challenge. Here, we report\npioneering transport evidence of a thickness-dependent transition from\nconventional to unconventional superconductivity in 2M-phase WS2 (2M-WS2). As\nthe sample thickness reduces, we see clear changes in key superconducting\nmetrics, including critical temperature, critical current, and carrier density.\nNotably, while thick 2M-WS2 samples show conventional superconductivity, with\nan in-plane (IP) upper critical field constrained by the Pauli limit, samples\nunder 20 nm exhibit a pronounced IP critical field enhancement, inversely\ncorrelated with 2D carrier density. This marks a distinct crossover to\nunconventional superconductivity with strong spin-orbit-parity coupling. Our\nfindings underscore the crucial role of sample thickness in accessing\ntopological states in 2D topological superconductors, offering pivotal insights\ninto future studies of topological superconductivity.\n",
