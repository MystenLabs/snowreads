Here, we propose a simple\nself-interaction correction by applying an effective core potential (ECP) that\nreplaces no electrons: we dub this the self-interaction potential (SIP). ECPs\nare already implemented in all major quantum chemistry codes and so there is\nminimal effort required by developers and users to access our correction. The\ngoal of SIPs is to reduce the overly severe SIE - commonly manifesting as the\nunphysical delocalization of an electron over two or more nuclei, or even over\nan entire chemical system. We propose two first generation SIPs (optimized SIPs\nand subtraction SIPs) that can reduce the SIE in various one-electron test\nsystems and a hydrogen transfer reaction. Our tests show improvements for\nsystems that suffer from predominantly functional- or density-driven errors,\npointing at the potential robustness of the approach. Herein, the viability of\nSIPs is demonstrated in a proof-of-concept study and several avenues for\nimprovement are identified that will help with the construction of future\ngenerations of SIPs.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"nl-ZphGT4W1I_-wiz3Ur9r4Asi9v2REJlPr9-AdXnUo","pdfSize":"905764","objectId":"0x4d37ad8e4afc0527300af43119d7eb231042117573c21565ae8f9f1b9cbcda82","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
