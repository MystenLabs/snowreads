Beside this, they are tempting from a functional materials\npoint of view: Topological materials bear potential for an enhanced\nthermoelectric efficiency because they possess the required ingredients, such\nas intermediate carrier concentrations, large mobilities, heavy elements etc.\nAgainst this background, this work reports an enhanced thermoelectric\nperformance of the topological Dirac semimetal Cd$_{3}$As$_{2}$ upon alloying\nthe trivial semiconductor Zn$_{3}$As$_{2}$. This allows to gain fine-tuned\ncontrol over both the band filling and the band topology in\nCd$_{3-x}$Zn$_{x}$As$_{2}$. As a result, the thermoelectric figure of merit\nexceeds 0.5 around $x = 0.6$ and $x = 1.2$ at elevated temperatures. The former\nis due to an enhancement of the power factor, while the latter is a consequence\nof a strong suppression of the thermal conductivity. In addition, in terms of\nfirst-principle band structure calculations, the thermopower in this system is\ntheoretically evaluated, which suggests that the topological aspects of the\nband structure change when traversing $x = 1.2$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OXSRWZRDEZUZ3y_KYOSUwrcifkqFj164EFGzKdG78iA","pdfSize":"6421001"}
