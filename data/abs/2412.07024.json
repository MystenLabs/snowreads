  "abstract": "  We investigate the existence of compact self-dual solitons in the restricted\ngauged baby Skyrme model in the presence of a magnetic impurity. The consistent\nimplementation of the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) formalism depends on\nthe relative size between the compacton and the impurity. To address this, we\nanalyze the following scenarios: in the first, the impurity is entirely inside\nthe compacton, and in the second, the impurity fully encircles the compacton.\nIn both cases, the approach has enabled us to set the self-dual potential,\nachieve the Bogomol'ny bound for the energy, and establish the self-dual or BPS\nequations whose solutions saturate such a bound. We next focused on obtaining\nradially symmetric compactons, where for such an aim, we chose two types of\nfunctions to solve the BPS system: the first defining a step-type impurity and\nthe second a Gaussian impurity. After solving the BPS system numerically, we\ndepicted the resulting field profiles and highlighted the effects induced on\nthe compacton's size, field profiles, magnetic field, and magnetic flux.\n",
