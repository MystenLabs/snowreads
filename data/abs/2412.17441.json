  "abstract": "  We describe various types of traveling fronts of bistable reaction-diffusion\ncellular automata. These dynamical systems with discrete time, space, and state\nspaces can be seen as fully discrete versions of widely studied bistable\nreaction-diffusion equations. We show that moving traveling waves for high\ndiffusion parameters are restricted to slow speeds and their profiles are\ninterestingly not unique. Pinned waves always exist for weak diffusion as in\nthe case of lattice equations but do not complement parametric region of moving\ntraveling waves. The remaining parameter domain is dominated by waves which are\nunique to cellular automaton settings. These higher-order traveling waves move\nand periodically change profile at the same time.\n",
