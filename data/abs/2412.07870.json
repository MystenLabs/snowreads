We report on\nseveral remarkable features of output fields such as transparency, quantum\nnonreciprocity and the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ values\nless than unity. In particular, for two qubits detuned antisymmetrically with\nrespect to the central waveguide frequency, we find transparency in forward\ntransmission and in photon numbers for arbitrary values of the input powers\nprovided the phase separation between qubits is an integer multiple of $\\pi$.\nValues of $g^{(2)}(0)$ less than unity can be reached even for nonzero value of\nthe intrinsic damping by using phase separation different from integer multiple\nof $\\pi$, marking the transition from classical to quantum light. We also\nuncover a new type of quantum criticality that enables complete suppression of\nforward-propagating amplitude transmission at specific driving powers, giving\nrise to enhanced nonreciprocal effects in both transmission and quantum\nfluctuations in amplitudes. Forward propagation amplifies the quantum\nfluctuations in amplitudes, while backward propagation significantly suppresses\nthem. These findings open new pathways for controlling light-matter\ninteractions in chiral quantum electrodynamics, with potential applications in\nquantum information and nonreciprocal quantum devices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UDevq3tgRB_f3pDqABM-lsI5zLTZd5AvP16HLpVnjAI","pdfSize":"1559777"}
