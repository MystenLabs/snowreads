The\npaper presents a systematization of knowledge (SoK) of this paradigm by the\nmeans of a systematic mapping study and a scoping review of relevant\nliterature. According to the mapping and review, the paradigm has been\nextensively discussed, used, and developed further since the late 1990s.\nPartially driven by the insecurity of the Internet of things, the volume of\npublications has accelerated from the circa mid-2010s onward. The publications\nreviewed indicate that the paradigm has been adopted in numerous different\ncontexts. It has also been expanded with security design principles not\noriginally considered when the paradigm was initiated in the mid-1970s. Among\nthe newer principles are an \"off by default\" principle, various overriding and\nfallback principles, as well as those related to the zero trust model. The\nreview also indicates problems developers and others have faced with the\nparadigm.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Cryptography and Security","Computer Science/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computer Science/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wLrgycTulHKwBrmgEw8siaBwqcTYXdekGGasqd7QaPw","pdfSize":"949471"}
