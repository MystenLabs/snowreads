In this study, we thoroughly compare the\nshot-noise model with experimental observations of optical transition radiation\n(OTR) generated by a relativistic electron bunch ($\\gamma \\approx$ 50),\ntransiting an Aluminium metal surface. The bunch parameters are close to those\nproposed for a stage in an Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), where the bunch size is\nmuch larger than the OTR wavelength being measured. Here we present\nmeasurements and particle tracking results of both the low-level noise for the\nEIC bunch parameters and longitudinal space-charge-induced microbunching for\nthe chicane-compressed bunch with coherent OTR enhancements up to 100 times in\nthe various bandwidth-filtered near-infrared (NIR) OTR photodiode signals. We\nalso discuss the corresponding limitations of the OTR method.\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"63oFyJf5Xxb_i4irjbCKioS8VhTg8kOu2us1R4FVQs0","pdfSize":"1436784"}
