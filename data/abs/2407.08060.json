Capturing that some property holds under\nsuch an assumption in a logical formula is challenging and error-prone,\nparticularly in the modal $\\mu$-calculus. In this paper, we present template\nformulae in the modal $\\mu$-calculus that can be instantiated to a broad range\nof liveness properties. We consider the following assumptions: progress,\njustness, weak fairness, strong fairness, and hyperfairness, each with respect\nto actions. The correctness of these formulae has been proven.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Rc35vmrwzI1foVeXLs5KSLjH8dmIJ-3n53mA2i4Nt78","pdfSize":"991597","objectId":"0x808fb80fb6f22895b9d15474fe70b126481df9017ed0d050dba1f39a5cd0bef2","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
