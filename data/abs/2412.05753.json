  "abstract": "  This study evaluates the performance of OpenAI's o1-preview model in\nhigher-order cognitive domains, including critical thinking, systematic\nthinking, computational thinking, data literacy, creative thinking, logical\nreasoning, and scientific reasoning. Using established benchmarks, we compared\nthe o1-preview models's performance to human participants from diverse\neducational levels. o1-preview achieved a mean score of 24.33 on the Ennis-Weir\nCritical Thinking Essay Test (EWCTET), surpassing undergraduate (13.8) and\npostgraduate (18.39) participants (z = 1.60 and 0.90, respectively). In\nsystematic thinking, it scored 46.1, SD = 4.12 on the Lake Urmia Vignette,\nsignificantly outperforming the human mean (20.08, SD = 8.13, z = 3.20). For\ndata literacy, o1-preview scored 8.60, SD = 0.70 on Merk et al.'s \"Use Data\"\ndimension, compared to the human post-test mean of 4.17, SD = 2.02 (z = 2.19).\nOn creative thinking tasks, the model achieved originality scores of 2.98, SD =\n0.73, higher than the human mean of 1.74 (z = 0.71). In logical reasoning\n(LogiQA), it outperformed humans with average 90%, SD = 10% accuracy versus\n86%, SD = 6.5% (z = 0.62). For scientific reasoning, it achieved near-perfect\nperformance (mean = 0.99, SD = 0.12) on the TOSLS,, exceeding the highest human\nscores of 0.85, SD = 0.13 (z = 1.78). While o1-preview excelled in structured\ntasks, it showed limitations in problem-solving and adaptive reasoning. These\nresults demonstrate the potential of AI to complement education in structured\nassessments but highlight the need for ethical oversight and refinement for\nbroader applications.\n",
