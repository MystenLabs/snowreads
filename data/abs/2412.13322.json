To this end, we\nuse the results of modified chiral quark model ($\\chi QM$) for the valence\nquark distributions of pion obtained in our previous work. We also determine\nthe electromagnetic and gravitational form factors of pion and compare the\nresults of our theoretical model for valence GPDs and form factors of pion with\nthe results of some other models and available experimental data.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qgshbx7PtSgd1bMqMdOoKzA5da3iNIgx5_Ja2ZgW5po","pdfSize":"668820"}
