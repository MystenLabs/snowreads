  "abstract": "  We present new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-Infrared Instrument\n(MIRI) Medium-Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) observations of the nearby\nultra-luminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) F08572+3915 NW. These integral field\nspectroscopic (IFS) data reveal a kpc-scale warm-molecular rotating disk and\nbiconical outflow traced by the H$_2$ $\\nu$ = 0$-$0 S(1), S(2), S(3), and S(5)\nrotational transitions. The outflow maintains a relatively constant median\n(maximum) projected velocity of 1100 km s$^{-1}$ (3000 km s$^{-1}$) out to\n$\\sim$ 1.4 kpc from the nucleus. The outflowing H$_2$ material is slightly\nwarmer (640 $-$ 700 K) than the rotating disk material (460 $-$ 520 K), perhaps\ndue to shock heating in the highly turbulent outflowing material. This outflow\nshares the same kinematics and orientation as the sub-kpc scale warm-H$_2$\noutflow traced by the ro-vibrational H$_2$ lines in Keck AO near-infrared IFS\ndata. However, this warm-H$_2$ outflow is significantly faster than the sub-kpc\nscale cold-molecular outflow derived from multi-transition far-infrared OH\nobservations with Herschel and the $\\gtrsim$ kpc-scale cold-molecular outflow\nmapped by mm-wave interferometric CO 1$-$0 observations with IRAM-PdBI and\nNOEMA. The new JWST data bolster the scenario where the buried quasar in this\nULIRG is excavating the dust screen, accelerating perhaps as much as 60\\% of\nthe dusty warm-molecular material to velocities beyond the escape velocity, and\nthus influencing the evolution of the host galaxy.\n",
