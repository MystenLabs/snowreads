In particular, let $F\\subset\n\\mathbb{R}^n$, $1\\leq k \\leq n-1$, $s\\in (0,k]$, and $t\\in (0,k(n-k)]$. We say\nthat $F$ is a $(s,t;k)$-spread Furstenberg set if there exists a\n$t$-dimensional set of subspaces $\\mathcal P \\subset \\mathcal G(n,k)$ such that\nfor all $P\\in \\mathcal P$, there exists a translation vector $a_P \\in\n\\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\\dim(F\\cap (P + a_P)) \\geq s$. We show that given $k\n\\geq k_0 +1$ (where $k_0:= k_0(n)$ is sufficiently large) and $s>k_0$, every\n$(s,t;k)$-spread Furstenberg set $F$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ satisfies \\[ \\dim F \\geq\nn-k + s - \\frac{k(n-k) - t}{\\lceil s\\rceil - k_0 +1 }. \\] Our methodology is\nmotivated by the work of the second author, Dvir, and Lund over finite fields.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KNz3WusEseScjuV_Ga4YZWyTYO5iBbAu2HdP0AZXmPU","pdfSize":"297149"}
