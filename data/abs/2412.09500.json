We evaluate our loss function for a simple event\nclassification task using a linear model and show that it produces decision\nboundaries that change according to the cross sections of the processes\ninvolved. We find that the models trained with the new loss have higher signal\nefficiency for similar values of estimated signal significance compared to ones\ntrained with a cross-entropy loss, showing promise to improve sensitivity of\nparticle physics searches at colliders.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Computer Science/Machine Learning","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Kt1yqKrMPwEakYPkak_srgXOID3lUop1EcNq0UuRMGU","pdfSize":"1067283"}
