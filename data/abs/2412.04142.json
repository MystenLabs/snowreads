However, these devices often face challenges in terms of accuracy,\nsize, and cost. This study presents a methodology, integrating deep learning,\nmodeling and simulation to enhance the design of microfluidic systems, used to\ndevelop an innovative approach for viscosity measurement of polymer melts. We\nuse synthetic data generated from the simulations to train a deep learning\nmodel, which then identifies rheological parameters of polymer melts from\npressure drop and flow rate measurements in a microfluidic circuit, enabling\nonline estimation of fluid properties. By improving the accuracy and\nflexibility of microfluidic rheological estimation, our methodology accelerates\nthe design and testing of microfluidic devices, reducing reliance on physical\nprototypes, and offering significant contributions to the field.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"1ypqUaTdeD5DuZQJoXYnxfYMZPILTcFw7jsehAh8DMs","pdfSize":"600627"}
