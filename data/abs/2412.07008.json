  "abstract": "  We analyze superconductivity in a multi-orbital fermionic system near the\nonset of a nematic order, using doped FeSe as an example. We associate\nnematicity with a spontaneous polarization between $d_{\\text{xz}}$ and\n$d_{\\text{yz}}$ orbitals (a Pomeranchuk-type order) and analyze the pairing\nmediated by soft nematic fluctuations. Such a pairing gives rise to a highly\nanisotropic gap function whose structure strongly varies with temperature, and\nleads to strongly non-BCS behavior in thermodynamics, spectroscopy and\ntransport. We compute the specific heat and its directional variation with a\nmagnetic field, magnetic susceptibility, density of states, tunneling\nconductance, Raman intensity, superfluid stiffness and penetration depth\nwithout and with impurity scattering and for the latter computed also optical\nconductivity and $T_c$ variation. We find good agreement with the existing data\nfor FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ and FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ and suggest new experiments.\n",
