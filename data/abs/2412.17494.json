We parameterized the magnetic field and\nthe source distance in anisotropy calculations to align well with the\nobservational data from the Pierre Auger Observatory for all the cosmological\nmodels. An uncertainty band is presented along with the $\\chi^2$ test for all\ncosmological models to demonstrate the goodness of fitting. Our findings\nrevealed that the amplitude of the anisotropy is highly sensitive to these\ncosmological models. Notably, the $f(R, T)$ models exhibited a lower amplitude\nof anisotropy (i.e., more isotropy), while the $\\Lambda$CDM model predicted a\ncomparatively higher amplitude at most of the energies considered.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bGD-I_Mr7NZWcaI7T58uuOgx8_M3wRQG0e5JOhtnJYo","pdfSize":"684532"}
