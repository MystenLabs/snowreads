  "abstract": "  A stochastic SIR epidemic model taking into account the heterogeneity of the\nspatial environment is constructed. The deterministic model is given by a\npartial differential equation and the stochastic one by a space-time jump\nMarkov process. The consistency of the two models is given by a law of large\nnumbers. In this paper, we study the deviation of the spatial stochastic model\nfrom the deterministic model by a functional central limit theorem. The limit\nis a distribution-valued Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Gaussian process, which is the mild\nsolution of a stochastic partial differential equation.\n",
