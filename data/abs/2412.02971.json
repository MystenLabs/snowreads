We tackle a new task in\nthis paper: image-conditioned autocorrection of inaccuracies within these\nreports. Using the MIMIC-CXR dataset, we first intentionally introduce a\ndiverse range of errors into reports. Subsequently, we propose a two-stage\nframework capable of pinpointing these errors and then making corrections,\nsimulating an \\textit{autocorrection} process. This method aims to address the\nshortcomings of existing automated medical reporting systems, like factual\nerrors and incorrect conclusions, enhancing report reliability in vital\nhealthcare applications. Importantly, our approach could serve as a guardrail,\nensuring the accuracy and trustworthiness of automated report generation.\nExperiments on established datasets and state of the art report generation\nmodels validate this method's potential in correcting medical reporting errors.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uVwusPkzSl8hXbrNBEHVAUa_t_2UbwINmL04ERVeoNA","pdfSize":"5355976"}
