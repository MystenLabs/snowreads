The full\ntemperature range superfluid density is consistent with the clean isotropic\n$s-$wave weak-coupling BCS theory without any signs of the second gap or strong\ncoupling. The temperature dependence of the Campbell length is hysteretic\nbetween zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field-cooling (FC) protocols, indicating\nan anharmonic vortex pinning potential. The field dependence of the effective\ncritical current density, $j_{c}\\left(H\\right)$, reveals an unusual result.\nWhile in the ZFC protocol, $j_{c}\\left(H\\right)$ is monotonically suppressed by\nthe magnetic field, it exhibits a profound ``hidden'' peak effect in the FC\nprotocol, that is, without a vortex density gradient. We suggest a possible\nnovel mechanism for the formation of the peak effect, which involves both\nstatic and dynamic aspects.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"z-wbX_sjmfcwv_3mBosTThwXusay0kOM7E-hR_ILdR4","pdfSize":"1062786"}
