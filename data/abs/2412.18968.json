We study the\nwellposedness of weak large solutions on infinite cylinders by the convergence\nof large solutions on finite cylinders and observe that any such solution\ncoincides with the large solution on its cross-section. Finally, the results\nare generalized to a class of operators involving non-linearity in the\ngradient.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tTC75ObQ59sYquAUF5hZTw5HwCpovLaK0bt_0qoGosg","pdfSize":"212884"}
