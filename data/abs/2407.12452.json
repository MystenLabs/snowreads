We\ndescribe a language in which it admits relative quantifier elimination up to\nthe field sort. Using a new criterion which does not rely on a stationary\nindependence relation, we prove that if the field is NSOP$_1$, then the model\ncompanion is NSOP$_4$. We also prove that if the field is algebraically closed,\nthen the model companion is $c$-NIP.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UUmpglQ9LOasAbjoAe3AzC5DZXvO5opWkaTipE4eIFc","pdfSize":"318450","objectId":"0x6f212419e7700c9b433af2d395ade2a06c74cfc3a8cef011813471b91c798da9","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
