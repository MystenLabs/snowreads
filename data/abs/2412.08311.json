Our updated analysis includes recent\ninclusive and differential measurements from the LHC Run II, together with the\nexact implementation of electroweak precision observables (EWPOs) from LEP and\nSLD. We then analyse the impact of HL-LHC measurements by adding to SMEFiT3.0\nthe projections obtained by extrapolating from Run II data. Finally we estimate\nthe potential of two proposed high-energy circular $e^+e^-$ colliders, the\nFCC-ee and the CEPC, in further improving the bounds on the SMEFT parameters.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JYxT8-5wriE1a3R3znhp04l76FV12nzTm6Y-dtc37uw","pdfSize":"1736979"}
