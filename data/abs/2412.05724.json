This paper introduces a tiered GAN model to\nprogressively refine image quality through a multi-stage process, enhancing the\ngenerated images at each step. The model transforms random noise into detailed\nartistic representations, addressing common challenges such as instability in\ntraining, mode collapse, and output quality. This approach combines\ndownsampling and convolutional techniques, enabling the generation of\nhigh-quality Monet-style artwork while optimizing computational efficiency.\nExperimental results demonstrate the architecture's ability to produce\nfoundational artistic structures, though further refinements are necessary for\nachieving higher levels of realism and fidelity to Monet's style. Future work\nfocuses on improving training methodologies and model complexity to bridge the\ngap between generated and true artistic images. Additionally, the limitations\nof traditional GANs in artistic generation are analyzed, and strategies to\novercome these shortcomings are proposed.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"a_OHJjtVLyLtzegfij3dZFIgpNWN3Wa_OZaCRL4DiNg","pdfSize":"5164119"}
