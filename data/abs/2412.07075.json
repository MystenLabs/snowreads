The method addresses the significant challenges posed by the\ninherent volatility and uncertainty of real-time electricity prices, which\ncreate substantial risks of financial losses for energy storage participants\nrelying on future price forecasts to plan their operations. The framework\ncomprises a two-layer prediction model to quantify real-time price uncertainty\nconfidence intervals with high coverage. The framework is distribution-free and\ncan work with any underlying point prediction model. We evaluate the\nquantification effectiveness through storage price arbitrage application by\nmanaging the risk of participating in the real-time market. We design a\nrisk-averse policy for profit-maximization of energy storage arbitrage to find\nthe safest storage schedule with very minimal losses. Using historical data\nfrom New York State and synthetic price predictions, our evaluations\ndemonstrate that this framework can achieve good profit margins with less than\n$35\\%$ purchases.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Gc6hStKWzJhChCgt4ovQhdO38Rahsw54zQmS47oRkGw","pdfSize":"996649"}
