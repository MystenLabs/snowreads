The measured DGE flux is significantly higher than the\nexpectation from hadronic interactions between cosmic rays (CRs) and the\ninterstellar medium. This excess has been proposed to originate from unknown\nextended sources produced by electron radiation, such as pulsar wind nebulae or\npulsar halos (PWNe/halos). In this study, we propose a new perspective to\nexplain the DGE excess observed by LHAASO. The masking regions used in the\nLHAASO DGE measurement may not fully encompass the extended signals of\nPWNe/halos. By employing a two-zone diffusion model for electrons around\npulsars, we find that the DGE excess in most regions of the Galactic plane can\nbe well explained by the signal leakage model under certain parameters. Our\nresults indicate that the signal leakage from known sources and contributions\nfrom unresolved sources should be considered complementary in explaining the\nDGE excess.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NqQ94Z9-f1ZjP0X7Xvfbkbb0pq2sLKv4HWNaFBLrfhA","pdfSize":"2258484"}
