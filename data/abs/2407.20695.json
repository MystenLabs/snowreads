The proposed\nmethod creates a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack using an IoT\nnetwork simulator, Cooja, which emulates environmental sensors such as\ntemperature and humidity. CNNs detect anomalies in time series data, resulting\nin a 92\\% accuracy in identifying possible attacks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KM3n2V3iRc9xd_uHMLSJmGhRWjafZE240XrZahHxWTs","pdfSize":"168018","objectId":"0xf65139df7d86868eb618eacbb76b9e36a0346e04380090e58c5f4328cf2d5970","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
