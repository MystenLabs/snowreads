  "abstract": "  We investigate a compelling model of a rotating black hole that is deformed\nby the effects of loop quantum gravity (LQG). We present a simplified metric\nand explore two distinct geometries: one in which the masses of the black hole\nand white hole are equal, and another in which they differ. Our analysis yields\nthe radius of the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCO), as well as the\nenergy and angular momentum of a particle within this framework. Additionally,\nwe find the frequency of the first-order resonance separately. We constrain the\nmodel by the quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO) of the X-ray binary GRO\nJ1655-40. We show that $\\lambda=0.15^{+0.23}_{-0.14}$ at $1\\sigma$ confidence\nlevel for equal mass black hole and white hole geometry. For the other geometry\nwe get $\\lambda=0.11^{+0.07}_{-0.07}$ at $1\\sigma$ confidence level.We\nencounter a degeneracy in the parameter space that hinders our ability to\nconstrain $\\lambda$ with greater precision.\n",
