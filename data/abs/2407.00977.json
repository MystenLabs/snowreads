In the\ncentral region of the host galaxy, we identified a redshifted substructure of\n[C II] with a velocity of $702\\pm17$ km s$^{-1}$, which is close to the CIV\nline with a velocity of $500\\pm10$ km s$^{-1}$. The position and the velocity\noffsets align with a model of an outflowing shell structure, consistent with\nthe large velocity offset of Ly$\\alpha$. The non-detection of [C II] and dust\nemission from the three CO(1--0)-detected companions indicates their different\nnature compared to dwarf galaxies based on the photodissociation region model.\nGiven their large velocity of $\\sim1500$ km s$^{-1}$, outflowing molecular\nclouds induced by the AGN is the most plausible interpretation, and they may\nexceed the escape velocity of a $10^{13}\\,M_{\\odot}$ halo. These results\nsuggest that TN J0924$-$2201, with the ongoing and fossil large-scale outflows,\nis in a distinctive phase of removing molecular gas from a central massive\ngalaxy in an overdense region in the early universe. A dusty HI absorber at the\nhost galaxy is an alternative interpretation.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"uLlFzkFysh_HmOpJ-Ysxo6TyOCPyak_pGC6QWmameuI","pdfSize":"1552589"}
