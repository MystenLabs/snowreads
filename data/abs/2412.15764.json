  "abstract": "  The Sasaki projection was introduced as a mapping from the lattice of closed\nsubspaces of a Hilbert space onto one of its segments. To use this projection\nand its dual so-called Sasaki operations were introduced by the second two\nauthors. In a previous paper there are described several classes of lattices,\n$\\lambda$-lattices and semirings where the Sasaki operations form an adjoint\npair. In the present paper we prove that the class of complemented lattices\nwith this property forms a variety and we explicitly state its defining\nidentities. Moreover, we prove that this variety V is congruence permutable and\nregular. Hence every ideal I of some member L of V is a kernel of some\ncongruence on L. Finally, we determine a finite basis of so-called ideal terms\nand describe the congruence $\\Theta_I$ determined by the ideal I.\n",
