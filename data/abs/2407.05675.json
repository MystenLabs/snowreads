Approaches such as\nRiccati equation approximations aim to alleviate this complexity, yet ensuring\nproperties like bounded errors remains challenging. Yamada and Ohki introduced\nlow-rank Kalman-Bucy filters for continuous-time systems, ensuring bounded\nerrors. This paper proposes a discrete-time counterpart of the low-rank filter\nand shows its system theoretic properties and conditions for bounded mean\nsquare error estimation. Numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the\nproposed method.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"P864z1yUv4J7fEqqV3I9AjFLXIccpaVu2uYqbqzeVvc","pdfSize":"407529"}
