In this Letter, we introduce a novel quantum deamplification mechanism\nthat extends dynamic range at a minimal cost of sensitivity. Our approach uses\ntwo sequential spin-squeezing operations to generate and detect an entangled\nprobe state, respectively. We demonstrate that the optimal quantum\ninterferometer limit can be approached through two-axis counter-twisting\ndynamics. Further expansion of dynamic range is possible by using sequential\nquantum deamplification interspersed with phase encoding processes.\nAdditionally, we show that robustness against detection noise can be enhanced\nby a hybrid sensing scheme that combines quantum deamplification with quantum\namplification. Our protocol is within the reach of state-of-the-art\natomic-molecular-optical platforms, offering a scalable, noise-resilient\npathway for entanglement-enhanced metrology.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"FdUjc9j2-7oQOt9_jUSHiqNDzyKC1shps3NHpa-i0BE","pdfSize":"5634152"}
