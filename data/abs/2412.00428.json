The conformal boundary is\ngenerically a squashed, branched, lens space and the graviphoton gauge field\ncan have either twist or anti-twist through the spindle bolt. Correspondingly,\nthe boundary geometry inherits two types of rigid Killing spinors, that we\nrefer to as twist and anti-twist for the three-dimensional Seifert orbifolds,\nas well as some specific flat connections for the background gauge field,\ndetermined by the data of the spindle bolt. For all our solutions we compute\nthe holographically renormalized on-shell action and compare it to the\nexpression obtained via equivariant localization, uncovering a markedly\ndistinct behaviour in the cases of twist and anti twist. Our results provide\nprecise predictions for the large $N$ limit of the corresponding localized\npartition functions of three-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field\ntheories placed on Seifert orbifolds.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wP0_7XfO5gSrQVHqDR9Ahkx1KpxlcBhMmhkLknn4ht0","pdfSize":"1025793"}
