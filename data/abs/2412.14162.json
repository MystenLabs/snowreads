To this\npurpose, we consider explicit mediators that contribute to these processes in\nthe $s$- and $t$-channels, comparing their effects in Drell-Yan distributions\nwith the ones obtained by matching onto the corresponding EFT. We determine the\nconditions for the EFT results to accurately describe these scenarios. In\nparticular, we explore the impact of including dimension-eight $(d=8)$\noperators in the faster convergence of the EFT series, at the analytical and\nnumerical level, considering contributions to the cross section up to the\nsquare of $d=8$ EFT operator insertions. Moreover, we discuss the possible\nimplications of clipping LHC data and illustrate results for a specific\nNew-Physics scenario motivated by low-energy flavor data.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zqK1_vfzs9ZgBN7eXgtYn0yyIVAUiFoI3qb__P0l_u8","pdfSize":"1835460"}
