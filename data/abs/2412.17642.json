In this paper, we first give a forbidden induced subgraph\ncharacterization of double-arborescences, where we prove that\ndouble-arborescences are precisely $P_4$-free treelike comparability graphs.\nThen, we characterize a more general class consisting of $P_4$-free\ndistance-hereditary graphs using split-decomposition trees. Consequently, using\nsplit-decomposition trees, we characterize double-arborescences and one of its\nsubclasses, viz., arborescences; a double-arborescence is an arborescence if\nits all-adjacent vertex is a source or a sink. In the context of\nword-representable graphs, it is an open problem to find the classes of\nword-representable graphs whose minimum-word-representants are of length $2n -\nk$, where $n$ is the number of vertices of the graph and $k$ is its clique\nnumber. Contributing to the open problem, we devise an algorithmic procedure\nand show that the class of double-arborescences is one such class. It seems the\nclass of double-arborescences is the first example satisfying the criteria\ngiven in the open problem, for an arbitrary $k$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computer Science/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UZ7SkS6wBAlgn5nlEGcnH4C87kbkfThF0T5TDDLYaaU","pdfSize":"267272"}
