Adaptive\nrefinement strategies to dynamically increase the resolution of the particles\nto capture sharp gradients in the flow have also been developed. However, most\nof the SPH schemes in the literature are not second-order convergent (SOC).\nBoth second-order convergence and adaptive resolution are considered grand\nchallenge problems in the SPH community. In this paper, we propose, for the\nfirst time, a second-order convergent (SOC) adaptive refinement strategy along\nwith a SOC weakly-compressible SPH scheme. We employ the method of manufactured\nsolutions to systematically develop the scheme and validate the solver. We\ndemonstrate the order of convergence of the entire scheme using the\nTaylor-Green vortex problem and then go on to demonstrate the applicability of\nthe method to simulate flow past a circular cylinder.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Zo69IBMxbANR6anvPInJ_sHXa07yLKVrfBkcpj-IJlI","pdfSize":"3731330"}
