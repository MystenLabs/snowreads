In dilute Fermi liquids, this analysis has been carried out\nup to second-order in the gas parameter, where the results for any spin\ndegeneracy are universal in terms of only the s-wave scattering length $a_0$.\nWe extend this analysis to third-order where energies depend, not only on\n$a_0$, but also on the s-wave effective range $r_0$ and the p-wave scattering\nlength $a_1$. The introduction in the theory of these new parameters changes\nthe transition point, with respect to the second-order estimation, and also can\nmodify the nature of the phase transition itself. We analyze these interaction\neffects on the phase transition for different spin values. The emerging phase\ndiagram shows that the type of ferromagnetic transition changes dramatically as\na function of $r_0$ and $a_1$ and, importantly, that this classification is not\nsolely determined by the spin value, as happens at second order.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"j6msr7UVG6RYzge2i4TSV39sPDuPfMEXyiglA3uZiyY","pdfSize":"2180820","objectId":"0x51149107f3a316b591052652ac2ef760f1e136dbec516d635684221df57a4e34","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
