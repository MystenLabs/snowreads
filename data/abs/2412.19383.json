  "abstract": "  Let $\\Psi(\\mathbb{z},\\mathbb{a},q)$ be the fundamental solution matrix of the\nquantum difference equation in the equivariant quantum K-theory for Nakajima\nvariety $X$. In this work, we prove that the operator $$\n\\Psi(\\mathbb{z},\\mathbb{a},q)\n\\Psi\\left(\\mathbb{z}^p,\\mathbb{a}^p,q^{p^2}\\right)^{-1} $$ has no poles at the\nprimitive complex $p$-th roots of unity $\\zeta_p$ in the curve counting\nparameter $q$. As a byproduct, we show that the eigenvalues of the iterated\nproduct of the operators ${\\bf M}_{\\mathcal{L}}$ from the quantum difference\nequation on $X$ $$ {\\bf M}_{\\mathcal{L}} (\\mathbb{z},\\mathbb{a},q) {\\bf\nM}_{\\mathcal{L}} (\\mathbb{z} q^{\\mathcal{L}},\\mathbb{a},q) \\cdots {\\bf\nM}_{\\mathcal{L}} (\\mathbb{z} q^{(p-1)\\mathcal{L}},\\mathbb{a},q) $$ evaluated at\n$\\zeta_p$ are described by the Bethe equations for $X$ in which all variables\nare substituted by their $p$-th powers.\n  Finally, upon a reduction of the quantum difference equation on $X$ to the\nquantum differential equation over the field with finite characteristic, the\nabove iterated product transforms into a Grothendiek-Katz $p$-curvature of the\ncorresponding differential connection whereas ${\\bf M}_{\\mathcal{L}}\n(\\mathbb{z}^p,\\mathbb{a}^p,q^p)$ becomes a certain Frobenius twist of that\nconnection. In this way, we are reproducing, in part, the statement of a\ntheorem by Etingof and Varchenko.\n",
