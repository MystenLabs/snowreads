While it is well-known that, in order to move between equivalent\ndiagrams with Reidemeister moves, one sometimes needs to insert excess\ncrossings, there are significant gaps between the best known lower and upper\nbounds on the required number of these added crossings. In this article, we\nstudy the problem of turning a diagram of a split link into a split diagram,\nand we show that there exist split links with diagrams requiring an arbitrarily\nlarge number of such additional crossings. More precisely, we provide a family\nof diagrams of split links, so that any sequence of Reidemeister moves\ntransforming a diagram with $c$ crossings into a split diagram requires going\nthrough a diagram with $\\Omega(\\sqrt{c})$ extra crossings. Our proof relies on\nthe framework of bubble tangles, as introduced by Lunel and de Mesmay, and a\ntechnique of Chambers and Liokumovitch to turn homotopies into isotopies in the\ncontext of Riemannian geometry.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Computer Science/Computational Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QXX4Lbx0NwNh2GTk-AIkQrRm44LqYpMySUGCYnmrRe8","pdfSize":"665915"}
