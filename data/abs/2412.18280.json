We first construct the effective\nLagrangians, and there are 12 distinct terms. As a result, we observe that the\ninvariant Lagrangian under HQSS manifests exclusively in the pseudoscalar $D$\nmesons coupling to nucleons and $\\Lambda_c$ baryons, whereas nucleons and\n$\\Sigma_c$ ($\\Sigma_c^*$) baryons only couple with vector $D$ mesons. By taking\ninto account the violated heavy-quark spin transformation, one can recover all\ninteractions from the effective Lagrangians. Furthermore, we compute the\ndifferential cross-sections of the $p\\bar p \\to Y_c\\bar{Y}_c'$ scatterings,\nwhere $Y_c,\\bar{Y_c}' = \\Lambda_c,~\\Sigma_c,~\\Sigma_c^*$, to reveal the residue\nof the violating HQSS (VHQSS) on charmed baryon production. Ultimately, by\naccounting for VHQSS, we aim for precise predictions of production rates, which\nare essential for the High-Energy Storage Ring (HESR) experiments at the\nFacility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR).\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ynm5DGiHd_QP9jDsoXogYISSZPUkZS9vHeacoQ82NPo","pdfSize":"1606110"}
