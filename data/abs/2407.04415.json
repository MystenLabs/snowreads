This work studies the relation between\nattributes or features of an individual to understand how redundant, unique,\nand synergetic interactions between attributes construct inequality. For this\npurpose, we define a family of inequality measures (f-inequality) from\nf-divergences. Special cases of this family are, among others, the Pietra index\nand the Generalized Entropy index. We present a decomposition for any\nf-inequality with intuitive set-theoretic behavior that enables studying the\ndynamics between attributes. Moreover, we use the Atkinson index as an example\nto demonstrate how the decomposition can be transformed to measures beyond\nf-inequality. The presented decomposition provides practical insights for\nsystem analyses and complements subgroup decompositions. Additionally, the\nresults present an interesting interpretation of Shapley values and demonstrate\nthe close relation between decomposing measures of inequality and information.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jHR_4jfHFnN6ZwodIITUoq1fhuN3jmQ6COkk3DaL20k","pdfSize":"476249"}
