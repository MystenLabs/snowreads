However, because of the variety of artifact forms,\nexisting methods require substantial annotated data for training. This\nrequirement limits their scalability and efficiency, which restricts their wide\napplication. This paper shows that the similarity of denoised images between\nconsecutive time steps during the sampling process is related to the severity\nof artifacts in images generated by diffusion models. Building on this\nobservation, we introduce the concept of Similarity Trajectory to characterize\nthe sampling process and its correlation with the image artifacts presented.\nUsing an annotated data set of 680 images, which is only 0.1% of the amount of\ndata used in the prior work, we trained a classifier on these trajectories to\npredict the presence of artifacts in images. By performing 10-fold validation\ntesting on the balanced annotated data set, the classifier can achieve an\naccuracy of 72.35%, highlighting the connection between the Similarity\nTrajectory and the occurrence of artifacts. This approach enables\ndifferentiation between artifact-exhibiting and natural-looking images using\nlimited training data.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"TK9ZvtGsfmg5KN9bHHzorPAa1UwzqdX5Kmx2U9z76b4","pdfSize":"2461191"}
