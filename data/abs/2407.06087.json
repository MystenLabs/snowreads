In this study, we introduce the Analytic\nConvolutional Layer (ACL), an innovative model-driven convolutional layer,\nwhich is a mosaic of analytical convolution kernels (ACKs) and traditional\nconvolution kernels. ACKs are characterized by mathematical functions governed\nby analytic kernel parameters (AKPs) learned in training process. Learnable\nAKPs permit the adaptive update of incorporated knowledge to align with the\nfeatures representation of data. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the\nACLs not only have a remarkable capacity for feature representation with a\nreduced number of parameters but also attain increased reliability through the\nanalytical formulation of ACKs. Furthermore, ACLs offer a means for neural\nnetwork interpretation, thereby paving the way for the intrinsic\ninterpretability of neural network. The source code will be published in\ncompany with the paper.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kXBb69Op8KqETfeARGYrq4g9yq5YLvgSj_f3C-EnKUk","pdfSize":"2370963"}
