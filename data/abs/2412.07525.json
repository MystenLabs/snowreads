  "abstract": "  This paper demonstrates a method that synthesizes narrowband Multiple-Input\nMultiple-Output (MIMO) beampatterns using the Multi-Tone Sinusoidal Frequency\nModulated (MTSFM) waveform model. MIMO arrays transmit unique waveforms on each\nof their elements which increases the degrees of freedom available to\nsynthesize novel transmit beampatterns. The MIMO beampattern shape is\ndetermined by the structure of the MIMO correlation matrix whose entries are\nthe inner products between the waveforms transmitted on each element. The MTSFM\nwaveform possesses an instantaneous phase that is represented as a finite\nFourier series. The Fourier coefficients are modified to synthesize sets of\nwaveforms whose correlation matrix realizes a desired MIMO transmit\nbeampattern. The MIMO correlation matrix for a MTSFM waveform set has an\nanalytical form expressed in terms of Generalized Bessel Functions. These\nmathematical properties are utilized to develop an optimization routine that\nsynthesizes MTSFM waveform sets to approximate a desired MIMO transmit\nbeampattern. The performance of this optimization routine is then demonstrated\nvia an illustrative design example.\n",
