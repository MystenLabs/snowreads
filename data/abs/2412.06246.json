{"id":"2412.06246","title":"The smallest singular value for rectangular random matrices with L\\'evy\n  entries","authors":"Yi Han","authorsParsed":[["Han","Yi",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2024 06:39:58 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-10","timestamp":1733726398000,"abstract":"  Let $X=(x_{ij})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N\\times n}$ be a rectangular random matrix with\ni.i.d. entries (we assume $N/n\\to\\mathbf{a}>1$), and denote by\n$\\sigma_{min}(X)$ its smallest singular value. When entries have mean zero and\nunit second moment, the celebrated work of Bai-Yin and Tikhomirov show that\n$n^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\sigma_{min}(X)$ converges almost surely to\n$\\sqrt{\\mathbf{a}}-1.$ However, little is known when the second moment is\ninfinite. In this work we consider symmetric entry distributions satisfying\n$\\mathbb{P}(|x_{ij}|>t)\\sim t^{-\\alpha}$ for some $\\alpha\\in(0,2)$, and prove\nthat $\\sigma_{min}(X)$ can be determined up to a log factor with high\nprobability: for any $D>0$, with probability at least $1-n^{-D}$ we have\n$$C_1n^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha}}(\\log n)^\\frac{5(\\alpha-2)}{2\\alpha}\\leq\n\\sigma_{min}(X)\\leq C_2n^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha}}(\\log n)^\\frac{\\alpha-2}{2\\alpha}$$\nfor some constants $C_1,C_2>0$. This appears to be the first determination of\n$\\sigma_{min}(X)$ in the $\\alpha$-stable case with a correct leading order of\n$n$, as previous ant-concentration arguments only yield lower bound\n$n^\\frac{1}{2}$. The same lower bound holds for $\\sigma_{min}(X+B)$ for any\nfixed rectangular matrix $B$ with no assumption on its operator norm. The case\nof diverging aspect ratio is also computed. Geometrically, the lower bound\nshows that the random polytope $X^*(B_1^N)$ generated by heavy-tail\ndistributions will with very high probability contain Euclidean balls $B_2^n$\nof a much larger radius compared to its Gaussian counterpart.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YZFp7495uLcaQI0uhO86U4VSQ61r-mzJ0rwAtLPDGwo","pdfSize":"382670"}
