In particular, we calculate the respective the Kawai-Lewellen-Tye\nrelations for tree-level Berends-Giele currents and color-kinematics master\nnumerators at one loop, both cases for any number of external particles.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jkbTA_HEq0juJhK0XmG9thAlzVuTv5xGa_yxvUSSH2M","pdfSize":"297843"}
