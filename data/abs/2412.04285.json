  "abstract": "  Causal reasoning is often challenging with spatial data, particularly when\nhandling high-dimensional inputs. To address this, we propose a neural network\n(NN) based framework integrated with an approximate Gaussian process to manage\nspatial interference and unobserved confounding. Additionally, we adopt a\ngeneralized propensity-score-based approach to address partially observed\noutcomes when estimating causal effects with continuous treatments. We evaluate\nour framework using synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world data inferred\nfrom satellite imagery. Our results demonstrate that NN-based models\nsignificantly outperform linear spatial regression models in estimating causal\neffects. Furthermore, in real-world case studies, NN-based models offer more\nreasonable predictions of causal effects, facilitating decision-making in\nrelevant applications.\n",
