This model supports the basic tasks for automatic\nloop parallelization, such as the representation of the nested loop, the\ndependence analysis, the computation of valid schedules, as well as the\ntransformation of the loop program with a valid schedule.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Symbolic Computation","Computer Science/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"AtXsTR8M5MKucPHHkt8a9Jtk9XM4dFgt4itHGktUiXI","pdfSize":"147291"}
