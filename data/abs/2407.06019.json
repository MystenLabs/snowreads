What are the epigenetic mechanisms that allow this? Despite\nthe rise in available epigenetic data, how such information is inherited\nthrough the cell cycle is still not fully understood. Here, we develop and\nanalyse a simple mathematical model for histone-based epigenetic information\nthat describes how daughter cells can recapitulate the gene expression profiles\nof their parent. We consider the dynamics of histone modifications during the\ncell cycle deterministically but also incorporate the largest stochastic\nelement: DNA replication, where histones are randomly distributed between the\ntwo daughter DNA strands. This hybrid stochastic-deterministic approach enables\nan analytic derivation of the switching rate, i.e., the frequency of\nloss-of-memory events due to replication. While retaining great simplicity, the\nmodel can recapitulate experimental switching rate data, establishing its\nbiological importance as a framework to quantitatively study epigenetic\ninheritance.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Quantitative Biology/Molecular Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"-Y7vSXnLkJ8PjI6oLf33Sf_fOoDoPXxaqQ_lyJiCY-Q","pdfSize":"915087"}
