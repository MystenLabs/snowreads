Traditional econometric\nmethods often struggle with limited within-product price variation, a challenge\naddressed by the proposed neural network approach. The proposed method\nestimates the functional form of the demand and demonstrates higher performance\nin both simulations and empirical applications. Notably, under low price\nvariation, the machine learning model outperforms econometric approaches,\nreducing the mean squared error of initial price parameter estimates by nearly\nthreefold. In empirical setting, the ML model consistently predicts a negative\nrelationship between demand and price in 100% of cases, whereas the econometric\napproach fails to do so in 20% of cases. The suggested model incorporates a\nwide range of product characteristics, as well as prices of other products and\ncompetitors.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"f9x7JVvdeeBTRx_kinOMCCcA07YpFmkV1aDe2J4K-P4","pdfSize":"1563445"}
