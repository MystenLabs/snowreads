  "abstract": "  Data integrity is crucial for ensuring data correctness and quality,\nmaintained through integrity constraints that must be continuously checked,\nespecially in data-intensive systems like OLTP. While DBMSs handle common\nconstraints well, complex constraints often require ad-hoc solutions. Research\nsince the 1980s has focused on automatic and simplified integrity constraint\nchecking, leveraging the assumption that databases are consistent before\nupdates. This paper discusses using program transformation operators to\ngenerate simplified integrity constraints, focusing on complex constraints\nexpressed in denial form. In particular, we target a class of integrity\nconstraints, called extended denials, which are more general than\ntuple-generating dependencies and equality-generating dependencies. These\ntechniques can be readily applied to standard database practices and can be\ndirectly translated into SQL.\n",
