However, in affective\nscience, emotions are often represented as multi-dimensional. In this paper, we\npropose to adopt a Circumplex Model of emotion by mapping emotions into a\ntwo-dimensional spectrum of valence and arousal. We show how one can derive a\nvalence and arousal signal from an agent's expected free energy, relating\narousal to the entropy of posterior beliefs and valence to utility less\nexpected utility. Under this formulation, we simulate artificial agents engaged\nin a search task. We show that the manipulation of priors and object presence\nresults in commonsense variability in emotional states.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-clRBbaQkCn97nVff3B-oQB31ngnoeaNzl_9JeL2onI","pdfSize":"706484"}
