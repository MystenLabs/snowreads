  "abstract": "  In this note, we use a toy problem of detecting cycles of length two in a\ntent map to highlight some curious phenomena in the behavior of discrete\ndynamical systems. This work presents no new results or proofs, only computer\nexperiments and illustrations. Thus, it serves as light reading and does not\naim to be a scientific paper but is rather educational in nature. For this\nreason it is accompanied by numerous illustrations.\n",
