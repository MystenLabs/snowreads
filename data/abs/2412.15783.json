Jets with small\n$R=0.2$ are instrumental in measurements of the substructure of large-$R$ jets\nresulting from collimated hadronic decays of energetic $W$, $Z$, and Higgs\nbosons, top quarks, and of potential new resonances. Measurements are presented\nof the energy scale and resolution of jets with radius parameters $R=0.2$ and\n0.6 obtained with the ATLAS detector using $37 \\text{fb}^{-1}$ of\nproton--proton collisions from the Large Hadron Collider at a centre-of-mass\nenergy of $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV, with their associated uncertainties. A new in situ\nmethod to measure jet energy scale differences between data and Monte Carlo\nsimulations is presented. The systematic uncertainties in the jet energy scale\nfor central jets ($|\\eta| < 1.2$) typically vary from 1% to about 5% as a\nfunction of $|\\eta|$ at very low transverse momentum, $p_{\\text{T}}$, of around\n20 GeV for both $R=0.2$ and 0.6 jets. The relative energy resolution ranges\nfrom $(35 \\pm 6)$% at $p_{\\text{T}} = 20$ GeV to $(6 \\pm 0.5)$% at\n$p_{\\text{T}} = 300$ GeV for central $R=0.2$ jets, and is found to be slightly\nworse for $R=0.6$ jets. Finally, the effect of close-by hadronic activity on\nthe jet energy scale is investigated and is found to be well modelled by the\nATLAS Monte Carlo simulations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UCg4nwZZSO3-rpylft6VNRVHk47xyyrAVqSssMqzX9Y","pdfSize":"34665449"}
