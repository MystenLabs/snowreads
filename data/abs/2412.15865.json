In Brazil, where road transport is a\nsignificant portion of freight and passenger movement, network science can\nprovide valuable insights into the structural properties of the infrastructure,\nthus helping decision makers responsible for proposing improvements to the\nsystem. This paper models the federal road network as weighted networks, with\nthe intent to unveil its topological characteristics and identify key locations\n(cities) that play important roles for the country through 75,000 kilometres of\nroads. We start with a simple network to examine basic connectivity and\ntopology, where weights are the distance of the road segment. We then\nincorporate other weights representing number of incidents, population, and\nnumber of cities in-between each segment. We then focus on community detection\nas a way to identify clusters of cities that form cohesive groups within a\nnetwork. Our findings aim to bring clarity to the overall structure of federal\nroads in Brazil, thus providing actionable insights for improving\ninfrastructure planning and prioritising resources to enhance network\nresilience.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Computer Science/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"y-Ahzs38kZ2wie0ADPgY9XS7AIjzFFUtWFpUryMHBV4","pdfSize":"2880720"}
