In\nparticular, our results apply to higher-dimensional fractals such as Sierpinski\ncarpets in $\\mathbf{R}^n$, $n\\geq 3$, as well as generalized fractal-type\nspaces that do not have a well-defined Hausdorff dimension or walk dimension.\nThis yields new instances of the $3G$ Principle for these spaces.
