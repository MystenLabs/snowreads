This\napproach addresses two major computational challenges in high-multiplicity\nprocesses: complexity from amplitude squaring and the extensive summations over\ncolor and helicity. Our method employs quantum off-shell recursion, a\nloop-level generalization of Berends--Giele recursion, combined with Veltman's\nlargest time equation (LTE) through a doubling prescription of fields. By\nderiving Dyson--Schwinger equations within this doubled framework and\nconstructing quantum perturbiner expansions, we develop recursive relations for\ngenerating LTEs. We validate our method by successfully reproducing the\ndifferential cross-section for tree-level $2 \\to 2$ and $2 \\to 4$ scalar\nscattering for $\\phi^{4}$ theory through one-loop and three-loop amplitude\ncalculation respectively. This framework offers an efficient alternative to\nconventional methods and can be broadly applied to theories with color charges,\nsuch as QCD and the Standard Model.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"h8PrQ3gpgMMlm1W5NQvPeWRMuLWi1oOvd3ooiwhANn0","pdfSize":"367303"}
