  "abstract": "  We present a real-time system that enables bidirectional human-AI learning\nand teaching in a balancing task that is a realistic analogue of disorientation\nduring piloting and spaceflight. A human subject and autonomous AI model of\nchoice guide each other in maintaining balance using a visual inverted pendulum\n(VIP) display. We show how AI assistance changes human performance and vice\nversa.\n",
