It is shown that both models\nreproduce behavior consistent with lattice QCD. In particular, the\nEinstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-scalar system exhibits a first-order phase transition\nin the pure gauge sector, aligning with predictions from Yang-Mills theory.\nBased on these models, we construct a holographic model for neutron stars,\nincorporating leptons to satisfy electric charge neutrality, and examine the\ncold equation of state, the mass-radius relation, and tidal deformability of\nneutron stars. It is demonstrated that the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-scalar\nsystem enables us to describe neutron star properties that meet current\nastrophysical constraints.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JGVNgEqJ8b5K5WhI0O316QOfQSmAJSjHe-QWeLcfpNk","pdfSize":"2497761"}
