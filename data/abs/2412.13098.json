  "abstract": "  Online reporting platforms have enabled citizens around the world to\ncollectively share their opinions and report in real time on events impacting\ntheir local communities. Systematically organizing (e.g., categorizing by\nattributes) and geotagging large amounts of crowdsourced information is crucial\nto ensuring that accurate and meaningful insights can be drawn from this data\nand used by policy makers to bring about positive change. These tasks, however,\ntypically require extensive manual annotation efforts. In this paper we present\nUchaguzi-2022, a dataset of 14k categorized and geotagged citizen reports\nrelated to the 2022 Kenyan General Election containing mentions of\nelection-related issues such as official misconduct, vote count irregularities,\nand acts of violence. We use this dataset to investigate whether language\nmodels can assist in scalably categorizing and geotagging reports, thus\nhighlighting its potential application in the AI for Social Good space.\n",
