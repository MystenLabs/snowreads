  "abstract": "  Let $\\mathbb{B}_p^N$ be the $N$-dimensional unit ball corresponding to the\n$\\ell_p$-norm. For each $N\\in\\mathbb N$ we sample a uniform random subspace\n$E_N$ of fixed dimension $m\\in\\mathbb{N}$ and consider the volume of\n$\\mathbb{B}_p^N$ projected onto $E_N$ or intersected with $E_N$. We also\nconsider geometric quantities other than the volume such as the intrinsic\nvolumes or the dual volumes. In this setting we prove central limit theorems,\nmoderate deviation principles, and large deviation principles as $N\\to\\infty$.\nOur results provide a complete asymptotic picture. In particular, they\ngeneralize and complement a result of Paouris, Pivovarov, and Zinn [A central\nlimit theorem for projections of the cube, Probab. Theory Related Fields. 159\n(2014), 701-719] and another result of Adamczak, Pivovarov, and Simanjuntak\n[Limit theorems for the volumes of small codimensional random sections of\n$\\ell_p^n$-balls, Ann. Probab. 52 (2024), 93-126].\n",
