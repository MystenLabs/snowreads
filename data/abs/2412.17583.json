We show that for any bounded functions\n$a,b\\colon\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{C}$, $$\\frac{1}{\\log{N}}\\sum_{n=1}^N\n\\frac{a(\\Omega(n))b(\\Omega(n+1))}{n} = \\Bigg(\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{n=1}^N\na(\\Omega(n))\\Bigg)\\Bigg(\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{n=1}^N b(\\Omega(n))\\Bigg) +\n\\mathrm{o}_{N\\to\\infty}(1).$$ This generalizes a theorem of Tao on the\nlogarithmically averaged two-point correlation Chowla conjecture. Our result is\nquantitative and the explicit error term that we obtain establishes\ndouble-logarithmic savings. As an application, we obtain new results about the\ndistribution of $\\Omega(p+1)$ as $p$ ranges over $\\ell$-almost primes for a\n\"typical\" value of $\\ell$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FIe_QKyMlSC6aaxbOs1IYhGy7AvlsCZ-uPTJCLYdoao","pdfSize":"448670"}
