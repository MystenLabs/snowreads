We establish an optimal control model\ninvolving two stochastic processes with two control variables, which is a\nsingular control problem. This model can then be converted into a\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which is a two-dimensional variational\nequality with gradient barrier, so that the free boundary is a surface. We\nprove the existence and uniqueness of the solution. Finally, some numerical\nresults are shown.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MR5YyrF5wlnkGlYfwjWxbQdkz1zIkHm2HWYmozDswpk","pdfSize":"630819"}
