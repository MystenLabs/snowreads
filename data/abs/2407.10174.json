In particular, it follows\nthat every compact 3-manifold has a triangulation with dual graph of bounded\ntwin-width. This is in sharp contrast to the case of treewidth, where for any\nnatural number $n$ there exists a closed 3-manifold such that every\ntriangulation thereof has dual graph with treewidth at least $n$. To establish\nthis result, we bound the twin-width of the incidence graph of the $d$-skeleton\nof the second barycentric subdivision of the $2d$-dimensional hypercubic\nhoneycomb. We also show that every compact, piecewise-linear (hence smooth)\n$d$-dimensional manifold has triangulations where the dual graph has an\narbitrarily large twin-width.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jDZF82raGCa4isRiL9aan9b-yXFSb2wCk53Aznsuzgg","pdfSize":"873332"}
