Such quantization has been pivotal in quantum\nmetrology and computing. Here, we demonstrate a novel quantized quantity: the\nratio of the displacement field to the magnetic field, $D/B$, in\nlarge-twist-angle bilayer graphene. In the high magnetic field limit, Landau\nlevel crossings between the top and bottom layers manifest equal-sized\ncheckerboard patterns throughout the $D/B$-$\\nu$ space. It stems from a\npeculiar electric-field-driven interlayer charge transfer at one elementary\ncharge per flux quantum, leading to quantized intervals of critical\ndisplacement fields, (i.e., $\\delta D$ = $\\frac{e}{2\\pi l_{B}^{2}}$, where\n$l_B$ is the magnetic length). Our findings suggest that interlayer charge\ntransfer in the quantum Hall regime can yield intriguing physical phenomena,\nwhich has been overlooked in the past.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"l7uEEgEGZ6BYerzhydxx4hy4SVkux_G-KC5ZwPqKjRI","pdfSize":"6828968"}
