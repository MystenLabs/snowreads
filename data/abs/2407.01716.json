We investigate the balance between the atomic\n($\\Sigma_{\\rm HI}$) and molecular gas ($\\Sigma_{\\rm H2}$) surface densities in\neight nearby star-forming galaxies using new high-quality observations from\nMeerKAT and ALMA (for HI and CO, respectively). We define the molecular gas\nratio as $R_{\\rm mol} = \\Sigma_{\\rm H2} / \\Sigma_{\\rm HI}$ and measure how it\ndepends on local conditions in the galaxy disks using multi-wavelength\nobservations. We find that, depending on the galaxy, HI is detected at\n$>3\\sigma$ out to 20-120 kpc in galactocentric radius ($r_{\\rm gal}$). The\ntypical radius at which $\\Sigma_{\\rm HI}$ reaches 1~$\\rm M_\\odot~pc^{-2}$ is\n$r_{\\rm HI}\\approx22$~kpc, which corresponds to 1-3 times the optical radius\n($r_{25}$). $R_{\\rm mol}$ correlates best with the dynamical equilibrium\npressure, P$_{\\rm DE}$, among potential drivers studied, with a median\ncorrelation coefficient of $<\\rho>=0.89$. Correlations between $R_{\\rm mol}$\nand star formation rate, total gas and stellar surface density, metallicity,\nand $\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$/P$_{\\rm DE}$ are present but somewhat weaker. Our\nresults also show a direct correlation between P$_{\\rm DE}$ and $\\Sigma_{\\rm\nSFR}$, supporting self-regulation models. Quantitatively, we measure similar\nscalings as previous works and attribute the modest differences that we find to\nthe effect of varying resolution and sensitivity. At $r_{\\rm gal}\n{\\gtrsim}0.4~r_{25}$, atomic gas dominates over molecular gas, and at the\nbalance of these two gas phases, we find that the baryon mass is dominated by\nstars, with $\\Sigma_{*} > 5~\\Sigma_{\\rm gas}$. Our study constitutes an\nimportant step in the statistical investigation of how local galaxy properties\nimpact the conversion from atomic to molecular gas in nearby galaxies.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_35WiBBR7olMyAIwEgysjOtUI3984KIgZxG4Tct2VY0","pdfSize":"26792623","objectId":"0xa378535515a80a128fb03a59c772719d833809c6beac2fdd013167f2031626f2","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
