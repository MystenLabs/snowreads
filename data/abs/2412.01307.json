  "abstract": "  Recent observations have revealed an unusual stellar distribution within the\nalmost dark dwarf galaxy Nube. The galaxy exhibits a remarkably flat stellar\ndistribution, with an effective radius of approximately 6.9 kpc, exceeding the\ntypical size of dwarf galaxies and even surpassing that of ultra-diffuse\ngalaxies (UDGs) with similar stellar masses. The dynamical heating effect of\nfuzzy dark matter (FDM) may offer an explanation for this extremely diffuse\nstellar distribution in Nube. In this research, we utilize simulation\ntechniques to investigate this issue and find that a particle mass $\\mathcal{O}\n(1)\\times 10^{-23}$ eV offers a plausible explanation for this peculiar stellar\ndistribution anomaly.\n",
