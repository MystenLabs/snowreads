  "abstract": "  Let $(X,D)$ be an open log del Pezzo surface of rank one, that is, $X$ is a\nnormal projective surface of Picard rank one, and the boundary $D$ is a\nreduced, nonzero divisor on $X$. We show that, up to well described exceptions\nin characteristics 2, 3 and 5, the open part $X\\setminus D$ admits an\n$\\mathbb{A}^1$- or $\\mathbb{A}^1_*$-fibration with no base points on the\nboundary of the minimal log resolution of $(X,D)$. In characteristic 0, this\nimproves a well-known structure theorem of Miyanishi-Tsunoda. Within the proof,\nwe classify rational anti-canonical curves contained in smooth loci of\ncanonical del Pezzo surfaces of rank one.\n",
