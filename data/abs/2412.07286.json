  "abstract": "  We present a model selection framework for the extraction of the CKM matrix\nelement $|V_{cb}|$ from exclusive $B \\to D^* l \\nu$ decays. By framing the\ntruncation of the Boyd-Grinstein-Lebed (BGL) parameterization as a model\nselection task, we apply the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to choose the\noptimal truncation order. We demonstrate the performance of our approach\nthrough a comprehensive toy study, comparing it to the Nested Hypothesis Test\n(NHT) method used in previous analyses. Our results show that the AIC-based\napproach produces unbiased estimates of $|V_{cb}|$, albeit with some issues of\nundercoverage. We further investigate the impact of unitarity constraints and\nexplore model averaging using the Global AIC (gAIC) approach, which produced\nunbiased results with correct coverage properties. Our findings suggest that\nmodel selection techniques based on information criteria and model averaging\noffer a promising path towards more reliable $|V_{cb}|$ determinations.\n",
