Implementations have focused in particular on error correction of\nstored, idle quantum information, whereas quantum algorithms are likely to\ndesire high duty cycles of active control. Error-transparent operations are one\nway to preserve error rates during operations, but, to the best of our\nknowledge, only phase gates have so far been given an explicitly\nerror-transparent formulation for binomial encodings. Here, we introduce the\nconcept of 'parity nested' operations, and show how these operations can be\ndesigned to achieve continuous amplitude-mixing logical gates for binomial\nencodings that are fully error-transparent to the photon loss channel. For a\nbinomial encoding that protects against l photon losses, the construction\nrequires $\\lfloor$l/2$\\rfloor$ + 1 orders of generalized squeezing in the\nparity nested operation to fully preserve this protection. We further show that\nerror-transparency to all the correctable photon jumps, but not the no-jump\nerrors, can be achieved with just a single order of squeezing. Finally, we\ncomment on possible approaches to experimental realization of this concept.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TFFODbx0mfJW6o_t6UYhvw6ikf6an-Ka11EEx8FOOtQ","pdfSize":"1402710"}
