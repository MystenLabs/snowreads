Leveraging fine-tuned VGG-19\nand ResNet50 convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the research focuses on\nidentifying snow presence in pavement images. The dataset comprises 98 images\nevenly split between snowy and snow-free conditions, evaluated with a separate\ntest set using the F1 score and accuracy metrics. This work builds upon\nexisting research by employing fine-tuned CNN architectures to accurately\ndetect snow on pavements from smartphone-captured images. The methodology\nincorporates transfer learning and model ensembling techniques to integrate the\nbest predictions from both the VGG19 and ResNet50 architectures. The study\nyields accuracy and F1 scores of 81.8% and 81.7%, respectively, showcasing the\npotential of computer vision in addressing winter-related hazards for\nvulnerable populations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Ur34pgE8rjQjmi7U0kClxd8twOdAk3-T_zGhM9sU2QU","pdfSize":"367827","objectId":"0x6d6f341e103425e29dadc968a8ce6c223701011d0c996205f3bc611d43f68255","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
