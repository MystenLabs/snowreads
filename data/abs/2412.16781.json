As we explain, it plays a central role in the\nSymanzik's polymer representation of the continuous Abelian Yang--Mills--Higgs\nfield in 2 dimensions and allows to study this field using classical stochastic\ncalculus and martingale theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"-ki_kAmec1H1rxOOkjApVU26WgAmDi64S5ACQTjkSxo","pdfSize":"957572"}
