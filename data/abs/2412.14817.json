The model\nis based on a conductivity equation with nonlinear Robin boundary condition. We\nprove that the nonlinear Robin term can be identified locally from Cauchy data\nmeasurements on a subset of the boundary. A possible strategy for turning a\nlocal identification result into a global one is suggested, and a partial\nresult is proved in this direction. The inversion method is an adaptation to\nthis nonlinear Robin problem of a method originally developed for semilinear\nelliptic equations. The strategy is based on linearization and relies on\nparametrizing solutions of the nonlinear equation on solutions of the\nlinearized equation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cP-7pyZ2JNcJjAbiLRC7X4BUFrKPo3270i61BwzXdTA","pdfSize":"296993"}
