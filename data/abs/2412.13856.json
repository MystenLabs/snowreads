  "abstract": "  Fractures, particularly in the distal forearm, are among the most common\ninjuries in children and adolescents, with approximately 800 000 cases treated\nannually in Germany. The AO/OTA system provides a structured fracture type\nclassification, which serves as the foundation for treatment decisions.\nAlthough accurately classifying fractures can be challenging, current deep\nlearning models have demonstrated performance comparable to that of experienced\nradiologists. While most existing approaches rely solely on radiographs, the\npotential impact of incorporating other additional modalities, such as\nautomatic bone segmentation, fracture location, and radiology reports, remains\nunderexplored. In this work, we systematically analyse the contribution of\nthese three additional information types, finding that combining them with\nradiographs increases the AUROC from 91.71 to 93.25. Our code is available on\nGitHub.\n",
