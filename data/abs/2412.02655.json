While large language models (LLMs) are not inherently\ndesigned for planning, they can significantly enhance planning efficiency by\nproviding guidance and informing constraints to ensure safety. This paper\nintroduces a planning framework that integrates LLMs with 2D occupancy grid\nmaps and natural language commands to improve spatial reasoning and task\nexecution in resource-limited settings. By decomposing high-level commands and\nreal-time environmental data, the system generates structured navigation plans\nfor pick-and-place tasks, including obstacle avoidance, goal prioritization,\nand adaptive behaviors. The framework dynamically recalculates paths to address\nenvironmental changes and aligns with implicit social norms for seamless\nhuman-robot interaction. Our results demonstrates the potential of LLMs to\ndesign context-aware system to enhance navigation efficiency and safety in\nindustrial and dynamic environments.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Robotics","Computer Science/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2h0dBt6kW9HoKAwmA-Y-skmr5InkSqLOtCvPfPlhOnI","pdfSize":"1305106"}
