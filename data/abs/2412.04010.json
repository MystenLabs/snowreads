The effective Hamiltonian based on the cyclic\npermutation symmetry of sublattices is constructed to show that the topology of\nDirac fermions at these two valleys is characterized by opposite winding\nnumbers. For spinless fermions, the many-particle interactions produce\nintervalley scattering and drive an intervalley coherent state with spontaneous\ntranslation symmetry breaking. The Dirac fermions acquire a mass term from the\nsimultaneous charge and bond orderings. In this phase, the developed bond\ntexture underlies a hollow-star-of-David pattern in a tripled Wigner-Seitz cell\nof kagom\\'e lattice. It is further demonstrated that the twisting of Dirac mass\nwith vorticity leads to zero Dirac modes at the vortex core, which are\nintimately related to fractionalization. The hollow-star-of-David phase is\nshown to have a distinct $\\mathbb{Z}_6$ Berry phase with its sign-change\ncounterpart of Dirac mass, i.e. the hexagonal phase, shedding light on the\ntopological origin of zero Dirac modes around the vortex core.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xYEM2e1V5sRyIoBz9dVABp-wMk9amTb734MGmtZs8BI","pdfSize":"568651"}
