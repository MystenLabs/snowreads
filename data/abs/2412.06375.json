In 1996, Guiduli posed the\nfollowing problem: If an $n$-vertex graph $G$ possesses the property $P_{t,r}$,\nwhere $t$ is a positive real number and $r$ is a real number such that $r \\geq\n-\\binom{\\lfloor t+1 \\rfloor}{2}$, does it follow that the spectral radius\n$\\rho(G)$ is bounded above by $c(s,t) + \\sqrt{\\lfloor t \\rfloor n}$, where $s =\n\\binom{t+1}{2} + r$?\n  In this paper, we affirmatively resolve Guiduli's problem. Furthermore, we\nprovide a precise characterization of the extremal graphs that achieve this\nbound. Specifically, these extremal graphs are constructed as the join of two\ngraphs: one being a complete graph $K_{\\lfloor t \\rfloor}$, and the other\neither a disjoint union of $K_3$ and isolated vertices, or a forest consisting\nsolely of star structures.\n  The forest of order $n-\\lfloor t \\rfloor$ in extremal graphs is meticulously\ncharacterized. The key to our proof is the classification of the stars into\nfour categories--maximal, large, small, and minimal--according to their sizes.\nThis classification provides deeper insights into how edge distribution\ninfluence the spectral properties of graphs under the constraint of property\n$P_{t,r}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"fSYDXSsTlowNKtbl-H_iccAIp5Upkt12q1SRok-zDOY","pdfSize":"226953"}
