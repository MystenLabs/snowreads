This FPGA is available for radiation tolerant\napplications. The TDC is implemented with 16-channels and a 200 MHz reference\nclock. Each channel is able to record at an event rate of > 1 MHz. The\nperformance of the TDC is assessed over voltage and temperature. Typical TDC\nperformance has a resolution of 10.9 ps. Typical INL is +/-3 LSB peak-to-peak.\nTypical DNL is (+1.13,-0.77) LSB. Typical differential performance between two\nchannels is 20 ps (1-sigma).\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OQUfOruvExfjD2sPkezhfWqQcu7VUd4s07ZKGJpRAwE","pdfSize":"3519522"}
