In these theories one has ontological states in which the\nstate of reality is exactly known and no uncertainties are present. Also these\nstates evolve in time deterministically. A first step in finding the\nontological deterministic theory behind the Standard Model is to find in\nQuantum Field Theory the states that behave as ontological states. We present\nthe ontological states for all non-interacting (3+1-dimensional) Quantum Field\nTheories occurring in the Standard Model. We summarize the ontological states\nfor free scalar bosons and for free masless Dirac fermions, which are known\nfrom the literature. We construct the ontological states for vector bosons, in\nanalogy to the scalar boson case. With this we have a set of ontological states\nfor all particles that are known to occur in reality and in the Standard Model.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QZ2vOgN86p0uFAdcu6pnoYWouINDXk6ufqWN17NUob8","pdfSize":"154372"}
