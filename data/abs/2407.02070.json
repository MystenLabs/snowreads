To address this\nchallenge, we train a novel generative deep learning approach on extensive sets\nof climate simulations. The model consists of two components: a variational\nautoencoder for dimensionality reduction and a denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic model that generates multiple ensemble members. We validate our\nmodel on the Max Planck Institute Grand Ensemble and show that it achieves good\nagreement with the original ensemble in terms of variability. By leveraging the\nlatent space representation, our model can rapidly generate large ensembles\non-the-fly with minimal memory requirements, which can significantly improve\nthe efficiency of uncertainty quantification in climate simulations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"qIWB0aJ60TisxzLC4BCNA6Nj-ywqKtMQhuo5hIUDK5s","pdfSize":"4350872"}
