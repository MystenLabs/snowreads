Here, we\nreport on a combined experimental and theoretical study of magnetic, optical,\nand structural properties of bulk CrPS$_{4}$ samples. We find that the\nmagnetic-field-dependent circular polarization degree of the photoluminescence\nis a direct measure of the net magnetization of CrPS$_{4}$. Complementary,\nRaman scattering measured as a function of magnetic field and temperature\nenables the determination of the magnetic susceptibility curve of the material.\nOur experimental results are backed by Our experimental results are supported\nby density functional theory calculations that take as input the lattice\nparameters determined from temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction\nmeasurements. This allows us to explain the impact of spin ordering on the\nspectral position of Raman transitions in CrPS$_4$, as well as anomalous\ntemperature shifts of selected of them. The presented method for all-optical\ndetermination of the magnetic properties is highly promising for studies of\nspin ordering and magnetic phase transitions in single- or a few-layer samples\nof magnetic layered materials, for which a poor signal-to-noise ratio precludes\nany reliable neutron scattering or magnetometry measurements.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pPj7ewUstioo3ahf9F7El06qPQb2WmYJsn-UQ5mDPps","pdfSize":"10979362"}
