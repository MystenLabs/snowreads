These are elementary particles, which exist\nin three different flavors and change the latter as they propagate in the dense\ncore of astrophysical sources as well as en route to Earth. To capitalize on\nexisting and upcoming multi-messenger opportunities, it is crucial to\nunderstand: 1. the role of neutrinos in explosive transient sources as well as\nin the synthesis of the elements heavier than iron; 2. the impact of neutrino\nphysics on the multi-messenger observables; 3. the information on the source\nphysics carried by the detectable neutrino signal. In this review, the status\nof this exciting and fast-moving field is outlined, focusing on astrophysical\nsources linked to collapsing massive stars and neutron-star mergers. In light\nof the upcoming plethora of multi-messenger data, outstanding open issues\nconcerning the optimization of multi-messenger detection strategies are\ndiscussed.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"f0EcmMlcDq5kQ_HViXc8OmSfQ7R8R4EJIMHrDzO3BEE","pdfSize":"1503235"}
