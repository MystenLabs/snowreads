We show analytically that the expansion induces a\nterm in the entanglement entropy that depends logarithmically on the size of\nthe overall system, which may extend beyond the horizon. In cosmology the size\nof the system can be identified with the size of a spatially finite universe,\nor with the wavelength of the first mode that exited the horizon in the\nbeginning of inflation.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"M9h8aNDZjvTncI4yVbyCwpxnwY7nuba5LxNTsvorP_I","pdfSize":"192909","objectId":"0xae9a7d0e4b981bd4d6e3b8015069b3cf6c43a760ba9fd87d8c4c5c349dffce93","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
