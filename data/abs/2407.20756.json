Vision Large Language Models\n(VLLMs) have recently emerged due to their robust vision-understanding\ncapabilities. However, training these models requires vast amounts of data,\nposing challenges to efficiency, effectiveness, data quality, and privacy. In\nthis paper, we introduce SynthVLM, a novel data synthesis pipeline for VLLMs.\nUnlike existing methods that generate captions from images, SynthVLM employs\nadvanced diffusion models and high-quality captions to automatically generate\nand select high-resolution images from captions, creating precisely aligned\nimage-text pairs. Leveraging these pairs, we achieve state-of-the-art (SoTA)\nperformance on various vision question answering tasks, maintaining high\nalignment quality and preserving advanced language abilities. Moreover,\nSynthVLM surpasses traditional GPT-4 Vision-based caption generation methods in\nperformance while significantly reducing computational overhead. Crucially, our\nmethod's reliance on purely generated data ensures the preservation of privacy,\nachieving SoTA performance with just 100k data points (only 18% of the official\ndataset size).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Fn9LuY_uJ18LGSJSOgL9wjJuexIlxAMk4fd9msYW7ok","pdfSize":"3915531"}
