  "abstract": "  Li containing transition metal oxides are known as good ionic conductors.\nPerforming classical molecular dynamics simulations, the diffusion behavior of\nLi ions is investigated in crystalline and amorphous phases with the\nstoichiometries Li$_2$ZrO$_3$ and LiNbO$_3$. We first demonstrate the stability\nof the crystal structures for the used interatomic potential model and then\nanalyze the amorphous phases, which result from melt-and-quench simulations, in\nterms of radial distribution functions. Diffusivities of Li ions in those\nsystems are obtained from a statistical Arrhenius analysis of mean square\ndisplacement curves at different temperatures. The crystalline phase of\nLi$_2$ZrO$_3$ exhibits two well-defined migration mechanisms: vacancy-mediated\nmigration is dominant below and a site exchange of Li ions above a crossover\nregion between about 1700 and 1800 K. The latter mechanism also prevails in the\namorphous phases of Li$_2$ZrO$_3$ with a strongly reduced activation energy,\nwhich is due to a smaller equilibrium separation of Li ions as in the crystal\nstructure. This migration mechanism is found in amorphous LiNbO$_3$, too.\n",
