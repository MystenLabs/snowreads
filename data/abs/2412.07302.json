  "abstract": "  Large-scale 3D point clouds (LS3DPC) obtained by LiDAR scanners require huge\nstorage space and transmission bandwidth due to a large amount of data. The\nexisting methods of LS3DPC compression separately perform rule-based point\nsampling and learnable feature extraction, and hence achieve limited\ncompression performance. In this paper, we propose a fully end-to-end training\nframework for LS3DPC compression where the point sampling and the feature\nextraction are jointly optimized in terms of the rate and distortion losses. To\nthis end, we first make the point sampling module to be trainable such that an\noptimal position of the downsampled point is estimated via aggregation with\nlearnable weights. We also develop a reliable point reconstruction scheme that\nadaptively aggregates the expanded candidate points to refine the positions of\nupsampled points. Experimental results evaluated on the SemanticKITTI and\nnuScenes datasets show that the proposed method achieves significantly higher\ncompression ratios compared with the existing state-of-the-art methods.\n",
