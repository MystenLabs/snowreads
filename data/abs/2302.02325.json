They add a transaction to the ledger after it undergoes\nconsensus among the replicas that run a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) or Byzantine\nFault-Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocol. Unfortunately, these protocols face a\nlong-range attack where an adversary having access to the private keys of the\nreplicas can rewrite the ledger. One solution is forcing each committed block\nfrom these protocols to undergo another consensus, Proof-of-Work(PoW)\nconsensus; PoW protocol leads to wastage of computational resources as miners\ncompete to solve complex puzzles. In this paper, we present the design of our\nPower-of-Collaboration (PoC) protocol, which guards existing PoS/BFT\nblockchains against long-range attacks and requires miners to collaborate\nrather than compete. PoC guarantees fairness and accountability and only\nmarginally degrades the throughput of the underlying system.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Databases","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Vkzl2lXn8g_tivNMgYef2qf41sMIEqFweqwlAU_biNQ","pdfSize":"860724"}
