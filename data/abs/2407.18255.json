The CORDIC (Coordinate\nRotation Digital Computer) iterative algorithm can perform this operation, as\nwell as trigonometric functions and vector rotations, using only simple\narithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and bit-shifting. This\nresearch paper presents hardware architecture for a 3-D CORDIC processor using\nQuartus II 7.1 ALTERA software, which enables easy modifications and design\nchanges due to its regularity and simplicity. The proposed 3-D CORDIC model is\nevaluated by comparing the calculated results with the simulated results to\ndetermine its accuracy. The results were satisfaction and the proposed model\ncould be suitable for numerous real-time applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Up8ULb8p1KpD3vE8ecEZERp4kShUMd0DtkKjHdUt1oc","pdfSize":"707032"}
