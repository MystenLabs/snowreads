While these platforms represent successful examples of\ncollective knowledge production, they are also sites of significant conflict,\nas diverse participants with differing intentions and perspectives interact.\nThe analysis identifies recurring patterns of interaction, including serial\nattacks, reciprocal revenge, and third-party interventions. These\nmicrostructures reveal the role of experience, cultural differences, and topic\nsensitivity in shaping human-human, human-machine, and machine-machine\ninteractions. The chapter further investigates the role of algorithmic agents\nand bots, highlighting their dual nature: they enhance collaboration by\nautomating tasks but can also contribute to persistent conflicts with both\nhumans and other machines. We conclude with policy recommendations that\nemphasize transparency, balance, cultural sensitivity, and governance to\nmaximize the benefits of human-machine synergy while minimizing potential\ndetriments.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computers and Society","Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction","Computer Science/Social and Information Networks","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HSyv7wKiY-mS-cQDJ7LSzOc2B1Fdf1hQhSk2p-pc1Vw","pdfSize":"563484"}
