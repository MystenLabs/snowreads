  "abstract": "  We propose two thermo-spintronic responses of spin-orbit coupled\nsuperconductors - the intrinsic thermal Edelstein effect and intrinsic spin\nNernst effect - stemming from phase-space and momentum-space Berry curvatures\nof Bogoliubov quasiparticles. We unveil that the Bloch band spin-orbit coupling\nand superconducting pairing are entangled in shaping the quasiparticle Berry\ncurvatures rather than in an additive manner. The resulting thermo-spintronic\nresponses are significantly enhanced at low temperatures by the emergence of\nBogoliubov Fermi surface, and can be effectively modulated by tuning the\nlatter. Our work reveals unique Berry curvature properties in topologically\ntrivial superconductors with spin-orbit coupling, and opens a new route to\nsuperconducting spintronics.\n",
