  "abstract": "  This paper explains how traditional centralized architectures are\ntransitioning to distributed zonal approaches to address challenges in\nscalability, reliability, performance, and cost-effectiveness. The role of edge\ncomputing and neural networks in enabling sophisticated sensor fusion and\ndecision-making capabilities for autonomous vehicles is examined. Additionally,\nthis paper discusses the impact of zonal architectures on vehicle diagnostics,\npower distribution, and smart power management systems. Key design\nconsiderations for implementing effective zonal architectures are presented,\nalong with an overview of current challenges and future directions. The\nobjective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how\nzonal architectures are shaping the future of automotive technology,\nparticularly in the context of self-driving vehicles and artificial\nintelligence integration.\n",
