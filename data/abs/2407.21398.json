However, a lack of\nattention to device security and user-awareness beyond the primary function of\nthese IoT devices may be exposing users to invisible risks. This paper extends\nupon prior work that defined the \"droplock\", an attack whereby a smart lock is\nturned into a wireless fingerprint harvester. We perform a more in-depth\nanalysis of a broader range of vulnerabilities and exploits that make a\ndroplock attack easier to perform and harder to detect. Analysis is extended to\na range of other smart lock models, and a threat model is used as the basis to\nrecommend stronger security controls that may mitigate the risks of such as\nattack.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"ERPrH2yXGL_w5Yhm9CzRfW8fEXujI6r0QWVQt_uiF2Y","pdfSize":"4749607"}
