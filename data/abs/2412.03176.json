  "abstract": "  In this paper we present a hybrid method for the automatic detection of\ndermatological pathologies in medical reports. We use a large language model\ncombined with medical ontologies to predict, given a first appointment or\nfollow-up medical report, the pathology a person may suffer from. The results\nshow that teaching the model to learn the type, severity and location on the\nbody of a dermatological pathology, as well as in which order it has to learn\nthese three features, significantly increases its accuracy. The article\npresents the demonstration of state-of-the-art results for classification of\nmedical texts with a precision of 0.84, micro and macro F1-score of 0.82 and\n0.75, and makes both the method and the data set used available to the\ncommunity.\n",
