  "abstract": "  We present a question-and-answer (Q\\&A) application designed to support the\ncontract management process by leveraging combined information from contract\ndocuments (PDFs) and data retrieved from contract management systems\n(database). This data is processed by a large language model (LLM) to provide\nprecise and relevant answers. The accuracy of these responses is further\nenhanced through the use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), text-to-SQL\ntechniques, and agents that dynamically orchestrate the workflow. These\ntechniques eliminate the need to retrain the language model. Additionally, we\nemployed Prompt Engineering to fine-tune the focus of responses. Our findings\ndemonstrate that this multi-agent orchestration and combination of techniques\nsignificantly improve the relevance and accuracy of the answers, offering a\npromising direction for future information systems.\n",
