HI studies have so far been limited by the\ncapabilities of single-dish radio telescopes or synthesis arrays to either\nsmall samples or low resolution and sensitivities. Now, the Square Kilometer\nArray precursors and pathfinders are providing a novel view of the HI in and\naround galaxies allowing wide-field high resolution deep surveys in nearby\ngalaxies. We give an overview of past, current and future HI surveys\nconsistently comparing their HI column density and spatial resolutions\nhighlighting their main scientific key goals and results.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6SPaSa6YFAF5KFuzqCRdlwX8ghj68zR_mh_olETgUTM","pdfSize":"896273"}
