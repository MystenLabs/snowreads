  "abstract": "  This study aims to determine the algebraic structures of\n$\\alpha$-constacyclic codes of length $3p^s$ over the finite commutative\nnon-chain ring $\\mathcal{R}=\\frac{\\mathbb{F}_{p^m}[u, v]}{\\langle u^2, v^2,\nuv-vu\\rangle}$, for a prime $p \\neq 3.$ For the unit $\\alpha$, we consider two\ndifferent instances: when $\\alpha$ is a cube in $\\mathcal{R}$ and when it is\nnot. Analyzing the first scenario is relatively easy. When $\\alpha$ is not a\nunit in $\\mathcal{R}$, we consider several subcases and determine the algebraic\nstructures of constacyclic codes in those cases. Further, we also provide the\nnumber of codewords and the duals of $\\alpha$-constacyclic codes.\n",
