  "abstract": "  A thulium-doped fiber laser operating quasi-continuous-wave generated 198 W\nof instantaneous output power in 0.2-ms pulses at 50 Hz repetition rate. The\nduty cycle becomes 1% and the average output power 2.0 W. This was\ncladding-pumped with 408 W from 0.79-um diode lasers (average pump power 4.1\nW). The pump switch-on time was ~10 us at full power, with the laser exhibiting\nrelaxation oscillations starting ~5 us after the start of the pumping and\nlasting for ~5 us. The slope efficiency with respect to absorbed pump power was\n67% up to 200 W of absorbed pump power and 52% at the full 352 W of absorbed\npump power. The low duty cycle simplified the heatsinking, despite the high\ninstantaneous power and thermal load.\n",
