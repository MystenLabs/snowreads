We use the data from Pantheon$+$, cosmic chronometers,\nand the latest DESI BAO results for this purpose. We reaffirm the fact that\nthere is a degeneracy between $M$ and $r_d$, and modifying the $r_d$ values to\nreconcile the Hubble tension also requires a change in the peak absolute\nmagnitude $M$. For certain $M$ and $r_d$ priors, the tension is found to reduce\nto as low as (1.2-2) $\\sigma$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zA3ddxtb8dnAQT01dJGmY_zy3CtmLWCT29WjWtAX_6A","pdfSize":"565179"}
