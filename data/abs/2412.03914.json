  "abstract": "  This paper proposes a metalens designed to work in 3.3 {\\mu}m wavelength\nwhich resides in the mid-IR region. The metasurface was created using MoS2\nnanopillars taking advantage of high refractive index and low loss. It could be\nused to make compact optical Methane gas sensors.\n",
