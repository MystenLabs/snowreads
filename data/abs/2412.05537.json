Such a system may be modeled as a Heisenberg XY spin chain\nwith $\\textit{N}$ interacting spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particles under an external\nmagnetic field. Here we consider both nearest-neighbor and long-range spin\ninteractions. The charging performance of this many-body quantum battery is\nevaluated by comparing Landau-Zener and periodic driving protocols within these\ninteraction regimes. Our findings show that the Landau-Zener driving can offer\nsuperior energy deposition and storage efficiency compared to periodic driving.\nNotably, the Landau-Zener protocol may deliver optimal performance when\ncombined with long-range interactions. The efficiency of a Landau-Zener quantum\nbattery can be significantly enhanced by optimizing key parameters, such as XY\nanisotropy, the magnitude of the driving field, and interaction strength.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"LjpGDeDVSXV8tj3pV98v4BA_sneFnyM97IQkDJeV31U","pdfSize":"28535956"}
