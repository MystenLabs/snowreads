  "abstract": "  This paper describes the zero-shot spontaneous style TTS system for the\nISCSLP 2024 Conversational Voice Clone Challenge (CoVoC). We propose a\nLLaMA-based codec language model with a delay pattern to achieve spontaneous\nstyle voice cloning. To improve speech intelligibility, we introduce the\nClassifier-Free Guidance (CFG) strategy in the language model to strengthen\nconditional guidance on token prediction. To generate high-quality utterances,\nwe adopt effective data preprocessing operations and fine-tune our model with\nselected high-quality spontaneous speech data. The official evaluations in the\nCoVoC constrained track show that our system achieves the best speech\nnaturalness MOS of 3.80 and obtains considerable speech quality and speaker\nsimilarity results.\n",
