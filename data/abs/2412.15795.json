  "abstract": "  A rigid isotopy of real algebraic curves of a certain class is a path in the\nspace of curves of this class. The paper's study completes the rigid isotopic\nclassification of nonsingular real algebraic curves of bidegree (4,3) on a\nhyperboloid, begun by the author in earlier works. There are given the missing\nproofs of the uniqueness of the connected components for 16 classes of real\nalgebraic curves of bidegree (4,3) having a single node or a cusp. The main\ntechnical tools are graphs of real trigonal curves on Hirzebruch surfaces.\n",
