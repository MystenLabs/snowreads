  "abstract": "  With the increasing use of plastic, the challenges associated with managing\nplastic waste have become more challenging, emphasizing the need of effective\nsolutions for classification and recycling. This study explores the potential\nof deep learning, focusing on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and object\ndetection models like YOLO (You Only Look Once), to tackle this issue using the\nWaDaBa dataset. The study shows that YOLO- 11m achieved highest accuracy\n(98.03%) and mAP50 (0.990), with YOLO-11n performing similarly but highest\nmAP50(0.992). Lightweight models like YOLO-10n trained faster but with lower\naccuracy, whereas MobileNet V2 showed impressive performance (97.12% accuracy)\nbut fell short in object detection. Our study highlights the potential of deep\nlearning models in transforming how we classify plastic waste, with YOLO models\nproving to be the most effective. By balancing accuracy and computational\nefficiency, these models can help to create scalable, impactful solutions in\nwaste management and recycling.\n",
