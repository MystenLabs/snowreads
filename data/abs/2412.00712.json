  "abstract": "  In this work, the author gives a character-free proof of the Frobenius\ntheorem. The new proof is based on some notions and results from the theory of\nternary operations, the theory of orthogonal binary operations, the theory of\ntransversals in groups and the theory of quasigroups and loops.\n",
