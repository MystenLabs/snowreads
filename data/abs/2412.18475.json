The well-posedness of such problems is\ntypically established by demonstrating the convergence of robust first-order\nschemes. However, achieving more accurate solutions necessitates the\ndevelopment of higher-order schemes. In this article, we present a fully\ndiscrete, second-order scheme for a general class of non-local conservation law\nsystems in multiple spatial dimensions. The method employs a MUSCL-type spatial\nreconstruction coupled with Runge-Kutta time integration. The proposed scheme\nis proven to preserve positivity in all the unknowns and exhibits L-infinity\nstability. Numerical experiments conducted on both the non-local scalar and\nsystem cases illustrate the8 importance of second-order scheme when compared to\nits first-order counterpart.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VxeWw9RhvUY02Rm7-3Z-J9v4qSB5XQIPyJ014FuG3Vw","pdfSize":"1620767"}
