This paper presents an efficient\ndownlink framework for multi-spectral satellite images, leveraging adaptive\ntransmission techniques based on pixel importance and link capacity. By\nintegrating semantic communication principles, the framework prioritizes\ncritical information, such as changed multi-spectral pixels, to optimize data\ntransmission. The process involves preprocessing, assessing pixel importance to\nencode only significant changes, and dynamically adjusting transmissions to\nmatch channel conditions. Experimental results on the real dataset and\nsimulated link demonstrate that the proposed approach ensures high-quality data\ndelivery while significantly reducing number of transmitted data, making it\nhighly suitable for satellite-based EO applications.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aGUpfUDR3fVwMYjedTvcLNfWeyaKM1BEaNZ8-M064pA","pdfSize":"13675634"}
