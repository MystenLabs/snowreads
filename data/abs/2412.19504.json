In this study, we introduce an\ninnovative approach that leverages only transcription annotations for training\ntext spotting models, substantially reducing the dependency on elaborate\nannotation processes. Our methodology employs a query-based paradigm that\nfacilitates the learning of implicit location features through the interaction\nbetween text queries and image embeddings. These features are later refined\nduring the text recognition phase using an attention activation map. Addressing\nthe challenges associated with training a weakly-supervised model from scratch,\nwe implement a circular curriculum learning strategy to enhance model\nconvergence. Additionally, we introduce a coarse-to-fine cross-attention\nlocalization mechanism for more accurate text instance localization. Notably,\nour framework supports audio-based annotation, which significantly diminishes\nannotation time and provides an inclusive alternative for individuals with\ndisabilities. Our approach achieves competitive performance against existing\nbenchmarks, demonstrating that high accuracy in text spotting can be attained\nwithout extensive location annotations.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ml4XzSplxufpMiY4aNp7eJed5w3I40J_GLfdydbxo4w","pdfSize":"13772344"}
