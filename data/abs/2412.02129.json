Specifically, GSOT3D offers 620 sequences with 123K frames, and covers a\nwide selection of 54 object categories. Each sequence is offered with multiple\nmodalities, including the point cloud (PC), RGB image, and depth. This allows\nGSOT3D to support various 3D tracking tasks, such as single-modal 3D SOT on PC\nand multi-modal 3D SOT on RGB-PC or RGB-D, and thus greatly broadens research\ndirections for 3D object tracking. To provide highquality per-frame 3D\nannotations, all sequences are labeled manually with multiple rounds of\nmeticulous inspection and refinement. To our best knowledge, GSOT3D is the\nlargest benchmark dedicated to various generic 3D object tracking tasks. To\nunderstand how existing 3D trackers perform and to provide comparisons for\nfuture research on GSOT3D, we assess eight representative point cloud-based\ntracking models. Our evaluation results exhibit that these models heavily\ndegrade on GSOT3D, and more efforts are required for robust and generic 3D\nobject tracking. Besides, to encourage future research, we present a simple yet\neffective generic 3D tracker, named PROT3D, that localizes the target object\nvia a progressive spatial-temporal network and outperforms all current\nsolutions by a large margin. By releasing GSOT3D, we expect to advance further\n3D tracking in future research and applications. Our benchmark and model as\nwell as the evaluation results will be publicly released at our webpage\nhttps://github.com/ailovejinx/GSOT3D.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"uNCrsLViRv28jonGnHYxEzUsB5kAAA4Ni1XwLP4BnXc","pdfSize":"7222046"}
