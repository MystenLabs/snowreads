The algorithm was implemented using the programming\nlanguages Python, R, and MATLAB. Initial results led to the conclusion that\nthere was less amplitude loss in the filtered signal compared to the FIR\nfilter. Future work may address a more rigorous methodology and comparative\nassessment of computational cost.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5RSmHTcQHa3Xajrvzxyq4Ys7Uiobc2w6-4t5i4QcmE4","pdfSize":"491877"}
