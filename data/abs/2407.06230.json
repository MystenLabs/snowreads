We use referential\ntranslation machines (RTMs), which allows a common representation for training\nand test sets and stacked machine learning models. RTMs can achieve the top\nresults in Graded Word Similarity in Context (GWSC) task.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dxtInvY-SQXLQvcUmCL95t1LMIkrw2kXPYHkiPYAuzI","pdfSize":"444952"}
