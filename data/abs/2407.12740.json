We model the galaxy as a\ntwo-component system consisting of stars and gas in equilibrium with an\nexternal dark matter halo. We derive the equations governing the growth of\nperturbations and obtain a stability criterion that connects the potential of\nthe dark matter halo and the gas fraction with the stability levels of the\ngalaxy. We find that a two-component disc is more susceptible to the growth of\ngravitational instabilities than individual components, particularly as gas\nfractions increase. However, the external field, due to the dark matter halo,\nacts as a stabilizing agent and increases the net stability levels even in the\npresence of a cold gas component. We apply the stability criterion to models of\nthe Milky Way, low surface brightness galaxies, and baryon-dominated cold\nrotating disc galaxies observed in the early universe. Our results show that\nthe potential due to the dark matter halo plays a significant role in\nstabilizing nearby galaxies, such as the Milky Way, and low surface brightness\ngalaxies, which would otherwise be prone to local gravitational instabilities.\nHowever, we find that the baryon-dominated cold disc galaxies observed in the\nearly universe remain susceptible to the growth of local gravitational\ninstabilities despite the stabilizing effect of the dark matter halo.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dlvKNAPC9YQ9h9n2vtxmPxE6m5pI2eHXk_6-qjdDaCM","pdfSize":"612041"}
