  "abstract": "  MusicGen is a music generation language model (LM) that can be conditioned on\ntextual descriptions and melodic features. We introduce MusicGen-Chord, which\nextends this capability by incorporating chord progression features. This model\nmodifies one-hot encoded melody chroma vectors into multi-hot encoded chord\nchroma vectors, enabling the generation of music that reflects both chord\nprogressions and textual descriptions. Furthermore, we developed\nMusicGen-Remixer, an application utilizing MusicGen-Chord to generate remixes\nof input music conditioned on textual descriptions. Both models are integrated\ninto Replicate's web-UI using cog, facilitating broad accessibility and\nuser-friendly controllable interaction for creating and experiencing\nAI-generated music.\n",
