We prove\nthe existence and uniqueness of predictable increasing mean intensity for the\nPoisson additive process. Besides, we establish a likelihood ratio formula for\nthe Poisson additive process. It directly implies there doesn't exist an\nanticipative Poisson additive process which is absolutely continuous with\nrespect to the standard Poisson process, which confirms a conjecture proposed\nby P. Br\\'emaud in his PhD thesis in 1972. When applied to the Hawkes process,\nit concludes that the self-exciting function is constant. Similar results are\nalso obtained for the Wiener additive process and Markov additive process.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2CVUX-CZoOSjcy3IXPaDbHKi5BLfNlba7CZ13sy3Tyo","pdfSize":"576141","objectId":"0x40122539cdb2259779fa85d457b7c8c373237ca8ccd61546e4803eeaa21e5596","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
