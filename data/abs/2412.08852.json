For that purpose we first constrain the model parameters\n$H_0$, $\\Omega_{m0}$, $\\Omega_{r0}$ and $M$ by means of the Pantheon+ catalog\nand a mock catalog of gravitational waves. Then, we solve numerically the\nequation for dark matter scalar perturbations using the dynamical scaling\nsolution for the master equation and assuming that $p=4$ for the matter\ndominated era. Finally, we found that the evolution of matter density\nperturbations in both branches is different from the $\\Lambda$CDM model and\nthat the value of $\\sigma_8=0.774\\pm0.027$ for the normal branch and\n$\\sigma_8=0.913\\pm0.032$ for the self-accelerating branch.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SnWwbX63sEwSrA2QYsplBbgjbTl0HTB3TDLF9MSwIKk","pdfSize":"1348560"}
