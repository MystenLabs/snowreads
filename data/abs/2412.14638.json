Methods:\nTuneS, a novel pipeline to predict clinically optimal DBS contact\nconfigurations based on predefined targets and constraints, is introduced. The\nmethod relies upon patient-specific models of stimulation spread and extends\noptimization beyond traditional neural structures to include automated,\nmodel-based targeting of streamlines. Results: Initial findings demonstrate\nthat STN motor streamlines consistently receive a significant portion of the\nallocated stimulation volume, suggesting that a consistent portion of the\nstimulation should ideally focus on the STN motor streamlines. At the example\nof a small cohort of Parkinson's disease patients, the value of model-based\ncontact predictions for assessing stimulation targets while observing\nconstraints is demonstrated. Conclusion: TuneS shows promise as a research\ntool, enabling systematic assessment of DBS target effectiveness and\nfacilitating constraint-aware optimization of stimulation parameters.\nSignificance: The presented pipeline offers a pathway to improve\npatient-specific DBS therapies and contributes to the broader understanding of\neffective DBS targeting strategies.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computer Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"e5utsUogScIgdUKvDyHp9_iPhqFlD8MO0yrYzltIE6I","pdfSize":"3591172"}
