This equalization involves two different tasks: 1)\nestimation of the channel impulse response, and 2) estimation of the users'\ntransmitted symbols. The new algorithm is developed and applied in a\nDirect-Sequence / Code-Division Multiple-Access (DS/CDMA) multiuser\ncommunications system. Important issues such as robustness, convergence speed\nand population diversity control have been in deep investigated. A method based\non the entropy of the flowers' fitness is proposed for in-service monitoring\nand adjusting population diversity. Numerical simulations analyze the\nperformance, showing comparisons with well-known conventional multiuser\ndetectors such as Matched Filter (MF), Minimum Mean Square Error Estimator\n(MMSEE) or several Bayesian schemes, as well as with other nature-inspired\nstrategies. Numerical analysis shows that the proposed algorithm enables\ntransmission at higher symbol rates under stronger fading and interference\nconditions, constituting an attractive alternative to previous algorithms, both\nconventional and nature-inspired, whose performance is frequently sensible to\nnear-far effects and multiple-access interference problems. These results have\nbeen validated by running hypothesis tests to confirm statistical significance.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"4nOI72jtSZai1TQOWSF9NmLB7vSxZpwkDkcuaPqcJ7c","pdfSize":"430351"}
