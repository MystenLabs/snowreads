On the other hand, to solve interesting problems, we need to run\ncomplex programs on fault-tolerant quantum computers, and hence, the system\nneeds to use hardware resources efficiently. Taking advantage of parallelism is\na major optimization strategy and compilers are responsible for performing\noptimizations to allow parallel processing. However, the probabilistic nature\nof magic state distillation is not compatible with compile-time optimizations\nand results in an additional run-time delay. To reduce the additional run-time\ndelay, we propose introducing a pool of magic states. We run simulations of\nquantum circuits to verify the magnitude of the run-time delay and the\nusefulness of the mitigation approach. The experimental results show that the\nrun-time delay is amplified by parallel processing, and pooling effectively\nreduces the run-time delay with a small spatial cost.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_ifZXWPUiNAS9soeggtBzSXwMp9H0k0H2VA-NMQdUi4","pdfSize":"1305469"}
