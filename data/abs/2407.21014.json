We investigate the precise decay rate of the\nprobability to obtain an overlap greater than $a$, for some $a>0$, in the whole\nsubcritical phase of inverse temperatures $\\beta \\in [0,\\beta_c)$. Moreover, we\nstudy this probability both conditionally on the branching Brownian motion and\nnon-conditionally. Two sub-phases of inverse temperatures appear, but\nsurprisingly the threshold is not the same in both cases.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pwMN3wWJc2-uHSmzllyGThiIHUbnDJc0L0MXWkctEWA","pdfSize":"553714"}
