Such a threefold $X$ can be realized by a\nregular zero section $\\mathbf{s}$ of $(\\bigwedge^2\\mathcal{F}^{*})^{\\oplus 3}$\nover Grassmannian variety $\\mathrm{Gr}(3,V)$, $\\dim V=7$ with the universal\nsubbundle $\\mathcal{F}$. When the section $\\mathbf{s}$ is given by the net of\nthe $\\mathrm{SL}_2$-invariant skew forms, we call it by the Mukai-Umemura (MU)\nvariety. In this paper, we prove that the Hilbert scheme of rational quartic\ncurves in the MU-variety is smooth and compute its Poincar\\'e polynomial by\napplying the Bia{\\l}ynicki-Birula's theorem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Zkyys5ElsTCl__DcDCeE5pbXq4QTEUcET44uczJt8ns","pdfSize":"518259"}
