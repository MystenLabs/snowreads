  "abstract": "  The main aim of this paper is to review recent advances in the multivariate\nautoregressive index model [MAI], originally proposed by\n<cite>reinsel1983some</cite>, and their applications to economic and financial\ntime series. MAI has recently gained momentum because it can be seen as a link\nbetween two popular but distinct multivariate time series approaches: vector\nautoregressive modeling [VAR] and the dynamic factor model [DFM]. Indeed, on\nthe one hand, the MAI is a VAR model with a peculiar reduced-rank structure; on\nthe other hand, it allows for identification of common components and common\nshocks in a similar way as the DFM. The focus is on recent developments of the\nMAI, which include extending the original model with individual autoregressive\nstructures, stochastic volatility, time-varying parameters,\nhigh-dimensionality, and cointegration. In addition, new insights on previous\ncontributions and a novel model are also provided.\n",
