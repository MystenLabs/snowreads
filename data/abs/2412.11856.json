  "abstract": "  We present comprehensive high magnetic field studies of the alternating\nweakly coupled ferro-antiferromagnetic (FM-AFM) spin-$1/2$ chain compound\nCu$_2$(OH)$_3$Br, with the structure of the natural mineral botallackite. Our\nmeasurements reveal a broad magnetization plateau at about half of the\nsaturation value, strongly suggesting that the FM chain sublattice becomes\nfully polarized, while the AFM chain sublattice remains barely magnetized, in\nmagnetic fields at least up to $50$ T. We confirm a spin-reorientation\ntransition for magnetic fields applied in the $ac^\\ast$-plane, whose angular\ndependence is described in the framework of the mean-field theory. Employing\nhigh-field THz spectroscopy, we reveal a complex pattern of high-frequency\nspinon-magnon bound-state excitations. On the other hand, at lower frequencies\nwe observe two modes of antiferromagnetic resonance, as a consequence of the\nlong-range magnetic ordering. We demonstrate that applied magnetic field tends\nto suppress the long-range magnetic ordering; the temperature-field phase\ndiagram of the phase transition is obtained for magnetic fields up to $14$ T\nfor three principal directions ($a$, $b$, $c^\\ast$).\n",
