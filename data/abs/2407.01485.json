Furthermore, these models can be extended to\nthe isotopologues of the reaction involving deuterium and tritium. In addition,\nwe develop a neural network model that can learn across the chemical space\nbased on the isotopologues of hydrogen. The model can predict the outcome of a\nreaction whose reactants have never been seen. This is done by training on the\nCa $+$ H2 and Ca $+$ T2 reactions and subsequently predicting the Ca $+$ D2\nreaction.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iZTEPHF0uCMKEDEPm2kl7mJ9IqmM78KEFOjWBofn9K4","pdfSize":"1656309"}
