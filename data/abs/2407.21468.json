Several process modeling formalisms have been proposed and\nused, e.g., Petri nets, BPMN, and process trees. Despite their frequent use,\nlittle research addresses the formal properties of process trees and the\ncorresponding potential to improve the efficiency of solving common\ncomputational problems. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an invertible\nstate space definition for process trees and demonstrate that the corresponding\nstate space graph is isomorphic to the state space graph of the tree's inverse.\nOur result supports the development of novel, time-efficient, decomposition\nstrategies for applications of process trees. Our experiments confirm that our\nstate space definition allows for the adoption of bidirectional state space\nsearch, which significantly improves the overall performance of state space\nsearches.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Pjh0HJAvHaqlbgOfB9RKJkkZmhlunsxhcJpXDjOcjno","pdfSize":"472832"}
