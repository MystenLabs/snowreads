The similar family of\nmixed states $\\rho^{n}$ are developed by L. Derkacz et. al. with differed\napproach. Further the author extend $\\rho^{n}$ to two parameter family of\nquantum states $\\rho^{m}$ and characterized these states in terms of Bell\ninequality violation against their mixedness. In the present article, we\ninvestigate the comparative dynamics of all mixed states\n$(\\rho^{l},\\rho^{n},\\rho^{m})$ under the bipartite Ising Hamiltonian exposed by\nthe external magnetic field and investigate the dynamics of quantum\ncorrelations against the mixedness quantified by linear entropy\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wO3rhMy1gQKma_h2L_I45eWH5KNyIutAb44C6j_bR8o","pdfSize":"2382622"}
