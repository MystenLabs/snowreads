It has\nbeen demonstrated for two exactly solvable spin systems, that thermodynamic\ncriticality is directly \\textit{indicated} by finite size scaling of the global\nmaxima and turning points of the susceptibility of entanglement entropy through\nnumerical analysis - obtaining power laws. Analytically we have proved those\npower laws for $| \\ \\lambda_c(N)-\\lambda_c^{\\infty}|$ as $N\\to \\infty$ in the\ncases of finite 1D transverse field ising model (TFIM) ($\\lambda=h$) and XY\nchain ($\\lambda=\\gamma$). The integer power law appearing for XY model has been\nverified using perturbation theory in $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{N})$ and the\nfractional power law appearing in the case of TFIM, is verified by an exact\napproach involving Chebyshev polynomials, hypergeometric functions and complete\nelliptic integrals. Furthermore a set of potential applications of this\nquantity under quantum dynamics and also for non-integrable systems, are\nbriefly discussed. The simplicity of this setup for understanding quantum\ncriticality is emphasized as it takes in only the reduced density matrix of\nappropriate rank.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zuc7_G4Z8PAFRDt3Jh1JQF799KwJOaDT91_55eW7YpI","pdfSize":"1225165"}
