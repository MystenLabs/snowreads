We shall prove that the Connes-Kasparov\nisomorphism in operator $K$-theory is equivalent to a $K$-theoretic version of\nVogan's result.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology","Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"C6CuM6AhU59pbYFk69CW8ec7Ca8_KWMCy5j6AhHgGwU","pdfSize":"346332"}
