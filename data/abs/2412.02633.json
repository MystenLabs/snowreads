The Nambu bracket can be related with Dirac bracket if we can write\nthe DB as a generalized Poisson structure. The NB associated with DB have all\nthe standard properties of the original DB. When the dimension of the phase\nspace is $s+2$ where $s$ is the number of second class constraints, the\nassociated Nambu structure has $s+2$ entries and reduces to the Dirac bracket\nwhen $s$ of its entries are fixed to be the second class constraints. In\ngeneral, when the dimension of phase space is $d=r+s$ a new Nambu structure\nthat describes correctly the constrained dynamics can also be constructed but\nin thsi case addicional conditidionts are requiered. In that case the\nassociated NB corresponds to a ``Dirac-Nambu'' bracket with $r$ entries.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"szJhmkNKetyuzMh6OmTySu7tYbzKNsdYUsYfDXMAb-4","pdfSize":"148312"}
