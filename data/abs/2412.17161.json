In contrast, here we demonstrate that its time-reversed\nconfiguration produces an ideal, deterministic second-order 'ghost'\ninterference pattern devoid of diffraction and first-order effect, with the\nsize dependent on the dimensions of the `effectively extended light source.'\nFurthermore, the new system enables a range of effects and phenomena not\navailable in traditional double-slit interference studies, including the\nformation of programmed and digitized interference fringes and the coincidence\nof the pattern plane and the source plane. Despite the absence of first-order\ninterference, our proposed experiment does not rely on nonclassical\ncorrelations or quantum entanglement. The elimination of diffraction through\ntime-reversal symmetry holds promise for advancing superresolution optical\nimaging and sensing techniques beyond existing capabilities.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Classical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"aawR483SbfkFXmxiTUn-6S2hriJqzN9YvbNO-nazbmQ","pdfSize":"505922"}
