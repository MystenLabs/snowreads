Our results reveal the relative contributions from bulk, resonant,\nand surface phonon modes, as well as from different surface mode polarizations,\nproviding insights into differences between smooth and corrugated surfaces.\nThese findings advance understanding of surface dynamics and electron-phonon\ncoupling, laying groundwork for future studies on surface superconductivity.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UB2xGxSDsjjd-SUAuHAtJtCM82Jx4R52W3XqiY3x-cc","pdfSize":"2173799"}
