  "abstract": "  In this paper, we present an approach for monocular open-set novel view\nsynthesis (NVS) that leverages object skeletons to guide the underlying\ndiffusion model. Building upon a baseline that utilizes a pre-trained 2D image\ngenerator, our method takes advantage of the Objaverse dataset, which includes\nanimated objects with bone structures. By introducing a skeleton guide layer\nfollowing the existing ray conditioning normalization (RCN) layer, our approach\nenhances pose accuracy and multi-view consistency. The skeleton guide layer\nprovides detailed structural information for the generative model, improving\nthe quality of synthesized views. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nskeleton-guided method significantly enhances consistency and accuracy across\ndiverse object categories within the Objaverse dataset. Our method outperforms\nexisting state-of-the-art NVS techniques both quantitatively and qualitatively,\nwithout relying on explicit 3D representations.\n",
