Four different opening geometries are studied under ten different gravity\nconditions. As demonstrated by an earlier study in our group, backdraft is\nestablished under different gravity conditions from 0.1 g to 1 g. The rate at\nwhich oxygen reaches an ignition block in the enclosure in the presence of the\ngravity current plays an important role in the onset of ignition, the\nsubsequent backdraft formation, and the maximum pressure built inside the\nenclosure before the onset of backdraft. This role also explains why these\neffects are different under different openings. We observe that the gravity\nstrength affects the ignition time and the onset of backdraft nonlinearly.\nMoreover, the smoke exiting the enclosure is a precursor for the onset of\nbackdraft, albeit with a short warning, allowing people on the outside to take\nnecessary precautions. The effect of backdraft in the form of heat flow and\nimpact force at the exit is also studied. It is found that the effect of heat\nflow is more severe than that of impact force.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"3VYzWhTeCBD7Skr02wBggrGf9FpXIRrk18BL8GFvR9w","pdfSize":"6161964"}
