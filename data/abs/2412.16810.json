  "abstract": "  Given a partition $\\mu$ of $-2$, the stratum $\\mathcal{H}(\\mu)$ parametrizes\nmeromorphic differential one-forms on $\\mathbb{CP}^{1}$ with~$n$ zeros and $p$\npoles of orders prescribed by $\\mu$. The isoresidual fibration is defined by\nassigning to each differential in $\\mathcal{H}(\\mu)$ its configuration of\nresidues at the poles. In the case of differentials with $n=2$ zeros, generic\nisoresidual fibers are complex curves endowed with a canonical translation\nstructure, which we describe extensively in this paper. Quantitative\ncharacteristics of the translation structure on isoresidual fiber curves,\nincluding the orders of the singularities and a period central charge\nencapsulating the linear dependence of periods on the underlying configuration\nof residues, provide rich discrete invariants for these fibers. We also\ndetermine the Euler characteristic of generic isoresidual fiber curves from\nintersection-theoretic computations, relying on the multi-scale\ncompactification of strata of differentials. In particular, we describe a wall\nand chamber structure for the Euler characteristic of generic isoresidual fiber\ncurves in terms of the partition $\\mu$. Additionally, we classify the connected\ncomponents of generic isoresidual fibers for strata in genus zero with an\narbitrary number of zeros.\n",
