This is because\nmost popular shear measurement methods contain explicit or implicit thresholds\non the galaxy-to-PSF (point spread function) size ratio, below which their\nshape measurement errors increase abruptly. Using the DECaLS data, we have\npreviously demonstrated that the Fourier\\_Quad method performs very well on\npoorly resolved galaxy images in general. It is therefore a ready tool for\nshear measurement with multi-band images regardless of their seeing conditions.\nIn this paper, we apply the Fourier\\_Quad pipeline on the multi-band images\nfrom the third public data release of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic\nProgram. We show that the shear catalogs from the five optical bands\n(g/r/i/z/y) all pass the field-distortion test with very high accuracy. Using\nthe LOWZ and CMASS galaxies as foreground lenses, we show that the errorbar in\nthe galaxy-galaxy lensing measurement can be decreased by factors around 15\\%\nby combining shear catalogs from different bands. This indicates that it is\nworthful to do multi-bands shear measurements for a better shear statistics.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"gr8T2DdiOZ806tNArglzVR_gbX73xw-qy6qv9vtcCBY","pdfSize":"3443163"}
