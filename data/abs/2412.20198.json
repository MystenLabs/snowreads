The present article contains new examples of such transforms in\nthe Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic settings, when integration is\nperformed over lower-dimensional geodesic spheres or cross-sections, which are\ntangent to a given surface. Simple inversion formulas are obtained and\nadmissible singularities at the tangency points are studied. Possible\napplications to the half-ball screening in mathematical tomography and some\ndifficulties related to the general (not necessarily symmetric) case are\ndiscussed.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PG-IODv5JMCsKTTz-5ygaTjsekxle8cRwz-xaHs_tio","pdfSize":"321682"}
