  "abstract": "  We introduce the following natural generalization of trace reconstruction,\nparameterized by a deletion probability $\\delta \\in (0,1)$ and length $n$:\nThere is a length $n$ string of probabilities, $S=p_1,\\ldots,p_n,$ and each\n\"trace\" is obtained by 1) sampling a length $n$ binary string whose $i$th\ncoordinate is independently set to 1 with probability $p_i$ and 0 otherwise,\nand then 2) deleting each of the binary values independently with probability\n$\\delta$, and returning the corresponding binary string of length $\\le n$. The\ngoal is to recover an estimate of $S$ from a set of independently drawn traces.\nIn the case that all $p_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ this is the standard trace\nreconstruction problem. We show two complementary results. First, for\nworst-case strings $S$ and any deletion probability at least order\n$1/\\sqrt{n}$, no algorithm can approximate $S$ to constant $\\ell_\\infty$\ndistance or $\\ell_1$ distance $o(\\sqrt n)$ using fewer than\n$2^{\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})}$ traces. Second -- as in the case for standard trace\nreconstruction -- reconstruction is easy for random $S$: for any sufficiently\nsmall constant deletion probability, and any $\\epsilon>0$, drawing each $p_i$\nindependently from the uniform distribution over $[0,1]$, with high probability\n$S$ can be recovered to $\\ell_1$ error $\\epsilon$ using\n$\\mathrm{poly}(n,1/\\epsilon)$ traces and computation time. We show\nindistinguishability in our lower bound by regarding a complicated alternating\nsum (comparing two distributions) as the Fourier transformation of some\nfunction evaluated at $\\pm \\pi,$ and then showing that the Fourier transform\ndecays rapidly away from zero by analyzing its moment generating function.\n",
