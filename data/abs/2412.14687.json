  "abstract": "  The proposed Super Tau-Charm Facility (STCF) is an electron-positron collider\ndesigned to operate in a center-of-mass energy range from 2 to 7 GeV. It\nprovides a unique platform for physics research in the tau-charm energy region.\nTo fulfill the physics goals of STCF, high tracking efficiency and good\nmomentum resolution is required for charged particles with momenta from 50\nMeV/c to 3.5 GeV/c. A global track finding algorithm based on Hough transform\nhas been developed and implemented in the STCF software framework to meet this\nrequirement. The design of the algorithm and its performance with simulation\nare presented in this paper.\n",
