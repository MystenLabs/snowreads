The growth rate decreases with increasing\nshear flow, and is completely stabilized as the shear flow becomes Alfv\\'enic.\nWe also show that in the presence of strong flow shear, the tearing mode growth\nrate decreases with increasing background ion-to-electron temperature ratio,\nthe opposite behaviour to the tearing mode without flow shear. We find that\neven a relatively small flow shear is enough to dramatically alter the scaling\nbehaviour of the mode, because the growth rate is small compared to the shear\nflow across the ion scales (but large compared to shear flow across the\nelectron scales). Our results may explain the relative absence of reconnection\nevents in the near-Sun Alfv\\'enic solar wind observed recently by NASA's Parker\nSolar Probe.\n","subjects":["Physics/Space Physics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"V9GKiOGTmgpttaTNaQe7jno9h7A9dCDUCcNIpO5fDmA","pdfSize":"708345"}
