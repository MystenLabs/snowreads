  "abstract": "  We start by introducing and studying the definition of a Riesz basis in a\nKrein space $(\\mathcal{K},[.,.])$, along with a condition under which a Riesz\nbasis becomes a Bessel sequence. The concept of biorthogonal sequence in Krein\nspaces is also introduced, providing an equivalent characterization of a Riesz\nbasis. Additionally, we explore the concept of the Gram matrix, defined as the\nsum of a positive and a negative Gram matrices, and specify conditions under\nwhich the Gram matrix becomes bounded in Krein spaces. Further, we characterize\nthe conditions under which the Gram matrices $\\{[f_n,f_j]_{n,j \\in I_+}\\}$ and\n$\\{[f_n,f_j]_{n,j \\in I_-}\\}$ become bounded invertible operators. Finally, we\nprovide an equivalent characterization of a Riesz basis in terms of Gram\nmatrices.\n",
