  "abstract": "  In this paper, we study the global well-posedness and optimal time decay\nrates of strong solutions to the diffusion approximation model in radiation\nhydrodynamics in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. This model consists of the full compressible\nNavier-Stokes equations and the radiative diffusion equation which describes\nthe influence and interaction between thermal radiation and fluid motion.\nSupposing that the initial perturbation around the equilibrium is sufficiently\nsmall in $H^2$-norm, we obtain the global strong solutions by utilizing method\nof the frequency decomposition. Moreover, by performing Fourier analysis\ntechniques and using the delicate energy method, we consequently derive the\noptimal decay rates (including highest-order derivatives) of solutions for this\nmodel.\n",
