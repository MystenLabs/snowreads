We formalize this model by using Kleene's strong logic of\nindeterminacy on three variables to capture unknowns. We call this model the\n`u-query model'.\n  We relate the query complexity of functions in the new u-query model with\ntheir analogs in the standard query model. We show an explicit function that is\nexponentially harder in the u-query model than in the usual query model. We\ngive sufficient conditions for a function to have u-query complexity\nasymptotically the same as its query complexity.\n  Using u-query analogs of the combinatorial measures of sensitivity, block\nsensitivity, and certificate complexity, we show that deterministic,\nrandomized, and quantum u-query complexities of all total Boolean functions are\npolynomially related to each other, just as in the usual query models.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UGQ-SWvJ7yoHasrqXW5FlDY0iLeXz7_nDxtcujjzkeg","pdfSize":"204853"}
