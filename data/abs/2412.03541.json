  "abstract": "  Atomistic simulations of properties of materials at finite temperatures are\ncomputationally demanding and require models that are more efficient than the\nab initio approaches. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)\naddress this issue by enabling accurate models with close to ab initio\naccuracy. Here, we demonstrate the utility of ML models in capturing properties\nof realistic materials by performing finite temperature molecular dynamics\nsimulations of perovskite oxides using a force field based on equivariant graph\nneural networks. The models demonstrate efficient learning from a small\ntraining dataset of energies, forces, stresses, and tensors of Born effective\ncharges. We qualitatively capture the temperature dependence of the dielectric\ntensor and structural phase transitions in calcium titanate.\n",
