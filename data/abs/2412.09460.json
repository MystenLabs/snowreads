This paper presents a framework for and the\nresults of empirically assessing the impact of publisher-controlled copyrighted\ncorpora on the performance of generative large language models (LLMs) for\nNorwegian. When evaluated on a diverse set of tasks, we found that adding both\nbooks and newspapers to the data mixture of LLMs tend to improve their\nperformance, while the addition of fiction works seems to be detrimental.
