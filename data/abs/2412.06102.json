This paper presents a synthesis technique\nthat aims to generate document database queries from input-output examples\nautomatically. A new domain-specific language is designed to express a\nrepresentative set of document database queries in an algebraic style.\nFurthermore, the synthesis technique leverages a novel abstraction of\ncollections for deduction to efficiently prune the search space and quickly\ngenerate the target query. An evaluation of 110 benchmarks from various sources\nshows that the proposed technique can synthesize 108 benchmarks successfully.\nOn average, the synthesizer can generate document database queries from a small\nnumber of input-output examples within tens of seconds.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Databases","Computer Science/Programming Languages","Computer Science/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"H73kIwm9h_1yPzk9FyRoJwgS4cFCihSLL4qXwuGOTW0","pdfSize":"841378"}
