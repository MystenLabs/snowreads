  "abstract": "  One of the key tasks in graph learning is node classification. While Graph\nneural networks have been used for various applications, their adaptivity to\nreject option setting is not previously explored. In this paper, we propose\nNCwR, a novel approach to node classification in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)\nwith an integrated reject option, which allows the model to abstain from making\npredictions when uncertainty is high. We propose both cost-based and\ncoverage-based methods for classification with abstention in node\nclassification setting using GNNs. We perform experiments using our method on\nthree standard citation network datasets Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed and compare\nwith relevant baselines. We also model the Legal judgment prediction problem on\nILDC dataset as a node classification problem where nodes represent legal cases\nand edges represent citations. We further interpret the model by analyzing the\ncases that the model abstains from predicting by visualizing which part of the\ninput features influenced this decision.\n",
