  "abstract": "  In this work, we develop machine learning techniques to study nonperturbative\nscattering amplitudes. We focus on the two-to-two scattering amplitude of\nidentical scalar particles, setting the double discontinuity to zero as a\nsimplifying assumption. Neural networks provide an efficient parameterization\nfor scattering amplitudes, offering a flexible toolkit to describe their fine\nnonperturbative structure. Combined with the bootstrap approach based on the\ndispersive representation of the amplitude and machine learning's gradient\ndescent algorithms, they offer a new method to explore the space of consistent\nS-matrices. We derive bounds on the values of the first two low-energy Taylor\ncoefficients of the amplitude and characterize the resulting amplitudes that\npopulate the allowed region. Crucially, we parallel our neural network analysis\nwith the standard S-matrix bootstrap, both primal and dual, and observe perfect\nagreement across all approaches.\n",
