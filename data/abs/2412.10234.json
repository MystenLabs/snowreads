  "abstract": "  We introduce an extension of the standard cohomology which is characterised\nby maps that fail to be classical cocycles by products of simpler maps. The\nconstruction is motivated by the study of Manin's noncommutative modular\nsymbols and of false theta functions. We use this construction to obtain a\ncohomological interpretation of important iterated integrals that arise in that\nstudy. In another direction, our approach gives modular counterparts to the\nlong-studied relations among multiple zeta values.\n",
