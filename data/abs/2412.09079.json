  "abstract": "  We introduce two convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, inspired\nby the Merriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) algorithm and by cellular automatons, to\nmodel and learn threshold dynamics for front evolution from video data. The\nfirst model, termed the (single-dynamics) MBO network, learns a specific kernel\nand threshold for each input video without adapting to new dynamics, while the\nsecond, a meta-learning MBO network, generalizes across diverse threshold\ndynamics by adapting its parameters per input. Both models are evaluated on\nsynthetic and real-world videos (ice melting and fire front propagation), with\nperformance metrics indicating effective reconstruction and extrapolation of\nevolving boundaries, even under noisy conditions. Empirical results highlight\nthe robustness of both networks across varied synthetic and real-world\ndynamics.\n",
