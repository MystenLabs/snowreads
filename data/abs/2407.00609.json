However, existing approaches\noften neglect the importance of maintaining the symmetry-preserving property\nwhen generating scene graphs from 3D point clouds. This oversight can diminish\nthe accuracy and robustness of the resulting scene graphs, especially when\nhandling noisy, multi-view 3D data. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is\nthe first to implement an Equivariant Graph Neural Network in semantic scene\ngraph generation from 3D point clouds for scene understanding. Our proposed\nmethod, ESGNN, outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating\na significant improvement in scene estimation with faster convergence. ESGNN\ndemands low computational resources and is easy to implement from available\nframeworks, paving the way for real-time applications such as robotics and\ncomputer vision.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"o1Ju9gkuzygzUyoVZSIBfJYVqx95yTQr9pe6IvPncj0","pdfSize":"3928639"}
