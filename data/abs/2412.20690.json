In this paper, we discuss\na unified framework that provides the existing TSLs based on different\nactivities such as dynamical activity and dynamical state mobility. This\nunification is based on generalized means that include standard means such as\nthe arithmetic, logarithmic, and geometric means, the first two of which\nrespectively correspond to the dynamical activity and the dynamical state\nmobility. We also derive an infinite variety of TSLs for Markov jump processes\nand deterministic chemical reaction networks using different activities. The\nlower bound on the entropy production given by each TSL provides the minimum\ndissipation achievable by a conservative force. We numerically and analytically\ndiscuss the tightness of the lower bounds on the EPR in the various TSLs.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CHF9gn7NC5ItNrZ1hCyNVA02907ABo9_DrmJ9ethjCs","pdfSize":"892621"}
