  "abstract": "  We prove that every real nonnegative ternary quartic whose complex zero set\nis smooth can be represented as the determinant of a symmetric matrix with\nquadratic entries which is everywhere positive semidefinite. We show that the\ncorresponding statement fails for the Robinson polynomial, answering a question\nby Buckley and \\v{S}ivic.\n",
