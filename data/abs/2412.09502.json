  "abstract": "  This paper presents the development of a comprehensive dynamics and\nstabilizing control architecture for Tethered Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (TUAV)\nsystems. The proposed architecture integrates both onboard and ground-based\ncontrollers, employing nonlinear backstepping control techniques to achieve\nasymptotic stability of the TUAV's equilibrium. The onboard controllers are\nresponsible for the position and attitude control of the TUAV, while the ground\ncontrollers regulate the winder mechanism to maintain the desired tether\nlength, ensuring it retains its catenary form. Simulation results demonstrate\nthe ability of the TUAV system to accurately track linear and circular\ntrajectories, ensuring robust performance under various operational scenarios.\nThe code and movies demonstrating the performance of the system can be found at\nhttps://github.com/sof-danny/TUAV\\_system\\_control.\n",
