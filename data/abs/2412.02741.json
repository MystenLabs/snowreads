Our identification follows from a careful\nstudy of the conformal eigenstates in the perturbed orbifold theory. We find\nthat, in addition to the fractional torus modes (that correspond to the torus\nexcitations in the dual AdS spacetime), there are `long' collective eigenmodes\nthat involve a superposition of products of fractional torus modes, and that\nare in natural one-to-one correspondence with the expected AdS$_3\\times$S$^3$\nexcitations. These collective modes are deformations of (fractional)\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ modes, to which they reduce for integer momentum.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"m_IJ067doTgrfns2AYkjXac1Y7broRfnLAhotmoGFRw","pdfSize":"800959"}
