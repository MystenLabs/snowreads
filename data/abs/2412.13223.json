The nature of this\nconformational heterogenity is imprinted in the raw electron density\nmeasurements obtained from X-ray crystallography experiments. Fitting an\nensemble of protein structures to these measurements is a challenging,\nill-posed inverse problem. We propose a non-i.i.d. ensemble guidance approach\nto solve this problem using existing protein structure generative models and\ndemonstrate that it accurately recovers complicated multi-modal alternate\nprotein backbone conformations observed in certain single crystal measurements.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"X7afX1fRfOBwKYOrL3cM2XblIeJAGZ85oba4Uy6bH9I","pdfSize":"34602043"}
