Without any adjustable free parameters fitted to lattice or\nexperimental data, we demonstrate that the net-proton number cumulant ratios\nfrom the Beam Energy Scan-I (BES-I) central ($0-5\\%$) Au+Au collision\nexperiments at RHIC, for center-of-mass energies $\\sqrt{s} \\geq\n39\\,\\text{GeV}$, are well described by the \\textit{dynamical soft-wall} AdS\nblack hole model, indicating the formation of a strongly coupled quark-gluon\nplasma (sQGP). We identify a critical point at \\(\\mu_B = 247\\,\\text{MeV}\\) or\n\\(\\sqrt{s}=16\\,\\text{GeV}\\) in this model, where net-proton cumulant ratios\nshow non-monotonic variation. However, for $\\sqrt{s} < 39\\,\\text{GeV}$, the\nrecent BES-II data does not exhibit the expected variation due to the critical\npoint, suggesting instead a transition to a nearly-cold ($\\mu_B \\gg T$) weakly\ncoupled QGP (wQGP) for $\\sqrt{s} < 7.7\\,\\text{GeV}$. This prediction can be\ntested by the upcoming STAR Fixed-Target experimental data.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EpdVUDS_lBWtjUYnUIc7MxFvC8Yh057PRfOX_5ROhvE","pdfSize":"658211"}
