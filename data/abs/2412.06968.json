  "abstract": "  This paper proposes a novel method for omnidirectional 360$\\degree$\nperception. Most common previous methods relied on equirectangular projection.\nThis representation is easily applicable to 2D operation layers but introduces\ndistortions into the image. Other methods attempted to remove the distortions\nby maintaining a sphere representation but relied on complicated convolution\nkernels that failed to show competitive results. In this work, we introduce a\ntransformer-based architecture that, by incorporating a novel ``Spherical Local\nSelf-Attention'' and other spherically-oriented modules, successfully operates\nin the spherical domain and outperforms the state-of-the-art in 360$\\degree$\nperception benchmarks for depth estimation and semantic segmentation.\n",
