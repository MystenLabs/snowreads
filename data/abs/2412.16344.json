  "abstract": "  The Arcus Probe mission concept provides high-resolution soft X-ray and UV\nspectroscopy to reveal feedback-driven structure and evolution throughout the\nuniverse with an agile response capability ideal for probing the physics of\ntime-dependent phenomena. The X-ray Spectrograph (XRS) utilizes two nearly\nidentical CCD focal planes to detect and record X-ray photons from the\ndispersed spectra and zero-order of the critical angle transmission gratings.\nIn this paper we describe the Arcus focal plane instrument and the CCDs,\nincluding laboratory performance results, which meet observatory requirements.\n",
