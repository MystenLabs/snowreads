  "abstract": "  Large-scale shell-model calculations have been performed to study the nuclear\nstructure properties of Hg isotopes with mass varying from $A=193$ to $A=200$.\nThe shell-model calculations are carried out in the 50 $\\leq Z \\leq$ 82 and 82\n$ \\leq N \\leq$ 126 model space using monopole-based truncation. We present\ndetailed studies on low-energy excitation spectra, energy systematics, and\ncollective properties of Hg isotopes, such as reduced transition probabilities,\nquadrupole, and magnetic moments along the isotopic chain. The evolution of\nwave function configurations with spin is analyzed in the case of even-$A$ Hg\nisotopes. The shell-model results are in reasonable agreement with the\nexperimental data and predictions are made where experimental data are\nunavailable. The shapes of Hg isotopes are also investigated through the\nenergy-surface plots.\n",
