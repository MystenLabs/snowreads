By accounting for correlated interlayer\nimpurity scattering under a weak magnetic field, our theoretical results reveal\ndrag resistivities resembling those in weak (anti-)localization. It is\nestablished that the quantum interference effect is most significant when the\nchemical potentials match. The theory clarifies the roles of intra- and\ninterlayer Berry phases in Coulomb drag in double-layer graphene systems and\nhelps delineate the intra- and intervalley contributions. These insights are\nvaluable for designing graphene-based electronic devices exploiting quantum\neffects.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Jd36dLp4oo2RWQn_446qnDmGJshhZiAZgobl862Yutc","pdfSize":"1895909"}
