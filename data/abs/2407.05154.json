RTMs are also used to predict the intensity of the structure and\ncontent in tweets in English, Arabic, and Spanish in Task 1 where MTPP is\nbetween the tweets and the set of words for the emotion selected from WordNet\naffect emotion lists. Stacked RTM models obtain encouraging results in both.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DXFAGifUj0OOOLMWEbTvQnJjHDxb0SvQfXkhHofdXO0","pdfSize":"561270"}
