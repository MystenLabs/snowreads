  "abstract": "  The conversion between spin and orbital currents is at the origin of the\norbital torque and its Onsager reciprocal, the orbital pumping. Here, we\npropose a phenomenological model to describe the orbital torque in magnetic\nbilayers composed of an orbital source (i.e., a light metal such as Ti, Ru,\nCuOx...) and a spin-orbit coupled magnet (i.e., typically Ni, (Co/Pt)$_n$,\netc.). This approach accounts for spin-to-orbit and orbit-to-spin conversion in\nthe ferromagnet and at the interface. We show that the orbital torque arises\nfrom a compromise between orbital current injection from the orbital source to\nthe ferromagnet and spin current backflow from the ferromagnet back to the\norbital source. We also discuss the concept of orbital-mixing conductance and\nintroduce the \"orbit-spin-\" and \"spin-orbit-mixing\" conductances that govern\nthe orbital torque and orbital pumping, respectively.\n",
