This\nassumption rests in practice on a study from the 1960s. Since that work,\nknowledge of relevant atomic processes and theoretical calculations of stellar\natmospheres and their spectra have advanced significantly, but this question\nhas not been reexamined. We present calculations based on a slightly modified\nanalytical model that includes H, H$_2$, and H$^-$, together with modern atomic\ndata and a grid of 1D LTE theoretical stellar atmosphere models with stellar\nparameters ranging from T$_\\mathrm{eff} = 4000$ to 7000~K, $\\log{g} = 1$ to 5\ncm/s$^2$, and [Fe/H]$=-3$ to 0. We find direct non-LTE effects on populations\nin spectrum-forming regions, continua, and spectral lines of about 1-2% in\nstars with higher T$_\\mathrm{eff}$ and/or lower $\\log g$. Effects in models for\nsolar parameters are smaller by a factor of 10, about 0.1-0.2%, and are\npractically absent in models with lower T$_\\mathrm{eff}$ and/or higher $\\log\ng$. These departures from LTE found in our calculations originate from the\nradiative recombination of electrons with hydrogen to form H$^-$ exceeding\nphotodetachment, that is, overrecombination. Modern atomic data are not a\nsource of significant differences compared to the previous work, although\ndetailed data for processes on H$_2$ resolved with vibrational and rotational\nstates provide a more complete and complex picture of the role of H$_2$ in the\nequilibrium of H$^-$. In the context of modern studies of stellar spectra at\nthe percent level, our results suggest that this question requires further\nattention, including a more extensive reaction network, and indirect effects\ndue to non-LTE electron populations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"S3GlL4kotfQibK1mi7v7xVcQNYd4bzlLVNgMSPFuvIU","pdfSize":"858978","objectId":"0x0d7bff0ba09405850bc8da1a1cc27a43a4e835cefb5c3667a4bf81c4218553ff","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
