  "abstract": "  With the rise of remote work, a range of surveillance technologies are\nincreasingly being used by business owners to track and monitor employees,\nraising concerns about worker rights and privacy. Through analysis of Reddit\nposts and in-depth semi-structured interviews, this paper seeks to understand\nhow workers across a range of sectors make sense of and respond to layered\nforms of surveillance. While workers express concern about risks to their\nhealth, safety, and privacy, they also face a lack of transparency and autonomy\naround the use of these systems. In response, workers take up tactics of\neveryday resistance, such as commiserating with other workers or employing\ntechnological hacks. Although these tactics demonstrate workers' ingenuity,\nthey also show the limitations of existing approaches to protect workers\nagainst intrusive workplace monitoring. We argue that there is an opportunity\nfor CSCW researchers to support these countermeasures through worker-led design\nand policy.\n",
