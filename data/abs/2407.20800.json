All of them lead to generalizations of the quadrupole formula,\nhowever, due to different gauge conditions and choices of the hypersurfaces,\nacross which the energy flux is computed, it is nontrivial to see that they all\ncoincide, as one would expect from the symplectic theory. Each of the\nexpressions for the radiated energy in the form of gravitational waves is\nexpressed in terms of the mass and pressure quadrupole moments and written\nexplicitly up to the linear order in $\\sqrt{\\Lambda}$, or equvalently in Hubble\nparameter $H$. It is shown that up to the first order all three of the\ngeneralizations of the quadrupole formula agree.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dkqN4XuIPOUISlrmj9_4JtIfGElUhXI00651HUTzkFE","pdfSize":"465187","objectId":"0xe281e23e5857a5531cce148ac434a102de83137be62e63efdf9d0dd1db500bdd","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
