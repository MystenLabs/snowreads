This work describes\nthe use of genetic algorithms for optimizing analytical models that can improve\nthe visualization of images with poor light. Genetic algorithms are part of\nmetaheuristic approaches, which proved helpful in solving challenging\noptimization tasks. We propose two analytical methods combined with\noptimization reasoning to approach a solution to the physical and computational\naspects of transforming dark images into visible ones. The experiments\ndemonstrate that the proposed approach ranks at the top among 26\nstate-of-the-art algorithms in the LOL benchmark. The results show evidence\nthat a simple genetic algorithm combined with analytical reasoning can defeat\nthe current mainstream in a challenging computer vision task through controlled\nexperiments and objective comparisons. This work opens interesting new research\navenues for the swarm and evolutionary computation community and others\ninterested in analytical and heuristic reasoning.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"mo8vwi4a7KMcTyVVZMdfejyoRo2d5lex7nPcsoLzOb0","pdfSize":"5852767"}
