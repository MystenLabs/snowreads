In this paper, we outline a\nscenario in which an attacker can infect an in-orbit NASA Core Flight System\n(cFS) based satellite with ransomware and communicate the infection back to a\nsatellite operator. This paper is the first to demonstrate an end-to-end\nexploit path that results in a ransomware infection without the need for a\nsupply chain attack or compromised credentials. Novel ransomware is delivered\nto an emulated satellite system using custom shellcode that exploits a weakness\nin the considered scenario. The scenario considered by this initial piece of\nwork achieves a success rate of 33.3\\% for a complete successful infection.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Cryptography and Security","Computer Science/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"1iZ30c-TsjZWJPxGCMEAZXXABHWSYSQ72-t5GLzKXMg","pdfSize":"289986"}
