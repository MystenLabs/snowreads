Conventionally, the qubit encoding in QAOA for the TSP describes\na tour using a sequence of nodes, where each node is written as a 1-hot binary\nvector. We propose to encode TSP tours by selecting edges included in the tour.\nRemoving certain redundancies, the number of required qubits can be reduced by\na linear factor compared to the aforementioned conventional encoding.\n  We examined implementations of both QAOA encoding variants in terms of their\napproximation quality and runtime. Our experiments show that for small\ninstances results are significantly more accurate using our proposed encoding,\nwhereas the number of required classical optimizer iterations increases only\nslightly.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"73mO56UGrXGbrhjNv7uMXaFm4FIr4OYeNsa0Uszux54","pdfSize":"526639"}
