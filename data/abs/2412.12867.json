From this vast observational material we were able to\nestimate masses of components of 325 double-lined system. Since the launch of\nthe TESS mission we have been collecting 2-min cadence photometry for the\nCR\\'EME targets through successful GI proposals. As by Sector 85, we obtained\ndata for $>$330 of them. We are thus now in the process of comprehensively\nanalyzing our targets. This paper presents the recent status of the CR\\'EME\nproject and its space photometry counterpart, and describes several\nsub-projects within CR\\'EME that focus on specific classes of targets.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Ie-BW6Q81QVoBBmu_5CZijaO95xLbSl9xlNN-LW5_pk","pdfSize":"425842"}
