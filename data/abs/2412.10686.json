  "abstract": "  We present a general solution and formulation framework to Bellman's\nlost-in-a-forest problem. The forest boundary is known and may take any shape.\nThe starting point and the orientation are unspecified. We convert the problem\ninto translation and rotation of the forest boundary. This transformation\nallows us to formulate this problem as a constrained minimization problem. Upon\ndiscretization, the problem becomes a variation of the traveling salesman\nproblem or the Hamiltonian path problem. We leverage discrete optimization and\nderive several nontrivial results consistent with those from previous papers.\nThis method is general, and we also extend the approach to related problems,\nincluding Moser's worm problem and the shortest opaque set problem.\n",
