A dynamical initial state is set\nup using the 3d-Glauber model with transverse locations of hotspots within each\nincoming nucleon. A hard scattering that emanates from two colliding hotspots\nis carried out using the Pythia generator. Initial state radiation from the\nincoming hard partons is carried out in a new module called I-matter, which\nincludes the longitudinal location of initial splits. The energy-momentum of\nboth the initial hard partons and their associated beam remnants is removed\nfrom the hot spots, depleting the energy-momentum available for the formation\nof the bulk medium. Outgoing showers are simulated using the matter generator,\nand results are presented for both cases, allowing for and not allowing for\nenergy loss. First comparisons between this hard-soft model and single\ninclusive hadron and jet data from $p$-$p$ and minimum bias $p$-$Pb$ collisions\nare presented. Single hadron spectra in $p$-$p$ are used to carry out a limited\n(in number of parameters) Bayesian calibration of the model. Fair comparisons\nwith data are indicative of the utility of this new framework. Theoretical\nstudies of the correlation between jet $p_T$ and event activity at mid and\nforward rapidity are carried out.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qpkDq60fFY2EDbr6OTKOvuOzRIW-YAY4EeZYsb6cs-k","pdfSize":"2736621","objectId":"0xa9834e4acca55b660d71d7ea14558bfbb348fc09f98a1554248cca359be5da99","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
