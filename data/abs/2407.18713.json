In particular, we provide consistent uncountable\nexamples of such spaces and we define \\textit{trivial} R-,H-, and M-{\\it\nnw}-selective spaces the ones with countable net weight having, additionally,\nthe cardinality and the weight strictly less then $cov({\\cal M})$, $\\frak b$,\nand $\\frak d$, respectively. Since we establish that spaces having\ncardinalities more than $cov({\\cal M})$, $\\frak b$, and $\\frak d$, fail to have\nthe R-,H-, and M-{\\it nw}-selective properties, respectively, non-trivial\nexamples should eventually have weight greater than or equal to these small\ncardinals. Using forcing methods, we construct consistent countable non-trivial\nexamples of R-{\\it nw}-selective and H-{\\it nw}-selective spaces and we\nestablish some limitations to constructions of non-trivial examples. Moreover,\nwe consistently prove the existence of two H-{\\it nw}-selective spaces whose\nproduct fails to be M-{\\it nw}-selective. Finally, we study some relations\nbetween {\\it nw}-selective properties and a strong version of the HFD property.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LLmAXtMQcrHJHQgUm6NrmmLUGFr_KiT9QHqtAz7385U","pdfSize":"318734"}
