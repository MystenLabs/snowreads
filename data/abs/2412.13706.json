  "abstract": "  We investigate the set-theoretic strength of several maximality principles\nthat play an important role in the study of modal and intuitionistic logics. We\nfocus on the well-known Fine and Esakia maximality principles, present two\nformulations of each, and show that the stronger formulations are equivalent to\nthe Axiom of Choice (AC), while the weaker ones to the Boolean Prime Ideal\nTheorem (BPI).\n",
