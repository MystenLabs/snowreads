In this paper, we relax the condition that $f(z)$ and\n$g(z)$ are of the same degree and instead assume that $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ are\npolynomials of arbitrary degree $n$ and $m$ respectively, $m\\leq n,$ and obtain\na generalization of this result. As an application, we also introduce a linear\noperator which preserve Bernstein type polynomial inequalities.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FclL1fsubSKPnVItPS7HGmndT8x4LodjuZHoXQ_tLvs","pdfSize":"135211"}
