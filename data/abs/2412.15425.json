  "abstract": "  The finitary isomorphism theorem, due to Keane and Smorodinsky, raised the\nnatural question of how \"finite\" the isomorphism can be, in terms of moments of\nthe coding radius. More precisely, for which values does there exist an\nisomorphism between any two i.i.d. processes of equal entropy, with coding\nradii exhibiting finite t-moments? [3, 4]. Parry [13] and Krieger [10] showed\nthat those finite moments must be lesser than 1 in general, and Harvey and\nPeres [5] showed that they must be lesser than 1/2 in general. However, the\nquestion for the range between 0 and 1/2 remained open, and in fact no general\nconstruction of an isomorphism was shown to exhibit any non trivial finite\nmoments. In the present work we settle this problem, showing that between any\ntwo aperiodic Markov processes (and i.i.d. processes in particular) of the same\nentropy, there exists an isomorphism f with coding radii exhibiting finite\nt-moments for all t in (0,1/2). The isomorphism is constructed explicitly, and\nthe tails of the radii are shown to be optimal up to a poly-logarithmic factor.\n",
