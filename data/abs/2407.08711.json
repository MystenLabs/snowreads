OmniNOCS has 20 times more object\nclasses and 200 times more instances than existing NOCS datasets (NOCS-Real275,\nWild6D). We use OmniNOCS to train a novel, transformer-based monocular NOCS\nprediction model (NOCSformer) that can predict accurate NOCS, instance masks\nand poses from 2D object detections across diverse classes. It is the first\nNOCS model that can generalize to a broad range of classes when prompted with\n2D boxes. We evaluate our model on the task of 3D oriented bounding box\nprediction, where it achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art 3D\ndetection methods such as Cube R-CNN. Unlike other 3D detection methods, our\nmodel also provides detailed and accurate 3D object shape and segmentation. We\npropose a novel benchmark for the task of NOCS prediction based on OmniNOCS,\nwhich we hope will serve as a useful baseline for future work in this area.
