This leads to many-to-one matches and\nnumerous potential inliers without any corresponding point. Recently, some\napproaches have framed the feature matching task as an assignment problem to\nachieve optimal one-to-one matches. We argue that the transition to the\nAssignment problem is not reliable for general correspondence-based PCR. In\nthis paper, we propose a heuristics stable matching policy called GS-matching,\ninspired by the Gale-Shapley algorithm. Compared to the other matching\npolicies, our method can perform efficiently and find more non-repetitive\ninliers under low overlapping conditions. Furthermore, we employ the\nprobability theory to analyze the feature matching task, providing new insights\ninto this research problem. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of\nour matching policy, achieving better registration recall on multiple datasets.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"r-X1qW7EHoN4ehHNmmvhh8si9GsiYgsdczxg6z53Hjc","pdfSize":"2105139"}
