Subtask B involves detecting hate speech in\nonline text, while Subtask C requires identifying the specific targets of hate\nspeech, such as individuals, organizations, or communities. We propose the\nMultilingualRobertaClass model, a deep neural network built on the pretrained\nmultilingual transformer model ia-multilingual-transliterated-roberta,\noptimized for classification tasks in multilingual and transliterated contexts.\nThe model leverages contextualized embeddings to handle linguistic diversity,\nwith a classifier head for binary classification. We received 88.40% accuracy\nin Subtask B and 66.11% accuracy in Subtask C, in the test set.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"IWMkCIYyhx5B4tha0Quggu5hzVpHSFMlbSRnYaQibiw","pdfSize":"188375"}
