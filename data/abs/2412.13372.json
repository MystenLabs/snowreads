The fourth-order Ma-Trudinger-Wang\n(MTW) tensor associated with this ground cost function provides a notion of\ncurvature in optimal transport. The non-negativity of this tensor plays a\ncrucial role for establishing continuity for the Monge optimal transport map.\nIt is, however, generally difficult to analytically verify this condition for\nany given ground cost. To expand the class of cost functions for which MTW\nnon-negativity can be verified, we propose a provably correct computational\napproach which provides certificates of non-negativity for the MTW tensor using\nSum-of-Squares (SOS) programming. We further show that our SOS technique can\nalso be used to compute an inner approximation of the region where MTW\nnon-negativity holds. We apply our proposed SOS programming method to several\npractical ground cost functions to approximate the regions of regularity of\ntheir corresponding optimal transport maps.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"49enVZhA5f1O1SXg3JVQkFOU_LAuhLawgUpb-hskGoo","pdfSize":"2094857"}
