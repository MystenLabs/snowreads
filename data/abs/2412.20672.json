Starting from an adequate initial\nstate of physical qubits, we produce a corresponding energy eigenstate by\ntwirling operations, that are time evolutions by the Hamiltonian controlled by\nthe ancilla qubits.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"MKie2v-1BcYa-mgKh22oi9282_OCRyOBoZUNI78rdjU","pdfSize":"1446264"}
