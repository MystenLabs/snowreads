We investigate the accuracy\nof navigation by using this process. The paper begins with the research\nbackground and social importance. Then, the specific experimental setup and\nanalysis of experimental results are presented. Finally, the results are\ndetailed and some potential improvements are provided.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"lakiGHzWLduADRLhyTJo86nUsEOCgH_IkKrpUJW1uyc","pdfSize":"579679"}
