Moreover, we show that the set of\nanalytic twist maps having such an invariant curve of a given rotation number\nis a strict analytic subset of the set of analytic twist maps. The first result\nextends, in dimension 2, a previous result by Arnaud, Massetti and Sorrentino.\nWe then apply our result to rational caustics of billiards, considering several\nmodels such as Birkhoff billiards, outer billiards and symplectic billiards.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wnnfKUKLZQa-GsxX1UyCocWb8tgzU6gObOQZSNEKFY0","pdfSize":"609887"}
