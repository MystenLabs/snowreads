We revisit the formalism of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Graph\nNeural Networks (GNNs), and Attention Mechanisms. Based on recent studies, we\nexplore their applications in designing improved top taggers, top\nreconstruction, and event classification tasks. We also examine the ML-based\nlikelihood-free inference approach and generative unfolding models, focusing on\ntheir applications to scenarios involving top quarks.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ya6dqjwLE6CNFrXEGpCAosACHWmgHyGZcwCvAIMVZpk","pdfSize":"2158403"}
