Concretely, we obtain 95% performance on InterCode-CTF, a popular\noffensive security benchmark, using prompting, tool use, and multiple attempts.\nThis beats prior work by Phuong et al. 2024 (29%) and Abramovich et al. 2024\n(72%).\n  Our results suggest that current LLMs have surpassed the high school level in\noffensive cybersecurity. Their hacking capabilities remain underelicited: our\nReAct&Plan prompting strategy solves many challenges in 1-2 turns without\ncomplex engineering or advanced harnessing.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Cryptography and Security","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FPi9DizsvLaC772m4yUoCqWGGFogy1jPpInoGttfJgM","pdfSize":"1001444"}
