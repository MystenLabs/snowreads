Yet, each out-of-sample prediction can also be\nexpressed as a linear combination of in-sample values of the predicted\nvariable, with weights corresponding to pairwise proximity scores between\ncurrent and past economic events. While this dual route leads nowhere in some\ncontexts (e.g., large cross-sectional datasets), it provides sparser\ninterpretations in settings with many regressors and little training data-like\nmacroeconomic forecasting. In this case, the sequence of contributions can be\nvisualized as a time series, allowing analysts to explain predictions as\nquantifiable combinations of historical analogies. Moreover, the weights can be\nviewed as those of a data portfolio, inspiring new diagnostic measures such as\nforecast concentration, short position, and turnover. We show how weights can\nbe retrieved seamlessly for (kernel) ridge regression, random forest, boosted\ntrees, and neural networks. Then, we apply these tools to analyze post-pandemic\nforecasts of inflation, GDP growth, and recession probabilities. In all cases,\nthe approach opens the black box from a new angle and demonstrates how machine\nlearning models leverage history partly repeating itself.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics","Computer Science/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"R3HxdDXpJr4bz89uC_kBEHKxocSn7Deas_oKmS_Ysdg","pdfSize":"17154582"}
