We introduce a new possible threat to determinism,\nwhich we call Arbitrariness Problem (ARB), resulting from the inherent freedom\nin selecting a reference frame.\n","subjects":["Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"S2PJPZNyJpIcWC3KF7exePTVLQ7bh4uUVVth8A7UTT4","pdfSize":"574789"}
