  "abstract": "  Kidney stones are a common and debilitating health issue, and genetic factors\nplay a crucial role in determining susceptibility. While Genome-Wide\nAssociation Studies (GWAS) have identified numerous single nucleotide\npolymorphisms (SNPs) linked to kidney stone risk, translating these findings\ninto effective clinical tools remains a challenge. In this study, we explore\nthe potential of deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs), to enhance Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) models for predicting\nkidney stone susceptibility. Using a curated dataset of kidney stone-associated\nSNPs from a recent GWAS, we apply CNNs to model non-linear genetic interactions\nand improve prediction accuracy. Our approach includes SNP selection, genotype\nfiltering, and model training using a dataset of 560 individuals, divided into\ntraining and testing subsets. We compare our CNN-based model with traditional\nmachine learning models, including logistic regression, random forest, and\nsupport vector machines, demonstrating that the CNN outperforms these models in\nterms of classification accuracy and ROC-AUC. The proposed model achieved a\nvalidation accuracy of 62%, with an ROC-AUC of 0.68, suggesting its potential\nfor improving genetic-based risk prediction for kidney stones. This study\ncontributes to the growing field of genomics-driven precision medicine and\nhighlights the promise of deep learning in enhancing PRS models for complex\ndiseases.\n",
