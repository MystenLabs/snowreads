However, when gravity\nis dynamical, diffeomorphism symmetries are gauged which apparently obstructs a\nsensible definition of local operators, as different locations in spacetime are\nconnected by these gauged symmetries. This consideration brings in the puzzle\nof reconciling our empirical world with quantum gravity. Intuitively, this\npuzzle can be avoided using relatively defined observables when there exists a\nnatural reference system such as a distribution of galaxies in our universe.\nNevertheless, this intuition is classical as the rods and clock defined in this\nway may also have quantum fluctuations so it is not a priori clear if it can be\nrealized in the quantum regime. In this letter, we provide an affirmative\nanswer to this question. Interestingly, we notice that the quantum fluctuations\nof the reference system are in fact essential for the realization of the above\nintuition in the quantum regime.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4N28MuX5YJ1Tr_khxteJdfKNTCsE3p_EX3Nn-lBCt9s","pdfSize":"339343"}
