  "abstract": "  Inspired by the increased cooperation between humans and autonomous systems,\nwe present a new hybrid systems framework capturing the interconnected dynamics\nunderlying these interactions. The framework accommodates models arising from\nboth the autonomous systems and cognitive psychology literature in order to\nrepresent key elements such as human trust in the autonomous system. The\nintermittent nature of human interactions are incorporated by asynchronous\nevent-triggered sampling at the framework's human-autonomous system interfaces.\nWe illustrate important considerations for tuning framework parameters by\ninvestigating a practical application to an autonomous robotic swarm search and\nrescue scenario. In this way, we demonstrate how the proposed framework may\nassist in designing more efficient and effective interactions between humans\nand autonomous systems.\n",
