In order to create a dedicated operational context for\nautonomous artificial intelligence systems, the wording of local regulatory\ndocuments can be simultaneously presented in two versions: for use by people\nand for use by autonomous systems. In this case, the artificial intelligence\nsystem will get a well-defined operational context that allows such a system to\nperform functions within the required standards. Local regulations that provide\nbasis for the joint work of individuals and autonomous artificial intelligence\nsystems can form the grounds for the relevant legislation governing the\ndevelopment and implementation of autonomous systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"w7MCnzLcIg3yJVbV2BOxN8tV-wsJfFTSsdSXy8RHmJ8","pdfSize":"274804"}
