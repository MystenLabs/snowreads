For this purpose, high-speed multi-port\nmemory is used. The traditional multi-port memory solutions are hard-bounded to\na fixed number of ports for read or write operations. In this work, we proposed\na pseudo-quad-port memory architecture. Here, ports can be configured (1-port,\n2-port, 3-port, 4-port) for all possible combinations of read/write operations\nfor the 6T static random access memory (SRAM) memory array, which improves the\nspeed and reduces the bandwidth for data transfer. The proposed architecture\nimproves the bandwidth of data transfer by 4x. The proposed solution provides\n1.3x and 2x area efficiency as compared to dual-port 8T and quad-port 12T SRAM.\nAll the design and performance analyses are done using 65nm CMOS technology.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Guxwpa_drfdzi5ge40KVXJ1E0xtWlYwxzKTokwYxmVg","pdfSize":"4157615","objectId":"0x18d6d2b3b9f444beae6420127bdc018b3c9daae78d8cc38040620a95b9949172","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
