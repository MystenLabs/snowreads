  "abstract": "  Twisted bilayer graphene exhibits two prominent correlated phenomena in\ndistinct regimes: a Kondo lattice near the magic angle, resembling heavy\nfermion systems, and a triangular correlated domain wall network under\ninterlayer bias, akin to sliding Luttinger liquids previously introduced for\ncuprates. Combining these characteristics, here we investigate a system where\ninteracting electrons in the domain wall network couple to localized spins.\nOwing to inter-domain-wall correlations, a two-dimensional spin helix phase\nemerges as a result of spatial phase coherence across parallel domain walls.\nWithin the spin helix phase, magnons can induce a singularity in the scaling\ndimensions of various operators, accessible by adjusting the interaction\nstrength between electrons. We predict observable features in magnetic\nresonance and anisotropic paramagnetic spin susceptibility for the spin helix\nand the magnon-induced singularity, serving as experimental indicators of the\ninterplay between the Kondo lattice and sliding Luttinger liquids.\n",
