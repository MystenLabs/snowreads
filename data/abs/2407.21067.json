Prior research suggests relevance,\ngroup cohesion, or honest source crediting as possible factors. However, the\ndual nature of cognitive and social dimensions underlying citation is often\noverlooked by not considering the intermediary steps leading up to a citation.\nFor one work to be cited by another, it must first be published by a set of\nauthors. Therefore, we investigate the reasons behind researchers' citations,\nexplicitly examining the interplay of socio-cognitive ties through the\ninterdependence of coauthorship and citation networks. We assess our claims in\nan empirical analysis by employing the Author-Oriented Relational HyperEvent\nModel (AuthRHEM) to study Chilean astronomers' citation and collaboration\nbehavior between 2013 and 2015 in a joint framework. We find evidence that when\ndeciding which work to cite, authors prefer other work with novelty and\ncognitive ties, such as work-to-work relations. At the same time, coherent\ngroups are relevant because coauthors are cocited more frequently in subsequent\npublications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries","Physics/Physics and Society","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"legll1cKFhAg2gSSpcr7nqM4_HXvBqhzuGdRwtN8ynU","pdfSize":"869019"}
