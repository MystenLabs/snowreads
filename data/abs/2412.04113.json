We find that in each\nsub-domain, the quasi-static Biot equations are obtained with domain-specific\nmaterial parameters. Moreover, across the interface, material displacement and\npore pressure are continuous, while volumetric fluid content and normal stress\nare balanced. By utilizing the energy of the system, the phase-field potential\nis shown to be influenced by the curvature, along with contributions from both\nflow and elasticity at the interface. The normal velocity of the interface is\nproportional to the jump in normal derivative of the phase-field potential\nacross the interface. Finally, we present a numerical experiment that\ndemonstrates how the location of each phase evolves consistently as the\ndiffuse-interface width parameter becomes smaller; only the width of the\ndiffuse interface changes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NZzWSLFz_kWpRjeiJViz9DbLiMAbNTwV74uSzTyEJE8","pdfSize":"811567"}
