We\nuse a large language model (Mixtral 8x7B instruct) and ScispaCy NER model to\nidentify entities in an article and build custom heuristics based on unified\nmedical language system (UMLS) semantic types to categorize the entities. We\ndiscuss the results and limitations of our system and propose future\nimprovements. Our system achieved an F1 score of 0.39 on the BioNNE validation\nset and 0.348 on the test set.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iP5qdfykkuryl00b9rqdMoYDcj8grHK2UjKoXTNHkAs","pdfSize":"675219"}
