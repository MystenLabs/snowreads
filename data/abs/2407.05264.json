For most problems pertaining to perfect matchings, one may\nrestrict attention to matching covered graphs; thus, there is extensive\nliterature on them. A cornerstone of this theory is an ear decomposition result\ndue to Lov\\'asz and Plummer. Their theorem is a fundamental problem-solving\ntool, and also yields interesting open problems; we discuss two such problems\nbelow, and we solve one of them.\n  A subgraph $H$ of a graph $G$ is conformal if $G-V(H)$ has a perfect\nmatching. This notion is intrinsically related to the aforementioned ear\ndecomposition theorem -- which implies that each matching covered graph (apart\nfrom $K_2$ and even cycles) contains a conformal bisubdivision of $\\theta$, or\na conformal bisubdivision of $K_4$, possibly both. (Here, $\\theta$ refers to\nthe graph with two vertices joined by three edges.) This immediately leads to\ntwo problems: characterize $\\theta$-free (likewise, $K_4$-free) matching\ncovered graphs. A characterization of planar $K_4$-free matching covered graphs\nwas obtained by Kothari and Murty [J. Graph Theory, 82 (1), 2016]; the\nnonplanar case is open.\n  We provide a characterization of $\\theta$-free matching covered graphs that\nimmediately implies a poly-time algorithm for the corresponding decision\nproblem. Our characterization relies heavily on a seminal result due to\nEdmonds, Lov\\'asz and Pulleyblank [Combinatorica, 2, 1982] pertaining to the\ntight cut decomposition theory of matching covered graphs. As corollaries, we\nprovide two upper bounds on the size of a $\\theta$-free graph, namely, $m\\leq\n2n-1$ and $m\\leq \\frac{3n}{2}+b-1$, where $b$ denotes the number of bricks\nobtained in any tight cut decomposition of the graph; for each bound, we\nprovide a characterization of the tight examples. The Petersen graph and $K_4$\nplay key roles in our results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"I_22NOvYXg6YlReI1smXNvsidnaChSSxdGTam3xsxcA","pdfSize":"288601"}
