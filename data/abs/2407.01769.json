However, conventional classification\nmodels often struggle to adequately capture the nuanced patterns of minority\nclasses within these datasets, leading to sub-optimal accuracy. In response to\nthis challenge, we present Ensemble Synthesizer (ENSY) which leverages\nprobability distribution for data augmentation, a novel data model tailored\nspecifically for enhancing classification accuracy in mode choice datasets. In\nour study, ENSY demonstrates remarkable efficacy by nearly quadrupling the F1\nscore of minority classes and improving overall classification accuracy by\nnearly 3%. To assess its performance comprehensively, we compare ENSY against\nvarious augmentation techniques including Random Oversampling, SMOTE-NC, and\nCTGAN. Through experimentation, ENSY consistently outperforms these methods\nacross various scenarios, underscoring its robustness and effectiveness\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gxqvdWBDp3UR7-Z3l9DF3G-L0kWV5Rs8r5Qc3BvkvGU","pdfSize":"1220833","objectId":"0xec8b80f5c4b616744d84d4f70e7785b6ec6fcd5ce4eaf304a45062ef10d03165","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
