  "abstract": "  As star-forming galaxies approach or exceed a stellar mass around $10^{11}\nM_\\odot$, they are increasingly likely to be quenched in a process generically\ncalled mass quenching. Central galaxies, which are quenched via mass rather\nthan environmental quenching, therefore accumulate in a peak around this\ncharacteristic mass. While a number of processes may influence the shape of the\nquenched central stellar mass function (QCSMF), we find that its low-mass slope\nis strongly affected by the scatter in the mass of black holes at a given\nstellar mass, with higher scatters in the black hole population yielding\nshallower slopes. Higher scatters in the black hole mass spread out the stellar\nmass range over which quenching occurs, leading to shallower slopes. This trend\nholds across a variety of semi-analytic models and cosmological hydrodynamic\nsimulations. A comparison with observations provides indirect evidence for a\nlarge scatter in black hole mass $\\sigma(\\log_{10}(M_\\mathrm{BH})|M_*) \\gtrsim\n0.5$ dex, and a joint constraint on AGN feedback physics and the co-evolution\nof galaxies and black holes.\n",
