Mailboxes correspond to one FIFO buffer per process\n(instead of one buffer per pair of processes in peer-to-peer systems).\nRound-based communication corresponds to sequences of rounds in which processes\ncan first send messages, then only receive (and receives must be in the same\nround as their sends). A system is called synchronizable if every execution can\nbe re-scheduled into an equivalent execution that is a sequence of rounds.\nPrevious work mostly considered the setting where rounds have fixed size. Our\nmain contribution shows that the problem whether a mailbox communication system\ncomplies with the round-based policy, with no size limitation on rounds, is\nPspace-complete. For this we use a novel automata-based approach, that also\nallows to determine the precise complexity (Pspace) of several questions\nconsidered in previous literature.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6TXngAsDXvMEygPAEYUfPScBplmDc04s4fvMHYpektQ","pdfSize":"1081651"}
