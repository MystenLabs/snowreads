To overcome these\nchallenges, we present MAC-Ego3D, a novel framework for real-time collaborative\nphotorealistic 3D reconstruction via Multi-Agent Gaussian Consensus. MAC-Ego3D\nenables agents to independently construct, align, and iteratively refine local\nmaps using a unified Gaussian splat representation. Through Intra-Agent\nGaussian Consensus, it enforces spatial coherence among neighboring Gaussian\nsplats within an agent. For global alignment, parallelized Inter-Agent Gaussian\nConsensus, which asynchronously aligns and optimizes local maps by regularizing\nmulti-agent Gaussian splats, seamlessly integrates them into a high-fidelity 3D\nmodel. Leveraging Gaussian primitives, MAC-Ego3D supports efficient RGB-D\nrendering, enabling rapid inter-agent Gaussian association and alignment.\nMAC-Ego3D bridges local precision and global coherence, delivering higher\nefficiency, largely reducing localization error, and improving mapping\nfidelity. It establishes a new SOTA on synthetic and real-world benchmarks,\nachieving a 15x increase in inference speed, order-of-magnitude reductions in\nego-motion estimation error for partial cases, and RGB PSNR gains of 4 to 10\ndB.
