  "abstract": "  This study explores the application of deep learning for rainfall prediction,\nleveraging the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) High rate\ninformation transmission (HRIT) data as input and the Operational Program on\nthe Exchange of weather RAdar information (OPERA) ground-radar reflectivity\ndata as ground truth. We use the mean of 4 InfraRed frequency channels as the\ninput. The radiance images are forecasted up to 4 hours into the future using a\ndense optical flow algorithm. A conditional generative adversarial network\n(GAN) model is employed to transform the predicted radiance images into\nrainfall images which are aggregated over the 4 hour forecast period to\ngenerate cumulative rainfall values. This model scored a value of approximately\n7.5 as the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) in the Weather4Cast 2024\ncompetition and placed 1st on the core challenge leaderboard.\n",
