However, recent analyses indicate that pure core-collapse\nsupernova (CCSN) ejecta can also be a likely source. We perform a detailed\nanalysis of 17 $\\alpha$PVMP stars by considering six different scenarios\nrelevant to the early Galaxy. We consider a single pair-instability supernova\n(PISN) and a single CCSN. Additionally, we consider the combination of ejecta\nfrom a CCSN with ejecta from another CCSN, a PISN, a near-Chandrasekhar mass\n(near-${\\rm M_{Ch}}$) SN 1a, and a sub-Chandrasekhar mass (sub-${\\rm M_{Ch}}$)\nSN 1a. A clear signature can only be established for sub-${\\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a\nwith a near-smoking-gun signature in SDSSJ0018-0939 and a reasonably clear\nsignature in ET0381. The majority ($82\\%$) of $\\alpha$PVMP stars can be\nexplained by pure CCSN ejecta and do not require any SN 1a contribution.\nHowever, the combination of CCSN and sub-${\\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a ejecta can also\nexplain most ($76\\%$) of $\\alpha$PVMP stars. In contrast, the combination of\nejecta from CCSN with near-${\\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a and PISN can fit $41\\%$ and\n$29\\%$ of the stars, respectively. The single PISN scenario is strongly ruled\nout for all stars. Our results indicate that $\\alpha$PVMP stars are equally\ncompatible with pure CCSN ejecta and a combination of CCSN and SN 1a ejecta,\nwith sub-${\\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a being roughly twice as frequent as near-${\\rm\nM_{Ch}}$ SN 1a.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9lkXwq_oOD0I9H2oGdxsd3FON6iIFiwSimQ2cTeARg4","pdfSize":"842900"}
