Existing approaches often\nstruggle to effectively capture the underlying structure and relationships\nwithin such data. We propose GFTab (Geodesic Flow Kernels for Semi- Supervised\nLearning on Mixed-Variable Tabular Dataset), a semi-supervised framework\nspecifically designed for tabular datasets. GFTab incorporates three key\ninnovations: 1) Variable-specific corruption methods tailored to the distinct\nproperties of continuous and categorical variables, 2) A Geodesic flow kernel\nbased similarity measure to capture geometric changes between corrupted inputs,\nand 3) Tree-based embedding to leverage hierarchical relationships from\navailable labeled data. To rigorously evaluate GFTab, we curate a comprehensive\nset of 21 tabular datasets spanning various domains, sizes, and variable\ncompositions. Our experimental results show that GFTab outperforms existing\nML/DL models across many of these datasets, particularly in settings with\nlimited labeled data.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Izf443ryVo1wbhpbgJUeQaaCl3CkhGDdplNGISN4CvQ","pdfSize":"470929"}
