  "abstract": "  In this paper, we study the two-stage distributionally robust optimization\n(DRO) problem from the primal perspective. Unlike existing approaches, this\nperspective allows us to build a deeper and more intuitive understanding on\nDRO, to leverage classical and well-established solution methods and to develop\na general and fast decomposition algorithm (and its variants), and to address a\ncouple of unsolved issues that are critical for modeling and computation.\nTheoretical analyses regarding the strength, convergence, and iteration\ncomplexity of the developed algorithm are also presented. A numerical study on\ndifferent types of instances of the distributionally robust facility location\nproblem demonstrates that the proposed solution algorithm (and its variants)\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods. It solves instances up to several\norders of magnitude faster, and successfully addresses new types of practical\ninstances that previously could not be handled. We believe these results will\nsignificantly enhance the accessibility of DRO, break down barriers, and\nunleash its potential to solve real world challenges.\n",
