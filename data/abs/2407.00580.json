It is shown that if $f(z)$ is a meromorphic solution of the\nfirst order differential equation $f'(z)=S(z)e^{P(z)}f(z)+1$, then there is a\ncurve $\\Gamma: x\\to x+iy(x)$, where $x_0\\leq x<\\infty$ and\n$\\pi<nx^{n-1}y<3\\pi/2$ such that for all $z\\in \\Gamma$,\n\\begin{equation}\\tag{\\dag} |f(z)|>\n\\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{8}e^{\\frac{1}{8}x^{n}}\\right). \\end{equation} The estimate\nin $(\\dag)$ together with the Wiman--Valiron theory implies that the\nhyper-order $\\varsigma(f)$ of $f(z)$ is equal to $n$, which allows to specify\nthe class $N$ in complex dynamics. Moreover, this provides partial answers to\nBr\\\"{u}ck's conjecture in uniqueness theory and also a problem on a second\norder algebraic differential equation of Hayman.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-Pn3XXZ0xI95u5aVwwEZvx70gHR3HPWE6nIKxU-UYiY","pdfSize":"237398","objectId":"0x8d8108cf6ac7aa6b09b3f43c6531ec8f9b13e99fe1c4add05adcbc38e3a6333a","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
