  "abstract": "  We present the complete solution to the classification problem regarding the\nvariational symmetries of the generalized Brans-Dicke cosmological model in the\npresence of a second scalar field minimally coupled to gravity and the\ngeneralized Brans-Dicke scalar field theory. Through the symmetry analysis, we\nwere able to specify the functional form of the field equations such that they\nbecome integrable. Additionally, new families of integrable cosmological models\nare presented.\n",
