When this system is expressed in\nterms of multiple components it can be used to explore the impact of a phase\ntransition from a hadronic state to a quark plasma state with a complex\nclustering structure. The clustering can take the form of colored diquarks or\ntriquarks and bound colorless meson, baryon, or hyperon states at the phase\ntransition boundary. The resulting multicomponent EoS system is nonconvex which\ncan give rise to nonclassical BZT phase changing shock waves. Using the BZT\nshock wave condition we find constraints on the quark density and examine how\nthis changes the compactness and tidal deformability of the compact core. These\nresults are then combined with the TOV equations to find the changes in the\nmass-radius relationship. These states are compared to the recent astrophysical\nhigh mass neutron star systems which may provide evidence for a core that has\nundergone a quark-gluon phase transition such as PSR 0943+10 or GW 190814.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RFkeuaAwORH4pjMSrko_WCP9Y7RhuJR9A9upveWuRkM","pdfSize":"890511"}
