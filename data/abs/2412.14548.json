Due to their structural similarities, it\nis often held that soft modes are some kind of asymptotic limit of edge modes.\nHere, we show in Maxwell theory that there is an arguably more interesting\nrelationship between the \\emph{asymptotic} symmetries and their charges, on one\nhand, and their \\emph{finite-distance} counterparts, on the other, without the\nneed of a limit. Key to this observation is to embed the finite region in the\nglobal spacetime and identify edge modes as dynamical $\\rm{U}(1)$-reference\nframes for dressing subregion variables. Distinguishing \\emph{intrinsic} and\n\\emph{extrinsic} frames, according to whether they are built from field content\nin- or outside the region, we find that non-trivial corner symmetries arise\nonly for extrinsic frames. Further, the asymptotic-to-finite relation requires\nasymptotically charged ones (like Wilson lines). Such frames, called \\emph{soft\nedges}, extend to asymptotia and realize the corner charge algebra by ``pulling\nin'' the asymptotic one from infinity. Realizing an infinite-dimensional\nalgebra requires a new set of \\emph{soft boundary conditions}, relying on the\ndistinction between extrinsic and intrinsic data. We identify the subregion\nGoldstone mode as the relational observable between extrinsic and intrinsic\nframes and clarify the meaning of vacuum degeneracy. We also connect the\nasymptotic memory effect with a more operational \\emph{quasi-local} one. A main\nconclusion is that the relationship between asymptotia and finite distance is\n\\emph{frame-dependent}; each choice of soft edge mode probes distinct\ncross-boundary data of the global theory. Our work combines the study of\nboundary symmetries with the program of dynamical reference frames and we\nanticipate that core insights extend to Yang-Mills theory and gravity.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nZKVS-VdhFxz6lAdCuxFJSQwozdLi4PI0yOqehdSOHw","pdfSize":"1349986"}
