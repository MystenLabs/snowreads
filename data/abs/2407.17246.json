Two representative\nchannel strategies are closely associated with model expressivity and\nrobustness, including channel independence (CI) and channel dependence (CD).\nThe former adopts individual channel treatment and has been shown to be more\nrobust to distribution shifts, but lacks sufficient capacity to model\nmeaningful channel interactions. The latter is more expressive for representing\ncomplex cross-channel dependencies, but is prone to overfitting. To balance the\ntwo strategies, we present a channel-aware low-rank adaptation method to\ncondition CD models on identity-aware individual components. As a plug-in\nsolution, it is adaptable for a wide range of backbone architectures. Extensive\nexperiments show that it can consistently and significantly improve the\nperformance of both CI and CD models with demonstrated efficiency and\nflexibility.
