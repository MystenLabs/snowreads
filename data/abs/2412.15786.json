  "abstract": "  The processes that generate rogue waves on the sea surface remain a mystery.\nDespite their different natures, the nonlinear bending waves generated in a\nthin elastic plate share some similarities with waves on the surface of the\nsea. For instance, both involve four-wave interactions during energy exchange,\nbut in bending waves, the number of waves is not conserved. Here, we present an\nexperimental study to investigate extreme event statistics in random elastic\nbending waves forced by an electromagnetic shaker on a thin stainless steel\nplate. In our setup, the standard statistical criterion used to define extreme\nevents, such as rogue waves on the sea surface, is insufficiently restrictive.\nWe therefore apply a new criterion to determine the occurrence frequency of\nrare events, similar to those observed in wave tanks. With this new criterion,\nwe examine correlations between extreme events amplitude and wave slopes,\nenergy, and periods, raising questions about the links between statistically\nrare events and rogue waves.\n",
