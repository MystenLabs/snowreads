  "abstract": "  When two systems are coupled, the driver system can function as an external\nforcing over the driven or response system. Also, an external forcing can\nindependently perturb the driven system, leading us to examine the interplay\nbetween the dynamics induced by the driver system and the external forcing\nacting on the response system. The cooperation of the two external\nperturbations can induce different kinds of behavior and initiate a resonance\nphenomenon. Here, we analyze and characterize this resonance phenomenon.\nMoreover, this resonance may coexist in the parameter set and coincide with\nother resonances typical of coupled systems, as {\\it the transmitted resonance}\nand {\\it the coupling-induced resonance}. Thus, we analyze the outcomes to\ndiscern their distinctions and understand when the increase in oscillation\namplitudes is attributable to one phenomenon, to one of both the others, or a\ncombination of the three.\n",
