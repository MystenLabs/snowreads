Here, we report\nthe experimental observation of an altermagnetic spin-splitting\nmagnetoresistance effect, which is driven by a spin current associated with the\ngiant nonrelativistic spin splitting of an altermagnet. The spin current\npolarization and the corresponding magnetic field direction associated with the\nmagnetoresistance extrema are largely determined by the Neel vector of the\naltermagnet, leading to a remarkable phase shift compared to that driven by a\nconventional relativistic spin current. Our work opens a door to unearthing\nluxuriant nonrelativistic quantum states of matter in emergent materials with\nunconventional spin degeneracy lifting.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6wWQzLSsMAS_Az4aAAbXZjbC9vAgdgPg17UVj8qwor8","pdfSize":"774829"}
