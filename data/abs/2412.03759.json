The\nprimary focus is on vacuum SSS solutions describing asymptotically flat\nsystems. In different f(R) models $\\mu$ varies from several meV to $\\sim\n10^{13}$Gev yielding very large dimensionless (in Planck units) parameter\n$M\\mu$ for a typical astrophysical mass $M$. We identify a class of scalaron\npotentials in the Einstein frame of f(R) gravity that encompasses several\nwell-known models and permits a straightforward analytical description of SSS\nobjects for $M\\mu\\gg 1$. The approximate solutions describe well the SSS\nconfigurations in regions of both strong and weak scalaron fields and\ndemonstrate remarkably similar properties across the considered class of\nscalaron potentials for astrophysically significant cases. The results are\nconfirmed by numerical simulations.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LmD0cnhPfudKF_k3gYn70p1QeQR3jBg_jsGy3T5L8IQ","pdfSize":"451423"}
