We numerically verify and\nexperimentally validate the accuracy and fidelity of the resulting\nthermalized/mixed ADPs (TADPs) by means of selected numerical tests including\nfree entropy, heat capacity, thermal expansion, molar volumes, equation of\nstate and elastic constants. We show that the local equilibrium properties\npredicted by TADPs agree closely with those computed directly from ADP by means\nof Molecular Dynamics (MD).\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"YNfdoOrrN9aJTuW11hTUTHkFMXgejg-aqHQ7si4l5Sk","pdfSize":"409408"}
