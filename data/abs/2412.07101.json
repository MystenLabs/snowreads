  "abstract": "  Topological charges are typically manipulated by managing their energy bands\nin quantum systems. In this work, we propose a new approach to manipulate the\ntopological charges of systems by engineering density zeros of localized wave\nexcitations in them. We demonstrate via numerical simulation and analytical\nanalysis that the winding number of a toroidal Bose condensate can be well\nmanipulated by engineering the relative velocities between the dark solitons\nand their backgrounds. The crossing of relative velocities through zero makes a\nchange in winding number by inducing density zeros during acceleration, with\nthe direction of crossing determining whether charge increases or decreases.\nPossibilities of observing such winding number manipulation are discussed for\ncurrent experimental settings. This idea may also be to higher dimensions.\nThese results will inspire new pathways in designing topological materials\nusing quantum simulation platforms.\n",
