  "abstract": "  The main goal of the present research is to make a summary of analytical\nequations that can be found to calculate a swing-by maneuver in the\nthree-dimensional space. Analytical equations based in the patched conics\napproximation are showed and they allow to calculate the variation in velocity,\nangular momentum, energy and inclination of the spacecraft that is involved in\nthis maneuver. Based on that, it is possible to obtain expressions for\nparticular cases, like the planar and the polar maneuver. The most important\nproperties of this maneuver can demonstrated using thos equations, like: in the\ncase of planar maneuver the variation in inclination can be only 180, 0, and\n-180 degrees; the variation in inclination is symmetric with respect to the out\nof plane angle; a passage by the poles changes only the y-component of the\nangular momentum, keeping the energy and the inclination of the trajectory\nunchanged. The results show several maneuvers.\n",
