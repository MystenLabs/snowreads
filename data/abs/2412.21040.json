Specifically, for all integers $n\\geq 1$, we prove that there exist\nclassical solutions, emanating from smooth, compressive, and non-vacuous\ninitial data, which form a cusp-type gradient singularity in finite time, in\nwhich the gradient of the solution has precisely $C^{0,\\frac{1}{2n+1}}$\nH\\\"older-regularity. We show that such Euler solutions are codimension-$(2n-2)$\nstable in the Sobolev space $W^{2n+2,\\infty}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pNcq80e6GBpn7Ip91SR71tPSoj703l6D6ZcsEYmk6Cs","pdfSize":"829363"}
