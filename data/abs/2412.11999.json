  "abstract": "  Shallow permutations were defined in 1977 to be those that satisfy the lower\nbound of the Diaconis-Graham inequality. Recently, there has been renewed\ninterest in these permutations. In particular, Berman and Tenner showed they\nsatisfy certain pattern avoidance conditions in their cycle form and Woo showed\nthey are exactly those whose cycle diagrams are unlinked. Shallow permutations\nthat avoid 321 have appeared in many contexts; they are those permutations for\nwhich depth equals the reflection length, they have unimodal cycles, and they\nhave been called Boolean permutations. Motivated by this interest in\n321-avoiding shallow permutations, we investigate $\\sigma$-avoiding shallow\npermutations for all $\\sigma \\in \\mathcal{S}_3$. To do this, we develop more\ngeneral structural results about shallow permutations, and apply them to\nenumerate shallow permutations avoiding any pattern of length 3.\n",
