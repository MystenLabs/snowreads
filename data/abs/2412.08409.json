  "abstract": "  A passive loudspeaker mounted in a duct acts as a reciprocal scatterer for\nplane waves impinging on either of its sides. However, the reciprocity can be\nbroken by means of an asymmetric electroacoustic feedback which supplies to the\nloudspeaker a signal picked-up from a microphone facing only one of its sides.\nThis simple modification offers new opportunities for the control and\nmanipulation of sound waves. In this paper, we investigate the scattering\nfeatures of a pair of such actively controlled loudspeakers connected by means\nof a short and narrow duct. The theoretical and experimental results\ndemonstrate that by tuning the feedback loops, the system exhibits several\nexotic effects, which include an asymmetric reflectionless configuration with\none-way transmission or absorption, a directional amplifier with an isolation\nof 42 dB, and a quasi CPA-lasing configuration. All of these effects were\nachieved using a single setup in the subwavelength regime, highlighting the\nversatility of such an asymmetrically active scatterer.\n",
