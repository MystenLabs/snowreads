Generalizing the so-called ``coupled-valley'' model of Scheer et al.\n[1], we start from a microscopic tight-binding description, deriving a\ncontinuum model from Schreiffer-Wolff perturbation theory and obtaining an\neffective description of the low-energy momentum states in either valley as\nwell as the explicit microscopic forms of the Moir\\'e potentials. We then\nconsider two explicit symmetry-mismatched Moir\\'e geometries with a rectangular\nsubstrate, the first of which displays an emergent time-reversal symmetry as\nwell as a broad parameter regime which displays quasi-1D physics characterized\nby the existence of a Sliding Luttinger Liquid phase. This model also has a\nnontrivial topological character, captured by the Berry curvature dipole. The\nsecond geometry displays an emergent $C_3$ rotational symmetry despite the\nrectangular substrate, reducing to a continuum model considered in Ref. [1]\nthat was shown to display honeycomb and Kagome topological flat bands.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"X9iITum9SjKM_2lwsRdicSo--wFKQMrO1UIJNenc-Mw","pdfSize":"2634521"}
