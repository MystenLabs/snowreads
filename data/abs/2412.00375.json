  "abstract": "  In this paper, we provide two algorithms based on the theory of\nmultidimensional neural network (NN) operators activated by hyperbolic tangent\nsigmoidal functions. Theoretical results are recalled to justify the\nperformance of the here implemented algorithms. Specifically, the first\nalgorithm models multidimensional signals (such as digital images), while the\nsecond one addresses the problem of rescaling and enhancement of the considered\ndata. We discuss several applications of the NN-based algorithms for modeling\nand rescaling/enhancement remote sensing data (represented as images), with\nnumerical experiments conducted on a selection of remote sensing (RS) images\nfrom the (open access) RETINA dataset. A comparison with classical\ninterpolation methods, such as bilinear and bicubic interpolation, shows that\nthe proposed algorithms outperform the others, particularly in terms of the\nStructural Similarity Index (SSIM).\n",
