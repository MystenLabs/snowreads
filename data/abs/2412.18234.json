Misalignment can lead to poor model\ngeneralization, especially in high-dimensional sequences. Existing methods\noften struggle with optimization when dealing with high-dimensional sparse\ndata, falling into poor alignments. Feature selection is frequently used to\nenhance model performance for sparse data. However, a fixed set of selected\nfeatures would not generally work for dynamically changing sequences and would\nneed to be modified based on the state of the sequence. Therefore, modifying\nthe selected feature based on contextual input would result in better\nalignment. Our suggested method, Conditional Deep Canonical Temporal Time\nWarping (CDCTW), is designed for temporal alignment in sparse temporal data to\naddress these challenges. CDCTW enhances alignment accuracy for high\ndimensional time-dependent views be performing dynamic time warping on data\nembedded in maximally correlated subspace which handles sparsity with novel\nfeature selection method. We validate the effectiveness of CDCTW through\nextensive experiments on various datasets, demonstrating superior performance\nover previous techniques.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MhoLw82kTZeqKkIeYq1wyeH9AJFxeLdiVvmVeXW18Vk","pdfSize":"500584"}
