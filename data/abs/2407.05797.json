If the potential is slowly varying on the soliton scale, we derive\nanalytical soliton solutions behaving like Newtonian particles. If the\npotential has the form of an attractive delta-like point defect, we identify\ndifferent dynamical regimes, defined by the relative strength of the\nnonlocality and the point defect. In these regimes, the soliton can be trapped\nat the defect's location, via a nonlinear resonance with a defect mode -- which\nis found analytically -- reflected by or transmitted through the defect,\nfeaturing a wave behavior. Our analytical predictions are corroborated by\nresults of direct numerical simulations.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons","Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BzrtC0AmzVzMNC_RLGYEm6fIE3BrRWD3yVp5_VSH4WU","pdfSize":"1073760"}
