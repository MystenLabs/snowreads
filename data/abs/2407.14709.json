Existing methods face critical limitations:\nconditional diffusion models in pixel or latent space cannot exceed the\nresolution on which they were trained without losing fidelity, and\ncomputational demands increase significantly for larger image sizes.\nPatch-based methods offer computational efficiency but fail to capture\nlong-range spatial relationships due to their overreliance on local\ninformation. In this paper, we introduce a novel conditional diffusion model in\ninfinite dimensions, $\\infty$-Brush for controllable large image synthesis. We\npropose a cross-attention neural operator to enable conditioning in function\nspace. Our model overcomes the constraints of traditional finite-dimensional\ndiffusion models and patch-based methods, offering scalability and superior\ncapability in preserving global image structures while maintaining fine\ndetails. To our best knowledge, $\\infty$-Brush is the first conditional\ndiffusion model in function space, that can controllably synthesize images at\narbitrary resolutions of up to $4096\\times4096$ pixels.
