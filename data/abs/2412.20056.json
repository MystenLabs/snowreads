  "abstract": "  We present GSplatLoc, a camera localization method that leverages the\ndifferentiable rendering capabilities of 3D Gaussian splatting for\nultra-precise pose estimation. By formulating pose estimation as a\ngradient-based optimization problem that minimizes discrepancies between\nrendered depth maps from a pre-existing 3D Gaussian scene and observed depth\nimages, GSplatLoc achieves translational errors within 0.01 cm and near-zero\nrotational errors on the Replica dataset - significantly outperforming existing\nmethods. Evaluations on the Replica and TUM RGB-D datasets demonstrate the\nmethod's robustness in challenging indoor environments with complex camera\nmotions. GSplatLoc sets a new benchmark for localization in dense mapping, with\nimportant implications for applications requiring accurate real-time\nlocalization, such as robotics and augmented reality.\n",
