Still, only a few metallic altermagnets have been identified, and\ndiscovering them through trial-and-error is resource-intensive. Here, we\nintroduce a high-throughput screening strategy to accelerate the discovery of\nmaterials with altermagnetic properties. By combining density functional theory\n(DFT) with embedded dynamical mean-field theory (eDMFT), our approach improves\nthe accuracy in predicting metallicity and spin splitting, especially in\ntransition-metal-rich compounds. An automated workflow incorporates\npre-screening and symmetry analysis to reduce both human effort and\ncomputational cost. This approach identified two previously unreported metallic\naltermagnets, CrSe and CaFe4Al8 (in addition to two known altermagnets, CrSb\nand RuO2), as well as a dozen semiconducting altermagnets among over 2,000\nmagnetic materials. Our findings reveal that while altermagnets are abundant\namong magnetic materials, only a tiny fraction is metallic.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"_80gd3UauvgnQKOLQa4Wv1YElfaHPPRqCrTmNE9oJoo","pdfSize":"2758992"}
