The study builds\nupon the concept presented in literature \\cite{tisha2}, applying it to river\necology in the context of harvesting activities. We assume that despite of\nhaving distinct advection and diffusion rates, two species are competing for\nthe same food supply. This paper's main objective is to study, using\ntheoretical and numerical analysis, the global asymptotic stability and\ncoexistence steady state based on different and unequal rates of diffusion and\nadvection. We establish the result for existence, uniqueness and positivity of\nthe solution. The local stability of two semi trivial steady states is\ndemonstrated. Also, we examine the non-existence of coexistence steady state\nwith the help of some non-trivial presumptions. Finally, we combine the local\nstability with the non-existence of coexistence to demonstrate the global\nstability using monotone dynamical systems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"KxSNZgd0mWhxA-RgR8mEjKAu0H-Vkf3EOVz_ayOlhsM","pdfSize":"949004"}
