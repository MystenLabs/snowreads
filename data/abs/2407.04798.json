In this article, we use the well-known infinite product\nidentities due to Jacobi, Watson, and Hirschhorn to derive further such closed\nformulas for reciprocals of other interesting infinite products. Moreover, with\nthese formulas, we approximate these reciprocals to arbitrary order simply\nusing MacMahon's functions and {\\it MacMahon type} functions. For example, let\n$\\Theta_{6}(q):=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{n\\in\\mathbb{Z}} \\chi_6(n) n\nq^{\\frac{n^2-1}{24}}$ be the theta function corresponding to the odd quadratic\ncharacter modulo $6$. Then for any positive integer $n$, we have\n$$\\frac{1}{\\Theta_{6}(q)}= q^{-\\frac{3n^2+n}{2}}\\sum_{\\substack{k=r_1\\\\ k\\equiv\nn\\hspace{-0.2cm}\\pmod{2}}}^{r_2}(-1)^{\\frac{n-k}{2}}A_{k}(q)C_{\\frac{3n-k}{2}}(q)+O(q^{n+1}),$$\nwhere $r_1:=\\lfloor\\frac{3n-1-\\sqrt{12n+13}}{3}\\rfloor+1$ and\n$r_2:=\\lceil\\frac{3n-1+\\sqrt{12n+13}}{3}\\rceil-1$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"LW3WU11p9N5VWZrUcVNT6KINtnskXUZJH9hFdZdZEOw","pdfSize":"230792"}
