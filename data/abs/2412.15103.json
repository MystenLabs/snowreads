  "abstract": "  We present an extension of Landau's theory of phase transitions by\nincorporating the topology of the order parameter. When the order parameter\ncomprises several components arising from multiplicity in the same irreducible\nrepresentation of symmetry, it can possess a nontrivial topology and acquire a\nBerry phase under the variation of thermodynamic parameters. To illustrate this\nidea, we investigate the superconducting phase transition of an electronic\nsystem with tetragonal symmetry and an attractive interaction involving two\npartial waves, both transforming in the trivial representation. By analyzing\nthe time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation in the adiabatic limit, we show\nthat the order parameter acquires a Berry phase after a cyclic evolution of\nparameters. We study two concrete models -- one preserving time-reversal\nsymmetry and one breaking it -- and demonstrate that the nontrivial topology of\nthe order parameter originates from thermodynamic analogs of gapless Dirac and\nWeyl points in the phase diagram. Finally, we identify an experimental\nsignature of the topological Berry phase in a Josephson junction.\n",
