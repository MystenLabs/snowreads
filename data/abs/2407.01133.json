The nonlinear reflection and\ntransmission of such two-dimensional superatoms are exploited in different\ninterferometric setups for the deterministic generation of tunable single\nphotons and entangling two-photon operations with high fidelities,\n$\\mathcal{F}\\gtrsim0.999$. The described setup can function as a versatile\nnonlinear optical element in a free-space photonic quantum network with simple\nlinear elements and without the need of additional mode confinement, optical\nresonators, or optical isolators.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"0MoXQdkOndmzTXq2YQqRnuvv_z_ddYXdVELdS77h2Fg","pdfSize":"4841253"}
