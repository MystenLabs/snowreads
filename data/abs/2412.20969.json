  "abstract": "  We study ``nonlocal diffusion equations'' of the form \\[\n\\partial_{t}\\frac{d\\rho_{t}}{d\\pi}(x)+\\int_{X}\\left(\\frac{d\\rho_{t}}{d\\pi}(x)-\\frac{d\\rho_{t}}{d\\pi}(y)\\right)\\eta(x,y)d\\pi(y)=0\\qquad(\\dagger)\n\\] where $X$ is either $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ or $\\mathbb{T}^{d}$, $\\pi$ is a\nprobability distribution on $X$, and $\\eta(x,y)$ is a ``transition kernel''\nwhich may be singular as $x\\rightarrow y$. For a suitable notion of weak\nsolutions which we discuss below, we show that solutions to these nonlocal\ndiffusion equations can be interpreted as gradient flows of the relative\nentropy with respect to a certain nonlocal Wasserstein-type metric defined in\nterms of $\\eta$ and $\\pi$. These ``nonlocal Wasserstein metrics'' endow the\nspace of probability measures on $X$ with a formal Riemannian structure,\nthereby providing for us a nonlocal analogue of the \\emph{Otto calculus}\noriginally developed in the context of the 2-Wasserstein metric. The class of\nequations $(\\dagger)$ includes a family of ``nonlocal Fokker-Planck\nequations'', which are thus identified as nonlocal Wasserstein gradient flows\nof the relative entropy, analogously with the usual Fokker-Planck equation and\nthe $W_{2}$ metric.\n  The gradient flow structure we provide allows us to deduce: existence and\nuniqueness of solutions to ($\\dagger$) in a suitable class of weak solutions;\nstability of solutions in the sense of evolutionary $\\Gamma$-convergence, with\nrespect to perturbations of initial condition, reference measure $\\pi$, and\ntransition kernel $\\eta$; sufficient conditions for exponential convergence to\nequilibrium, in terms of a nonlocal analogue of the log-Sobolev inequality; as\nwell as the consistency of a finite-volume-type spatial discretization scheme\nin the $\\mathbb{T}^{d}$ case.\n",
