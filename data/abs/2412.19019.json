Thus, the controlled harnessing of high-dimensional\nentanglement has long been hailed as a necessary prerequisite towards practical\nquantum applications. By using a deterministic quantum state filter that\nimplemented through quantum interference, we present a generalised formulation\nfor the complete high-dimensional symmetric and anti-symmetric Bell basis, and\nexperimentally prepare four-dimensional orbital angular momentum Bell states\nthat provide the well-behaved symmetric or anti-symmetric properties.\nAdditionally, we use a concise yet efficient scan of temporal delay to directly\nobserve high-dimensional two-photon interference effects in spatial modes.\nThese results provide an alternative way for harnessing high-dimensional\nentanglement, and may facilitate the use of quantum interference for more\ncomplex quantum information processing tasks that beyond qubits.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Axz4LjshBZs-X-_31zugtmdXflryG0V5k4ekVWCjxBs","pdfSize":"31845892"}
