Both have their\nuses in neuromorphic computing and both can be implemented with low- or\nzero-energy-barrier nanomagnets whose random magnetization orientations in the\npresence of thermal noise encode the binary or analog state variables. In\nbetween these two classes is n-ary stochastic neurons, mainly ternary\nstochastic neurons (TSN) whose state randomly assumes one of three values (-1,\n0, +1), which have proved to be efficient in pattern classification tasks such\nas recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST data set or patterns from the\nCIFAR-10 data set. Here, we show how to implement a TSN with a\nzero-energy-barrier (shape isotropic) magnetostrictive nanomagnet subjected to\nuniaxial strain.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KKXTxCmuZohqepm3-DlHDyHd9-sy17T8wwPgMXlSP4Q","pdfSize":"686385"}
