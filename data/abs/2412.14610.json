  "abstract": "  Nonreciprocity of supercurrents may exist when both spatial inversion and\ntime-reversal symmetries are broken, leading to the supercurrent diode effect\n(SDE). The spatial inversion symmetry may be broken by chiral structures in\nnanotubes where the SDE is expected when a magnetic flux passes through the\ntube. While such an effect has been predicted based on a phenomenological\ntheory, a microscopic and quantitative study with a concrete lattice model is\nmissing. Here, we investigate the SDE in chiral nanotubes made of carbon and\nthose made of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) with tight-binding models.\nWe obtain the SDE efficiency as a function of the nanotube radius, the chiral\nangle, the magnetic flux, the temperature, the chemical potential, etc., and\nfind that sign flipping happens in various parameter dependencies. In TMD\nnanotubes, the SDEs with and without the spin-orbit coupling are compared. We\nalso simulate CNTs made from square lattice materials for comparison and\ndiscuss the effects of strains. Besides qualitative consistency with previous\nphenomenological theory, new features are found and the microscopic origins are\nclarified.\n",
