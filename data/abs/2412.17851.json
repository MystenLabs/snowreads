In this paper, we introduce\nNoisereduce, an algorithm for minimizing noise across a variety of domains,\nincluding speech, bioacoustics, neurophysiology, and seismology. Noisereduce\nuses spectral gating to estimate a frequency-domain mask that effectively\nseparates signals from noise. It is fast, lightweight, requires no training\ndata, and handles both stationary and non-stationary noise, making it both a\nversatile tool and a convenient baseline for comparison with domain-specific\napplications. We provide a detailed overview of Noisereduce and evaluate its\nperformance on a variety of time-domain signals.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computer Science/Sound"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"JMsAB-3O8JXJb2txePZUKGZCiG2ty_3uyvBWrv-bDJk","pdfSize":"14450497"}
