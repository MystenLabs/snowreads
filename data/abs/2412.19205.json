  "abstract": "  Understanding light-induced hidden orders is relevant for nonequilibrium\nmaterials control and future ultrafast technologies. Hidden superconducting\norder, in particular, has been a focus of recent experimental and theoretical\nefforts. In this study, we investigate the stability of light-induced $\\eta$\npairing. Using a memory truncated implementation of nonequilibrium dynamical\nmean field theory (DMFT) and entropy cooling techniques, we study the long-time\ndynamics of the photoinduced superconducting state. In the presence of coupling\nto a cold phonon bath, the photodoped system reaches a quasi-steady state,\nwhich can be sustained over a long period of time in large-gap Mott insulators.\nWe show that this long-lived prethermalized state is well described by the\nnonequilibrium steady state implementation of DMFT.\n",
