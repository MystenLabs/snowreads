Here, we present an optical coherence elastography\n(OCE) technique that quantifies both the tension and elastic modulus of lens\ntissue and capsule. This method derives mechanical parameters from surface wave\ndispersion across a critical frequency range of 1-30 kHz. Using isolated lenses\nfrom six-month-old pigs, we measured intrinsic anterior capsular tensions of\n0-20 kPa and posterior capsular tensions of 40-50 kPa, induced by\nintra-lenticular pressure at the cortical surface. Young's modulus (E) was 1.9\nMPa for anterior capsules and 1.2 MPa for posterior capsules. Tensions in\ncortical tissue (E ~ 10 kPa) were below 1 kPa. Biaxial zonular stretching (~4%\nstrain) increased anterior capsular tension from near zero to 64 kPa. This\nacousto-optical method holds significant promise for diagnosing and managing\naccommodative dysfunctions through lens mechanics assessment in clinical\nsettings.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Medical Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"kDWN3eLHjA68e-PYitoYkrkiPh5R_LqPFbrrAmDOUqs","pdfSize":"2809016"}
