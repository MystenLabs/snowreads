Companies, governments, and investors rely on key\nmetrics like GDP and industrial production indices to predict economic trends.\nHowever, they have yet to effectively leverage the wealth of information\ncontained in economic text, such as causal relationships, in their economic\nforecasting. Therefore, we design indices of economic fluctuation from economic\nsurveys by using our previously proposed narrative framework. From the\nevaluation results, it is observed that the proposed indices had a stronger\ncorrelation with cumulative lagging diffusion index than other types of\ndiffusion indices.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"d1seitW2_0NFESCwx6_oLh-tjlowngVFXAczc51W0c8","pdfSize":"2351206"}
