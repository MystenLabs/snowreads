  "abstract": "  The Information Bottleneck (IB) principle has emerged as a promising approach\nfor enhancing the generalization, robustness, and interpretability of deep\nneural networks, demonstrating efficacy across image segmentation, document\nclustering, and semantic communication. Among IB implementations, the IB\nLagrangian method, employing Lagrangian multipliers, is widely adopted. While\nnumerous methods for the optimizations of IB Lagrangian based on variational\nbounds and neural estimators are feasible, their performance is highly\ndependent on the quality of their design, which is inherently prone to errors.\nTo address this limitation, we introduce Structured IB, a framework for\ninvestigating potential structured features. By incorporating auxiliary\nencoders to extract missing informative features, we generate more informative\nrepresentations. Our experiments demonstrate superior prediction accuracy and\ntask-relevant information preservation compared to the original IB Lagrangian\nmethod, even with reduced network size.\n",
