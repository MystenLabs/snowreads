We integrate kinematics with dynamic radiance\nfields, bridging the gap between the sparse nature of monocular videos and the\nreal-world physics. Our method introduces the kinematic field, capturing motion\nthrough kinematic quantities: velocity, acceleration, and jerk. The kinematic\nfield is jointly learned with the dynamic radiance field by minimizing the\nphotometric loss without motion ground truth. We further augment our method\nwith physics-driven regularizers grounded in kinematics. We propose\nphysics-driven regularizers that ensure the physical validity of predicted\nkinematic quantities, including advective acceleration and jerk. Additionally,\nwe control the motion trajectory based on rigidity equations formed with the\npredicted kinematic quantities. In experiments, our method outperforms the\nstate-of-the-arts by capturing physical motion patterns within challenging\nreal-world monocular videos.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"IVmkyZi4DpwvN8zU20oao8LCbFKc0xGatbQKVybE-jM","pdfSize":"46211347"}
