  "abstract": "  The phenomenological description of the cosmological particle production in\nthe framework of the induced gravity is investigated. It appears that the\nsource terms with the particle number density in the creation law can be\ninterpreted as the invisible part of the Universe. It is shown that there is a\ngauge that restores the General Relativity in which our model is equivalent to\nthe $f(R)$-gravity for $f \\propto R^{\\frac{3}{2}}$\n",
