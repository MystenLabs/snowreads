We present the Bayes-optimal\nperformance and weak recovery thresholds in a model where the objective is to\nrecover the latent structures from two noisy data matrices with correlated\nspikes. The paper derives the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm for\nthis model and characterizes its performance in the high-dimensional limit via\nthe associated state evolution. The analysis holds for a broad range of priors\nand noise channels, which can differ across modalities. The linearization of\nAMP is compared numerically to the widely used partial least squares (PLS) and\ncanonical correlation analysis (CCA) methods, which are both observed to suffer\nfrom a sub-optimal recovery threshold.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"e-Nc_vVTr-vk9uhQJQ23XA6efMgb8UATRjkTdQkpRhE","pdfSize":"1141268"}
