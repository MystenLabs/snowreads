  "abstract": "  It is well-known that the classical Schwarz lemma yields an explicit\ncomparison of two Hermitian metrics with uniform constant negative curvature\nbounds through holomorphic maps between complex manifolds. In this paper, we\nestablish Schwarz lemmas for holomorphic bundle maps between abstract Hermitian\nholomorphic vector bundles with various positive curvature bounds. As\napplications, we prove Schwarz lemmas for holomorphic maps between complex\nmanifolds whose curvature tensors are described by the notion\n``RC-positivity''. In particular, new diameter and volume comparison theorems\nare obtained by using Schwarz lemmas.\n",
