With a few exceptions, such estimates are asymptotically sharp. The\nform of these estimates varies according to $m$ lying in the central or\nnon-central regions of $\\{1,\\ldots ,n\\}$. In each case, we use a different\nprobabilistic representation of $S(n,m)$ in terms of well known random\nvariables to show the corresponding results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"j8vTBOWmx9Z-dtpMcPbmsN_OOeH3uHr_yC4HPBKXU7M","pdfSize":"205160"}
