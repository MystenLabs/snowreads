  "abstract": "  We report a novel nanoscale device concept based on a highly doped\n$\\delta$-layer tunnel junction embedded in a semiconductor for charge sensing.\nRecent advances in Atomic Precision Advanced Manufacturing (APAM) processes\nhave enabled the fabrication of devices based on quasi-2D, highly conductive,\nhighly doped regions in semiconductor materials. In this work, we demonstrate\nthat FET-based sensors utilizing APAM $\\delta$-layer tunnel junctions are\nultrasensitive to the presence of charges near the tunnel junction, allowing\nthe use of these devices for detecting charges by observing changes in the\nelectrical current. We demonstrate that these devices can enhance the\nsensitivity in the limit, i.e. for small concentrations of charges, exhibiting\nsignificantly superior sensitivity compared to traditional FET-based sensors.\nWe also propose that the extreme sensitivity arises from the strong\nquantization of the conduction band in these highly-confined systems.\n",
