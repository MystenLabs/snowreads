Especially for Mn-based compounds,\nthere exist only very limited materials that show superconductivity. Here, we\nreport the discovery of superconductivity up to 14.2 K in a Mn-based material\nMnB$_4$. By applying high pressures, we found the continuous suppression of a\nweak insulating behavior and the occurrence of superconductivity after about 30\nGPa. With further increasing pressure, $T_\\text{c}$ is gradually enhanced and\nreaches the maximum value of about 14.2 K at 150 GPa with a Fermi-Liquid\nbehavior in the normal states. The synchrotron X-ray diffraction data reveal\nthe unchanged monoclinic (S.G: $P2_1/c$) symmetry but an unusual crossover of\nthe lattice parameters $b$ and $c$. Theoretical calculations based on the\nelectron-phonon coupling picture reveal a very low $T_\\text{c}$ (less than 1\nK), manifesting an exotic pairing mechanism beyond the\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. Our findings show a promising way to\nexplore high $T_\\text{c}$ superconductivity by combining the 3d-transition\nmetal magnetic elements and light elements.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6LtcfDoAu_79n7ioibPbuoA1LkS2t2GCgj5MYNRrMU0","pdfSize":"3454641"}
