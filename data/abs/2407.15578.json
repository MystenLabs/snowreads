We also precisely characterize its topological\ncritical points and their indices, and relate them to the differential critical\npoints of the function.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4TolvZBIyDCRh5yrtku9wXLM1TCcIk0Jo22MxoKZ06g","pdfSize":"8118050"}
