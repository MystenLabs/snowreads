In these games, one player, the system, declares his strategy\nupfront, and the other players, composing the environment, then rationally\nrespond by playing strategies forming a subgame perfect equilibrium. We study\nthe complexity of the rational synthesis problem when the players have\n{\\omega}-regular objectives encoded as parity objectives. Our algorithm is\nbased on an encoding into a three-player game with imperfect information,\nshowing that the problem is in 2ExpTime. When the number of environment players\nis fixed, the problem is in ExpTime and is NP- and coNP-hard. Moreover, for a\nfixed number of players and reachability objectives, we get a polynomial\nalgorithm.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-0f5srVGhoeAjNsaG9FofnLwA2VWgFNrTgESZbScnXA","pdfSize":"630770"}
