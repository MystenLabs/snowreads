Previous work has proveided\nexplanations for the actions or states of agents, yet falls short in\nunderstanding the black-boxed agent's importance within a MAS and the overall\nteam strategy. To bridge this gap, we propose EMAI, a novel agent-level\nexplanation approach that evaluates the individual agent's importance. Inspired\nby counterfactual reasoning, a larger change in reward caused by the randomized\naction of agent indicates its higher importance. We model it as a MARL problem\nto capture interactions across agents. Utilizing counterfactual reasoning, EMAI\nlearns the masking agents to identify important agents. Specifically, we define\nthe optimization function to minimize the reward difference before and after\naction randomization and introduce sparsity constraints to encourage the\nexploration of more action randomization of agents during training. The\nexperimental results in seven multi-agent tasks demonstratee that EMAI achieves\nhigher fidelity in explanations than baselines and provides more effective\nguidance in practical applications concerning understanding policies, launching\nattacks, and patching policies.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"g7DNdiCP_uC9CVVy0QGJeDmeiNolKr-dsdG9j5dSVTE","pdfSize":"1985682"}
