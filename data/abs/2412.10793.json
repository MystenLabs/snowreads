  "abstract": "  We propose that the drastic photometric and spectroscopic changes affecting\nthe symbiotic star V694 Mon since 2018, are due to its transition from the\naccreting-only state to steady hydrogen-burning on the surface of the white\ndwarf, closely mimicking the pattern followed by V4368 Sgr. The phase of peak\noptical brightness and weakest emission lines has probably been reached in\nearly 2024. The high-velocity absorptions powered by jet-ejection and the wild\nflickering, which dominated the century-long quiescence, should not reappear as\nlong has nuclear burning will hold (time-scale of decades). The 3500 Lsun\nburning luminosity suggests a mass of 0.60 Msun for the WD.\n",
