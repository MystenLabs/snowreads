We study the flow of an incompressible\nNewtonian fluid which interacts with an elastic body: we consider an arbitrary\nLagrangian Eulerian formulation of the fluid problem and a fully Lagrangian\nformulation of the solid problem; we rely on a finite element discretization of\nboth fluid and solid equations. The distinctive feature of our approach is an\nimplicit coupling of fluid and structural problems that relies on the solution\nto a constrained optimization problem with equality constraints. We discuss the\napplication of projection-based model reduction to both fluid and solid\nsubproblems: we rely on Galerkin projection for the solid equations and on\nleast-square Petrov-Galerkin projection for the fluid equations. Numerical\nresults for three model problems illustrate the many features of the\nformulation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"E2-8iVs68kHJFQELpZhwFkHybG5XArWsm-Nca0WI5wc","pdfSize":"3849268"}
