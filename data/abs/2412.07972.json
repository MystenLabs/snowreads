Previous work shows that the phase where the relative probability\nbetween the modes is learned disappears as the dimension goes to infinity\nwithout an appropriate time schedule. We introduce a time dilation that solves\nthis problem. This enables us to characterize the learned velocity field,\nfinding a first phase where the probability of each mode is learned and a\nsecond phase where the variance of each mode is learned. We find that the\nautoencoder representing the velocity field learns to simplify by estimating\nonly the parameters relevant to each phase. Turning to real data, we propose a\nmethod that, for a given feature, finds intervals of time where training\nimproves accuracy the most on that feature. Since practitioners take a uniform\ndistribution over training times, our method enables more efficient training.\nWe provide preliminary experiments validating this approach.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XD-XXWU3b_05cUwp9w7niVJ2V7JnaxgNUlyrkHy8q5Q","pdfSize":"843356"}
