This scheme necessitates\nconsidering the bending energy of the finite cut-off surface. Following our\nproposal, one observes a perfect match between the actions of deformed theory\non the field theory and gravity sides.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"PJaluYQ_Le8TLZi8XZ1js_NITD8EVqULTCMTw5KSYl8","pdfSize":"148537"}
