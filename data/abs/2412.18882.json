Theoretical analysis reveals\nthat this can only be achieved when the success probability of the fusion gate\nsurpasses a specific percolation threshold of 58.98% by using three-photon GHZ\nstates as resource states. However, such an implementation of a fusion gate has\nnever been experimentally realized before. Here, we successfully demonstrate a\nboosted fusion gate with a theoretical success probability of 75%, using\ndeterministically generated auxiliary states. The success probability is\nexperimentally measured to be 71.0(7)%. We further demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the boosted fusion gate by fusing two Bell states with a\nfidelity of 67(2)%. Our work paves a crucial path toward scalable linear\noptical quantum computing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"x4M7ZL_uvbSOHzrwImMXq5Ev5tmR4sS1u8b282Ces-k","pdfSize":"3273650"}
