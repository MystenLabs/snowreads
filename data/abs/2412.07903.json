We begin by reviewing the derivation of the Madelung\nequations. Using the Madelung equations in conjunction with Poisson's equation,\nwe calculate the spectrum of magnetoplasmons and the magneto-optical\nconductivity in the electrostatic regime, incorporating nonlocal corrections\ndue to the Fermi pressure. In the absence of a magnetic field, we analyze\nnonlinear and nonlocal second-harmonic generation, demonstrating how plasmon\nexcitation enhances this process. We further discuss the emergence of\nself-modulation phenomena driven by nonlinearity, leading to the\nrenormalization of the plasmon dispersion. Notably, we show that nonlinearity\namplifies nonlocal effects and, leveraging the hydrodynamic formalism, derive a\nsimple analytic expression for the renormalized spectra.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fnobMRwX9wbDHuk5ljoz2ubuG5jDWPqEf_G_msdW8Rw","pdfSize":"2818666"}
