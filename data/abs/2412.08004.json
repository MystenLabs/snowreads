The diagonal line element is not $t$-$r$ symmetric, i.e. $g_{00} \\ne\n-1/g_{11}$, which leads to an interesting approach to resolving the classical\ncurvature singularity. In this paper, we show, in Schwarzschild coordinates,\nthe $r = 0$ coordinate location is a null surface which is not a transition\nsurface or leads to a black bounce. We find the expansion of null geodesic\ncongruences in the interior turn around then vanishes at $r = 0$, and the\nenergy conditions are predominately violated indicating a repulsive\ngravitational core. In addition, we show that the line element admits a\nwormhole solution which is not traversable, and the black hole at its vanishing\nhorizon radius could be interpreted as a remnant.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"61kSxdDl3eyJnl4JWdPs4ADTmGS3vrRRvEFrc7Ngc5U","pdfSize":"2747421"}
