  "abstract": "  With the ever-increasing volumes of the Earth observation data present in the\narchives of large programmes such as Copernicus, there is a growing need for\nefficient vector representations of the underlying raw data. The approach of\nextracting feature representations from pretrained deep neural networks is a\npowerful approach that can provide semantic abstractions of the input data.\nHowever, the way this is done for imagery archives containing geospatial data\nhas not yet been defined. In this work, an extension is proposed to an existing\ncommunity project, Major TOM, focused on the provision and standardization of\nopen and free AI-ready datasets for Earth observation. Furthermore, four global\nand dense embedding datasets are released openly and for free along with the\npublication of this manuscript, resulting in the most comprehensive global open\ndataset of geospatial visual embeddings in terms of covered Earth's surface.\n",
