At\nthe LHC, the CMS detector enables searches for these massive particles,\nidentifiable by their characteristic ionization patterns. Using data collected\nduring 2017-2018, we search for signals of anomalous ionization in the silicon\ntracker. We present a novel approach to background prediction, utilizing the\ndistinct ionization measurements of the silicon pixel and strip detectors as\nindependent variables. We interpret the results within several models including\nthose with staus, stops, gluinos, and multiply charged particles as well as a\nnew model with decays from a Z' boson\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LhkR73UkgtRw_YCMzqp9hpa5yzm8I0ggWcAz_Uh5noM","pdfSize":"4108356"}
