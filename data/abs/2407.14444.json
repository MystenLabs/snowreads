We obtain explicit formulae for solutions of these equations,\nfor any fixed order $n\\ge 3$, by studying a Riccati type equation associated\nwith the logarithmic derivative of a solution. Moreover, we provide sufficient\nconditions to ensure the existence of a fundamental system of solutions. The\nfixed point Banach argument allows us to find almost periodic and\nasymptotically almost periodic solutions to this Riccati type equation. A\ndecomposition property of the perturbations induces a decomposition on the\nRiccati type equation and its solutions. In particular, by using this\ndecomposition we obtain asymptotically almost periodic and also $p$-almost\nperiodic solutions to the Riccati type equation. We illustrate our results for\na third order linear differential equation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5ww5tmEp4r_CxIbGy9M8RBYnjf1iWvTqPk1kQ2L2d28","pdfSize":"355968","objectId":"0x18d169685f0bfd35be476f9f72b7e57c18ba24df173c6544c341c7aa8dc18630","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
