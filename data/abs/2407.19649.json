Following deposition, disordered multilayered islands are\nobserved. Annealing to 90$^{\\circ} \\rm{C}$ causes a transition from dewetting\nmulti-layered islands to a single wetting layer at sufficiently high coverage,\naccompanied by a change in the energy alignment between the C60F48 and the\ndiamond surface which consequently decreased the carrier density induced by\ntransfer doping by 20%.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7N5irDF3SW2pfI9vchjLb15MH6p2OC9rxSRAA0z76xo","pdfSize":"3971687","objectId":"0xacda6feeef906434cdf679900ee9ad82f3ff48d8a80d17fa4e7acc1da84d173e","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
