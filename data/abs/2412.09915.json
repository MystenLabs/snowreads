  "abstract": "  We consider two-dimensional $(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2)$-constacyclic codes over\n$\\mathbb{F}_{q}$ of area $M N$, where $q$ is some power of prime $p$ with\n$\\gcd(M,p)=1$ and $\\gcd(N,p)=1$. With the help of common zero (CZ) set, we\ncharacterize 2-D constacyclic codes. Further, we provide an algorithm to\nconstruct an ideal basis of these codes by using their essential common zero\n(ECZ) sets. We describe the dual of 2-D constacyclic codes. Finally, we provide\nan encoding scheme for generating 2-D constacyclic codes. We present an example\nto illustrate that 2-D constacyclic codes can have better minimum distance\ncompared to their cyclic counterparts with the same code size and code rate.\n",
