  "abstract": "  We present a new, cosmologically model-independent, statistical analysis of\nthe Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae spectroscopic dataset, improving a standard\nmethodology adopted by Lane et al. We use the Tripp equation for supernova\nstandardisation alone, thereby avoiding any potential correlation in the\nstretch and colour distributions. We compare the standard homogeneous\ncosmological model, i.e., $\\Lambda$CDM, and the timescape cosmology which\ninvokes backreaction of inhomogeneities. Timescape, while statistically\nhomogeneous and isotropic, departs from average\nFriedmann-Lema\\^{\\i}tre-Robertson-Walker evolution, and replaces dark energy by\nkinetic gravitational energy and its gradients, in explaining independent\ncosmological observations. When considering the entire Pantheon+ sample, we\nfind very strong evidence ($\\ln B> 5$) in favour of timescape over\n$\\Lambda$CDM. Furthermore, even restricting the sample to redshifts beyond any\nconventional scale of statistical homogeneity, $z > 0.075$, timescape is\npreferred over $\\Lambda$CDM with $\\ln B> 1$. These results provide evidence for\na need to revisit the foundations of theoretical and observational cosmology.\n",
