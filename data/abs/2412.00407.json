We have developed a variational quantum algorithm that is capable of\nsimulating non-Markovian quantum dynamics. The algorithm captures the\nnon-Markovian effect by employing the Ehrenfect trajectories in the path\nintegral formulation and the Monte Carlo sampling of the thermal distribution.\nWe tested the algorithm with the spin-boson model on the quantum simulator and\nthe results match well with the exact ones. The algorithm naturally fits into\nthe parallel computing platform of the NISQ devices and is well suited for\nanharmonic system-bath interactions and multi-state systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gvkT6jgp5_jvxWFn3_jRTNKWWHcoXz-pSZ0Y18-xMoE","pdfSize":"710804"}
