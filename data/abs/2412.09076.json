Nevertheless,\nrecent theoretical and experimental inquiries have revealed the emergence of\nenergy dissipation in precisely quantized electrical transport. Here, we\npresent a criterion for the realization of truly no-dissipation design,\ncharacterized as $N_{in}=N_{tunl}+N_{bs}$, where $N_{in}$, $N_{tunl}$, and\n$N_{bs}$ represent the number of modes participating in injecting, tunneling,\nand backscattering processes, respectively. The key lies in matching the number\nof injecting, tunneling and backscattering modes, ensuring the equilibrium\namong all engaged modes inside the device. Among all the topological materials,\nwe advocate for the indispensability of Chern insulators exhibiting higher\nChern numbers to achieve functional devices and uphold the no-dissipation rule\nsimultaneously. Furthermore, we design the topological current divider and\ncollector, evading dissipation upon fulfilling the established criterion. Our\nwork paves the path for developing the prospective topotronics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CGZUX2nQlEmCro_DMl-sRBNQCgxZ4G1RDdNYeKZzmNo","pdfSize":"2210531"}
