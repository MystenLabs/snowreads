  "abstract": "  The physical coupling between robots has the potential to improve the\ncapabilities of multi-robot systems in challenging manufacturing processes.\nHowever, the path tracking accuracy of physically coupled robots is not studied\nadequately, especially considering the uncertain kinematic parameters, the\nmechanical elasticity, and the built-in controllers of off-the-shelf robots.\nThis paper addresses these issues with a novel differential-algebraic system\nmodel which is verified against measurement data from real execution. The\nuncertain kinematic parameters are estimated online to adapt the model.\nConsequently, an adaptive model predictive controller is designed as a\ncoordinator between the robots. The controller achieves a path tracking error\nreduction of 88.6% compared to the state-of-the-art benchmark in the\nsimulation.\n",
