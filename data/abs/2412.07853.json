Henning, co-PI: I. Kamp) are\npresented for several disks around T Tauri and lower-mass stars. A large\ndiversity in spectra is found. Some disks are very rich in H2O lines whereas\nother disks show prominent CO2. The spectra of disks around very low-mass stars\n(<0.3 MSun, late-M type stars like Trappist-1) are dominated by C2H2 and other\nhydrocarbon features including those of benzene, suggesting volatile C/O>1.\nTogether these data point to a rich chemistry in the inner regions that is\nlinked to the physical structure of these disks (e.g., dust traps) and that may\nbe affected by processes such as radial drift of icy pebbles from the outer to\nthe inner disk.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"o7r1Kxrap7cMk8ZEq0UGsgrmKkFVBVnIWagPsJdvy2M","pdfSize":"668141"}
