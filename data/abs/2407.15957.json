While there have been many studies\nevaluating the result of this change, there has been no rigorous examination of\ndisclosure risk claims resulting from the released 2010 tabular data. In this\nstudy we perform such an evaluation. We show that the procedures used to\nevaluate disclosure risk are unreliable and resulted in inflated disclosure\nrisk. Demonstration data products released using the new procedure were also\nshown to have poor utility. However, since the Census Bureau had already\ncommitted to a different procedure, they had no option except to escalate their\ncommitment. The result of such escalation is that the 2020 tabular data release\noffers neither privacy nor accuracy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"h-I0Opq5Zuf1R0SmDGa2tlxuCnf4MYG00Wtf1k9CJGc","pdfSize":"237414"}
