We perform\nstatistical tests on the tracer population in order to assess both the\nmagnitude and the main features of transport. The role of other physical\nproperties, such as viscosity and inverse energy cascade in the spectrum, is\nalso considered. We outline that large scale eddies are responsible for greater\ntransport coefficients, while the presence of an X-point magnetic field reduces\nthe mean free path of the particles, however generating a larger outliers\npopulation with respect to a Gaussian profile.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zXkc56NwZlDguPTC_uNJivbCB5wtvUzKJcu0gqpGmL8","pdfSize":"1382698"}
