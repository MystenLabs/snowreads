  "abstract": "  Capability evaluations play a critical role in ensuring the safe deployment\nof frontier AI systems, but this role may be undermined by intentional\nunderperformance or ``sandbagging.'' We present a novel model-agnostic method\nfor detecting sandbagging behavior using noise injection. Our approach is\nfounded on the observation that introducing Gaussian noise into the weights of\nmodels either prompted or fine-tuned to sandbag can considerably improve their\nperformance. We test this technique across a range of model sizes and\nmultiple-choice question benchmarks (MMLU, AI2, WMDP). Our results demonstrate\nthat noise injected sandbagging models show performance improvements compared\nto standard models. Leveraging this effect, we develop a classifier that\nconsistently identifies sandbagging behavior. Our unsupervised technique can be\nimmediately implemented by frontier labs or regulatory bodies with access to\nweights to improve the trustworthiness of capability evaluations.\n",
