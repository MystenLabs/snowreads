A sign pattern matrix A is\nsaid to require a property if all matrices having sign pattern as A have that\nproperty. In this paper, we characterize all sign pattern matrices associated\nwith cycle graphs having only negative 2-cycles that require algebraic\npositivity. We also give some necessary conditions for a sign pattern matrix to\nrequire algebraic positivity, and some sufficient conditions for a sign pattern\nmatrix with cycle graph to require algebraic positivity. Finally, we describe\nall 4-by-4 sign pattern matrices associated with cycle graphs that require\nalgebraic positivity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gmNMs4J-d0oplkI7Zlfjz3_dDE7X9VbIbAzaPgb_PUQ","pdfSize":"195804"}
