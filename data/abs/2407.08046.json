In order to\nachieve sub ms precision, NEID has strict requirements on survey efficiency,\nstellar image positioning, and guiding performance, which have exceeded the\nnative capabilities of the telescope's original pointing and tracking system.\nIn order to improve the operational efficiency of the telescope we have\ndeveloped a novel telescope pointing system, built on a recurrent neural\nnetwork, that does not rely on the usual pointing models (TPoint or other quasi\nphysical bases). We discuss the development of this system, how the intrinsic\nproperties of the pointing problem inform our network design, and show\npreliminary results from our best models. We also discuss plans for the\ngeneralization of this framework, so that it can be applied at other sites.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"QvH2BonUkhB1lnOkq1DxrNGWCg7OgazSpHGOejsmlLw","pdfSize":"811514"}
