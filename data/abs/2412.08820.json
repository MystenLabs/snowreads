  "abstract": "  This paper studies the estimation of large precision matrices and Cholesky\nfactors obtained by observing a Gaussian process at many locations. Under\ngeneral assumptions on the precision and the observations, we show that the\nsample complexity scales poly-logarithmically with the size of the precision\nmatrix and its Cholesky factor. The key challenge in these estimation tasks is\nthe polynomial growth of the condition number of the target matrices with their\nsize. For precision estimation, our theory hinges on an intuitive local\nregression technique on the lattice graph which exploits the approximate\nsparsity implied by the screening effect. For Cholesky factor estimation, we\nleverage a block-Cholesky decomposition recently used to establish complexity\nbounds for sparse Cholesky factorization.\n",
