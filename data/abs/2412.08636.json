  "abstract": "  In 2001, de Oliveira, Katzarkov, and Ramachandran conjectured that the\nproperty of smooth projective varieties having big fundamental groups is stable\nunder small deformations. This conjecture was proven by Beno\\^it Claudon in\n2010 for surfaces and for threefolds under suitable assumptions. In this paper,\nwe prove this conjecture for smooth projective varieties admitting a big\ncomplex local system. Moreover, we address a more general conjecture by Campana\nand Claudon concerning the deformation invariance of the \\(\\Gamma\\)-dimension\nof projective varieties. As an application, we establish the deformation\nopenness of pseudo-Brody hyperbolicity for projective varieties endowed with a\nbig and semisimple complex local system. To achieve these results, we develop\nthe deformation regularity of equivariant pluriharmonic maps into Euclidean\nbuildings and Riemannian symmetric spaces in families, along with techniques\nfrom the reductive and linear Shafarevich conjectures.\n",
