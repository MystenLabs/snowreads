Our result implies that information loss\nexperienced by a black hole during Hawking evaporation takes place as\nefficiently as possible. We also extend the analysis to the case of Barrow\nentropy as a phenomenological realization of a fractal event horizon, where the\nLandauer Principle informs amongst different options for the black hole\ntemperature. To our knowledge, this work is the first identification of the two\nresults as expressions of the same process.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"eMGEOtAjJ6njIlnCc4q7FJa11wcscH4gFPbaEQZeqPI","pdfSize":"128101"}
