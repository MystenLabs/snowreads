  "abstract": "  We prove that stable subgroups of Morse local-to-global groups exhibit a\ngrowth gap. That is, the growth rate of an infinite-index stable subgroup is\nstrictly less than the growth rate of the ambient Morse local-to-global group.\nThis generalizes a result of Cordes, Russell, Spriano, and Zalloum in the sense\nthat we removed the additional torsion-free or residually finite assumptions.\nThe Morse local-to-global groups are a very broad class of groups, including\nmapping class groups, CAT(0) groups, closed $3$-manifold groups, certain\nrelatively hyperbolic groups, virtually solvable groups, etc.\n",
