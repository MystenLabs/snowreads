  "abstract": "  The paper considers a Constrained-Informed Neural Network (CINN)\napproximation for the Time Shift Governor (TSG), which is an add-on scheme to\nthe nominal closed-loop system used to enforce constraints by time-shifting the\nreference trajectory in spacecraft rendezvous applications. We incorporate\nKolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), an emerging architecture in the AI\ncommunity, as a fundamental component of CINN and propose a\nConstrained-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CIKAN)-based approximation for\nTSG. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the CIKAN-based TSG through\nsimulations of constrained spacecraft rendezvous missions on highly elliptic\norbits and present comparisons between CIKANs, MLP-based CINNs, and the\nconventional TSG.\n",
