  "abstract": "  While dealing with the J-Matrix method for the harmonic oscillator to write\ndown its tridiagonal matrix representation in an orthonormal basis of L2(R); we\nrederive a set of generalized coherent states (GCS) of Perelomov type labeled\nby points z of the complex plane C and depending on a positive integer number m\nThe number states expansion of these GCS gives rise to coefficients that are\ncomplex Hermite polynomials whose linear superpositions provide eigenfunctions\nfor the two-dimensional magnetic Laplacian associated with the mth Landau\nlevel. We extend this procedure to the Morse oscillator by constructing a new\nset of GCS of Glauber type.\n",
