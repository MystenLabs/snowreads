When\n$n\\leq 21$, our bounds match the best known lower bounds, and we fully\nenumerate the densest unit-distance graphs in these cases.\n  On the combinatorial side, our principle technique is to more efficiently\ngenerate $\\mathcal{F}$-free graphs for a set of forbidden subgraphs\n$\\mathcal{F}$. On the algebraic side, we are able to determine programmatically\nwhether many graphs are unit-distance, using a custom embedder that is more\nefficient in practice than tools such as cylindrical algebraic decomposition.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"abNo_bb8UuoSmGTOBWoMmZzX9R_KTiEqOqgpueTUzyk","pdfSize":"484665"}
