  "abstract": "  Three-Dimensional Polarized Light Imaging (3D-PLI) and Computational\nScattered Light Imaging (ComSLI) map dense nerve fibers in brain sections with\nmicrometer resolution using visible light. 3D-PLI reconstructs single fiber\norientations, while ComSLI captures multiple directions per pixel, offering\ndeep insights into brain tissue structure. Here, we introduce the Scattering\nPolarimeter, a high-speed correlative microscope to leverage the strengths of\nboth methods. Based on a M\\\"uller polarimeter, it incorporates variable\nretarders and a large-area light source for direct and oblique illumination,\nenabling rapid 3D-PLI and ComSLI measurements as well as measuring the M\\\"uller\nmatrix per pixel. Applied to human and vervet monkey brain sections, the\nScattering Polarimeter generates results comparable to state-of-the-art 3D-PLI\nand ComSLI setups and creates a multi-modal fiber direction map, integrating\nthe robust fiber orientations obtained from 3D-PLI with fiber crossings from\nComSLI. Furthermore, we discuss applications of the Scattering Polarimeter for\nunprecedented correlative and multi-modal brain imaging.\n",
