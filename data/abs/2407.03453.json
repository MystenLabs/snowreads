{"id":"2407.03453","title":"On Large Language Models in National Security Applications","authors":"William N. Caballero and Phillip R. Jenkins","authorsParsed":[["Caballero","William N.",""],["Jenkins","Phillip R.",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2024 18:53:22 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-08","timestamp":1720032802000,"abstract":"  The overwhelming success of GPT-4 in early 2023 highlighted the\ntransformative potential of large language models (LLMs) across various\nsectors, including national security. This article explores the implications of\nLLM integration within national security contexts, analyzing their potential to\nrevolutionize information processing, decision-making, and operational\nefficiency. Whereas LLMs offer substantial benefits, such as automating tasks\nand enhancing data analysis, they also pose significant risks, including\nhallucinations, data privacy concerns, and vulnerability to adversarial\nattacks. Through their coupling with decision-theoretic principles and Bayesian\nreasoning, LLMs can significantly improve decision-making processes within\nnational security organizations. Namely, LLMs can facilitate the transition\nfrom data to actionable decisions, enabling decision-makers to quickly receive\nand distill available information with less manpower. Current applications\nwithin the US Department of Defense and beyond are explored, e.g., the USAF's\nuse of LLMs for wargaming and automatic summarization, that illustrate their\npotential to streamline operations and support decision-making. However, these\napplications necessitate rigorous safeguards to ensure accuracy and\nreliability. The broader implications of LLM integration extend to strategic\nplanning, international relations, and the broader geopolitical landscape, with\nadversarial nations leveraging LLMs for disinformation and cyber operations,\nemphasizing the need for robust countermeasures. Despite exhibiting \"sparks\" of\nartificial general intelligence, LLMs are best suited for supporting roles\nrather than leading strategic decisions. Their use in training and wargaming\ncan provide valuable insights and personalized learning experiences for\nmilitary personnel, thereby improving operational readiness.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"U-tji9qd3sX62_l4EHaJYjLUMnDUu0RFEz8h3EnxFPY","pdfSize":"304830"}
