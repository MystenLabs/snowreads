A\n$\\mathcal{C}$-semigroup $S$ is $k$-positioned if for every $h\\in\n\\mathcal{C}\\setminus S$ we have that $k-h$ belongs to $S$. In this work, we\nfocus on this family of semigroups and introduce primary positioned\n$\\mathcal{C}$-semigroups, characterizing a subfamily of them through the\nperspective of irreducibility. Furthermore, we provide some procedures to\ncompute all such semigroups, describing a family of graphs containing all the\nprimary positioned $\\mathcal{C}$-semigroups for a fixed $k\\in \\mathcal{C}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"pfn-acbKQKkkM-8uK0GQu3DBoQbXC2acfnpc2nKiynE","pdfSize":"646701"}
