Using idealized mock observations of galaxy clusters from the\nMillenniumTNG simulation, we train a machine learning model to estimate the\nmass accretion rate. The model constrains 68% of the mass accretion rates of\nthe clusters in our dataset to within 33% of the true value without significant\nbias, a ~58% reduction in the scatter over existing constraints. We demonstrate\nthat the model uses information from both radial surface brightness density\nprofiles and asymmetries.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kJz2JOX1HjSeT4XPEnkK81ZR81gstZzbegdYWK_l29M","pdfSize":"6581320"}
