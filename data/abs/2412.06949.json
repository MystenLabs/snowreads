We introduce Reddit-ML32M, a\ndataset that links Reddit conversations with interactions on MovieLens 32M, to\nenrich item representations by leveraging collaborative knowledge and\naddressing interaction sparsity in conversational datasets. We propose an\nLLM-based framework that uses Reddit-ML32M to align LLM-generated\nrecommendations with CF embeddings, refining rankings for better performance.\nWe evaluate our framework against three sets of baselines: CF-based\nrecommenders using only interactions from CRS tasks, traditional CRS models,\nand LLM-based methods relying on conversational context without item\nrepresentations. Our approach achieves consistent improvements, including a\n12.32% increase in Hit Rate and a 9.9% improvement in NDCG, outperforming the\nbest-performing baseline that relies on conversational context but lacks\ncollaborative item representations.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Information Retrieval","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QhEl1Cr_2WUBRm8W6StijdN0QkFebG7kJpBeeralDaY","pdfSize":"1039756"}
