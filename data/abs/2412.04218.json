The\naxion dark matter emitted from cosmic strings after the Peccei-Quinn (PQ)\nsymmetry breaking in the early Universe was extensively simulated. In this\nwork, we study dark matter and gravitational waves through the lattice\nsimulation of the Axion-Higgs string. We gave the dark matter overproduction\nand the Big Bang nucleosynthesis bounds on the axion decay constant $f_a$ and\nthe axion mass $m_a$ for axion-like particles, and found that the predicted\ngravitational wave spectra cannot be probed by the dataset of the current\npulsar timing array experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6AWT5zp2btTbs53QSrJv1zZckS29m8cKpqZd8N4aEok","pdfSize":"2496251"}
