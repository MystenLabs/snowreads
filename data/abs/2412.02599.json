  "abstract": "  The discovery of the kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ sparked broad interest, due\nto the coexistence of a charge density wave (CDW) phase and possible\nunconventional superconductivity in the material. In this study, we use\nlow-energy electron diffraction (LEED) with a $\\mu$m-sized electron beam to\nexplore the periodic lattice distortion at the antimony-terminated surface in\nthe CDW phase. We recorded high-quality backscattering diffraction patterns in\nultrahigh vacuum from multiple cleaved samples. Unexpectedly, we did not find\nsuperstructure reflexes at intensity levels predicted from dynamical LEED\ncalculations for the reported $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ bulk structure. Our results\nsuggest that in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ the periodic lattice distortion accompanying the\nCDW is less pronounced at Sb-terminated surfaces than in the bulk.\n",
