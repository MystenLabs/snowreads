Theoretical formulas are proposed to\ndescribe the electromagnetic tensors of a corresponding uniaxial effective\nmedium with dielectric and magnetic responses. In addition, this work employs\ntheoretical analysis and numerical simulations to examine the interaction\nbetween the metamaterial and electromagnetic waves across a broad spectral\nrange. Band diagrams and isofrequency contours show good agreement between\ntheoretical and numerical results for low frequencies and certain directions of\npropagation at higher frequencies. The ease of designing the metamaterial\nstructure for various applications is facilitated by the derived theoretical\nformulas, which enable accurate prediction of the electromagnetic response\nacross a wide range of frequencies based on geometric parameters.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"R2wG7YfwyluOKXHfQxAdGunLv-Wh7vBVGkCGStMA38Q","pdfSize":"3658021","objectId":"0x72ced17a98f291543ea2aff042d68a2198eb1883b311f79b2ac511a0b7cec21b","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
