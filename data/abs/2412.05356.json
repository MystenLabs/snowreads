A population of these stars\nwas recently observed for the first time, but their prevalence remains unknown.\nIn preparation for such measurements, we estimate the mass distribution of hot,\nstripped stars using a population synthesis code that interpolates over\ndetailed single and binary stellar evolution tracks. We predict that for a\nconstant star-formation rate of $1 \\,M_\\odot$/yr and regardless of metallicity,\na population contains $\\sim$30,000 stripped stars with mass $M_{\\rm\nstrip}>1M_\\odot$ and $\\sim$4,000 stripped stars that are sufficiently massive\nto explode ($M_{\\rm strip}>2.6M_\\odot$). Below $M_{\\rm strip}=5M_\\odot$, the\ndistribution is metallicity-independent and can be described by a power law\nwith the exponent $\\alpha \\sim -2$. At higher masses and lower metallicity ($Z\n\\lesssim 0.002$), the mass distribution exhibits a drop. This originates from\nthe prediction, frequently seen in evolutionary models, that massive\nlow-metallicity stars do not expand substantially until central helium burning\nor later and therefore cannot form long-lived stripped stars. With weaker\nline-driven winds at low metallicity, this suggests that neither binary\ninteraction nor wind mass loss can efficiently strip massive stars at low\nmetallicity. As a result, a \"helium-star desert\" emerges around $M_{\\rm strip}\n=15\\, M_\\odot$ at $Z=0.002$, covering an increasingly large mass range with\ndecreasing metallicity. We note that these high-mass stars are those that\npotentially boost a galaxy's He$^+$-ionizing radiation and that participate in\nthe formation of merging black holes. This \"helium-star desert\" therefore\nmerits further study.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mGnkXB8_kSc1oDxvp-r4a7eJydPVIpxtSzy8px4mst8","pdfSize":"4740021"}
