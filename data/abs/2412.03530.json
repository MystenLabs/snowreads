  "abstract": "  Energy dissipation in collisionless shocks is a key mechanism in various\nastrophysical environments. Its non-linear nature complicates analytical\nunderstanding and necessitate Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations. This study\nexamines the impact of reducing the ion-to-electron mass ratio ($m_r$), to\ndecrease computational cost, on energy partitioning in 1D3V (one spatial and\nthree velocity-space dimensions) PIC simulations of strong, non-relativistic,\nparallel electron-ion collisionless shocks using the SHARP code. We compare\nsimulations with a reduced mass ratio ($m_r = 100$) to those with a realistic\nmass ratio ($m_r = 1836$) for shocks with high ($\\mathcal{M}_A = 21.3$) and low\n($\\mathcal{M}_A = 5.3$) Alfv$\\acute{\\text{e}}$n Mach numbers. Our findings show\nthat the mass ratio significantly affects particle acceleration and thermal\nenergy dissipation. At high $\\mathcal{M}_A$, a reduced mass ratio leads to more\nefficient electron acceleration and an unrealistically high ion flux at higher\nmomentum. At low $\\mathcal{M}_A$, it causes complete suppression of electron\nacceleration, whereas the realistic mass ratio enables efficient electron\nacceleration. The reduced mass ratio also results in excessive electron heating\nand lower heating in downstream ions at both Mach numbers, with slightly more\nmagnetic field amplification at low $\\mathcal{M}_A$. Consequently, the\nelectron-to-ion temperature ratio is high at low $\\mathcal{M}_A$ due to reduced\nion heating and remains high at high $\\mathcal{M}_A$ due to increased electron\nheating. In contrast, simulations with the realistic $m_r$ show that the\nion-to-electron temperature ratio is independent of the upstream magnetic\nfield, a result not observed in reduced $m_r$ simulations.\n",
