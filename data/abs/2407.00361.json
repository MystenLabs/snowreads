RICHES offers an alternative to conventional RAG systems by\neliminating the need for separate retriever and generator. It retrieves\ndocuments by directly decoding their contents, constrained on the corpus.\nUnifying retrieval with generation allows us to adapt to diverse new tasks via\nprompting alone. RICHES can work with any Instruction-tuned model, without\nadditional training. It provides attributed evidence, supports multi-hop\nretrievals and interleaves thoughts to plan on what to retrieve next, all\nwithin a single decoding pass of the LLM. We demonstrate the strong performance\nof RICHES across ODQA tasks including attributed and multi-hop QA.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"J3oC5OlJpLYeJSYc-imC2Nqein64CCRPNMg5_TdrJ40","pdfSize":"528328","objectId":"0x874709d4d5d2582ba1498fd6f801c7699ece962f01ee1d4ed69ca57894608492","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
