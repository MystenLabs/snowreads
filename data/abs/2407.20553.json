However, existing methods often struggle to generate accurate\nand consistent counterfactuals, particularly when the causal relationships are\ncomplex. We propose a novel framework that incorporates causal mechanisms and\ndiffusion models to generate high-quality counterfactual samples guided by\ncausal representation. Our approach introduces a novel, theoretically grounded\ntraining and sampling process that enables the model to consistently generate\naccurate counterfactual high-dimensional data under multiple intervention\nsteps. Experimental results on various synthetic and real benchmarks\ndemonstrate the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in\ngenerating accurate and high-quality counterfactuals, using different\nevaluation metrics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VRBAvT-2JuPCNyMd8YK8fo4dqPXKIeHTUDKaObde9Ts","pdfSize":"12176936"}
