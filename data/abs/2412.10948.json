  "abstract": "  We introduce the diffusion model as a method to generate new samples.\nGenerative models have been recently adopted for tasks such as art generation\n(Stable Diffusion, Dall-E) and text generation (ChatGPT). Diffusion models in\nparticular apply noise to sample data and then \"reverse\" this noising process\nto generate new samples. We will formally define the noising and denoising\nprocesses, then introduce algorithms to train and generate with a diffusion\nmodel. Finally, we will explore a potential application of diffusion models in\nimproving classifier performance on imbalanced data.\n",
