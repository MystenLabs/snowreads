We\nobtain the unified expression of the Teukolsky-like master equations and the\ncorresponding radial equations with various spins. We find that taking the\nseparable gauge introduced in previous study simplifies the unified form. We\nalso discuss the structure of the radial equation as an ordinary differential\nequation, such as the existence of the regular and the irregular singularities\nof the equation and the behavior of the solution around each singularity.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3lKEvRJsMBOq2kF0QIemt48ulrWf9LlXAOfJB5v2CYI","pdfSize":"223025"}
