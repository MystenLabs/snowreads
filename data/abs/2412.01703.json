Traditional Filtered Back\nProjection algorithm reconstructions suffer from severe artifacts due to sparse\ndata. In contrast, Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (MBIR) algorithms,\nthough better at mitigating noise through regularization, are too\ncomputationally costly for clinical use. This paper introduces a novel\ntechnique, denoted as the Deep Guess acceleration scheme, using a trained\nneural network both to quicken the regularized MBIR and to enhance the\nreconstruction accuracy. We integrate state-of-the-art deep learning tools to\ninitialize a clever starting guess for a proximal algorithm solving a\nnon-convex model and thus computing an interpretable solution image in a few\niterations. Experimental results on real CT images demonstrate the Deep Guess\neffectiveness in (very) sparse tomographic protocols, where it overcomes its\nmere variational counterpart and many data-driven approaches at the state of\nthe art. We also consider a ground truth-free implementation and test the\nrobustness of the proposed framework to noise.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VVkuRnmG1gAgGf9UgjclNRouaNtfxfo4UnC6blMp_Jo","pdfSize":"5157877"}
