  "abstract": "  We consider fairly general class of dynamical systems under the assumptions\nguaranteeing the existence of Lyapunov function around some nontrivial\nstationary point. Moreover, the existence of heteroclinic trajectory is proved\nmotivated by integrated densities approach to some astrophysical models of\nself-gravitating particles both in relativistic and non--relativistic\nframeworks. Finally, with the aid of geometric and topological reasoning we\nfind the upper bounds for this trajectory yielding the critical mass--radius\ntheorem for the astrophysical model.\n",
