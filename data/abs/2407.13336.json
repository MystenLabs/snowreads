The Black 0-Brane admits a dual Gauge\ntheory description in terms of the Matrix model for M-Theory, named BFSS\ntheory, which is the theory of open strings on a collection of N D0-branes.\nRecent studies of the model have highlighted a mechanism of Black Hole\nevaporation for this system, based on the chaotic nature of the theory and the\nexistence of flat directions. This paper further explores this idea, through\nthe computation of the von Neumann entropy of Hawking radiation. In particular,\nwe show that the expected Page curve is indeed reproduced, consistently with a\ncomplete recovery of information after the Black Hole has fully evaporated. A\npivotal step in the computation is the definition of a Hilbert space which\nallows for a quantum mechanical description of partially evaporated Black\nHoles. We find that the entanglement entropy depends on the choice of a\nparameter, which can be interpreted as summarizing the geometric features of\nthe Black Hole, such as the size of the resolved singularity and the size of\nthe horizon.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"q5b0HsSCdVUycRx7_Afpxra_EZrc2YQYHCNl7eubt88","pdfSize":"543249"}
