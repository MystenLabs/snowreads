  "abstract": "  During its thirty years of existence, the World Wide Web has helped to\ntransform the world and create digital economies. Although it started as a\nglobal information exchange, it has become the most significant available\napplication platform on top of its initial target. One of the side effects of\nthis evolution was perhaps suboptimal ways to deliver content over the web,\nleading to wasted resources and business through lost conversions. Technically\nspeaking, there are many ways to improve the performance of web applications.\nIn this article, we examine the currently available options and the latest\ntrends related to improving web application performance.\n",
