As a side effect, however, the\nnetworks can disseminate fake news that harms individuals and the society.\nSeveral methods have been developed to detect fake news, but the majority\nrequire large sets of manually labeled data to attain the application-level\naccuracy. Due to the strict privacy policies, the required data are often\ninaccessible or limited to some specific topics. On the other side, quite\ndiverse and abundant unlabeled data on social media suggests that with a few\nlabeled data, the problem of detecting fake news could be tackled via\nsemi-supervised learning. Here, we propose a semi-supervised self-learning\nmethod in which a sentiment analysis is acquired by some state-of-the-art\npretrained models. Our learning model is trained in a semi-supervised fashion\nand incorporates LSTM with self-attention layers. We benchmark our model on a\ndataset with 20,000 news content along with their feedback, which shows better\nperformance in precision, recall, and measures compared to competitive methods\nin fake news detection.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"z0TULeqYUOFMr9z24NNdVXQuu-5M9GmTFW8UtY_O6FM","pdfSize":"1232017"}
