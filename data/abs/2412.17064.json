  "abstract": "  Parametric oscillations of an interface separating two fluid phases create\nnonlinear surface waves, called Faraday waves, which organise into simple\npatterns, like squares and hexagons, as well as complex structures, such as\ndouble hexagonal and superlattice patterns. In this work, we study the\ninfluence of surfactant-induced Marangoni stresses on the formation and\ntransition of Faraday wave patterns. We use a quantity $B$, that assesses the\nrelative importance of Marangoni stresses as compared to the the surface wave\ndynamics. Our results show that the threshold acceleration required to\ndestabilise a surfactant-covered interface through vibration increases with\nincreasing $B$. For a surfactant-free interface, a square wave pattern is\nobserved. As $B$ is incremented, we report transitions from squares to\nasymmetric squares, weakly wavy stripes, and ultimately to ridges and hills.\nThese hills are a consequence of the bi-directional Marangoni stresses at the\nneck of the ridges. The mechanisms underlying the pattern transitions and the\nformation of exotic ridges and hills are discussed.\n",
