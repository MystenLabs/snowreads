We show that the set\n$$\\mathop \\bigcap_{p\\in 2\\Z+1}\\left\\{\\Lambda\\subset \\R: \\text{$E(\\Lambda)$ and\n$E(p\\Lambda)$ are Fourier bases for $L^2(\\mu_4)$}\\right\\}$$ has the cardinality\nof the continuum. We also give other characterizations on the orthonormal set\nof exponential functions being a basis for the space $L^2(\\mu_4)$ from the\nviewpoint of measure and dimension. Moreover, we provide a method of\nconstructing explicit discrete set $\\Lambda$ such that $E(\\Lambda)$ and its all\nodd scaling sets $E(\\Lambda),p\\in2\\Z+1,$ are still Fourier bases for\n$L^2(\\mu_4)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wAWvmqz6iP-QbXwvhnQhhpduplyOuH_zWBUSQAZkrgs","pdfSize":"337577","objectId":"0x585de4161e98f674e41e9d9d3358724d69a7593d3fe20eeb587b532bb1c721a3","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
