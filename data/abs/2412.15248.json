  "abstract": "  Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology has revolutionized the\ndigitization of printed text, enabling efficient data extraction and analysis\nacross various domains. Just like Machine Translation systems, OCR systems are\nprone to errors. In this work, we address the challenge of data generation and\npost-OCR error correction, specifically for low-resource languages. We propose\nan approach for synthetic data generation for Devanagari languages,\nRoundTripOCR, that tackles the scarcity of the post-OCR Error Correction\ndatasets for low-resource languages. We release post-OCR text correction\ndatasets for Hindi, Marathi, Bodo, Nepali, Konkani and Sanskrit. We also\npresent a novel approach for OCR error correction by leveraging techniques from\nmachine translation. Our method involves translating erroneous OCR output into\na corrected form by treating the OCR errors as mistranslations in a parallel\ntext corpus, employing pre-trained transformer models to learn the mapping from\nerroneous to correct text pairs, effectively correcting OCR errors.\n",
