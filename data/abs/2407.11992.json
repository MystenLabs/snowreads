This paper examined our capacity to assess the relationship between\ntwo data variables when presented through visual or auditory scatterplots.\nTwenty-seven years later, we have replicated the first part of this influential\nstudy and present the preliminary findings of our replication, initially\ninvolving 21 participants. In addition to purely auditory and visual\nscatterplots, we introduced audiovisual scatterplots as a third condition in\nour experiment. Our initial findings mirror those of Flowers et al.'s original\nresearch. With this extended abstract, we also aim to spark a discussion about\nthe significance of replication studies for our research community in general.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Graphics","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"snxZgG3F0DLA3Oez74UE76NSt76AiYk-aU0MliC8FCQ","pdfSize":"254061"}
