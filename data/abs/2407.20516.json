Their\nremarkable performance should be attributed to massive training data and\nemergent reasoning abilities. However, the models would memorize and generate\nsensitive, biased, or dangerous information originated from the training data\nespecially those from web crawl. New machine unlearning (MU) techniques are\nbeing developed to reduce or eliminate undesirable knowledge and its effects\nfrom the models, because those that were designed for traditional\nclassification tasks could not be applied for Generative AI. We offer a\ncomprehensive survey on many things about MU in Generative AI, such as a new\nproblem formulation, evaluation methods, and a structured discussion on the\nadvantages and limitations of different kinds of MU techniques. It also\npresents several critical challenges and promising directions in MU research.
