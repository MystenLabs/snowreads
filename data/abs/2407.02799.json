We show theoretically that the\nnon-linearities, specifically four-magnon scatterings, reduce the equilibrium\nfluctuation amplitude of the magnetization as well as the switching frequencies\nbetween local minima via the decay of the homogeneous Kittel mode into two spin\nwaves with opposite momenta. Selectively suppressing the effective temperature\nof the finite-k spin waves, or reducing the radius of a thin magnetic disk\nenhance the switching frequency and improve performance of magnetic tunnel\njunctions in probabilistic computing applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"o4suTGdf-36ck18RdBEXC8lktvxdlkgIs1xMmmdFPLM","pdfSize":"2071212","objectId":"0x796dfbbea83eb7e4bcf9f38ea036bb24a4083b436d474e2881e7562160e0bc8a","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
