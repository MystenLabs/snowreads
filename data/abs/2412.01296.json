To reduce manual effort, image\nclustering can significantly speed up the annotation process. In this work, we\nphrase the clustering task as a Minimum Cost Multicut Problem [MP]. Solutions\nto the MP have been shown to provide clusterings that maximize the posterior\nprobability, solely from provided local, pairwise probabilities of two images\nbelonging to the same cluster. We discuss the efficacy of numerous embedding\nspaces to detect visual frames and show its superiority over other clustering\nmethods. To this end, we employ the climate change dataset \\textit{ClimateTV}\nwhich contains images commonly used for visual frame analysis. For broad visual\nframes, DINOv2 is a suitable embedding space, while ConvNeXt V2 returns a\nlarger number of clusters which contain fine-grain differences, i.e. speech and\nprotest. Our insights into embedding space differences in combination with the\noptimal clustering - by definition - advances automated visual frame detection.\nOur code can be found at https://github.com/KathPra/MP4VisualFrameDetection.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"997R2i_eDAvGeYUaYo9Hom8JFNwRsKZJfXbIkKWKOw4","pdfSize":"8375694"}
