Using the Transformers library, these\nmodels were trained on Universal Dependencies (UD) corpora and the newly\ndeveloped eFontes corpus of Polish Medieval Latin. The research evaluates the\nmodels' performance, addressing challenges such as orthographic variations and\nthe integration of Latinized vernacular terms. The models achieved high\naccuracy rates: lemmatization at 92.60%, part-of-speech tagging at 83.29%, and\nmorphological feature determination at 88.57%. The findings underscore the\nimportance of high-quality annotated corpora and propose future enhancements,\nincluding extending the models to Named Entity Recognition.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Kj4kXwxgOCwxrFBktjVwolkkC8uEjUdKO-7PK8fG3jo","pdfSize":"921246"}
