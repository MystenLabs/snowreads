Equivalently it\nis the probability Brownian motion started from $z$ first strikes the boundary\nwithin a distance $r$ from $z$. We call $h_D$ the $h$-function of $D$, this\nfunction captures geometrical aspects of the domain, such as connectivity, or\ncurvature of the boundary. This paper is concerned with the inverse problem:\ngiven a suitable function $h$, does there exist a domain $D$ such that $h =\nh_D$? To answer this, we first extend the concept of a $h$-function of a domain\nto one of a stopping time $\\tau$ . By using the conformal invariance of\nBrownian motion we solve the inverse problem for that of a stopping time. The\nassociated stopping time will be the projection of a hitting time of the real\nline. If this projection corresponds to the hitting time of a domain $D$, then\nthis technique solves the original inverse problem. We have found a large\nfamily of examples such that the associated stopping time is that of a hitting\ntime.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MZ03KRULEDr6e9Hw1bJtdGzCSy0pNR2btdEMimKTYKc","pdfSize":"779624"}
