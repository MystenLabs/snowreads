  "abstract": "  Prelle and Singer showed in 1983 that if a system of ordinary differential\nequations defined on a differential field $K$ has a first integral in an\nelementrary field extension $L$ of $K$, then it must have a first integral\nconsisting of algebraic elements over $K$ via their constant powers and\nlogarithms. Based on this result they further proved that an elementary\nintegrable planar polynomial differential system has an integrating factor\nwhich is a fractional power of a rational function. Here we extend their\nresults and prove that any $n$ dimensional elementary integrable polynomial\nvector field has $n-1$ functionally independent first integrals being composed\nof algebraic elements over $K$. Furthermore, using the Galois theory we prove\nthat the vector field has a rational Jacobian multiplier.\n",
