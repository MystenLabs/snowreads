  "abstract": "  Consider the problem of determining the optimal applied electric field to\ndrive a molecule from an initial state to a desired target state. For even\nmoderately sized molecules, solving this problem directly using the exact\nequations of motion -- the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation (TDSE) -- is\nnumerically intractable. We present a solution of this problem within\ntime-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory, a mean field approximation of the\nTDSE. Optimality is defined in terms of minimizing the total control effort\nwhile maximizing the overlap between desired and achieved target states. We\nframe this problem as an optimization problem constrained by the nonlinear TDHF\nequations; we solve it using trust region optimization with gradients computed\nvia a custom-built adjoint state method. For three molecular systems, we show\nthat with very small neural network parametrizations of the control, our method\nyields solutions that achieve desired targets within acceptable constraints and\ntolerances.\n",
