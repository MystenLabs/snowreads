As the correspondences hold\nfor intuitionistic and classic versions of LL (ILL and CLL), we obtain two\ndifferent families of type systems for concurrency. An open question remains:\nhow do these two families exactly relate to each other? Based upon a\ntranslation from CLL to ILL due to Laurent (2018), we provide two complementary\nanswers, in the form of full abstraction results based on a typed observational\nequivalence due to Atkey (2017). Our results elucidate hitherto missing formal\nlinks between seemingly related yet different type systems for concurrency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-cjQHlc98r4FyRhmkQ0b136oHSBijrM1KR-XWKvIsK0","pdfSize":"939289"}
