However, imperfect graph\nstructure with noisy links lacks enough robustness and may damage graph\nrepresentations, therefore limiting the GNNs' performance in practical tasks.\nMoreover, existing generative architectures fail to fit discriminative\ngraph-related tasks. To tackle these issues, we introduce an unsupervised\nmethod based on a joint of generative training and discriminative training to\nlearn graph structure and representation, aiming to improve the discriminative\nperformance of generative models. We propose an Energy-based Contrastive\nLearning (ECL) guided Graph Structure Refinement (GSR) framework, denoted as\nECL-GSR. To our knowledge, this is the first work to combine energy-based\nmodels with contrastive learning for GSR. Specifically, we leverage ECL to\napproximate the joint distribution of sample pairs, which increases the\nsimilarity between representations of positive pairs while reducing the\nsimilarity between negative ones. Refined structure is produced by augmenting\nand removing edges according to the similarity metrics among node\nrepresentations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ECL-GSR outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art on eight benchmark datasets in node classification. ECL-GSR\nachieves faster training with fewer samples and memories against the leading\nbaseline, highlighting its simplicity and efficiency in downstream tasks.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Hc4kL7qQyxPI-xD2MpPH9DI72HS0G7ffvpueNQFWD6o","pdfSize":"2370733"}
