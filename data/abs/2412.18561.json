  "abstract": "  Bound states and scattering resonances in the unoccupied continuum of a\ntwo-dimensional crystal predicted in [Phys$.$Rev$.$ B 87, 041405(R) (2013)] are\nconsidered within an exactly solvable model. A close connection of the observed\nresonances with those arising in the Fano theory is revealed. The resonance\noccurs when the lateral scattering couples the layer-perpendicular incident\nelectron wave to a strictly bound state. The coupling strength determines the\nlocation of the pole in the scattering amplitude in the complex energy plane,\nwhich is analytically shown to lead to a characteristic Fano-lineshape of the\nenergy dependence of the electron transmissivity through the crystal. The\nimplications for the timing of the resonance scattering are discussed. The\nanalytical results are illustrated by ab initio calculations for a graphene\nmonolayer.\n",
