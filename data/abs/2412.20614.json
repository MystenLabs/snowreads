The original method is based on the\nrandom casting of a needle of length l onto a planked floor of plank width L.\nThe described variant involves the random casting of an equilateral triangle\nwith side length l onto a tiled floor consisting of square tiles of side width\nL. Source code for the computer simulation of this method is provided.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/History and Overview","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aRFEUGnpNSxGTTm-pHV0BqiWw29trkxLRWFSgvV5NHY","pdfSize":"345373"}
