However, there still needs to be more\nknowledge in the extant literature about how climate change campaigns influence\nsustainable entrepreneurial intention. This study uses the Theory of Planned\nBehavior (TPB) to develop a theoretical framework to explain how climate change\ncampaigns affect the intention to start a sustainable business. This\ninterdisciplinary conceptual research model bridges the gap between climate\nawareness, sustainable values, and entrepreneurial intentions, offering a\nrobust framework for understanding and fostering sustainable entrepreneurial\nbehaviors. Our study lays the groundwork for future empirical studies and\nreal-world interventions to advance sustainability through entrepreneurship.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dMJRuhIkd_Zui1_dFmHLP_mcY6FXqPDo8W9HWOtA-Uc","pdfSize":"378586"}
