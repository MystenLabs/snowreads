The recently proposed blended generalized extreme value\n(bGEV) distribution modifies the GEV with positive shape parameter to avoid a\nhard lower bound that complicates fitting and inference. Here, the bGEV is\nextended to the GEV with negative shape parameter, avoiding a hard upper bound\nthat is unrealistic in many applications. This extended bGEV is shown to\nimprove on the GEV for forecasting heat and sea level extremes based on past\ndata. Software implementing this bGEV and applying it to the example\ntemperature and sea level data is provided.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"UPHVsDUaOFK6DLjNnjIrlt0Da0jxBCnRbGUNeoJHmoE","pdfSize":"190770"}
