We present results\nfrom Nirvana, our non-axisymmetric kinematic modeling code built with a\nphysically-motivated Bayesian forward modeling approach, which decomposes MaNGA\nvelocity fields into first- and second-order radial and tangential rotational\nmodes in a generalized and minimally-supervised fashion. We use Nirvana to\nproduce models and rotation curves for 1263 unique barred MaNGA galaxies and a\nmatched unbarred control sample We present our modeling approach, tests of its\nefficacy, and validation against existing visual bar classifications. Nirvana\nfinds elevated non-circular motions in galaxies identified as bars in imaging,\nand bar position angles that agree well with visual measurements. The\nNirvana-MaNGA barred and control samples provide a new opportunity for studying\nthe influence of non-axisymmetric internal disk kinematics in a large\nstatistical sample.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"hD6k6NEmWZqm_BFLJxlBuj0ghZ-x1auNlCR-syZaRXA","pdfSize":"3434411"}
