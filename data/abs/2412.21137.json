A particularly interesting and minimal scenario\ninvolves DM with pure gravitational interactions. In the early Universe, such\nDM can be unavoidably generated via annihilation of particles in the standard\nmodel (SM) thermal plasma. It is known that the SM thermal plasma also produces\ngravitational waves (GWs). In this study, we point out a simple and tight\nconnection between the amplitude of the thermal GWs and the properties of pure\ngravitational DM. Notably, future GW experiments in the ultra-high frequency\nregime have the potential to shed light on the mass and spin of pure\ngravitational DM.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bQyM-FuLNT-9pW0K9sFnlgCpZIU7CqAR6Zr3K7VqAhg","pdfSize":"573240"}
