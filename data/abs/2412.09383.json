Additionally, developing NLP tools\nfor Luxembourgish is a difficult task given the lack of annotated and parallel\ndata, which is exacerbated by ongoing standardization. In this paper, we\npropose the first sequence-to-sequence normalization models using the ByT5 and\nmT5 architectures with training data obtained from word-level real-life\nvariation data. We perform a fine-grained, linguistically-motivated evaluation\nto test byte-based, word-based and pipeline-based models for their strengths\nand weaknesses in text normalization. We show that our sequence model using\nreal-life variation data is an effective approach for tailor-made normalization\nin Luxembourgish.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"RwA4CMwuSEqiZ_hSBxFay1882Ibhenzu3U983WtIx4k","pdfSize":"301401"}
