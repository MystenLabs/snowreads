We give an asymptotic formula for how many\nof these forms are locally soluble everywhere, i.e. we give an asymptotic\nformula for the number of pairs of integers $(a, b)$ that satisfy $1 \\leq a\n\\leq A$, $1 \\leq b \\leq B$ and some mild conditions, such that $\\phi_{a,b}$ has\na non-zero solution in $\\mathbb{Q}_p$ for all primes $p$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"l6YZsRBaXPrv7KzQ1-tTZaQ7BSyDyscr70IhkN6V7gc","pdfSize":"255109"}
