  "abstract": "  GitHub, the de-facto platform for open-source software development, provides\na set of social-media-like features to signal high-quality repositories. Among\nthem, the star count is the most widely used popularity signal, but it is also\nat risk of being artificially inflated (i.e., faked), decreasing its value as a\ndecision-making signal and posing a security risk to all GitHub users. In this\npaper, we present a systematic, global, and longitudinal measurement study of\nfake stars in GitHub. To this end, we build StarScout, a scalable tool able to\ndetect anomalous starring behaviors (i.e., low activity and lockstep) across\nthe entire GitHub metadata. Analyzing the data collected using StarScout, we\nfind that: (1) fake-star-related activities have rapidly surged since 2024; (2)\nthe user profile characteristics of fake stargazers are not distinct from\naverage GitHub users, but many of them have highly abnormal activity patterns;\n(3) the majority of fake stars are used to promote short-lived malware\nrepositories masquerading as pirating software, game cheats, or cryptocurrency\nbots; (4) some repositories may have acquired fake stars for growth hacking,\nbut fake stars only have a promotion effect in the short term (i.e., less than\ntwo months) and become a burden in the long term. Our study has implications\nfor platform moderators, open-source practitioners, and supply chain security\nresearchers.\n",
