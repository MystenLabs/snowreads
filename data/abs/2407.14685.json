First, we derive the modified Friedmann\nequations from the first law of thermodynamics. We investigate the validity of\ngeneralised second law (GSL) of thermodynamics and find that it is always\nsatisfied for the all eras of universe. Moreover, we investigate the\ndeceleration parameter for the case $k=0$ in two frameworks. Finally, we\nnumerically study the bouncing behaviour for the modified Friedmann equations\nobtained from entropic gravity. The results indicate that the bouncing\nbehaviour is possible for the cases $k=1$ and $k=-1$.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NEKD0Nr5RkuTCNt_Goy-LHNhppDYX9uiSX2H_FFbEYs","pdfSize":"270983"}
