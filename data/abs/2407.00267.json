Such AI systems are more likely\nto be useful in a clinical setting if their predictions can be explained to a\nradiologist. This work proposes an explainable AI model that provides\ninterpretable predictions using a standard lexicon from the American College of\nRadiology's Breast Imaging and Reporting Data System (BI-RADS). The model is a\ndeep neural network featuring a concept bottleneck layer in which known BI-RADS\nfeatures are predicted before making a final cancer classification. This\nenables radiologists to easily review the predictions of the AI system and\npotentially fix errors in real time by modifying the concept predictions. In\nexperiments, a model is developed on 8,854 images from 994 women with expert\nannotations and histological cancer labels. The model outperforms\nstate-of-the-art lesion detection frameworks with 48.9 average precision on the\nheld-out testing set, and for cancer classification, concept intervention is\nshown to increase performance from 0.876 to 0.885 area under the receiver\noperating characteristic curve.
