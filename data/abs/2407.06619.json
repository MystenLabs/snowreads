VaR's limitation is its inability to account for\nthe magnitude of losses beyond a certain threshold. Expected Shortfall (ES)\naddresses this by providing the conditional expectation of such exceedances,\noffering a more comprehensive measure of tail risk. Despite its benefits, ES is\nnot elicitable on its own, complicating its direct estimation. However, joint\nelicitability with VaR allows for their combined estimation. Building on this,\nwe propose a new methodology named Conditional Autoregressive Expected\nShortfall (CAESar), inspired by the CAViaR model. CAESar handles dynamic\npatterns flexibly and includes heteroskedastic effects for both VaR and ES,\nwith no distributional assumption on price returns. CAESar involves a\nthree-step process: estimating VaR via CAViaR regression, formulating ES in an\nautoregressive manner, and jointly estimating VaR and ES while ensuring a\nmonotonicity constraint to avoid crossing quantiles. By employing various\nbacktesting procedures, we show the effectiveness of CAESar through extensive\nsimulations and empirical testing on daily financial data. Our results\ndemonstrate that CAESar outperforms existing regression methods in terms of\nforecasting performance, making it a robust tool for financial risk management.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Risk Management"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AucgDFveraDZShsFDOcdsOV8wZ6gFQvpp_kBeR1TBeo","pdfSize":"1022361"}
