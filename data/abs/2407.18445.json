The goal is to enhance the effectiveness of web application firewalls\n(WAFs). Web applications are frequently vulnerable to various security threats,\nmaking WAFs essential for their protection. WAFs analyze HTTP traffic using\nrule-based approaches to identify known attack patterns and to detect and block\npotential malicious requests. However, a major challenge is the occurrence of\nfalse positives, which can lead to blocking legitimate traffic and impact the\nnormal functioning of the application. The problem is addressed as an approach\nthat combines supervised learning for feature selection with a semi-supervised\nlearning scenario for training a One-Class SVM model. The experimental findings\nshow that the model trained with features selected by the proposed algorithm\noutperformed the expert-based selection approach in terms of performance.\nAdditionally, the results obtained by the traditional rule-based WAF\nModSecurity, configured with a vanilla set of OWASP CRS rules, were also\nimproved.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"YPcS7LxfiQ-VUxiBe1WL-xCSLTKACFZFsJ__xV_CPGQ","pdfSize":"1535656"}
