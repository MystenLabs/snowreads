  "abstract": "  The low frequency vibrational anomaly known as Boson peak (BP) have been\nstudied extensively in various disordered systems, however its origin and\ntheoretical description are still under debate. In this work, as one of the\nsimplest model for describing vibrational properties in disordered systems,\ninhomogeneous elastic wave equation, is solved in real space without using\nperturbative approach as previous works. In real space solution, the BP\nassociated flat dispersion relation can be obtained, localized vibration in\nexponential decay in soft spot can be observed, and the fluctuation length of\nshear modulus dependent BP frequency is also confirmed. These features have\nbeen reported in recent progresses but missed within perturbative approach.\nThis work unify divergent and controversial conclusions of BP within a simple\nmodel of fluctuating shear modulus under clear visualization.\n",
