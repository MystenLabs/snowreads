Associated\nwith this framework, we consider a second-order differential operator $L(x,\n{\\partial_x}) := v^2(x,t) (\\partial_x^2 -\\partial_x)$ that carries a variable\nvolatility term $v(x,t)$ and which is dependent on the underlying log-price $x$\nand a time parameter $t$ motivated by the celebrated Dupire local volatility\nmodel. In this context, we ask and answer the question of whether one can find\na non-linear evolution equation derived from a zero-curvature condition for a\ntime-dependent deformation of the operator $L$. The result is a variant of the\nHarry Dym equation for which we can then find a family of travelling wave\nsolutions. This brings in extensive machinery from soliton theory and\nintegrable systems. As a by-product, it opens up the way to the use of coherent\nstructures in financial-market volatility studies.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis","Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zabI5ZihfK9su4q6r_pA4gTZ-1sCCZyoK4DXf9ZVV1A","pdfSize":"545548"}
