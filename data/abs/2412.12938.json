  "abstract": "  A Flying Light Speck, FLS, is a miniature sized drone configured with light\nsources to illuminate 3D multimedia objects in a fixed volume, an FLS display.\nA swarm of FLSs may provide haptic interactions by exerting force back at a\nuser's touch. This paper presents a conceptual model for the multimedia data to\nenable content-based queries. The model empowers users of an FLS display to\nannotate the illuminations by adding semantics to the data, extending a\nmultimedia repository with information and knowledge. We present a core\nconceptual model and demonstrate its extensions for two diverse applications,\nauthoring tools with entertainment and MRI scans with healthcare.\n",
