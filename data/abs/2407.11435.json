Just as\nthe goal of Natural Language Processing is to understand sequences of words, a\nmajor objective in biology is to understand biological sequences. Genomic\nLanguage Models (gLMs), which are LLMs trained on DNA sequences, have the\npotential to significantly advance our understanding of genomes and how DNA\nelements at various scales interact to give rise to complex functions. In this\nreview, we showcase this potential by highlighting key applications of gLMs,\nincluding fitness prediction, sequence design, and transfer learning. Despite\nnotable recent progress, however, developing effective and efficient gLMs\npresents numerous challenges, especially for species with large, complex\ngenomes. We discuss major considerations for developing and evaluating gLMs.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Genomics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"BlJ4ywLYbUjEkDzIMYSYbWRcUr1sfIH3ghy7Rt_oj3o","pdfSize":"1149254"}
