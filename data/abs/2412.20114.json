A major approach for lower bounding the\nsize of IPS refutations is the Functional Lower Bound Method (Forbes, Shpilka,\nTzameret and Wigderson [FSTW21]), which reduces the hardness of refuting a\npolynomial equation f(x) = 0 with no Boolean solutions to the hardness of\ncomputing the function 1/f(x) over the Boolean cube with an algebraic circuit.\nUsing symmetry, we provide a general way to obtain many new hard instances\nagainst fragments of IPS via the functional lower bound method. This includes\nhardness over finite fields and hard instances different from Subset Sum\nvariants, both of which were unknown before, and stronger constant-depth lower\nbounds. Conversely, we expose the limitation of this method by showing it\ncannot lead to proof complexity lower bounds for any hard Boolean instance\n(e.g., CNFs) for any sufficiently strong proof systems.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Lr3PUWhtapauc5IeAnkzmLPY5YCEghFXQZpZdJWe6Vg","pdfSize":"841991"}
