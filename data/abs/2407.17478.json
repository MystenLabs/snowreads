Specifically, we carry out a\ncase study wherein we develop and test an LLM-based chatbot, PRODIGY (PROcess\nmoDellIng Guidance for You), in a multinational company, the Hilti Group. We\nare particularly interested in understanding how LLM can aid (human) modellers\nin creating process flow diagrams. To this purpose, we first conduct a\npreliminary user study (n=10) with professional process modellers from Hilti,\ninquiring for various pain-points they encounter in their daily routines. Then,\nwe use their responses to design and implement PRODIGY. Finally, we evaluate\nPRODIGY by letting our user study's participants use PRODIGY, and then ask for\ntheir opinion on the pros and cons of PRODIGY. We coalesce our results in\nactionable takeaways. Through our research, we showcase the first practical\napplication of LLM for process modelling in the real world, shedding light on\nhow industries can leverage LLM to enhance their Business Process Management\nactivities.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Vq8xGC4XfchQeITOviz0ZHjPSw6UpADMBh8_XSolNMM","pdfSize":"891866"}
