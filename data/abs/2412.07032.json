We introduce the notion of \\enquote{Volume of Assistance} (VoA),\nwhich computes the geometric mean of entanglement of assistance across all\npotential parties. We demonstrate the feasibility of VoA for three-qubit pure\nstates and certain classes of pure tripartite qudit states. We have extended\nthis measure to four-qubit states and general multipartite scenarios. We have\ndone a comparative analysis to illustrate VoA's distinctiveness from\nestablished entanglement measures, notably showing it serves as an upper bound\nfor the much celebrated generalized geometric measure (GGM). Remarkably, VoA\nexcels in distinguishing a broad class of states that elude differentiation by\nthe recently proposed Minimum Pairwise Concurrence (MPC) measure. Finally, VoA\nis applied to quantify genuine entanglement in the ground states of a\nthree-qubit Heisenberg XY model, which highlights its practical utility in\nquantum information processing tasks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PBf8YcBJeHfv_BJtT9gm3NtFcZbLrWE6BwaTEK7bmT8","pdfSize":"531633"}
