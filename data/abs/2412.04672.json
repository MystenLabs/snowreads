  "abstract": "  We add small random perturbations to a cellular automaton and consider the\none-parameter family $(F_\\epsilon)_{\\epsilon>0}$ parameterized by $\\epsilon$\nwhere $\\epsilon>0$ is the level of noise. The objective of the article is to\nstudy the set of limiting invariant distributions as $\\epsilon$ tends to zero\ndenoted $\\mathcal{M}_0^l$. Some topological obstructions appear,\n$\\mathcal{M}_0^l$ is compact and connected, as well as combinatorial\nobstructions as the set of cellular automata is countable: $\\mathcal{M}_0^l$ is\n$\\Pi_3$-computable in general and $\\Pi_2$-computable if it is uniformly\napproached. Reciprocally, for any set of probability measures $\\mathcal{K}$\nwhich is compact, connected and $\\Pi_2$-computable, we construct a cellular\nautomaton whose perturbations by an uniform noise admit $\\mathcal{K}$ as the\nzero-noise limits measure and this set is uniformly approached. To finish, we\nstudy how the set of limiting invariant measures can depend on a bias in the\nnoise. We construct a cellular automaton which realizes any connected compact\nset (without computable constraints) if the bias is changed for an arbitrary\nsmall value. In some sense this cellular automaton is very unstable with\nrespect to the noise.\n",
