Taking into account the main\nspin interactions - isotropic Heisenberg superexchange, antisymmetric\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange, single-ion spin anisotropy - calculations of\nthe free energy, concentration and temperature dependences of magnetization\nwere carried out within a framework of a molecular field model. In particular,\nthe model demonstrates the phenomena of temperature compensation and negative\nmagnetization, as well as spin reorientation. The compensation temperature\nreaches room temperature T = 300 K in a composition with x = 0.45. The\nexistence of magnetic structures of the $G_{xyz}$ type with the spatial\norientation of the Neel vector is predicted.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dfSt1Nq19dZALOqdigQRb9dzbG70HzcDFT_mtgcgp4o","pdfSize":"670828"}
