Analytically,\nwe demonstrate that non-reciprocal interactions do not alter the critical\nexponents of the model under equilibrium dynamics. In contrast, numerical\nsimulations with selfish non-equilibrium dynamics reveal distinctive behavior.\nFor $q=2$ (non-reciprocal non-equilibrium Ising model), the critical exponents\nremain consistent with those of the equilibrium Ising universality class.\nHowever, for $q=3$ and $q=4$, the critical exponents vary continuously.\nRemarkably, a super-universal scaling function -- Binder cumulant as a function\nof $\\xi_2/\\xi_0$, where $\\xi_2$ is the second moment correlation length and\n$\\xi_0$ its maximum value -- remains identical to that of the equilibrium\n$q=3,4$ Potts models. These findings indicate that non-reciprocal Potts models\nbelong to the superuniversality class of their respective equilibrium\ncounterparts.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Nonlinear Sciences/Cellular Automata and Lattice Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"M02SaQ2cl6cvWHJ7zvZW_Z9DsovwICV76JN9pnBUlvA","pdfSize":"1929417"}
