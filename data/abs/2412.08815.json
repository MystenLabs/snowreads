  "abstract": "  Let $\\mathcal{N} \\neq \\{0\\}$ be a fixed set of integers, closed under\nmultiplication, closed under negation, or containing $\\{\\pm 1\\}$. We prove that\nany zero of a polynomial in $\\mathbf{Z}[X]$ whose coefficients lie in\n$\\mathcal{N}$ can be approximated in $\\mathbf{C}$ to arbitrary precision by a\nzero of a polynomial in $\\mathbf{Z}[X]$ with square discriminant whose\ncoefficients also lie in $\\mathcal{N}$. Hence the topology of the closure in\n$\\mathbf{C}$ of the set of zeros of all such polynomials is insensitive to the\ndiscriminant being a square, in contrast to the Galois groups of the\npolynomials.\n",
