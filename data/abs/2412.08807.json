  "abstract": "  Working with function spaces in various branches of mathematical analysis\nintroduces optimality problems, where the question of choosing a function space\nboth accessible and expressive becomes a nontrivial exercise. A good middle\nground is provided by Orlicz spaces, parameterized by a single Young function\nand thus accessible, yet expansive. In this work, we study optimality problems\non Sobolev embeddings in Mazya classes of Euclidean domains which are defined\nthrough their isoperimetric behavior. In particular, we prove the nonexistence\nof optimal Orlicz spaces in certain Orlicz Sobolev embeddings in a limiting, or\ncritical, state whose pivotal special case is the celebrated embedding of\nBrezis and Wainger for John domains.\n",
