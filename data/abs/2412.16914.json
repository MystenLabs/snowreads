  "abstract": "  Temporal photon correlations have been a crucial resource for quantum and\nquantum-enabled optical science for over half a century. However, attaining\nnon-classical information through these correlations has typically been limited\nto a single point (or at best, a few points) at-a-time. We perform here a\nmassively multiplexed wide-field photon correlation measurement using a large\n$500\\times500$ single-photon avalanche diode array, the SwissSPAD3. We\ndemonstrate the performance of this apparatus by acquiring wide-field photon\ncorrelation measurements of single-photon emitters, and illustrate two\napplications of the attained quantum information: wide-field emitter counting\nand quantum-enabled super-resolution imaging (by a factor of $\\sqrt{2})$. The\nconsiderations and limitations of applying this technique in a practical\ncontext are discussed. Ultimately, the realization of massively multiplexed\nwide-field photon correlation measurements can accelerate quantum sensing\nprotocols and quantum-enabled imaging techniques by orders of magnitude.\n",
