  "abstract": "  When submerged in a chiral active bath, a passive object becomes a spinning\nratchet imbued with odd transport properties. In the adiabatic limit of a\nmassive object, we derive the most general Langevin dynamics for a rigid body\nin a chiral active bath, with odd diffusion and odd mobility connected by an\nEinstein relation, and numerically explore the breakdown of these predictions\nbeyond the adiabatic limit. We show that the irreversibility of a massive\nobject increases as its symmetry decreases: a disk exhibits an effective\nequilibrium dynamics, while a rod admits distinct translational and rotational\ntemperatures, and a wedge is fully out of equilibrium. Conversely, this\ndeparture from equilibrium can be read in the universal far-field currents and\ndensity modulations of the bath, which we measure numerically and derive\nanalytically.\n",
