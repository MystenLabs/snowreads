One natural question is whether there exists normal fluid in the\nsuperconducting state in the overdoped region. In this paper, we have carried\nout high-resolution ultra-low temperature laser-based angle-resolved\nphotoemission measurements on a heavily overdoped Bi2212 sample with a\n$T_{\\mathrm{c}}$ of 48 K. We find that this heavily overdoped Bi2212 remains in\nthe strong coupling regime with $2 \\mathit{\\Delta}_0 / k_{\\mathrm{B}}\nT_{\\mathrm{c}}=5.8$. The single-particle scattering rate is very small along\nthe nodal direction ($\\sim$5 meV) and increases as the momentum moves from the\nnodal to the antinodal regions. A hard superconducting gap opening is observed\nnear the antinodal region with the spectral weight at the Fermi level fully\nsuppressed to zero. The normal fluid is found to be negligibly small in the\nsuperconducting state of this heavily overdoped Bi2212. These results provide\nkey information to understand the high $T_\\mathrm{c}$ mechanism in the cuprate\nsuperconductors.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XeN85scPSDWKKt9MAks2-WpJU4RDpVFDSYwZJBeqgE8","pdfSize":"2281660"}
