In this work, we present a UV completion of this\nmodel by embedding it into an $SU(5)$ unified framework. Interestingly, we find\nthat loop-induced contributions to neutrino masses arising from colored scalars\nare just as important as those from color-neutral ones. These new states, which\nare required from gauge coupling unification and neutrino oscillation data to\nhave masses below $\\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ TeV, may be accessible to future collider\nexperiments. Additionally, the model can be probed in proton decay searches.\nOur Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis of model parameters shows a high\nlikelihood of observable $p \\rightarrow e^+ \\pi^0$ decay signal in the first\ndecade of Hyper-Kamiokande operation. The model predicts a vector-like\ndown-type quark at the TeV scale, utilized for realistic fermion mass\ngeneration and gauge coupling unification. The model is UV-complete in the\nsense that it is a unified theory which is realistic and asymptotically free\nthat can be extrapolated to the Planck scale.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qfNVJCcHp63eM3YUr2AEmnLMWUoX64gmAxkm2i2_U9Y","pdfSize":"1661782"}
