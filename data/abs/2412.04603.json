We restrict the magnetic group to its subgroup of elements that act\ncomplex linearly, and we show that this restriction induces a rational\nisomorphism with the conjugation invariant part of the complex equivariant\nK-theory of the restricted group. This isomorphism allows to calculate the\ntorsion free part of the magnetic equivariant K-theory groups reducing it to\nknown calculations in complex equivariant K-theory\n","subjects":["Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eQQzUoIDXAqaRJjjB5-5_t1wK407fL1wC6Yvu3CQssU","pdfSize":"203715"}
