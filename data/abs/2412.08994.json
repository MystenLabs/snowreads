Zero-field $\\mu$SR~experiment indicates the\nabsence of spontaneous magnetic field in the superconducting state, showing the\npreservation of time-reversal symmetry in the superconducting state.\nTransverse-field $\\mu$SR~experiment is performed to map the phase diagram of\nNbGe$_2$, from which clear evidence of both type-I and type-II\nsuperconductivity is obtained. More importantly, we clearly delineate the\nregion in the phase diagram where type-I and type-II superconductivity coexist.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NpJDTHiFFxyF3qccinnMLgjZoI4TWfy55j76HZAYO8Y","pdfSize":"4273761"}
