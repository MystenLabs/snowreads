Kreutz sungrazer C/2024 S1 (ATLAS) was discovered a\nmonth before reaching its perihelion distance of 0.008 au, allowing physical\nobservations from both ground- and space-based telescopes. We present\nobservations from 0.9 au to 0.4 au using the Nordic Optical Telescope showing\nthat 1) nucleus disintegration was on-going already at 0.7 au pre-perihelion,\n2) the activity varied unpredictably with distance and 3) the nucleus radius\nwas $<$600 m (red geometric albedo 0.04 assumed). We also use coronagraphic\nobservations from the STEREO-A spacecraft to study C/2024 S1 at heliocentric\ndistances $\\lesssim$0.1 au. We find that the coma scattering cross-section\npeaked near 0.075 au and faded progressively, by a factor $\\sim$20, towards the\nlast observation at 0.02 au. We interpret the near-perihelion fading as a\nresult of the sublimation of refractory coma grains, beginning at blackbody\ntemperatures $\\sim$1000 K, consistent with olivine composition. The comet was\nnot detected after perihelion. We consider processes operating to destroy the\nnucleus when near perihelion, concluding that rotational instability and\nsublimation losses work together towards this end, even before entry of the\ncomet into the Roche lobe of the Sun.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JmOrwe7Ai3mEiHvrbh6t7u1vcIUfuOkkEVU7f9-vtXs","pdfSize":"2889369"}
