We say an $r$-graph $F$ is bounded\nif there exist constants $\\alpha, \\beta>0$ such that for large $n$, every\n$n$-vertex $F$-free $r$-graph with a vertex of degree at least $\\alpha\n\\binom{n-1}{r-1}$ has fewer than $(1-\\beta) \\cdot \\mathrm{ex}(n,F)$ edges.

In addition, to prove the boundedness of the\nexpansion of complete bipartite graphs, we introduce and solve a\nZarankiewicz-type problem for $3$-graphs, strengthening a theorem by\nKostochka--Mubayi--Verstra\\\"{e}te~\\cite{KMV15}.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ApWbe9X5xCo3yqRt9Ohe0UzgQLC8vF5VDQsHVZuxQXk","pdfSize":"274590","objectId":"0x46802cfda94b0b70df7abfdb4a63c66b61ce6ffee8935b71e597b78ae0183212","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
