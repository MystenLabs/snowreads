We propose a global statistical postprocessing method for grid-based\nprecipitation ensemble forecasts. This U-Net-based distributional regression\nmethod predicts marginal distributions in the form of parametric distributions\ninferred by scoring rule minimization. Distributional regression U-Nets are\ncompared to state-of-the-art postprocessing methods for daily 21-h forecasts of\n3-h accumulated precipitation over the South of France. Training data comes\nfrom the M\\'et\\'eo-France weather model AROME-EPS and spans 3 years. A\npractical challenge appears when consistent data or reforecasts are not\navailable.\n  Distributional regression U-Nets compete favorably with the raw ensemble. In\nterms of continuous ranked probability score, they reach a performance\ncomparable to quantile regression forests (QRF). However, they are unable to\nprovide calibrated forecasts in areas associated with high climatological\nprecipitation. In terms of predictive power for heavy precipitation events,\nthey outperform both QRF and semi-parametric QRF with tail extensions.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2Ty2T_ou07Rc3we3LxcoX-tY4WF70AmYezmGF0ABaKk","pdfSize":"2728773"}
