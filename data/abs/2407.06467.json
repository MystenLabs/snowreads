Our approach involves two key innovations. Firstly, we locally\nreconstruct the underlying function using a linear combination of radial basis\nfunctions centered at a set of carefully chosen \\textit{ghost sample points}\nthat are independent of the point cloud samples. Secondly, unlike conventional\nleast-squares methods, which minimize the sum of squared differences from all\nsample points, we regularize the local reconstruction by imposing a hard\nconstraint to ensure that the least-squares approximation precisely passes\nthrough the center. This simple yet effective constraint significantly enhances\nthe diagonal dominance and conditioning of the resulting differential matrix.\nWe provide analytical proofs demonstrating that our method consistently\nestimates the exact Laplacian. Additionally, we present various numerical\nexamples showcasing the effectiveness of our proposed approach in solving the\nLaplace/Poisson equation and related eigenvalue problems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"R0RW4KsUtaniWvqn3HFKUo9YOWHIzSMG9k2zn2Yu6ew","pdfSize":"3481422"}
