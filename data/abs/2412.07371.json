Unlike\nprevious large reconstruction models that prepare images under fixed and simple\nlighting as both input and supervision, PRM renders photometric stereo images\nby varying materials and lighting for the purposes, which not only improves the\nprecise local details by providing rich photometric cues but also increases the\nmodel robustness to variations in the appearance of input images. To offer\nenhanced flexibility of images rendering, we incorporate a real-time\nphysically-based rendering (PBR) method and mesh rasterization for online\nimages rendering. Moreover, in employing an explicit mesh as our 3D\nrepresentation, PRM ensures the application of differentiable PBR, which\nsupports the utilization of multiple photometric supervisions and better models\nthe specular color for high-quality geometry optimization. Our PRM leverages\nphotometric stereo images to achieve high-quality reconstructions with\nfine-grained local details, even amidst sophisticated image appearances.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that PRM significantly outperforms other\nmodels.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hc3Gem2oMV422WSImZuS_Xr9nAKT8tbHfb1qr_sUZlA","pdfSize":"43135961"}
