  "abstract": "  We say that a metric space $X$ is $(\\epsilon,G)$-homogeneous if $G<Iso(X)$ is\na discrete group of isometries with $diam(X/G)<\\epsilon$.\\ A sequence of\n$(\\epsilon_i,G_i)$-homogeneous spaces $X_i$ with $\\epsilon_i\\to0$ is called a\nsequence of almost homogeneous spaces.\n  In this paper we show that the Gromov-Hausdorff limit of a sequence of almost\nhomogeneous RCD$(K,N)$ spaces must be a nilpotent Lie group with $Ric\\geqslant\nK$. We also obtain a topological rigidity theorem for\n$(\\epsilon,G)$-homogeneous RCD$(K,N)$ spaces, which generalizes a recent result\nby Wang. Indeed, if $X$ is an $(\\epsilon,G)$-homogeneous RCD$(K,N)$ space and\n$G$ is an almost-crystallographic group, then $X/G$ is bi-H\\\"older to an\ninfranil orbifold. Moreover, we study $(\\epsilon,G)$-homogeneous spaces in the\nsmooth setting and prove rigidity and $\\epsilon$-regularity theorems for\nRiemannian orbifolds with Einstein metrics and bounded Ricci curvatures\nrespectively.\n",
