They employ\nadvanced deep learning architectures to extract structural information\nautonomously from vast datasets through self-supervision. The resulting rich\nrepresentations of complex systems and dynamics can be applied to many\ndownstream applications. Therefore, FMs can find uses in electric power grids,\nchallenged by the energy transition and climate change. In this paper, we call\nfor the development of, and state why we believe in, the potential of FMs for\nelectric grids. We highlight their strengths and weaknesses amidst the\nchallenges of a changing grid. We argue that an FM learning from diverse grid\ndata and topologies could unlock transformative capabilities, pioneering a new\napproach in leveraging AI to redefine how we manage complexity and uncertainty\nin the electric grid. Finally, we discuss a power grid FM concept, namely\nGridFM, based on graph neural networks and show how different downstream tasks\nbenefit.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"H3DTe7jX7TiK8cJDFAw1m1qvFpntJCoZqWJ6vYMIFac","pdfSize":"923756"}
