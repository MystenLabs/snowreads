  "abstract": "  We study the Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) of electrostatic plane wave\nperturbations in compressible relativistic magnetoplasma fluids with thermal\nions under gravity in three different cases of when (i) electrons are in\nisothermal equilibrium, i.e., classical or nondegenerate, (ii) electrons are\nfully degenerate (with $T_e=0$), and (iii) electrons are partially degenerate\nor have finite temperature degeneracy (with $T_e\\neq0$). While in the cases of\n(i) and (iii), we focus on the regimes where the particle's thermal energy is\nmore or less than the rest mass energy, i.e., $\\beta_e \\equiv k_{\\mathrm\nB}T_e/{m_ec^2}<1~\\rm{or}~>1$, the case (ii) considers from weakly to\nultra-relativistic degenerate regimes. A general expression of the growth rate\nof instability is obtained and analyzed in the three different cases relevant\nto laboratory and astrophysical plasmas, which generalize and advance the\nprevious theory on RTI.\n",
