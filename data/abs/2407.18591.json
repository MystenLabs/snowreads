Given a query oracle and a set of nodes,\nthe goal is to obtain the edge set by performing as few queries as possible. An\nalgorithm for graph reconstruction is the Simple algorithm (Mathieu & Zhou,\n2023), which reconstructs bounded-degree graphs in $\\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$\nqueries. We extend the use of this algorithm to the class of geometric random\ngraphs with connection radius $r \\sim n^k$, with diverging average degree. We\nshow that for this class of graphs, the query complexity is\n$\\tilde{O}(n^{2k+1})$ when k > 3/20. This query complexity is up to a\npolylog(n) term equal to the number of edges in the graph, which means that the\nreconstruction algorithm is almost edge-optimal. We also show that with only\n$n^{1+o(1)}$ queries it is already possible to reconstruct at least 75% of the\nnon-edges of a geometric random graph, in both the sparse and dense setting.\nFinally, we show that the number of queries is indeed of the same order as the\nnumber of edges on the basis of simulations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UHZTY7Bvob8gkvt0pE2sErc5pTVCGA3ElRw4jIbtpLA","pdfSize":"774840","objectId":"0x48b6952e45e3c16b6ea04cc05f222cb1d146573eb86120b717becca7cddacbd9","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
