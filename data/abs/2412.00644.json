  "abstract": "  We complement the $y$-band template light curves for RR Lyrae to the\nwell-established template light curves in the $ugriz$-band, where the latter\nhave been adopted in the astroML/gatspy python package as one of the\nperiod-search methods for RR Lyrae. These $y$-band template light curves were\nconstructed based on the $z$-band time series data taken from the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey (SDSS), the $y$-band light curves from the Pan-STARRS1 survey, and\ndedicated $y$-band observations using the Lulin One-meter Telescope for RR\nLyrae located in the SDSS Stripe 82 region. These $y$-band template light\ncurves, 9 for the ab-type RR Lyrae and 3 for the c-type RR Lyrae, can be\napplied in conjunction to the $ugriz$-band template light curves for upcoming\nsky surveys involving the $y$-band, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory\nLegacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).\n",
