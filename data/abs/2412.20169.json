  "abstract": "  Despite the lack of a universally accepted quantum gravity theory, gravitons\nare considered the quantum noise in gravitational waves. Wave mediation\nrequires that gravitons be in a coherence state, with an abundance number of\norder $\\sim10^{79}$. Thus, the detection of coherent-state gravitons may be\npossible in a LIGO-like experiment via Compton scattering with a nanospherical\ntest mass. This work presents the associating scattering amplitude calculation\nusing effective field theory, calculating a total cross section approximately\n$100 ~\\mathrm{cm^2}$ for a coherence state and $\\sim10^{-81}~\\mathrm{m^2}$ for\na single graviton. An experiment proposal involving levitation techniques of a\nnanosphere is given in full description.\n",
