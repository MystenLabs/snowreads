Multimodal trajectory prediction enhances decision-making by\nconsidering multiple possible future trajectories based on diverse sources of\nenvironmental data. In this approach, we leverage ResNet-50 to extract image\nfeatures from high-definition map data and use IMU sensor data to calculate\nspeed, acceleration, and yaw rate. A temporal probabilistic network is employed\nto compute potential trajectories, selecting the most accurate and highly\nprobable trajectory paths. This method integrates HD map data to improve the\nrobustness and reliability of trajectory predictions for autonomous vehicles.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"s_k5XL02iz3xsA1zGfmD1ifywfH4jAP3VQCgq4Z88gk","pdfSize":"9635561"}
