{"id":"2407.00252","title":"Assistive Image Annotation Systems with Deep Learning and Natural\n  Language Capabilities: A Review","authors":"Moseli Mots'oehli","authorsParsed":[["Mots'oehli","Moseli",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2024 22:56:17 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-02","timestamp":1719615377000,"abstract":"  While supervised learning has achieved significant success in computer vision\ntasks, acquiring high-quality annotated data remains a bottleneck. This paper\nexplores both scholarly and non-scholarly works in AI-assistive deep learning\nimage annotation systems that provide textual suggestions, captions, or\ndescriptions of the input image to the annotator. This potentially results in\nhigher annotation efficiency and quality. Our exploration covers annotation for\na range of computer vision tasks including image classification, object\ndetection, regression, instance, semantic segmentation, and pose estimation. We\nreview various datasets and how they contribute to the training and evaluation\nof AI-assistive annotation systems. We also examine methods leveraging\nneuro-symbolic learning, deep active learning, and self-supervised learning\nalgorithms that enable semantic image understanding and generate free-text\noutput. These include image captioning, visual question answering, and\nmulti-modal reasoning. Despite the promising potential, there is limited\npublicly available work on AI-assistive image annotation with textual output\ncapabilities. We conclude by suggesting future research directions to advance\nthis field, emphasizing the need for more publicly accessible datasets and\ncollaborative efforts between academia and industry.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"oEp8ulBSQ9tPTzZbh3Ryc6M1ZZNTDMpsqW-KNl6j6kQ","pdfSize":"2705174"}
