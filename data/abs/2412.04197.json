For a variety\nof technical and physical reasons, UED diffraction images are typically of\nlower quality when viewed from the perspective of structure determination by\nsingle-crystal X-ray or electron diffraction. Nevertheless, time series of UED\nimages can provide valuable insight into structural dynamics, provided that an\nadequate interpretation of the diffraction patterns can be achieved. GARFIELD\nis a collection of tools with a graphical user interface designed to facilitate\nthe interpretation of diffraction patterns and to index Bragg reflections in\nchallenging cases where other indexing tools are ineffective. To this end,\nGARFIELD enables the user to interactively create, explore, and optimize sets\nof parameters that define the diffraction geometry and characteristic\nproperties of the sample.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"QoctyU8SPW_Syot2YrbXwOtDfk5BvtL-XWpEvEyK0ug","pdfSize":"17179537"}
