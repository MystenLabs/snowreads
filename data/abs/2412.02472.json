  "abstract": "  For a quasi-two-dimensional nonlinear sigma model on the real Stiefel\nmanifolds with a generalized (anisotropic) metric, the equations of a\ntwo-charge renormalization group (RG) for the homothety and anisotropy of the\nmetric as effective couplings are obtained in one-loop approximation. Normal\ncoordinates and the curvature tensor are exploited for the renormalization of\nthe metric. The RG trajectories are investigated and the presence of a fixed\npoint common to four critical lines or four phases (tetracritical point) in the\ngeneral case, or its absence in the case of Abelian structure 8group, is\nestablished.\n",
