When the superconducting phase difference equals\n$\\pi$, the Andreev subgap spectrum may host zero-energy Weyl singularities\nassociated with a vanishing normal-state reflection eigenvalue. With one of the\nAC fluxes playing the role of a quasimomentum, the junction can be viewed as an\nartificial one-dimensional chiral topological insulator. Its topological phase\ncan be tuned by crossing a Weyl singularity by means of varying the remaining\nAC flux. By associating an additional component of the quasimomentum with the\nsuperconducting phase difference, an artificial Chern insulator is realized.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mNvB1LFtUHkTenkieUBbcAZrCoE56yXiRBhD0Y2EBec","pdfSize":"275722"}
