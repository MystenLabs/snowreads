Among these, the Long-Range Frequency Hopping Spread\nSpectrum (LR-FHSS) modulation, tailored for LEO satellite IoT communications,\nsparks keen interest. This work presents a joint approach to enhancing the\nscalability of LR-FHSS, addressing the demand for massive connectivity. We\ndeepen into Frequency Hopping Sequence (FHS) mechanisms within LR-FHSS,\nspotlighting the potential of leveraging Wide-Gap sequences. Concurrently, we\nintroduce two novel demodulator allocation strategies, namely, ``Early-Decode\"\nand ``Early-Drop,\" to optimize the utilization of LoRa-specific gateway\ndecoding resources. Our research further validates these findings with\nextensive simulations, offering a comprehensive look into the future potential\nof LR-FHSS scalability in IoT settings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"joS64R2JxVwlKXyGSeghJIT1REZyDxN6HhdG2sLN81k","pdfSize":"890445"}
