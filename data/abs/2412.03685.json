Typically for 2D games, illustrators begin\nby designing the main character image, which serves as the foundation for all\nsubsequent animations. To create a smooth motion sequence, these subsequent\nanimations involve drawing the character in different poses and actions, such\nas running, jumping, or attacking. This process requires significant manual\neffort from illustrators, as they must meticulously ensure consistency in\ndesign, proportions, and style across multiple motion frames. Each frame is\ndrawn individually, making this a time-consuming and labor-intensive task.\nGenerative models, such as diffusion models, have the potential to\nrevolutionize this process by automating the creation of sprite sheets.\nDiffusion models, known for their ability to generate diverse images, can be\nadapted to create character animations. By leveraging the capabilities of\ndiffusion models, we can significantly reduce the manual workload for\nillustrators, accelerate the animation creation process, and open up new\ncreative possibilities in game development.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Graphics","Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qMYfDpFPdt2aDJufzndz_cHb2-GLbpuGOyzBA-vGe_I","pdfSize":"9295778"}
