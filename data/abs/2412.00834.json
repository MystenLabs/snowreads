  "abstract": "  This work revisits the well-posedness of non-degenerate McKean-Vlasov\nstochastic differential equations with H\\\"older continuous coefficients,\nrecently established by Chaudru de Raynal. We provide a streamlined and direct\nproof that leverages standard Gaussian estimates for uniformly parabolic PDEs,\nbypassing the need for derivatives with respect to the measure argument and\nextending applicability to hypoelliptic PDEs under weaker assumptions.\n",
