  "abstract": "  Precise measurements from sensors are crucial, but data is usually collected\nfrom low-cost, low-tech systems, which are often inaccurate. Thus, they require\nfurther calibrations. To that end, we first identify three requirements for\neffective calibration under practical low-tech sensor conditions. Based on the\nrequirements, we develop a model called TESLA, Transformer for effective sensor\ncalibration utilizing logarithmic-binned attention. TESLA uses a\nhigh-performance deep learning model, Transformers, to calibrate and capture\nnon-linear components. At its core, it employs logarithmic binning to minimize\nattention complexity. TESLA achieves consistent real-time calibration, even\nwith longer sequences and finer-grained time series in hardware-constrained\nsystems. Experiments show that TESLA outperforms existing novel deep learning\nand newly crafted linear models in accuracy, calibration speed, and energy\nefficiency.\n",
