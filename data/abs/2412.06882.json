  "abstract": "  Using high-precision astrometric data from Gaia DR3 and updated systemic\nvelocities from the literature, kinematical properties of cataclysmic variables\n(CVs) were investigated. By constraining the data according to the total space\nvelocity error and Galactic population class, a reliable sample of data was\nobtained. Non-magnetic CVs located in the thin disk have been found to have a\ntotal space velocity dispersion of $\\sigma_{\\nu} = 46.33\\pm4.23$ km s$^{-1}$,\nindicating that the thin disk CVs with a mean kinematical age of $\\tau =\n3.95\\pm0.75$ Gyr are much younger than the local thin disk of the Galaxy with\n$\\tau\\sim$6-9 Gyr. Total space velocity dispersions of non-magnetic CVs\nbelonging to the thin disk component of the Galaxy were found to be\n$\\sigma_{\\nu}=47.67\\pm3.94$ and $\\sigma_{\\nu}=44.43\\pm4.33$ km s$^{-1}$ for the\nsystems below and above the orbital period gap, respectively, corresponding to\nkinematical ages of $\\tau=4.19\\pm0.71$ and $\\tau=3.61\\pm0.74$ Gyr. $\\gamma$\nvelocity dispersions of the thin disk CVs below and above the gap were obtained\n$\\sigma_{\\gamma} = 27.52\\pm2.28$ and $\\sigma_{\\gamma} = 25.65\\pm2.44$ km\ns$^{-1}$, respectively. This study also shows that the orbital period is\ndecreasing with increasing age, as expected from the standard theory. The\nage-orbital period relation for non-magnetic thin disk CVs was obtained as\n$dP/dt=-2.09\\pm0.22\\times10^{-5}$ sec yr$^{-1}$. However, a significant\ndifference could not be found between the $\\gamma$ velocity dispersions of the\nsystems below and above the gap, which were calculated to be $\\sigma_{\\gamma} =\n27.52\\pm2.28$ and $\\sigma_{\\gamma} = 25.65\\pm2.44$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively.\n",
