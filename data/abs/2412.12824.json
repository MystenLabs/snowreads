We calculated key\nquantum characteristics, such as squeezing, photon statistics, and entanglement\nbetween the two PCS modes. Our results demonstrate that postselected von\nNeumann measurements enhance both the non-Gaussianity and nonclassicality of\nPCS. These findings are validated by analyzing the scaled joint Wigner function\nacross various system parameters. The theoretical optimization scheme offers an\nalternative approach for improving PCS-based quantum information efficiency and\nfacilitates practical implementations in quantum technologies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"POZsZFEAHoSiJOOzAH0EVQobb3QimmTBQIxcSL4PUPA","pdfSize":"3477235"}
