Our method relies on reversing the dynamics of the\nforward process and using this to learn a score function, which, via Doob's\n$h$-transform, gives us a bridged diffusion process; that is, a process\nconditioned on an endpoint. In contrast to prior methods, ours learns the score\nterm $\\nabla_x \\log p(t, x; T, y)$, for given $t, Y$ directly, completely\navoiding the need for first learning a time reversal. We compare the\nperformance of our algorithm with existing methods and see that it outperforms\nusing the (learned) time-reversals to learn the score term.
