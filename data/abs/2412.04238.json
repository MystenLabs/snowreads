  "abstract": "  We examine the energy-critical nonlinear heat equation in critical spaces for\nany dimension greater or equal than three. The aim of this paper is two-fold.\nFirst, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition on initial data at or\nbelow the ground state that dichotomizes the behavior of solutions.\nSpecifically, this criterion determines whether the solution will either exist\nglobally with energy decaying to zero over time or blow up in finite time.\nSecondly, we derive the decay rate for solutions that exist globally. These\nresults offer a comprehensive characterization of solution behavior for\nenergy-critical conditions in higher-dimensional settings\n",
