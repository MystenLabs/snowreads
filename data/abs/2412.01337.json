  "abstract": "  We study charge-exchange dynamics between slow atomic particles and condensed\nmatter revealing a strong dependence of the mean charge state on particle\ntrajectory. Exploiting transmission geometries, single crystalline targets and\ndistributions of the interaction distances obtained in simulations, we show the\ndifferences being rooted in the interaction with inner-shell electrons despite\nthe low ion energy. Energy dissipation due to deexcitation of modified inner\nshell states as well as increased local ionization density due to altered mean\ncharge states aggregate the excessive energy deposition in amorphous targets\ncompared to channeling trajectories and ab-initio calculations.\n",
