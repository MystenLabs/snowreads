Despite the\navailability of datasets categorizing various conflict events, the existing\nlabels often do not cover all of the fine-grained violent conflict event types\nrelevant to areas like the Horn of Africa. In this paper, we introduce a new\nbenchmark dataset Conflict Events in the Horn of Africa region (CEHA) and\npropose a new task for identifying violent conflict events using online\nresources with this dataset. The dataset consists of 500 English event\ndescriptions regarding conflict events in the Horn of Africa region with\nfine-grained event-type definitions that emphasize the cause of the conflict.\nThis dataset categorizes the key types of conflict risk according to specific\nareas required by stakeholders in the Humanitarian-Peace-Development Nexus.\nAdditionally, we conduct extensive experiments on two tasks supported by this\ndataset: Event-relevance Classification and Event-type Classification. Our\nbaseline models demonstrate the challenging nature of these tasks and the\nusefulness of our dataset for model evaluations in low-resource settings with\nlimited number of training data.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IFfObYQvYMWdnhzxAs33mJpEc1me9aUOVpm_gc7uD0Y","pdfSize":"1505469"}
