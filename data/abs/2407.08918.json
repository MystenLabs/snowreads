This paper tackles the challenge of crafting efficient knowledge\ntransfer mechanisms within EMaTO, a task complicated by the computational\ndemands of individual task evaluations. We introduce a novel framework that\nemploys a complex network to comprehensively analyze the dynamics of knowledge\ntransfer between tasks within EMaTO. By extracting and scrutinizing the\nknowledge transfer network from existing EMaTO algorithms, we evaluate the\ninfluence of network modifications on overall algorithmic efficacy. Our\nfindings indicate that these networks are diverse, displaying\ncommunity-structured directed graph characteristics, with their network density\nadapting to different task sets. This research underscores the viability of\nintegrating complex network concepts into EMaTO to refine knowledge transfer\nprocesses, paving the way for future advancements in the domain.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"vC4qVi_L6z3ia4djvG4NvdU85aNWBIDZ5ChBnLiP5t8","pdfSize":"2027525","objectId":"0xfb9fff7cf84a8ed637ae4cd48511f3625b7cf7f7d39204881f2f3deff23bd8c1","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
