Here, in contrast, we\npropose to use localized nature of topological junction states for sensing\napplications. We report a systematic topological classification of a wide class\nof graphene nanoribbons represented by already synthesized extended chevron\nspecies. By using this classification, we theoretically model a double-junction\ntransport device that shows enhanced interaction with NO$_2$ molecule. Our\nresults show that topological junction states of nanoribbons can open an avenue\nfor topological sensing and junction-assisted chemistry applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_skOEcnm5WPCLNZOm-gp8nFKhTfR23OuIV91cN1h8i4","pdfSize":"6889352"}
