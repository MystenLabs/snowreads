In addition to a\nquantum dynamical treatment of electrons and selected protons, this approach\nallows for the classical movement of all other nuclei to be taken into account\nin simulations of condensed matter systems. Furthermore, we introduce a\nLagrangian formulation for the traveling proton basis approach and propose new\nschemes to enhance its application for extended periodic systems. Validation\nand proof-of-principle applications are performed on electronically excited\nproton transfer in the o-hydroxybenzaldehyde molecule with explicit solvating\nwater molecules. These simulations demonstrate the importance of solvation\ndynamics and a quantum treatment of transferring protons. This work broadens\nthe applicability of the NEO Ehrenfest dynamics approach for studying complex\nheterogeneous systems in the condensed phase.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PkM_DCg4LbRRV0q0GeMuRYwnuLinWDOGQAID9jd7_S8","pdfSize":"971554"}
