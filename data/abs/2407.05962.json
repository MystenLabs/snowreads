A consequence of this property is a\nduality correspondence between one-dimensional Galilean and Carrollian fluids.\nWe describe the dynamics of these systems as they emerge from the relevant\nlimits of Lorentzian hydrodynamics, and explore the advertised duality\nrelationship. This interchanges longitudinal and transverse directions with\nrespect to the flow velocity, and permutes equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium\nobservables, unveiling specific features of Carrollian physics. We investigate\nthe action of local hydrodynamic-frame transformations in the Galilean and\nCarrollian configurations, i.e. dual Galilean and Carrollian local boosts, and\ncomment on their potential breaking. Emphasis is laid on the additional\ngeometric elements that are necessary to attain complete systems of\nhydrodynamic equations in Newton-Cartan and Carroll spacetimes. Our analysis is\nconducted in general Cartan frames as well as in more explicit coordinates,\nspecifically suited to Galilean or Carrollian use.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5t5BtdI1HYVxwa3rw9if51LDQZ8I7y_PsmQPiimtO44","pdfSize":"324127"}
