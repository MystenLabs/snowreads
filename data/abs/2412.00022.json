A unitarily equivalent linear relation is introduced\nfor GISs. It is shown that the solutions of the corresponding differential\nequations are continuously dependent on distributions and measures under\ncertain conditions. Using these results, the convergence of unitarily\nequivalent linear relations for GISs is discussed. By the perturbation theory\nto closed linear relations, an asymptotic stability result concerning the\nspectra of linear relations for GISs is obtained.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YhMB4sSqvtXvtK7-vPOSp71uD0kErmCDu2UoyxySsr8","pdfSize":"190740"}
