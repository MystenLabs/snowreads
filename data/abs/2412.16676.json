  "abstract": "  This paper investigates a class of degenerate forward-backward diffusion\nequations with a nonlinear source term, proposed as a model for removing\nmultiplicative noise in images. Based on Rothe's method, the relaxation\ntheorem, and Schauder's fixed-point theorem, we establish the existence of\nYoung measure solutions for the corresponding initial boundary problem. The\ncontinuous dependence result relies on the independence property satisfied by\nthe Young measure solution. Numerical experiments illustrate the denoising\neffectiveness of our model compared to other denoising models.\n",
