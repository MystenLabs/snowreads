To address these\nissues, we adhere to an outstanding Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) design\nparadigm and propose a novel network named A4-Unet. In A4-Unet, Deformable\nLarge Kernel Attention (DLKA) is incorporated in the encoder, allowing for\nimproved capture of multi-scale tumors. Swin Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SSPP)\nwith cross-channel attention is employed in a bottleneck further to study\nlong-distance dependencies within images and channel relationships. To enhance\naccuracy, a Combined Attention Module (CAM) with Discrete Cosine Transform\n(DCT) orthogonality for channel weighting and convolutional element-wise\nmultiplication is introduced for spatial weighting in the decoder. Attention\ngates (AG) are added in the skip connection to highlight the foreground while\nsuppressing irrelevant background information. The proposed network is\nevaluated on three authoritative MRI brain tumor benchmarks and a proprietary\ndataset, and it achieves a 94.4% Dice score on the BraTS 2020 dataset, thereby\nestablishing multiple new state-of-the-art benchmarks.
