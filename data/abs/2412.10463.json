In this paper, we develop a comprehensive\ntheoretical framework for the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect,\nextending previous classical models to a fully quantum description. By\nquantizing the gravitational field and modeling its interaction with atomic\nstates, we derive a formulation for the gravitational AB phase mediated by\ngravitons. This framework uncovers key insights into the entanglement dynamics\nand coherence properties of quantum systems in weak gravitational fields. Our\nanalysis suggests that the derived gravitational AB phase is consistent with\nclassical predictions but reveals subtle quantum features, providing a robust\nbasis for exploring the quantum nature of perturbative gravity. These findings\noffer a conceptual pathway for indirect detection of gravitons, enriching our\nunderstanding of gravity's quantum underpinnings.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NkLbmiaJzpCWZujehUiceQfxyu3SsRAQK1IieRd3AiA","pdfSize":"594041"}
