These systems often\ninvolve strong coupling at long distances, where the bulk and defects interact,\nmaking analytical studies challenging. By carefully analyzing the behavior of\nbulk symmetries in the presence of defects, we uncover robust topological\nconstraints on defect RG flows. Specifically, we introduce the notions of\n$\\textit{defect anomalies}$ and $\\textit{strongly symmetric defects}$, both of\nwhich are RG-invariant. Several known notions, such as higher-form symmetries,\nfractionalization, and projective lines, are revealed to be manifestations of\ndefect anomalies, which also encompass novel phenomena and forbid trivial\ndefect dynamics in the IR. Meanwhile, strongly symmetric defects are shown to\nremain coupled at low energies, imposing powerful dynamical constraints. We\nverify our findings through concrete examples: exactly solvable defect RG flows\nin (1+1)d Conformal Field Theories with strongly symmetric lines and a surface\ndefect in (2+1)d scalar QED.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oOAs3vNHWBm2HFzhqiPJnhT8fGMKyV9eVEGupjg2fpA","pdfSize":"793017"}
