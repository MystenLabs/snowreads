Meanwhile, such mechanics will increase the crosstalk\nbetween atoms and enhance the decoherence. In this paper, we propose a new\nscheme to realize the controlled-phase gate without Rydberg blockade. The\nscheme works effectively with large atomic spacings and is insensitive to the\nthermal motions of atoms. The proposal is robust against random noises due to\nthe geometric characteristic and operates fast based on the non-adiabatic\nevolution. The proposed gate is actually a new-type geometric gate that\nconsolidates the non-adiabatic holonomic control and the unconventional\ngeometric control simultaneously. The interference between two different types\nof geometric phases can be investigated. Furthermore, we show that the scheme\nwith weak Rydberg interaction requires much less physical resources than the\npresent Rydberg blockade scheme. Therefore, our proposal provides a fast and\nrobust way to realize geometric quantum control, and it may trigger the\ndiscoveries of new geometric gates in high-dimensional Hilbert space.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"5EkdqZjXzhh1WP4bBjrmdLgxenykO6OcL3_wYKyUYVU","pdfSize":"666899"}
