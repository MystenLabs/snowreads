Of particular\ninterest are the systems that are capable to exhibit such bistable effects as\nspontaneous vibrations, stochastic resonance and spontaneous synchronization.\nPreviously, in all-atom molecular dynamics simulations it has been demonstrated\nthat short pyridine-furan springs show these bistable phenomena. In this\narticle we introduce a coarse-grained model of such springs and investigate the\npossibility to observe the bistability effects, such as spontaneous vibrations.\nOur findings allow the studies of short pyridine-furan springs at large time\nand length scales and open field for further computational research of large\nbistable systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lRRuqa_AkaJQT5NpWsLQfluvI-elijfIvuuBWyyeF40","pdfSize":"616126"}
