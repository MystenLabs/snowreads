How this happens remains a mystery. Here,\nto shed light on this problem, we investigate the photospheric vector\nmagnetograms of the Moreton wave events associated with M- and X-class solar\nflares in 2010--2023. The H$\\alpha$ data are taken with the Global Oscillation\nNetwork Group (GONG) and the Chinese H$\\alpha$ Solar Explorer (CHASE). Our\nstatistical results show that more than 80\\% of the events occur at the edge of\nactive regions and propagate non-radially due to asymmetric magnetic fields\nabove the flares. According to the reconstructed magnetic field and atmospheric\nmodel, Moreton waves propagate in the direction along which the horizontal\nfast-mode wave speed drops the fastest. The result supports that the inclined\nmagnetic configuration of the eruption is crucial to generate Moreton waves,\neven for X-class flares. It may explain the low occurrence rate of Moreton\nwaves and why some X-class flares accompanied with coronal mass ejections\n(CMEs) do not generate Moreton waves.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"O3lGmasp7O73cd5ZAUyxbplzBOV_9CGScLAU1zEiZOk","pdfSize":"9853616"}
