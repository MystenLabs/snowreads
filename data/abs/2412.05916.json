However, their translation quality is sometimes\nquestioned, as the generated outputs may deviate from expressions typically\nused by native speakers. These deviations often arise from differences in\nsentence structure between language systems. To address this issue, we propose\nParaAlign Translator, a method that fine-tunes LLMs to paraphrase sentences,\naligning their structures with those of the target language systems. This\napproach improves the performance of subsequent translations. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed method enhances the LLaMA-3-8B model's\nperformance in both resource-rich and low-resource scenarios and achieves\nparity with or surpassing the much larger LLaMA-3-70B model.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MCu5I0UhCLXNlb3WhZ9sCZXuxo1VjsJJJsjJFFvjTLo","pdfSize":"208089"}
