  "abstract": "  Point-based interactive colorization techniques allow users to effortlessly\ncolorize grayscale images using user-provided color hints. However, point-based\nmethods often face challenges when different colors are given to semantically\nsimilar areas, leading to color intermingling and unsatisfactory results-an\nissue we refer to as color collapse. The fundamental cause of color collapse is\nthe inadequacy of points for defining the boundaries for each color. To\nmitigate color collapse, we introduce a lasso tool that can control the scope\nof each color hint. Additionally, we design a framework that leverages the\nuser-provided lassos to localize the attention masks. The experimental results\nshow that using a single lasso is as effective as applying 4.18 individual\ncolor hints and can achieve the desired outcomes in 30% less time than using\npoints alone.\n",
