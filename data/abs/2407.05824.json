Most of its analytical aspects are considered either self-evident, or\nminutiae that are better left to specialised textbooks. But what if the\nevidence provided by trusted sources disagrees? In this note I set out to\nverify results about the Negative Binomial regression specification presented\nin widely-cited academic sources. I identify problems in how these sources\napproach the gamma function and its derivatives, with repercussions on the\nFisher Information Matrix that may ultimately affect statistical testing. By\nelevating computations that are rarely specified in full, I provide\nrecommendations to improve methodological evidence that is typically presented\nwithout proof.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"R4BoRLED7mcjOIt0rTT_5TWuuw3kIBryWKz-WsU8IK0","pdfSize":"195034"}
