  "abstract": "  The rapid advancement of Generative AI (Gen AI) technologies, particularly\ntools like ChatGPT, is significantly impacting the labor market by reshaping\njob roles and skill requirements. This study examines the demand for\nChatGPT-related skills in the U.S. labor market by analyzing job advertisements\ncollected from major job platforms between May and December 2023. Using text\nmining and topic modeling techniques, we extracted and analyzed the Gen\nAI-related skills that employers are hiring for. Our analysis identified five\ndistinct ChatGPT-related skill sets: general familiarity, creative content\ngeneration, marketing, advanced functionalities (such as prompt engineering),\nand product development. In addition, the study provides insights into job\nattributes such as occupation titles, degree requirements, salary ranges, and\nother relevant job characteristics. These findings highlight the increasing\nintegration of Gen AI across various industries, emphasizing the growing need\nfor both foundational knowledge and advanced technical skills. The study offers\nvaluable insights into the evolving demands of the labor market, as employers\nseek candidates equipped to leverage generative AI tools to improve\nproductivity, streamline processes, and drive innovation.\n",
