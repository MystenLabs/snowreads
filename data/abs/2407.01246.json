Embedded within\nthe flat tile of the closed divertor chamber, the RFEA captures \\(T_i\\)\nprofiles across various plasma scenarios, including transitions to the Super-X\nconfiguration. Measurements were conducted under steady-state and transient\nplasma conditions characterized by a plasma current (\\(I_p\\)) of 750 kA,\nelectron density (\\(n_e\\)) between \\(2.2 \\times 10^{19}\\) and \\(4.45 \\times\n10^{19}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}\\), and Neutral Beam Injection (NBI) power ranging from\n3.0 MW to 3.2 MW. The ion temperatures, peaking at approximately 20 eV in\nsteady state, were compared with electron temperatures (\\(T_e\\)) obtained from\nLangmuir probes (LP) at identical radial positions. The study also examined ion\nsaturation current density (\\(J_{\\text{sat}}\\)) signals to using methodologies\nsimilar to previous MAST experiments. Preliminary findings reveal a \\(T_i/T_e\\)\nratio ranging from 1 to 2.5. Additionally, high temporal resolution\nmeasurements (100 $\\mu s$) captured the dynamics of Edge Localized Modes\n(ELMs), showing \\(T_i\\) peaks at 16.03 +- 1.84 eV during ELM events, nearly\nthree times higher than inter-ELM temperatures.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QJN8XgIPPXxzT_xDEzpAmunQIylom943yDwIE9MdWT4","pdfSize":"5358981"}
