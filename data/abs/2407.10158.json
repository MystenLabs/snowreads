The $h$-mass with norm $h$ can be defined in different ways,\nresulting in three functionals $\\mathcal{M}_h,|\\cdot|_H$, and $\\mathbb{M}_h$,\nwhose equality is the main result of this article: $\\mathcal{M}_h$ is a\nfunctional on $1$-currents in the spirit of Federer and Fleming, norm\n$|\\cdot|_H$ denotes the total variation of a Radon measure with respect to $H$\ninduced by $h$, and $\\mathbb{M}_h$ is a mass on flat $1$-chains in the sense of\nWhitney. On top we introduce a new and improved notion of calibrations for the\nmulti-material transport problem: we identify calibrations with (weak)\nJacobians of optimizers of the associated convex dual problem, which yields\ntheir existence and natural regularity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9rB44YeWfSXsT1RGscNnMev5iR_1a0I8gW11altzsxM","pdfSize":"459785"}
