During operation, the emergence of\nlocalization is difficult to predict, partly because of changing parameters\nover the life cycle of a system. This work proposes a novel, network-based\napproach to predicting an imminent localized vibration. Synthetic measurement\ndata is used to generate a functional network, which captures the dynamic\ninterplay of the machine parts, complementary to their geometric coupling.\nAnalysis of these functional networks reveals an impending localized vibration\nand its location. The method is demonstrated using a model system for a bladed\ndisk, a ring composed of coupled nonlinear Duffing oscillators. Results\nindicate that the proposed method is robust against small parameter\nuncertainties, added measurement noise, and the length of the measurement data\nsamples.
