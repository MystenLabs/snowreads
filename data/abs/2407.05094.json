They are thought to be reddened by dust, whether in tori of\nactive galactic nuclei or the interstellar medium (ISM), though none have\ndirect dust detections to date. Informed by the average characteristics of 675\nLRDs drawn from the literature, we provide ballpark constraints on the dust\ncharacteristics of the LRD population and estimate they have average dust\nmasses of $\\langle M_{\\rm dust}\\rangle=(1.6^{+4.8}_{-0.9})\\times10^{4}\nM_\\odot$, luminosities of $\\langle L_{\\rm IR}\\rangle=(8^{+3}_{-5})\\times10^{10}\nL_\\odot$ and temperatures of $\\langle T_{\\rm dust}\\rangle=110^{+21}_{-36}$ K.\nNotably, the spectral energy distributions are thought to peak at $\\sim$100 K\n(rest-frame 20-30 $\\mu$m) regardless of heating mechanism, whether AGN or star\nformation. LRDs' compact sizes $R_{\\rm eff}\\sim100$ pc are the dominant factor\ncontributing to their low estimated dust masses. Our predictions likely mean\nLRDs have, on average, submillimeter emission a factor of $\\sim$100$\\times$\nfainter than current ALMA limits provide. The star-to-dust ratio is a factor\n$\\sim$100$\\times$ larger than expected from dust formation models if one\nassumes the rest-optical light is dominated by stars; this suggests stars do\nnot dominate. Despite their high apparent volume density, LRDs contribute\nnegligibly (0.1%) to the cosmic dust budget at $z\\gtrsim4$ due to their low\ndust masses.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Gh9Bi7dD-R5tIGbGuhDCCM4D03fZenGt4zU5UTdceQg","pdfSize":"8777480"}
