  "abstract": "  We study and classify the emergence of protected edge modes at the junction\nof one-dimensional materials. Using symmetries of Lagrangian planes in boundary\nsymplectic spaces, we present a novel proof of the periodic table of\ntopological insulators in one dimension. We show that edge modes necessarily\narise at the junction of two materials having different topological indices.\nOur approach provides a systematic framework for understanding\nsymmetry-protected modes in one-dimension. It does not rely on periodic nor\nergodicity and covers a wide range of operators which includes both continuous\nand discrete models.\n",
