In this paper, we revisit deep NRSfM from two perspectives to address\nthe limitations of current deep NRSfM methods : (1) canonicalization and (2)\nsequence modeling. We propose an easy-to-implement per-sequence\ncanonicalization method as opposed to the previous per-dataset canonicalization\napproaches. With this in mind, we propose a sequence modeling method that\ncombines temporal information and subspace constraint. As a result, we have\nachieved a more optimal NRSfM reconstruction pipeline compared to previous\nefforts. The effectiveness of our method is verified by testing the\nsequence-to-sequence deep NRSfM pipeline with corresponding regularization\nmodules on several commonly used datasets.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pnchbHqA5zdnCwebD04D-1CL4yK9Il1ydcBOqRpCVAg","pdfSize":"3089519"}
