It opened\nmany interesting questions such as, could a macroscopic superposition like a\ndead and alive cat ever exist? What would be the characteristic features of\nsuch a system? The field of macroscopicity aims at providing answers to those\nquestions, both from a theoretical and an experimental point of view. Here, we\npresent the main concepts in macroscopicity, including macroscopicity measures,\nexperimental realizations and the link to metrology, from a pedagogical\nperspective. We provide visualizations and intuitive explanations, together\nwith a hands-on activity where students can create their own macroscopic\nquantum cats from cardboard cells that are in a superposition of being dead and\nalive.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6tJwso4RtA7f-cqIHTVj1qT-SMbNRhQpsAvciucvgNY","pdfSize":"6563722"}
