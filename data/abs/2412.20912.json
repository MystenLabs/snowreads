  "abstract": "  Motions of visually coupled zebrafish pairs are studied to understand the\neffects of information exchange on their behavior as a function of their\nminimal separation ($d$). We find that when $d$ is small, the pair can display\na leader-follower relation (LFR) with trajectories of almost synchronized form.\nHowever, with larger $d$, although the same LFR is still maintained, the\noriginally similar trajectories turn into different forms. Detailed analysis of\ntheir motion trajectories suggests that the pair might be using U-turns (UTs)\nto exchange information and to maintain a LFR at the same time. A simulation\nmodel based on UTs with inferred and proposed rules is able to reproduce\nprominent features of observed trajectories; indicating that the transition of\ntrajectories can be understood as the result of a change in information\nexchange between the fish as $d$ increases. Our finding that UTs as important\nvisual signals is consistent with the fact that UTs can induce a large amount\nof firings in retinas of observing fish.\n",
