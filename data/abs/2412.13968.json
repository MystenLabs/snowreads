  "abstract": "  The timeline of the expansion rate ultimately defines the interplay between\nhigh energy physics, astrophysics and cosmology. The guiding theme of this\ntopical review is provided by the scrutiny of the early history of the\nspace-time curvature through the diffuse backgrounds of gravitational radiation\nthat are sensitive to all the stages of the evolution of the plasma. Due to\ntheir broad spectrum (extending from the aHz region to the THz domain) they\nbridge the macroworld described by general relativity and the microworld of the\nfundamental constituents of matter. It is argued that during the next score\nyear the analysis of the relic gravitons may infirm or confirm the current\nparadigm where a radiation plasma is assumed to dominate the whole\npost-inflationary epoch. The role of high frequency and ultra-high frequency\nsignals between the MHz and the THz is emphasized in the perspective of quantum\nsensing. The multiparticle final state of the relic gravitons and its\nmacroscopic quantumness is also discussed with particular attention to the\ninterplay between the entanglement entropy and the maximal frequency of the\nspectrum.\n",
