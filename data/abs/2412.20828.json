  "abstract": "  High-throughput decoding of BCH codes necessitates efficient and\nparallelizable decoders. However, the algebraic rigidity of BCH codes poses\nsignificant challenges to applying parallel belief propagation variants. To\naddress this, we propose a systematic design scheme for constructing\nparity-check matrices using a heuristic approach. This involves a sequence of\nbinary sum operations and row cyclic shifts on the standard parity-check\nmatrix, aiming to generate a redundant, low-density, and quasi-regular matrix\nwith significantly fewer length-4 cycles. The relationships between frame error\nrate, rank deficiency of minimum-weight dual-code codewords, and row redundancy\nare empirically analyzed. For the revised normalized min-sum decoder, we\nintroduce three types of random automorphisms applied to decoder inputs. These\nare unpacked and aggregated by summing messages after each iteration, achieving\na 1-2dB improvement in bit error rate compared to parallelizable counterparts\nand two orders of magnitude faster convergence in iterations than iterative\nrivals. Additionally, undetected errors are highlighted as a non-negligible\nissue for very short BCH codes.\n",
