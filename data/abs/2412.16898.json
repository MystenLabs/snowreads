  "abstract": "  Sensitive and cost-effective Group-IV short-wave infrared (SWIR)\nphotodetectors (PDs), compatible with complementary metal-oxide semiconductor\n(CMOS) processes, are crucial for various emerging applications. Here, we\ndeveloped a black GeSn thin-film PD on silicon, optimised for efficient SWIR\nphotodetection and imaging. Incorporating Sn into the Ge layer effectively\nextended the photodetection range to 1960 nm. The blackening of the GeSn\nsurface resulted in a substantial reduction of reflection loss across a broad\nspectral range of 1200-2200 nm. Furthermore, the responsivity experienced a\nremarkable increase of 1.45 times through reduced reflection loss and carrier\nmultiplication by the carrier ionization. The black GeSn surface significantly\nboosts the detectivity, enhances the wide-angle SWIR photodetection, and\nimproves the quality of the resultant images. This demonstration heralds a new\nera for CMOS-compatible, cost-effective, high-performance black GeSn PDs and\nimagers for a wide range of applications in the underexplored SWIR region.\n",
