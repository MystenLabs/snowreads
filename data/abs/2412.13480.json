  "abstract": "  We construct fully-discrete schemes for the Benjamin-Ono, Calogero-Sutherland\nDNLS, and cubic Szeg\\H{o} equations on the torus, which are $\\textit{exact in\ntime}$ with $\\textit{spectral accuracy}$ in space. We prove spectral\nconvergence for the first two equations, of order $K^{-s+1}$ for initial data\nin $H^s(\\mathbb T)$, with an error constant depending $\\textit{linearly}$ on\nthe final time instead of exponentially. These schemes are based on\n$\\textit{explicit formulas}$, which have recently emerged in the theory of\nnonlinear integrable equations. Numerical simulations show the strength of the\nnewly designed methods both at short and long time scales. These schemes open\ndoors for the understanding of the long-time dynamics of integrable equations.\n",
