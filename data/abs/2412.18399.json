Using the intralayer BCS-like\npairing interaction and employing the Gor'kov formalism, we obtain analytical\nexpressions for the temperature Green's functions and determine the gap\nfunction $\\Delta$ which becomes complex in the presence of SOIs. In the absence\nof SOIs, $\\Delta$ is isotropic at both zero and finite temperatures, but it\nbecomes anisotropic even in the presence of a single SOI. This anisotropy is\nrelated to the extra $\\cos{k_z}$ factors in which the $k_z$ momentum along the\n$z$ direction contributes to the magnitude of the gap function. It is also\nfound that SOIs suppress $\\Delta$ at both zero and finite temperatures, and for\ncertain critical values of SOIs and beyond $\\Delta$ vanishes. Analytical\nexpressions for the critical values of SOIs at zero temperature are obtained.\nAdditionally, how the BCS equation for layered superconductors changes in the\npresence of SOIs is determined.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yt3sLH8XCsfbY6p7on5rd5AQG__EVSShXSEDRHmnAlk","pdfSize":"587324"}
