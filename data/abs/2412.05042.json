Damage detection systems, powered by computer vision and deep\nlearning, can assist experts in this endeavor. However, the lack of extensive,\nlabeled datasets poses a challenge to the development of these systems. In this\nstudy, we introduce a technique for generating semi-synthetic images to be used\nas data augmentation during the training of a damage detection system. We\nspecifically aim to generate images of cracks, which are a prevalent and\nindicative form of damage. The central concept is to employ parametric\nmeta-annotations to guide the process of generating cracks on 3D models of\nreal-word structures. The governing parameters of these meta-annotations can be\nadjusted iteratively to yield images that are optimally suited for improving\ndetectors' performance. Comparative evaluations demonstrated that a crack\ndetection system trained with a combination of real and semi-synthetic images\noutperforms a system trained on real images alone.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"UpTZIZCytDo6BBm-rFx3MSMvA9AMvOErobZyTPwBqN8","pdfSize":"2608838"}
