This region controls the inner core structure of the kink. We\nstudy how the disappearance of analyticity in this region of the potential\naffects the resonant features in $K\\bar{K}$ scattering.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Fv0nzXKx_uQu4NntGALXy7pBFkCzrH-o4dIw3vAH87k","pdfSize":"14015318","objectId":"0x501ff6991f75a19f181f0361c8aa6631b10606b51e3bd1441df6e3168a1f86dd","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
