  "abstract": "  Thin film ferroelectric devices with ultralow power operation, non-volatile\ndata retention and fast and reliable switching are attractive for non-volatile\nmemory and as synaptic weight elements. However, low thermal budget\nferroelectric oxides suffer from crystalline inhomogeneity and defects that\nmakes their large-scale circuit integration challenging. Here, we report on the\nthermally engineered way to induce wafer-scale homogeneity in\nHf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$ capacitors that can lead to high device reliability\nmaking their integration possible in ultralow power memory and neuromorphic\ncomputing hardware.\n",
