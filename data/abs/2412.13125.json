  "abstract": "  A research shows the phase space of the system. The phase space of such a\nsystem is determined by the development structure of four subsystems with\ndifferent objective functions. The control loop of such a system is formed.\nUsing the control loop, optimal control is generated. The dynamic control\nregion is calculated on the basis of a matrix determining the structure of the\ndevelopment of a multidimensional dynamic system. It was established that the\noptimal distribution by R. Bellman's method allows increasing the increase in\nthe value of the objective function over 5 years by 85% from the initial value\nwith a decrease in the distributed resource by 20%. It is believed that the\nconstruction of railways leads to an increase in gross regional product by 2%,\nbut the authors proved that it is possible to increase this figure to 7-8%\n",
