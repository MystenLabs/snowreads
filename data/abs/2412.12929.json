The answer to such a query in a model of a\nknowledge base is either an integer or $\\infty$, and its spectrum is the set of\nits answers over all models. While it is unclear how to compute and manipulate\nsuch a set in general, we identify a class of counting queries whose spectra\ncan be effectively represented. Focusing on atomic counting queries, we\npinpoint the possible shapes of a spectrum over $\\mathcal{ALCIF}$ ontologies:\nthey are essentially the subsets of $\\mathbb{N} \\cup \\{ \\infty \\}$ closed under\naddition. For most sublogics of $\\mathcal{ALCIF}$, we show that possible\nspectra enjoy simpler shapes, being $[ m, \\infty ]$ or variations thereof. To\nobtain our results, we refine constructions used for finite model reasoning and\nnotably rely on a cycle-reversion technique for the Horn fragment of\n$\\mathcal{ALCIF}$. We also study the data complexity of computing the proposed\neffective representation and establish the\n$\\mathsf{FP}^{\\mathsf{NP}[\\log]}$-completeness of this task under several\nsettings.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Computational Complexity","Computer Science/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"P85vLUAan1DmEQmTKCxnVkH-wMigp8PgjYO5w-JWf3w","pdfSize":"393213"}
