Here we discuss on general grounds how\n$Q_\\mathrm{L}$ of a planar microwave resonator made of a conventional\nsuperconductor should depend on temperature and frequency. We consider\ncontributions to $Q_\\mathrm{L}$ due to dissipation by thermal quasiparticles\n($Q_\\mathrm{QP}$), due to residual dissipation ($Q_\\mathrm{Res}$), and due to\ncoupling ($Q_\\mathrm{C}$). We present experimental data obtained with\nsuperconducting stripline resonators fabricated from lead (Pb), with different\ncenter conductor widths and different coupling gaps. We probe the resonators at\nvarious harmonics between 0.7 GHz and 6 GHz and at temperatures between 1.5 K\nand 7 K. We find a strongly frequency- and temperature-dependent\n$Q_\\mathrm{L}$, which we can describe by a lumped-element model. For certain\nresonators at lowest temperatures we observe a maximum in the\nfrequency-dependent $Q_\\mathrm{L}$ when $Q_\\mathrm{Res}$ and $Q_\\mathrm{C}$\nmatch, and here the measured $Q_\\mathrm{L}$ can exceed $2\\times 10^5$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1w8nhSmIQf6nViW5bTPXx6dzpAkZjpKxgEexLWvxwys","pdfSize":"948011"}
