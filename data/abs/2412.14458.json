  "abstract": "  An abstraction for multisensor communication termed the Gaussian Multiplex\nChannel is presented and analyzed. In this model, the sensor outputs can be\nadded together in any combination through a network of switches, and the\ncombinations can be changed arbitrarily during the observation interval. The\nsensor output sums are observed in additive Gaussian noise. Using a mean square\nerror cost function and a constraint on the total observation time, an optimal\nset of combinations (switch positions) and observation times is determined. The\nsolution exhibits high complexity (number of different combinations) even for\nmoderate numbers of sensors. It is then shown that there exists an alternative\nsolution based on Hadamard designs, which achieves the same minimizing MSE cost\nfunction and only requires a number of combinations equal to the number of\nsensors.\n",
