Both methods rely on\nFreedman--Quinn's disc embedding theorem. These are the lecture notes for a\nminicourse giving an introduction to both methods, by sketching the proofs of\nthe following results: every primitive second homology class in a closed,\nsimply connected 4-manifold is represented by a locally flat torus\n(Lee--Wilczy\\'{n}ski); and every Alexander polynomial one knot in $S^3$ is\ntopologically slice (Freedman--Quinn).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9bhORjd_FRtX3kSOMUj6_bzCJJkcQgEnD7gvx6rLAFs","pdfSize":"2996098"}
