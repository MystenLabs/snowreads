We show that neutrino flavor\nconversion inside the proto-neutron star (PNS), motivated by physics Beyond the\nStandard Model (BSM), can significantly boost PNS convection. This effect leads\nto large-amplitude GW emission over a wide frequency range during an otherwise\nrelatively quiescent GW phase shortly after core bounce. Such a signal provides\na promising new avenue for exploring nonstandard neutrino phenomena and other\nBSM physics impacting PNS convection.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"i7P8W-GMqftiJcW4SyHh4dHPW4LATPrFbj9VWux-oLA","pdfSize":"7521405"}
