This\ngroundbreaking method offers unique advantages such as nonlocal RF signal\nencoding and robust resistance to dispersion-induced frequency fading. This\npaper explores the versatility of processing the quantum microwave photonic\nsignal by utilizing coincidence window selection on the biphoton coincidence\ndistribution. The demonstration includes finely-tunable RF phase shifting,\nflexible multi-tap transversal filtering (with up to 15 taps), and photonically\nimplemented RF mixing, leveraging the nonlocal RF mapping characteristic of\nQMWP. These accomplishments significantly enhance the capability of microwave\nphotonic systems in processing ultra-weak signals, opening up new possibilities\nfor various applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JM4uIa_Q84fdeV62kkVQSqCqmosuOg30glgHduRHkzw","pdfSize":"1167172"}
