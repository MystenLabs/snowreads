  "abstract": "  This study explores the suitability of hydrogen-based plasma in direct power\nextraction (DPE) as a non-conventional electricity generation method. We apply\ncomputational modeling and principles in physics and chemistry to estimate\ndifferent thermal and electric properties of a\nwater-vapor/nitrogen/cesium-vapor (H2O/N2/Cs) gas mixture with different levels\nof cesium (Cs) at a fixed temperature of 2300 K (2026.85 {\\deg}C). This gas\nmixture and temperature are selected because they resemble the stoichiometric\ncombustion of hydrogen with air, followed by the addition of the alkali metal\nelement cesium to allow ionization, thus converting the gas mixture into\nelectrically conducting plasma. We vary the cesium mole fraction in the gas\nmixture by two orders of magnitude, from a minute amount of 0.0625% (1/1600) to\na major amount of 16% (0.16). We use these results to further estimate the\ntheoretical upper limit of the electric power output from a unit volume of a\nhigh-speed magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) channel, with the plasma accelerated\ninside it to twice the local speed of sound (Mach number 2) while subject to an\napplied magnetic field of 5 T (5 teslas). We report that there is an optimum\ncesium mole fraction of 3%, at which the power output is maximized. Per 1 m3 of\nplasma volume, the estimated theoretical electric power generation at 1 atm\n(101.325 kPa) pressure of the hydrogen-combustion mixture is extraordinarily\nhigh at 360 MW/m3, and the plasma electric conductivity is 17.5 S/m. This\nestimated power generation even reaches an impressive level of 1.15 GW/m3\n(11500 MW/m3) if the absolute pressure can be decreased to 0.0625 atm (6.333\nkPa), at which the electric conductivity exceeds 55 S/m (more than 10 times the\nelectric conductivity of seawater).\n",
