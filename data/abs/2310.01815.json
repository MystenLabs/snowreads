NFTs serve as the foundational framework that has revolutionized\nthe market for digital art, enabling artists to showcase and monetize their\ncreations in unprecedented ways. NFTs combine metadata stored on the blockchain\nwith off-chain data, such as images, to create a novel form of digital\nownership. It is not fully understood how these factors come together to\ndetermine NFT prices. In this study, we analyze both on-chain and off-chain\ndata of NFT collections trading on OpenSea to understand what influences NFT\npricing. Our results show that while text and image data of the NFTs can be\nused to explain price variations within collections, the extracted features do\nnot generalize to new, unseen collections. Furthermore, we find that an NFT\ncollection's trading volume often relates to its online presence, like social\nmedia followers and website traffic.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"OJXoG6EBncRGMRlJ_ULr0EkADlxwXI4Pp4fussEdaP8","pdfSize":"226055"}
