  "abstract": "  Dense QCD matter may exhibit crystalline phases. Their existence is reflected\nin a moat regime, where mesonic correlations feature spatial modulations. We\nstudy the realtime properties of pions at finite temperature and density in QCD\nin order to elucidate the nature of this regime. We show that the moat regime\narises from particle-hole-like fluctuations near the Fermi surface. This gives\nrise to a characteristic peak in the spectral function of the pion at nonzero\n\\emph{spacelike} momentum. This peak can be interpreted as a new quasi\nparticle, the moaton. In addition, our framework also allows us to directly\ntest the stability of the homogeneous chiral phase against the formation of an\ninhomogeneous condensate in QCD. We find that the formation of such a phase is\nhighly unlikely for baryon chemical potentials $\\mu_B \\leq 630$\\,MeV.\n",
