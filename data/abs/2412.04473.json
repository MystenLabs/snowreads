{"id":"2412.04473","title":"Take Package as Language: Anomaly Detection Using Transformer","authors":"Jie Huang","authorsParsed":[["Huang","Jie",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2024 02:00:43 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-09","timestamp":1731636043000,"abstract":"  Network data packet anomaly detection faces numerous challenges, including\nexploring new anomaly supervision signals, researching weakly supervised\nanomaly detection, and improving model interpretability. This paper proposes\nNIDS-GPT, a GPT-based causal language model for network intrusion detection.\nUnlike previous work, NIDS-GPT innovatively treats each number in the packet as\nan independent \"word\" rather than packet fields, enabling a more fine-grained\ndata representation. We adopt an improved GPT-2 model and design special\ntokenizers and embedding layers to better capture the structure and semantics\nof network data. NIDS-GPT has good scalability, supports unsupervised\npre-training, and enhances model interpretability through attention weight\nvisualization. Experiments on the CICIDS2017 and car-hacking datasets show that\nNIDS-GPT achieves 100\\% accuracy under extreme imbalance conditions, far\nsurpassing traditional methods; it also achieves over 90\\% accuracy in one-shot\nlearning. These results demonstrate NIDS-GPT's excellent performance and\npotential in handling complex network anomaly detection tasks, especially in\ndata-imbalanced and resource-constrained scenarios.
