  "abstract": "  We study relative differential closure in the context of Hardy fields. Using\nour earlier work on algebraic differential equations over Hardy fields, this\nleads to a proof of a conjecture of Boshernitzan (1981): the intersection of\nall maximal analytic Hardy fields agrees with that of all maximal Hardy fields.\nWe also generalize a key ingredient in the proof, and describe a cautionary\nexample delineating the boundaries of its applicability.\n",
