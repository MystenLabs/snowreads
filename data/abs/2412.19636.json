  "abstract": "  This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of Magnetoplasmadynamic\nThrusters (MPDT), examining their working principles, performance\ncharacteristics, and potential applications in space propulsion. The study\nfocuses on both self-field and applied-field MPDT variants, detailing the\nfundamental physics of plasma generation, acceleration mechanisms through\nLorentz forces, and plasma detachment processes. Through mathematical modeling\nand experimental data analysis, the paper demonstrates MPDTs' capability to\nachieve high specific impulse and efficient propellant utilization compared to\nchemical propulsion systems. While highlighting their advantages for deep space\nmissions and satellite operations, the study also addresses key challenges,\nincluding high power requirements and thermal management issues. The research\nconcludes that despite current technological limitations, MPDTs show promising\npotential for future space exploration, particularly for long-duration missions\nrequiring sustained thrust.\n",
