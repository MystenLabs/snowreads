  "abstract": "  For a long time, the study of thermal effects at three-dimensional (3D)\nshort-ranged wetting transitions considered only the effect of interfacial\nfluctuations. We show that an entropic Casimir contribution, missed in previous\ntreatments, produces significant effects when it is included; in particular,\nmean-field predictions are no longer obtained when interfacial fluctuations are\nignored. The Casimir term arises from the many different microscopic\nconfigurations that correspond to a given interfacial one. By employing a\ncoarse-graining procedure, starting from a microscopic Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson\nHamiltonian, we identify the interfacial model for 3D wetting and the exact\nform of the Casimir term. The Casimir contribution does not alter the\nNakanishi-Fisher surface phase diagram; it significantly increases the\nadsorption near a first-order wetting transition and completely changes the\npredicted critical singularities of tricritical wetting, including the\nnonuniversality occurring in 3D arising from interfacial fluctuations. We\nillustrate how the Casimir term leads to a reappraisal of the critical\nsingularities at wetting transitions.\n",
