The climate emergency has\nmade it clear that unlimited use of resources (e.g., energy) for scientific\ndiscovery is no longer acceptable. Future computing hardware promises to be\nmuch more energy efficient, but without better optimized software this cannot\nreach its full potential. In this vision paper, we propose a generic AI-driven\nco-design methodology, using specialized Large Language Models (like ChatGPT),\nto effectively generate efficient code for emerging computing hardware. We\ndescribe how we will validate our methodology with two radio astronomy\napplications, with sustainability as the key performance indicator. This paper\nis a modified version of our accepted SuperCode project proposal. We present it\nhere in this form to introduce the vision behind this project and to\ndisseminate the work in the spirit of Open Science and transparency. An\nadditional aim is to collect feedback, invite potential collaboration partners\nand use-cases to join the project.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"TV9Vr8u90T-WP5pWOMGAddEnQymAQ35s6MImqg-bAsw","pdfSize":"8920369"}
