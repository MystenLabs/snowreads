  "abstract": "  Novel view synthesis (NVS) has shown significant promise for applications in\ncinematographic production, particularly through the exploitation of Neural\nRadiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting (GS). These methods model real 3D\nscenes, enabling the creation of new shots that are challenging to capture in\nthe real world due to set topology or expensive equipment requirement. This\ninnovation also offers cinematographic advantages such as smooth camera\nmovements, virtual re-shoots, slow-motion effects, etc. This paper explores\ndynamic NVS with the aim of facilitating the model selection process. We\nshowcase its potential through a short montage filmed using various NVS models.\n",
