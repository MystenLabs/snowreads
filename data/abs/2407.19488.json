It contributes to the\nunderstanding of Beauville's and Voisin's conjectures on the Chow rings of\nprojective hyper-K\\\"ahler manifolds and strict Calabi-Yau manifolds. It also\nstudies some birational invariants of projective hyper-K\\\"ahler manifolds.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PTpaKPxC1rYI6OfkfUV-gSubVZjpHsAnujUGW2i_zzg","pdfSize":"1000031"}
