To solve this issue, translating TPMS to STEP is\nneeded, called TPMS2STEP. This paper provides constraint matrices and\nconvergence proof of TPMS2STEP so that $C^2$ continuity and an error bound of\n$2\\epsilon$ on the deviation can be ensured during the translation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"OvucX2WjCLvfl2KUzoFEq4aDd3jeXeCrJsgELhHrqLg","pdfSize":"130213"}
