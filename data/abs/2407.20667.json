In this work, we investigate\nthe potential for identifying an alternative multivariate function for KAN\nneurons that may offer increased practical utility. Our empirical research\ninvolves testing various multivariate functions in KAN neurons across a range\nof benchmark Machine Learning tasks.\n  Our findings indicate that substituting the sum with the average function in\nKAN neurons results in significant performance enhancements compared to\ntraditional KANs. Our study demonstrates that this minor modification\ncontributes to the stability of training by confining the input to the spline\nwithin the effective range of the activation function.
