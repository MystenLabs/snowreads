  "abstract": "  Hadwiger's conjecture for the immersion relation posits that every graph $G$\ncontains an immersion of the complete graph $K_{\\chi(G)}$. Vergara showed that\nthis is equivalent to saying that every $n$-vertex graph $G$ with $\\alpha(G)=2$\ncontains an immersion of the complete graph on $\\lceil\\frac{n}{2}\\rceil$\nvertices. Recently, Botler et al. showed that every $n$-vertex graph $G$ with\n$\\alpha(G)=2$ contains every complete bipartite graph on\n$\\lceil\\frac{n}{2}\\rceil$ vertices as an immersion. In this paper, we give a\nmuch simpler proof of this result.\n",
