Such estimates effectively bound the\nsizes and oscillations of weak solutions, respectively. The proof relies on\ndemonstrating a new local H\\\"{o}lder estimate with an optimal $L^q$-Tail for\nweak solutions to the corresponding homogeneous problem, which remarkably\nextends the $L^\\infty$-Tail in previous work. It is worth mentioning that our\nmain results capture both local and nonlocal features of the double phase\nparabolic equations and, more importantly, remain valid for SOLA (Solutions\nObtained by Limit of Approximations).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1oa4zieD1AFNDh2ukt-syy8zFnEigqCoHdDKWUTcB24","pdfSize":"400244"}
