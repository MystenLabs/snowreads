This paper studies how\ncontextual information about the user influences the likelihood of an LLM to\nrefuse to execute a request. By generating user biographies that offer\nideological and demographic information, we find a number of biases in\nguardrail sensitivity on GPT-3.5. Younger, female, and Asian-American personas\nare more likely to trigger a refusal guardrail when requesting censored or\nillegal information. Guardrails are also sycophantic, refusing to comply with\nrequests for a political position the user is likely to disagree with. We find\nthat certain identity groups and seemingly innocuous information, e.g., sports\nfandom, can elicit changes in guardrail sensitivity similar to direct\nstatements of political ideology. For each demographic category and even for\nAmerican football team fandom, we find that ChatGPT appears to infer a likely\npolitical ideology and modify guardrail behavior accordingly.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"J--pRx3uQvrEfsfFGghMi6LPSBK3r5NrONSuo2KJVgI","pdfSize":"6555829"}
