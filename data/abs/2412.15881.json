  "abstract": "  Optomechanical cooling of multiple degenerate mechanical modes is prevented\nby the mechanical dark mode due to destructive interference. Here we report the\nfirst experimental demonstration of simultaneous cooling of two near-degenerate\nmechanical modes by breaking the mechanical dark mode in a two-membrane cavity\noptomechanical system. The dark mode is generated as the system passes the\nexceptional point of the antiparity-time symmetric scheme. By introducing a\nsecond cavity mode for the additional dissipative channel, the dark mode is\nbroken and the total phonon number is reduced by more than an order of\nmagnitude below the dark mode cooling limit. Owing to the flexible tunability\nof the optomechanical coupling rates of such a four-mode coupled system, the\noptimized cooling efficiency can be achieved by investigating different\nparameter ranges. Our results provide an important step towards the ground\nstate cooling and entanglement among multiple degenerate mechanical resonators.\n",
