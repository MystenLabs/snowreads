Particularly\ninteresting is the region in the chart of nuclides around Z = 12 and N = 20,\ncommonly referred to as \"Island of Inversion\", which is profoundly influenced\nby these features. Recent cutting-edge experiments performed at SAMURAI/RIBF\nhave investigated the structure of the most neutron-rich O and F isotopes,\nincluding 27,28O and 28-30F, utilizing quasi-free scattering and invariant-mass\nspectroscopy techniques. This experimental campaign manifests the breakdown of\nthe N = 20 magicity for O and F isotopes, placing them within the \"Island of\nInversion\", as is discussed in this review article. The results are further\nsupported by theoretical analyses employing state-of-the-art shell-model and\nab-initio calculations. These nuclei serve as corner stones for the study of\nweak binding and continuum coupling, deformation, and halo formation.\nSignatures for the establishment of a superfluid regime in 28O and 29F are\nfound. Future experimental and theoretical studies are needed to examine\ndetails.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bVqKzAkSFPglKen--Bbdq2yHvGGiRM6WfwnCqA_bkw8","pdfSize":"1982348"}
