  "abstract": "  Low-frequency radio emission from the Large Magellanic Cloud~(LMC) is assumed\nto be dominated by nonthermal synchrotron radiation from energy loss of\nenergetic $e^+/e^-$ in magnetic field. Two different kinds of sources of\n$e^+/e^-$, dark matter~(DM) annihilation and cosmic rays~(CR) related to\nmassive stars, are taken into account in this paper. We fit the multiple\nlow-frequency radio observations, from 19.7 MHz to 1.4 GHz, with a double\npower-law model $S_{nth} =S_{DM}(\\frac\n{\\nu}{\\nu_{\\star}})^{-\\alpha_{DM}}+S_{CR}( \\frac\n{\\nu}{\\nu_{\\star}})^{-\\alpha_{CR}} $. $\\nu_{\\star}$ is set to be $1.4$ GHz and\n$S_{CR}$ could be determined from the 24 $\\mu m$ luminosity based on the global\nradio-infrared correlation. Our best fit with a fixed $\\alpha_{CR}$ changing\nfrom $0.80$ to $0.55$ yields $\\alpha_{DM}$ ranging from $0.21$ to $0.66$. Given\na fixed value of $\\alpha_{CR}$, we derive the upper limits of synchrotron\nemission induced by dark matter annihilation at different radio frequencies.\nLarger value of $\\alpha_{CR}$ represents for a harder $e^+/e^-$ spectrum from\ncosmic rays, which leads to a smaller value of $\\alpha_{DM}$ and allow less\nsynchrotron emission resulted from dark matter annihilation in lower frequency.\nUnder the same assumption on the magnetic field, we find that the lower the\nfrequency, the stronger the restriction on DM parameter space. Meanwhile, as\nthe peak frequency of synchrotron radiation decrease with the energy of\n$e^+/e^-$, constraints on DM properties obtained from lower frequency are more\nsevere in the case of DM with lower mass. Future low-frequency radio survey\nshould be considered a promising and powerful way to constrain DM.\n",
