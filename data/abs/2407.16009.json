Unlike previous Ly$\\alpha$ codes, THALAS is fully\ndifferentiable, enabling a wide variety of potential applications for general\nanalysis of hydrodynamical simulations and cosmological inference. To\ndemonstrate THALAS's capabilities, we apply it to the Ly$\\alpha$ forest\ninversion problem: given a Ly$\\alpha$ optical depth field, we reconstruct the\ncorresponding real-space dark matter density field. Such applications are\nrelevant to both cosmological and three-dimensional tomographic analyses of\nLyman Alpha forest data.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cbD2AAS4sH3mpJO19-Twx5gBwonk8sU-s3GcCpk-K74","pdfSize":"5075369"}
