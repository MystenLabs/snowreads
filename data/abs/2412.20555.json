This note\nillustrates a bias diagnostic from the statistical literature as a complement\nto the Hausman test. The diagnostic can provide internal estimates of\nparameter-specific bias in the mixed model estimators without requiring the\nsecond, fixed-effects-only model to be fit. We apply the diagnostic to a panel\ndata analysis as well as to a Value-Added Model (VAM) for teacher evaluation.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"bzfeGfgF7wUxnkzgNOw-ZUAagzgY5OmkhLGpxKCwKUk","pdfSize":"332431"}
