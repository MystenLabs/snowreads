  "abstract": "  Many studies collect data that can be considered as a realization of a point\nprocess. Included are medical imaging data where photon counts are recorded by\na gamma camera from patients being injected with a gamma emitting tracer. It is\nof interest to develop analytic methods that can help with diagnosis as well as\nin the training of inexpert radiologists. Partial least squares (PLS) is a\npopular analytic approach that combines features from linear modeling as well\nas dimension reduction to provide parsimonious prediction and classification.\nHowever, existing PLS methodologies do not include the analysis of point\nprocess predictors. In this article, we introduce point process PLS (P3LS) for\nanalyzing latent time-varying intensity functions from collections of\ninhomogeneous point processes. A novel estimation procedure for $P^3LS$ is\ndeveloped that utilizes the properties of log-Gaussian Cox processes, and its\nempirical properties are examined in simulation studies. The method is used to\nanalyze kidney functionality in patients with renal disease in order to aid in\nthe diagnosis of kidney obstruction.\n",
