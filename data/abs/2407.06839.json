It finds varied applications in monitoring\nenvironmental changes, man-made changes as well as corresponding\ndecision-making and prediction of future trends. Deep learning methods like\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers have achieved remarkable\nsuccess in detecting significant changes, given two images at different times.\nIn this paper, we propose a Mamba-based Change Detector (M-CD) that segments\nout the regions of interest even better. Mamba-based architectures demonstrate\nlinear-time training capabilities and an improved receptive field over\ntransformers. Our experiments on four widely used change detection datasets\ndemonstrate significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nmethods.
