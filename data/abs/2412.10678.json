A notable example is the dedispersion process\nrequired for performing blind searches for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) in radio\ntelescope data. We introduce a novel approach - Efficient Summation of\nArbitrary Masks (ESAM) - which efficiently computes 1-D convolution of many\narbitrary 2-D masks, and can be used to carry out dedispersion over thousands\nof dispersion trials efficiently. Our method matches the accuracy of the\ntraditional brute force technique in recovering the desired Signal-to-Noise\nratio (S/N) while reducing computational cost by around a factor of 10. We\ncompare its performance with existing dedispersion algorithms, such as the Fast\nDispersion Measure Transform (FDMT) algorithm, and demonstrate how ESAM\nprovides freedom to choose arbitrary masks and further optimise computational\ncost versus accuracy. We explore the potential applications of ESAM beyond FRB\nsearches.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PZuZQguIQC5l2JdjyNpb-TUC5JHtur6c88XDk1i5ETI","pdfSize":"1807474"}
