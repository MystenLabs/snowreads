  "abstract": "  In this work, we studied the $Z_{c}(3900)$ state within the framework of\neffective field theory. We firstly show the construction of the Lagrangian\ndescribing meson-meson-meson and meson-diquark-diquark interactions. By using\nthe Feynman rule, we calculate the effective potentials corresponding to the\ncoupled channels of $D\\bar{D}^{*}/D^{*}\\bar{D}$ and\n$S_{cq}\\bar{A}_{cq}/A_{cq}\\bar{S}_{cq}$ with $S_{cq}$ ($A_{cq}$) the scalar\n(axial vector) diquark composed of $c$ and $q$ quarks. After solving the\nBethe-Salpeter equation of the on-shell parametrized form and compare our\nnumerical results with the experimental mass and width of $Z_{c}(3900)$, we\nfind that the $Z_{c}(3900)$ state can be explained as the mixture of\n$D\\bar{D}^{*}/D^{*}\\bar{D}$ and $S_{cq}\\bar{A}_{cq}/A_{cq}\\bar{S}_{cq}$\ncomponents.\n",
