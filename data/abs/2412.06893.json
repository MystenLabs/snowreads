We describe the finding of a striking\nsimilarity between librating and rotating KLCs for some range of precession\nrates. We show that the main effect occurs in both categories when the KLC\nfrequency is equal to the precession rate of the perturbing potential. We solve\nthe resonant dynamics analytically and show that it is equivalent to a simple\npendulum model allowing us to map the strikingly rich structures that arise for\nprecession rates similar to the Kozai-Lidov timescale (ratio of a few) and\nexplain the similarity and when it vanishes. Additionally, we show that the\nregular KLCs at high eccentricities can also be described using a simple\npendulum.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iOZrHNTj0KN3BQdLKDCp6KP4nT4gRMrzzfC5Bk0DGW4","pdfSize":"1527128"}
