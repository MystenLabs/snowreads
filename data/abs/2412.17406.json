Based on RBC/UKQCD's\nset of 2+1 flavour gauge field ensembles with Shamir domain-wall fermion and\nIwasaki gauge field action, we study semileptonic $B_{(s)}$ decays using\ndomain-wall fermions for light, strange and charm quarks, whereas bottom quarks\nare simulated with the relativistic heavy quark (RHQ) action. Exploratory\nresults for $B_s \\to D_s^* \\ell \\nu_\\ell$ are presented.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KVVCHeXHZmRe14AVQ4yBIEKn9yYc1Qxs4BkHfabF6NM","pdfSize":"605628"}
