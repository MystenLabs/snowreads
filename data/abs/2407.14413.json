The investigation is primarily concerned with practical\nscenarios where data is collected subsequent to an incident. We establish the\nuniqueness of either the spatial or the temporal component of the source,\nprovided that the temporal component exhibits an asymptotic expansion at\ninfinity. Taking anomalous diffusion as a typical example, we gather the\nasymptotic behavior of one of the following quantities: the concentration on\npartial interior region or at a point inside the region, or the flux on partial\nboundary or at a point on the boundary. The proof is based on the asymptotic\nexpansion of the solution to the fractional diffusion-wave equation. Notably,\nour approach does not rely on the conventional vanishing conditions for the\nsource components. We also observe that the extent of uniqueness is dependent\non the fractional order.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"HEBCCMrMP7aW7PvniiK2xt0ofhz6fqhKDPzIDCdgbAc","pdfSize":"298866"}
