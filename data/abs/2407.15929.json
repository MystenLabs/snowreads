Here, we present an overview of our current knowledge\nabout the magnetic field evolution in numerical simulations of accreting BHs,\nfocusing on jet launching, black hole-interstellar medium feedback, and black\nhole imaging of MADs. We find that misaligned MAD accretion flows seemingly\nexhibit jet ejection cycles that could produce flaring states in radio-quiet\nactive galactic nuclei. Further, we show that advances in horizon-scale\ninterferometric telescopes could identify disk misalignment by imaging the\ndisk-jet connection region.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lKp_Gh6twn1fLc2ANehs9uA260VFcA4VgqWPL0SQUwQ","pdfSize":"7843698"}
