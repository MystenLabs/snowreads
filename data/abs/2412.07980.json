In TTA, models are adapted online at the same time when\nmaking predictions to test data. Neighbor-based approaches have gained\nattention recently, where prototype embeddings provide location information to\nalleviate the feature shift between training and testing data. However, due to\ntheir inherit limitation of simplicity, they often struggle to learn useful\npatterns and encounter performance degradation. To confront this challenge, we\nstudy the TTA problem from a geometric point of view. We first reveal that the\nunderlying structure of neighbor-based methods aligns with the Voronoi Diagram,\na classical computational geometry model for space partitioning. Building on\nthis observation, we propose the Test-Time adjustment by Voronoi Diagram\nguidance (TTVD), a novel framework that leverages the benefits of this\ngeometric property. Specifically, we explore two key structures: 1)\nCluster-induced Voronoi Diagram (CIVD): This integrates the joint contribution\nof self-supervision and entropy-based methods to provide richer information. 2)\nPower Diagram (PD): A generalized version of the Voronoi Diagram that refines\npartitions by assigning weights to each Voronoi cell. Our experiments under\nrigid, peer-reviewed settings on CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C, ImageNet-C, and\nImageNet-R shows that TTVD achieves remarkable improvements compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods. Moreover, extensive experimental results also explore\nthe effects of batch size and class imbalance, which are two scenarios commonly\nencountered in real-world applications. These analyses further validate the\nrobustness and adaptability of our proposed framework.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DtqNiWeqeN19WoM04tKWPcxySw3c7rfbNUZFYZYgLwA","pdfSize":"8656019"}
