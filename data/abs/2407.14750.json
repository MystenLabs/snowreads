The climate crisis's urgency\ndemands a design shift towards sustainability and inclusivity. This shift was\nhappening through an emerging theme in design, More-Than-Human (MTH), which\nexpands the notion of the user to animals, things, nature, and microbes. Such\nan expansion creates a requirement for designers to consider nonhuman\nperspectives during the design process. This paper investigates the methods\nused in MTH Design studies to explore and synthesize the perspectives of\nnonhuman users. Reviewing 30 papers, it highlights a predominant focus on\nanimals and things over plants and microbes in MTH studies, along with a\nscarcity of synthesis methods. It identifies the necessity of tools that\nrepresent nonhumans with their relationships within larger ecosystems, and\ncalls for increased attention to plants and microbes, emphasizing their vital\nrole in sustainable environments and urging researchers to develop methods for\nunderstanding these species. By highlighting method strengths and weaknesses,\nit aims to guide designers and design researchers who plan to work with\nnonhuman users in selecting appropriate methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3phcumqqmhtpE8ORrOoT6kJJF391rV4kOkPf2gqlB_Q","pdfSize":"462998"}
