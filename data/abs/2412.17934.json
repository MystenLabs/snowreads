The next generation of wireless communications\nwill rely on increasingly higher frequencies, which are easily obstructed by\nobstacles. One of the most critical concepts yet to be fully addressed is\npositioning the UAV at optimal coordinates while accounting for obstacles. To\nensure a line of sight (LoS) between UAVs and user equipment (UE), improve QoS,\nand establish reliable wireless links with maximum coverage, obstacles must be\nintegrated into the proposed placement algorithms. This paper introduces a\nsimulation-based measurement approach for characterizing an air-to-ground (AG)\nchannel in a simple scenario. By considering obstacles, we present a novel\nperspective on channel characterization. The results, in terms of throughput,\npacket delivery, packet loss, and delay, are compared using the proposed\npositioning approach.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Networking and Internet Architecture","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FxqnNaHSMDEXkgzXj37eOQZw4IT1wi0xpCCj9_3uDOk","pdfSize":"658606"}
