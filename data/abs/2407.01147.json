For physical systems, we have it that the\nHamiltonian must be a Hermitian operator to ensure unitary dynamics. For\nanti-Hermitian Hamiltonians, the Schrodinger equation instead models the\nevolution of quantum states in imaginary time. This process of imaginary time\nevolution has been used successfully to calculate the ground state of a quantum\nsystem. Although imaginary time evolution is non-unitary, the normalised\ndynamics of this evolution can be simulated on a quantum computer using the\nquantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) algorithm. In this paper, we broaden\nthe scope of QITE by removing its restriction to anti-Hermitian Hamiltonians,\nwhich allows us to solve any partial differential equation (PDE) that is\nequivalent to the Schrodinger equation with an arbitrary, non-Hermitian\nHamiltonian. An example of such a PDE is the famous Black-Scholes equation that\nmodels the price of financial derivatives. We will demonstrate how our\ngeneralised QITE methodology offers a feasible approach for real-world\napplications by using it to price various European option contracts modelled\naccording to the Black-Scholes equation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6KBUSIOExQrQXlX5gVg6oAtyhf0EIxk-vHIFBX6IUJA","pdfSize":"547462"}
