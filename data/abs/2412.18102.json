A folklore\nconjecture since 2012 says that GAPF evolves smooth, embedded and star-shaped\ninitial curves globally. In this paper, we prove this conjecture by using\nDittberner's singularity analysis theory. A star-shaped ``flying wing\" curve is\nconstructed to show that GAPF may not always preserve the star-shapedness of\nevolving curves. This example is also a negative answer to Mantegazza's open\nproblem whether the curve shortening flow (CSF) always preserves the star shape\nof the evolving curves.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"uSgVc0IbM4IxbbDknLU7igJjpOhAjKbzN3eJ2r8Qz4o","pdfSize":"1121450"}
