  "abstract": "  Lam, Lee and Shimozono recently introduced backstable double Grothendieck\npolynomials to represent $K$-theory classes of the infinite flag variety. They\nused them to define double $\\beta$-Stanley symmetric functions, which expand\ninto double stable Grothendieck functions with polynomial coefficients called\ndouble $\\beta$-Edelman--Greene coefficients. Anderson proved these coefficients\nare $\\beta$-Graham positive. For vexillary permutations, this is equivalent to\na statement for skew flagged double $\\beta$-Grothendieck functions. Working in\nthis setting, we give a tableau formula for vexillary double\n$\\beta$-Edelman--Greene coefficients that is manifestly $\\beta$-Graham\npositive. Our formula demonstrates a finer notion of positivity than was\npreviously known.\n",
