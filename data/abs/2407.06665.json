In\ncontrol, piecewise regression is, e.g., used to approximate the optimal control\nlaw of model predictive control (MPC), the optimal value function, or unknown\nsystem dynamics. Neural networks are a common choice to solve the piecewise\nregression problem. However, due to their nonlinear structure, training is\noften based on gradient-based methods, which may fail to find a global optimum\nor even a solution that leads to a small approximation error. To overcome this\nproblem and to find a global optimal solution, methods based on mixed-integer\nprogramming (MIP) can be used. However, the known MIP-based methods are either\nlimited to a special class of functions, e.g., convex piecewise affine\nfunctions, or they lead to complex approximations in terms of the number of\nregions of the piecewise defined function. Both complicate a usage in the\nframework of control. We propose a new MIP-based method that is not restricted\nto a particular class of piecewise defined functions and leads to functions\nthat are fast to evaluate and can be used within an optimization problem,\nmaking them well suited for use in control.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"uFHMB7ViOYeXNDxeQ7uFBB4QlCSphzFK9rnUfnYLs_M","pdfSize":"2211235"}
