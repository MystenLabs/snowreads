By\nequipping the cyclic free magma with a second distributive operation we obtain\na ringoid-like structure with some primitive arithmetical properties. A\nsubmagma is $k$-maximal when there are only $k-1$ submagmas between it and the\nfree magma itself. These two tools, arithmetic and maximality, allow us to\nstudy the lattice of the submagmas of a free magma.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sWf9wpPhcSbHvNGeiVbiEp-gMlAmWBdgHbSGo8GV8b8","pdfSize":"353510"}
