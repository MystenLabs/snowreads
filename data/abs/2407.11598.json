We achieve a\n\"tight\" classification when the cyclic Galois field extensions is cubic. The\nclassification is \"tight\" in the sense that the list of algebras has features\nthat make it easy to distinguish non-isomorphic ones. Rough classification\nresults on regular algebras that are principal Albert isotopes of Galois\n$C_n$-algebras are obtained as well; the principal Albert isotopes of\n$C_3$-Galois algebras are again classified up to isomorphisms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5_k3FZdGn3iYwpqFgcAM6EEfmcC50JP3PcknmRTLVaw","pdfSize":"334708"}
