In this paper, we validate\nSTRINGS for the simulation of 2-parton $\\rightarrow$ $\\gamma$-parton scattering\nevents by comparing to previous literature. After validation, we produce MC\nsamples of resonances using $M_s$ = {5.0,5.5,6.0,6.5,7.0} TeV at $\\sqrt{s}$ =\n{13,13.6} TeV with STRINGS and Pythia and analyze the kinematic data. To\naccurately reproduce previous results close to resonance, it is necessary to\nintroduce a scaling factor of $\\approx$ 0.53. With this correction, the\nresonance structure is as expected.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"aSwHrXU_CUP9-Eind3HDVLqf5dM6b6Rt_TRqhfTZ6kI","pdfSize":"5712486"}
