We\nrevisit the approach described by Katz, Dong and Malhotra\n(\\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.181101}{Phys. Rev.

The resulting flip\ncriterion is much simpler than the previous one but the latter is still needed\nin a small fraction of phase space. We identify a logical error in the earlier\nderivation but clarify why it does not affect the final results.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rf1tGj6ypkhvzvoi88pjIChi7iNF6ygTAzN9V61a7I8","pdfSize":"616909"}
