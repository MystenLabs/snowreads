In this hypothesis, a similitude between the dark and the visible\ncomponents exists. The lack of observability of any type of dark matter up to\nnow, in particular A$\\bar{\\mathrm{Q}}$Ns, requires finding new ways of\ndetecting these particles, if they exist. In spite of strong interaction with\nvisible matter, for such objects a very small ratio of cross section to mass is\nexpected and thus huge detector systems are necessary. This paper presents a\nnew idea for the direct detection of the A$\\bar{\\mathrm{Q}}$Ns using minerals\nas natural rock deposits acting as paleo-detectors, where the latent signals of\nluminescence produced by interactions of A$\\bar{\\mathrm{Q}}$Ns are registered\nand can be identified as an increased and symmetrical deposited dose. The\nestimates were made for minerals widely distributed on Earth, for which the TL\nsignal is intense and if the thermal conditions are constant and with low\ntemperatures, the lifetime of the latent signals is kept for geological time\nscales.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ctefk2twJg2quQlfd70aKx6wsyuAmk39tj8xlidJ56A","pdfSize":"674342"}
