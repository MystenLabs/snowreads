Quantifying dislocation-impurity interactions in $\\alpha$-Fe from\nab initio across a wide temperature range is challenging due to paramagnetism\nat elevated temperatures. In this work, we investigate the energy profiles and\nsegregation behavior of various 3d elements - V, Cr, Mn, Cu, Ni, and Co - in\nand around $1/2\\langle111\\rangle$ screw dislocations in $\\alpha$-Fe in\nferromagnetic and paramagnetic state with the latter being modeled through both\nthe disordered local moment model and a spin-wave approach using ab initio\nmethods. Our findings reveal that (1) magnetic effects are large compared to\nelastic size effects, and (2) dislocation-impurity interactions are dependent\non the magnetic state of the matrix and thermal lattice expansion. In\nparticular, Cu changes from core-attractive in the ferromagnetic state to\nrepulsive in the paramagnetic state.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"l34McA4hwwTWBsv9U-y8yysJmvsqtPsgFd697OTYGZ0","pdfSize":"1004452"}
