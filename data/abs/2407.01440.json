Traditional RSMT\nalgorithms spend a significant amount of time on finding Steiner points to\nreduce the total wire length or use heuristics to approximate producing\nsub-optimal results. We show that Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can be used to\npredict optimal Steiner points in RSMTs with high accuracy and can be\nparallelized on GPUs. In this paper, we propose GAT-Steiner, a graph attention\nnetwork model that correctly predicts 99.846% of the nets in the ISPD19\nbenchmark with an average increase in wire length of only 0.480% on suboptimal\nwire length nets. On randomly generated benchmarks, GAT-Steiner correctly\npredicts 99.942% with an average increase in wire length of only 0.420% on\nsuboptimal wire length nets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3Q9YFG2AmBdnYSKghEjY2m8QsaONB5jhnv9tljsdZ30","pdfSize":"1992385"}
