Nature Nanotechnology 2018 \"Ballistic\nMajorana nanowire devices\" using fuller data from the original experiments\nreleased in 2023 on Zenodo. The authors have prepared a correction to their\narticle that appeared in Nature Nanotechnology in 2024. However, the correction\ndoes not address the concerns we identify here. We demonstrate that the fuller\ndata contain extensive evidence for quantum dots and disorder that are\ncompletely inconsistent with the authors' conclusion that they have achieved\nballistic devices containing zero bias peaks of likely Majorana origin. We show\nhow data selection, data cropping and undisclosed data processing played a role\nin composing the figures of the final published paper.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"q7OGEUF7x2b_P47k31fe8p6PseLyfkFAoooZZDJSuIs","pdfSize":"22364239","objectId":"0x01b0004ad4f96d5d52fe9ec4864b856f506cd5e579028f563d60625e44f5f3d4","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
