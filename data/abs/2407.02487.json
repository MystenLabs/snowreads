In this paper, we discuss in detail the\npossibility that the PMNS matrix is given by the product U_{PMNS}=V^\\ast_{CKM}\nT^\\ast where T comes from the diagonalization of a see-saw like mass matrix\nthat can be of a Bimaximal (BM), Tri-Bimaximal (TBM) and Golden Ratio (GR)\nform, and identify the leading corrections to such patterns that allow a good\nfit to the leptonic mixing matrix as well as to the CP phase. We also show that\nthe modified versions of BM, TBM and GR can easily accommodate the solar and\natmospheric mass differences\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"r7AsO_OgAxsnrtLdUCdVHbfsmlIQC7-A1qzS4Nd0iKA","pdfSize":"680230"}
