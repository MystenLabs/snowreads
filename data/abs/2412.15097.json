  "abstract": "  For over two decades, CORSIKA 7 and its previous versions have been the\nleading Monte Carlo code for simulating extensive air showers. However, its\nmonolithic Fortran-based software design and hand-optimized code has created\nchallenges for maintenance, adaptation to new computing paradigms, and\nextensions for more complex simulations. Addressing these limitations, the\nCORSIKA 8 project represents a comprehensive rewrite of CORSIKA 7, seeing its\ncore functionality re-envisioned in a modern and modular C++ framework. CORSIKA\n8 has now reached a \"physics-complete\" state, offering a robust platform that\nencourages expert development for specialized applications. It supports\nhigh-energy hadronic interactions using models such as Sibyll 2.3d,\nQGSJet-II.04, EPOS-LHC, and Pythia 8.3, alongside the treatment of\nelectromagnetic cascades with PROPOSAL 7.6.2. Key highlights are the support\nfor multiple interaction media, including cross-media particle showers, and an\nenhanced calculation of radio emissions from particle showers. This\ncontribution provides an overview of the current functionalities, showcases\nvalidation results of its simulations, and discusses future development plans.\n",
