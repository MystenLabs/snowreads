  "abstract": "  We study the quantum many-body dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)\non the lattice in the mean-field regime. We derive a local enhancement of the\nmean-field approximation: At positive distance $\\rho>0$ from the initial BEC,\nthe mean-field approximation error at time $t\\leq \\rho/v$ is bounded as\n$\\rho^{-n}$, for arbitrarily large $n\\geq 1$. This is a consequence of new\nballistic propagation bounds on the fluctuations around the condensate. To\nprove this, we develop a variant of the ASTLO (adiabatic spacetime localization\nobservable) method for the particle non-conserving generator of the fluctuation\ndynamics around Hartree states.\n",
