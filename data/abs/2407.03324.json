The\nperformance of the LPB is not according to the required level. This paper aims\nto improve the performance of a single objective LPB by embedding ten chaotic\nmaps within LPB to propose Chaotic LPB (CLPB). The proposed algorithm helps in\nreducing the Processing Time (PT), getting closer to the global optima, and\nbypassing the local optima with the best convergence speed. Another improvement\nthat has been made in CLPB is that the best individuals of a sub-population are\nforced into the interior crossover to improve the quality of solutions. CLPB is\nevaluated against multiple well-known test functions such as classical\n(TF1_TF19) and (CEC_C06 2019). Additionally, the results have been compared to\nthe standard LPB and several well-known metaheuristic algorithms such as Dragon\nFly Algorithm (DA), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Particle Swarm Optimization\n(PSO). Finally, the numerical results show that CLPB has been improved with\nchaotic maps. Furthermore, it is verified that CLPB has a great ability to deal\nwith large optimization problems compared to LPB, GA, DA, and PSO. Overall,\nGauss and Tent maps both have a great impact on improving CLPB.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"efTA0402efxiQkHTTblXxk861nDrg40R8_h0KLamFto","pdfSize":"270157"}
