All the coefficients in\nthe problem are random processes adapted to the filtration generated by\nBrownian motion and the Poisson random measure for each given regime. The model\nincorporates two distinct types of controls: the first is a conventional\ncontrol that appears in the continuous diffusion component, while the second is\nan unconventional control, dependent on the variable $z$, which influences the\njump size in the jump diffusion component. Both controls are constrained within\ngeneral closed cones. By employing the Meyer-It\\^o formula in conjunction with\na generalized squares completion technique, we rigorously and explicitly derive\nthe optimal value and optimal feedback control. These depend on solutions to\ncertain multi-dimensional fully coupled stochastic Riccati equations, which are\nessentially backward stochastic differential equations with jumps (BSDEJs). We\nestablish the existence of a unique nonnegative solution to the BSDEJs. One of\nthe major tools used in the proof is the newly established comparison theorems\nfor multidimensional BSDEJs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fjRsz2Bg8V352zldEcJMs9GeVCcuA033LA8F2-goiCE","pdfSize":"255798"}
