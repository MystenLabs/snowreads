In this paper, we characterize the\nvarieties Y with the approximation property. We also characterize the varieties\nY with the approximation property combined with a suitable interpolation\ncondition. Some of our results have variants concerning the regular\napproximation of continuous maps defined on (possibly singular) real algebraic\nvarieties.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"1SxfbdDfQ-HKawLi1RxibDyWj9XuMvBBa9Vw6q5fAM0","pdfSize":"284885"}
