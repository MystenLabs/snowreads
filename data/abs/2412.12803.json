  "abstract": "  We study $\\mathbb Z^d$-map lattices coupled by collision. We obtain a first\norder approximation for the first collision rate at a site $\\textbf{p}^*\\in\n\\mathbb Z^d$ and we prove a distributional convergence for the first collision\ntime to an exponential, with sharp error term. Moreover, we prove that the\nnumber of collisions at site $\\textbf{p}^*$ converge in distribution to a\ncompound Poisson distributed random variable. Key to our analysis in this\ninfinite dimensional setting is the use of transfer operators associated with\nthe decoupled map lattice at site $\\textbf{p}^*$\n",
