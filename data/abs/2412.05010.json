  "abstract": "  There have been several efforts in backdoor attacks, but these have primarily\nfocused on the closed-set performance of classifiers (i.e., classification).\nThis has left a gap in addressing the threat to classifiers' open-set\nperformance, referred to as outlier detection in the literature. Reliable\noutlier detection is crucial for deploying classifiers in critical real-world\napplications such as autonomous driving and medical image analysis. First, we\nshow that existing backdoor attacks fall short in affecting the open-set\nperformance of classifiers, as they have been specifically designed to confuse\nintra-closed-set decision boundaries. In contrast, an effective backdoor attack\nfor outlier detection needs to confuse the decision boundary between the closed\nand open sets. Motivated by this, in this study, we propose BATOD, a novel\nBackdoor Attack targeting the Outlier Detection task. Specifically, we design\ntwo categories of triggers to shift inlier samples to outliers and vice versa.\nWe evaluate BATOD using various real-world datasets and demonstrate its\nsuperior ability to degrade the open-set performance of classifiers compared to\nprevious attacks, both before and after applying defenses.\n",
