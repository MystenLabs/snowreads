We consider the slow roll\napproximation in the modified Friedmann equations within the $f(Q,T)$ gravity,\nspecifically in the form $f(Q,T)=\\alpha Q+g(T)$, where $g(T)$ is an arbitrary\nfunction of the trace of stress energy tensor $T$. Subsequently, we derive the\nMukhanov-Sasaki equations for both scalar and tensor perturbations. By solving\nthese equations in the slow-roll regime, we calculate the power spectrum and\nspectral index for scalar and tensor modes within the $f(Q,T)=\\alpha Q+g(T)$\nmodel. In particular, we examine two distinct functional forms of $g(T)$ to\ncalculate the slow roll parameters, the scalar spectral index and the tensor to\nscalar ratio. By imposing constraints on the parameters of the model, we\nachieve results that align well with the Planck 2018 data. Interestingly, a\nmodel including a $T^2$ dependence showed good agreement with the observational\ndata.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"9ex851Hm0ByRwMP1_FXCMMoVOpjC3SSUbWjei4IzTdI","pdfSize":"638334"}
