  "abstract": "  Our primary aim in this paper is to introduce and study the cohomology of a\nNijenhuis operator and of a Nijenhuis algebra. Our cohomology of a Nijenhuis\nalgebra controls the simultaneous deformations of the underlying associative\nstructure and the Nijenhuis operator. We interpret the second cohomology group\nas the space of all isomorphism classes of abelian extensions. Then we study\nthe inducibility of a pair of Nijenhuis algebra automorphisms in a given\nabelian extension and show that the corresponding obstruction can be seen as\nthe image of a suitable Wells-type map. We also consider skeletal and strict\n$2$-term homotopy Nijenhuis algebras and characterize them by third cocycles of\nNijenhuis algebras and crossed modules of Nijenhuis algebras, respectively.\nFinally, we introduce strict homotopy Nijenhuis operators on\n$A_\\infty$-algebras and show that they induce $NS_\\infty$-algebras.\n",
