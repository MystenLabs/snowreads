HMR from monocular images has\npredominantly been addressed by deterministic methods that output a single\nprediction for a given 2D image. However, HMR from a single image is an\nill-posed problem due to depth ambiguity and occlusions. Probabilistic methods\nhave attempted to address this by generating and fusing multiple plausible 3D\nreconstructions, but their performance has often lagged behind deterministic\napproaches. In this paper, we introduce GenHMR, a novel generative framework\nthat reformulates monocular HMR as an image-conditioned generative task,\nexplicitly modeling and mitigating uncertainties in the 2D-to-3D mapping\nprocess. GenHMR comprises two key components: (1) a pose tokenizer to convert\n3D human poses into a sequence of discrete tokens in a latent space, and (2) an\nimage-conditional masked transformer to learn the probabilistic distributions\nof the pose tokens, conditioned on the input image prompt along with randomly\nmasked token sequence. During inference, the model samples from the learned\nconditional distribution to iteratively decode high-confidence pose tokens,\nthereby reducing 3D reconstruction uncertainties. To further refine the\nreconstruction, a 2D pose-guided refinement technique is proposed to directly\nfine-tune the decoded pose tokens in the latent space, which forces the\nprojected 3D body mesh to align with the 2D pose clues. Experiments on\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that GenHMR significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods.
