  "abstract": "  This paper investigates Singer's conjecture by examining the cohit module\n$\\mathbb F_2\\otimes_{\\mathcal A}P^{\\otimes h}$ for specific degrees and values\nof $h$. Utilizing hit problem techniques, we extend previous work by Mothebe et\nal. and establish key dimensional results. Notably, for $h\\geq 6$, we prove\nthat the cohit module's dimension in certain degrees matches the order of a\nspecific factor group. Our contributions include demonstrating that certain\nnon-zero elements do not belong to the image of the Singer algebraic transfer.\n",
