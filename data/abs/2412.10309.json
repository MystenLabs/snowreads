In\nthis work, we investigate $\\mathcal{CP}$-violating effects in the top-Higgs\nsector using the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework.\nFocusing on top-pair production in association with a Higgs boson and single\ntop-Higgs associated production at the LHC, we study $\\mathcal{CP}$ violation\nin the top-Higgs Yukawa coupling and other Higgs and top interactions entering\nthese processes. By analysing $\\mathcal{CP}$-sensitive differential observables\nand asymmetries, we provide direct constraints on $\\mathcal{CP}$-violating\ninteractions in the top-Higgs sector. Our analysis demonstrates how combining\n$t\\bar{t}h$ and $thj$ production can disentangle the real and imaginary\ncomponents of the top-Yukawa coupling, offering valuable insights into\npotential sources of $\\mathcal{CP}$ violation. The sensitivity of these\nobservables to SMEFT operators provides model-independent constraints on the\nparameter space, advancing the search for new physics in the top-Higgs sector.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hk2sgKMuaYo1cmkzdKU57eldnTmNQ_Zy8SvXX8FwQFs","pdfSize":"2808872"}
