The theoretical outcomes of\nvarious diquark-antidiquark scenarios are inclined to categorize the\n$T_{cc}(3875)^+$ structure as the exemplary candidate of the $1S$-wave\nisoscalar axial-vector double-charm tetraquark state. In light of the\ndiquark-antidiquark configuration, this work investigates the mixing angles of\nthe orbitally excited isovector $T_{cc}$ states and the magic mixing angles of\nthe ideal heavy-light tetraquarks for the first time. As the advancement of the\nexperimental detection capability, these phenomenological prognostications will\neffectively boost the hunting for the prospective low-lying $T_{cc}$ states in\nthe future.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eQ_c7fXoSiOLaTsZZJQesDVDts6kutCuqSJ0lrfrpOs","pdfSize":"487362"}
