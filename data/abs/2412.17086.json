  "abstract": "  Finding Dyson rings around distant pulsars may involve identifying light\ncurve features that have not been previously identified. Previous studies\ncovered the detection of a ring structure uniformly brightened by the central\npulsar, mostly in infrared light. Here, more complex light curves are explored,\nwhich arise inherently from the pulsar beam spot's commonly predicted\nsuperluminal speed. These speeds may cause multiple images of the pulsar's spot\non the Dyson ring to appear simultaneously to a distant observer, and so\nfeature bright creation and annihilation events. Therefore, it is possible that\neven if Dyson ring structures had been observed previously, they might have\nremained unnoticed. Similar light curve features may appear on naturally\noccurring dust rings around pulsars that reflect detectable pulsar radiation.\n",
