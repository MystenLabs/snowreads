While numerous results support this conjecture, S. J. Miller observed\nthat for finite conductors, very different behavior can occur for zeros near\nthe central point in elliptic curve $L$-function families. This led to the\ncreation of the excised model of Due\\~{n}ez, Huynh, Keating, Miller, and\nSnaith, whose predictions for quadratic twists of a given elliptic curve are\nwell fit by the data. The key ingredients are relating the discretization of\ncentral values of the $L$-functions to excising matrices based on the value of\nthe characteristic polynomials at 1 and using lower order terms (in statistics\nsuch as the one-level density and pair-correlation) to adjust the matrix size.\nWe extended this model for a family of twists of an $L$-function associated to\na given holomorphic cuspidal newform of odd prime level and arbitrary weight.\nWe derive the corresponding \"effective\" matrix size for a given form by\ncomputing the one-level density and pair-correlation statistics for a chosen\nfamily of twists, and we show there is no repulsion for forms with weight\ngreater than 2 and principal nebentype. We experimentally verify the accuracy\nof the model, and as expected, our model recovers the elliptic curve model.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"aRw5vL_yHCpPVXYnbdn-IcJI1N0pt2uizyCrAjZoC2c","pdfSize":"1093595"}
