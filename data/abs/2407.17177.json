Nullers\ndiscard part of the astrophysical information to optimize the recording of\nlight present in the dark fringe of the central source. Asgard/NOTT will deploy\na beam-combination scheme offering good instrumental noise rejection when\nphased appropriately, but for which information is degenerate on the outputs,\nprompting a dedicated tuning strategy using the science detector. The\ndispersive effect of water vapor can be corrected with prisms forming a\nvariable thickness of glass. But observations in the L band suffer from an\nadditional and important chromatic effect due to longitudinal atmospheric\ndispersion coming from a resonance of CO2 at 4.3 micron. To compensate for this\neffect efficiently, a novel type of compensation device will be deployed\nleveraging a gas cell of variable length at ambient pressure. After reviewing\nthe impact of water vapor and CO2, we present the design of this atmospheric\ndispersion compensation device and describe a strategy to maintain this tuning\non-sky.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"GUq6r5o-JGr6APXH93K6BfzccIQ0g3AOuYOLE-a39DM","pdfSize":"1550377","objectId":"0x0d7a9f8eb7e223cc21634245ee575903864f00e406b37dc85317586e8ca79215","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
