With the growing difficulties of classical models\nrequiring extreme hardware and power solutions, and quantum models being\nlimited by noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware, there is an\nemerging opportunity to solve both problems together. Here we introduce a new\nsoftware model for quantum neuromorphic computing -- a quantum leaky\nintegrate-and-fire (QLIF) neuron, implemented as a compact high-fidelity\nquantum circuit, requiring only 2 rotation gates and no CNOT gates. We use\nthese neurons as building blocks in the construction of a quantum spiking\nneural network (QSNN), and a quantum spiking convolutional neural network\n(QSCNN), as the first of their kind. We apply these models to the MNIST,\nFashion-MNIST, and KMNIST datasets for a full comparison with other classical\nand quantum models. We find that the proposed models perform competitively,\nwith comparative accuracy, with efficient scaling and fast computation in\nclassical simulation as well as on quantum devices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xnThPcYtGaR2VMfkrtOpFdb_tn21c7mvxtMFG_UBgcw","pdfSize":"793606"}
