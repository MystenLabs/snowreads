  "abstract": "  We introduce bilinear secant varieties and joins of subvarieties of products\nof projective spaces, as a generalisation of the classical secant varieties and\njoins of projective varieties. We show that the bilinear secant varieties of\ncertain rational normal curves of $\\mathbb P^n \\times \\mathbb P^{n+1}$ play a\ncentral role in the study of the birational geometry of $X^{n,n+1}_s$, its\nblowup in $s$ points in general position. We show that $X^{n,n+1}_s$ is log\nFano, and we compute its effective and movable cones, for $s\\le n+2$ and $n\\ge\n1$ and for $s\\le n+3$ and $n\\le 2$, and we compute the effective and movable\ncones of $X^{3,4}_6$.\n",
