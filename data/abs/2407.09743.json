Further, we show that a\ncombination of measurements of the parity-violating asymmetry at forward and\nbackward angles for the same electron beam energy can be used to extract\ninformation on the nuclear weak charge distribution. We conclude that a $0.34$%\nprecision on the weak radius of $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ may be achieved by performing\na $3$% precision measurement of the parity-violating asymmetry at backward\nangles.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aTA8lD4XTBcHTE4bfREd4uZR2f07-C58KwDnX_6VB2c","pdfSize":"1516075"}
