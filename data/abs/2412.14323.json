In this work, we specifically target the\ntranslation challenges posed by attributive nouns in Chinese, which frequently\ncause ambiguities in English translation. By manually inserting the omitted\nparticle X ('DE'). In news article titles from the Penn Chinese Discourse\nTreebank, we developed a targeted dataset to fine-tune Hugging Face Chinese to\nEnglish translation models, specifically improving how this critical function\nword is handled. This focused approach not only complements the broader\nstrategies suggested by previous studies but also offers a practical\nenhancement by specifically addressing a common error type in Chinese-English\ntranslation.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Vdnnp7PZJOLIDaK3MoEBQmWFTGjIK4-EppWJvU9080k","pdfSize":"132275"}
