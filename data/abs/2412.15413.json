  "abstract": "  Measurements of light-by-light scattering (LbL,\n$\\gamma\\gamma\\to\\gamma\\gamma$) and the Breit--Wheeler process (BW,\n$\\gamma\\gamma$ $\\to$ $\\mathrm{e^+e^-}$) are reported in ultraperipheral PbPb\ncollisions at a centre-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of 5.02 TeV. The data\nsample, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.7 nb$^{-1}$, was\ncollected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC in 2018. Events with an\nexclusively produced $\\gamma\\gamma$ or $\\mathrm{e^+e^-}$ pair with invariant\nmasses $m^{\\gamma\\gamma,\\mathrm{ee}}$ $>$ 5 GeV, along with other fiducial\ncriteria, are selected. The measured BW fiducial production cross section,\n$\\sigma_\\text{fid}$($\\gamma\\gamma$ $\\to$ $\\mathrm{e^+e^-}$) = 263.5 $\\pm$ 1.8\n(stat) $\\pm$ 17.8 (syst) $\\mu$b, as well as the differential distributions for\nvarious kinematic observables, are in agreement with leading-order quantum\nelectrodynamics predictions complemented with final-state photon radiation. The\nmeasured differential BW cross sections allow discriminating between different\ntheoretical descriptions of the photon flux of the lead ion. In the LbL final\nstate, 26 exclusive diphoton candidate events are observed compared with 12.0\n$\\pm$ 2.9 expected for the background. Combined with previous results, the\nobserved significance of the LbL signal with respect to the background-only\nhypothesis is above five standard deviations. The measured fiducial LbL\nscattering cross section, $\\sigma_\\text{fid} (\\gamma\\gamma\\to\\gamma\\gamma)$ =\n107 $\\pm$ 24 (stat) $\\pm$ 13 (syst) nb, is in agreement with\nnext-to-leading-order predictions. Limits on the production of axion-like\nparticles coupled to photons are set over the mass range 5-100 GeV, including\nthe most stringent limits to date in the range of 5-10 GeV.\n",
