To harness these advancements for HSI classification, we make the\nfollowing contributions: i) We propose HyTAS, the first benchmark on\ntransformer architecture search for Hyperspectral imaging, ii) We\ncomprehensively evaluate 12 different methods to identify the optimal\ntransformer over 5 different datasets, iii) We perform an extensive factor\nanalysis on the Hyperspectral transformer search performance, greatly\nmotivating future research in this direction. All benchmark materials are\navailable at HyTAS.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WQ-ov4S8XNUjVPWrhD46-qXqU2GwXCfrh3UsSZNPsqE","pdfSize":"1405954"}
