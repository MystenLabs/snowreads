  "abstract": "  Superfluorescence in upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) is a room-temperature\nquantum phenomenon which can dramatically increase the rate and overall\nquantity of photons emitted by neodymium (Nd3+) doped UCNPs. This perspective\narticle contextualizes how SF-UCNPs could be exploited as a class of optical\nnanomaterials for second generation quantum technology applications.\n",
