This phenomenon, termed 'filamentation', challenges\nconventional understanding and remains poorly understood to date. To reveal its\npattern dynamics, we conduct 2D Particle-In-Cell simulations to comprehensively\nexamine whole process of filamentation, identifying two distinct stages.\nInitially, standing waves grows with a modulational instability, forming\nregular filaments. Subsequently, when initial wavenumber matching relation\nbreaks, the plasma shifts towards dynamic regime governed by competition\nbetween Lorentz and thermal pressure forces, characterized by filaments'\nchaotic evolution. These novel clues pave the way to theoretically\nunderstanding the filamentation instability, and provides essential references\nin effectively manipulating the magnetized plasmas.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Do0Y0CU7s0nGaG6lEDQcrhmAp6JY1QfUW9Xf8K54qmU","pdfSize":"6338380"}
