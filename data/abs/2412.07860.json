  "abstract": "  This study investigates the probability of threading in star catenanes under\ngood solvent conditions using molecular dynamics simulations, emphasizing the\ninfluence of ring rigidity. Threading in these systems arises from the\ninterplay between the intrinsic topology of and within the star-shaped\nstructure and the bending rigidity of individual rings. It is demonstrated that\nreduced ring flexibility enhances threading, and the presence of mechanical\nbonds is critical for threading formation. Notably, the bending rigidity of the\nrings alters their shapes, resulting in a non-monotonic threading probability\nwith a peak at intermediate rigidity. Furthermore, increasing ring length is\nfound to significantly boost threading probability. These findings elucidate\nthe intricate relationships among topology and rigidity in governing threading,\nwith implications for the design of advanced molecular systems and materials.\nThis work provides a comprehensive framework for understanding threading in\ngood solvent conditions, where such behavior is typically improbable for ring\npolymers, and opens avenues for the development of molecular machines and other\ncomplex architectures.\n",
