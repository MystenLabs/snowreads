The proposed control framework aims to\nimprove bimanual robot telepresence quality by reducing the user workload and\nrequired prior knowledge through the automation of secondary or auxiliary\ntasks. The introduced novel method calculates the near-optimal Cartesian\nend-effector pose in terms of visual feedback quality for the attached\neye-to-hand camera with motion constraints in consideration. The effectiveness\nis demonstrated by conducting user studies of drawing reference shapes using\nthe implemented robot avatar compared to stationary and teleoperated camera\npose conditions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed control framework\noffers improved visual feedback quality and drawing performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AOykxaH3zQG-1QWgGsn7yh9VSIOhzwSVFPD_DefdROo","pdfSize":"1351994"}
