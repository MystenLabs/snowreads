  "abstract": "  Commercial endeavours have already compromised our relationship with space.\nThe Artemis Accords are creating a framework that will commercialize the Moon\nand further impact that relation. To confront that impact, a number of\norganizations have begun to develop new principles of sustainability in space,\nmany of which are borne out of the capitalist and colonial frameworks that have\nharmed water, nature, peoples and more on Earth. Indigenous methodologies and\nways of knowing offer different paths for living in relationship with space and\nthe Moon. While Indigenous knowledges are not homogeneous, there are lessons we\ncan use from some of common methods. In this talk we will review some\nIndigenous methodologies, including the concept of kinship and discuss how\nkinship can inform our actions both on Earth and in space.\n",
