Using the theory of Markov chains of random\nwalks and the interchange process, it was proved that the algebraic\nconnectivities (second smallest Laplacian eigenvalues) of $G$ and $F_k(G)$\ncoincide, but a combinatorial/algebraic proof has been shown elusive. In this\npaper, we use the latter approach and prove that such equality holds for\ndifferent new classes of graphs under perturbations, such as extended cycles,\nextended complete bipartite graphs, kite graphs, and graphs with a cut clique.\nKite graphs are formed by a graph (head) with several paths (tail) rooted at\nthe same vertex and with exciting properties. For instance, we show that the\ndifferent eigenvalues of a kite graph are also eigenvalues of its perturbed\ngraph obtained by adding edges. Moreover, as a particular case of one of our\ntheorems, we generalize a recent result of Barik and Verma \\cite{bv24} about\ngraphs with a cut vertex of degree $n-1$. Along the way, we give conditions\nunder which the perturbed graph $G+uv$, with $uv\\in E$, has the same algebraic\nconnectivity as $G$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"e2r4gL4ZCHYqt0dL1rlVqQS78CdVEH2hMuQqJFK6luk","pdfSize":"254322"}
