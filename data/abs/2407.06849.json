This real-world data is complex in many ways and\nrequires the modelling of testee behaviour. To address this, we propose a\ntemporal variational autoencoder (TeVAE) that can detect anomalies with minimal\nfalse positives when trained on unlabelled data. Our approach also avoids the\nbypass phenomenon and introduces a new method to remap individual windows to a\ncontinuous time series. Furthermore, we propose metrics to evaluate the\ndetection delay and root-cause capability of our approach and present results\nfrom experiments on a real-world industrial data set. When properly configured,\nTeVAE flags anomalies only 6% of the time wrongly and detects 65% of anomalies\npresent. It also has the potential to perform well with a smaller training and\nvalidation subset but requires a more sophisticated threshold estimation\nmethod.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tgS8W1yIYknYojb5_7tjbAy4LXTtG_tHbIn92S_No_w","pdfSize":"727286"}
