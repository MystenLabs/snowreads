We start by presenting classic and fundamental tools for our\ninvestigation. Subsequently, we establish various convergence results that\nenhance our understanding of the model. In particular, these results include\nthe determination of particles contributing to the additive martingales, the\ndescription of the fluctuations of these martingales around their limits, and\nan approximation of the so-called overlap distribution. Regarding the latter,\nwe believe this is the first time that such an approximation is given.\nRemarkably, we identify a specific regime in which stable distributions emerge.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yGX7B-EkkOF3silJqi3X30cp0_M45Fj_a7Tc2JYLYzc","pdfSize":"1351814"}
