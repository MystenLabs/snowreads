  "abstract": "  The fractional Ornstein-Uhleneck (fOU) process is described by the overdamped\nLangevin equation $\\dot{x}(t)+\\gamma x=\\sqrt{2 D}\\xi(t)$, where $\\xi(t)$ is the\nfractional Gaussian noise with the Hurst exponent $0<H<1$. For $H\\neq 1/2$ the\nfOU process is non-Markovian but Gaussian, and it has either vanishing (for\n$H<1/2$), or divergent (for $H>1/2$) spectral density at zero frequency. For\n$H>1/2$, the fOU is long-correlated. Here we study dynamical large deviations\nof the fOU process and focus on the area $A_n=\\int_{-T}^{T} x^n(t) dt$,\n$n=1,2,\\ldots$ over a long time window $2T$. Employing the optimal fluctuation\nmethod, we determine the optimal path of the conditioned process, which\ndominates the large-$A_n$ tail of the probability distribution of the area,\n$\\mathcal{P}(A_n,T)\\sim \\exp[-S(A_n,T)]$. We uncover a nontrivial phase diagram\nof scaling behaviors of the optimal paths and of the action $S(A_n\\equiv 2 a_n\nT,T)\\sim T^{\\alpha(H,n)} a^{2/n}_n$ on the $(H,n)$ plane. The phase diagram\nincludes three regions: (i) $H>1-1/n$, where $\\alpha(H,n)=2-2H$, and the\noptimal paths are delocalized, (ii) $n=2$ and $H\\leq \\frac{1}{2}$, where\n$\\alpha(H,n)=1$, and the optimal paths oscillate with an $H$-dependent\nfrequency, and (iii) $H\\leq 1-1/n$ and $n>2$, where $\\alpha(H,n)=2/n$, and the\noptimal paths are strongly localized. We verify our theoretical predictions in\nlarge-deviation simulations of the fOU process. By combining the Wang-Landau\nMonte-Carlo algorithm with the circulant embedding method of generation of\nstationary Gaussian fields, we were able to measure probability densities as\nsmall as $10^{-170}$. We also generalize our findings to other stationary\nGaussian processes with either diverging, or vanishing spectral density at zero\nfrequency.\n",
