  "abstract": "  We confront the malaphoric $B_3-L_2$ model with bounds coming from a search\nfor resonances in the di-lepton channels at the 13~TeV LHC. In contrast to the\noriginal $B_3-L_2$ model, the $Z^\\prime$ of the malaphoric $B_3-L_2$ model has\nsizeable couplings to the lighter two families; these originate from order\nunity kinetic mixing with the hypercharge gauge boson and ameliorate the fit to\nlepton flavour universality measurements in $B-$meson decays. The $Z^\\prime$\ncoupling to the first two families of quark means that the resulting\nconstraints from resonant di-lepton searches are stronger. Nevertheless, we\nfind that for $M_{Z^\\prime}>2.8$ TeV there remains a non-negligible region of\nallowed parameter space where the model significantly improves upon several\nStandard Model predictions for observables involving the $b \\rightarrow s l^+\nl^-$ transition. We estimate that the 3000 fb$^{-1}$ HL-LHC will extend this\nsensitivity to $M_{Z^\\prime}= 4.2$ TeV.\n",
