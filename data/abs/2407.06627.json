The lambdaPi-calculus modulo theory is an extension\nof the lambda-calculus with dependent types and user-defined rewrite rules. It\nis a logical framework, used to exchange proofs between different proof\nsystems. We define an interpretation of theories of the lambdaPi-calculus\nmodulo theory, inspired by parametricity. Such an interpretation allows to\ntransfer proofs for free between theories that feature the notions of\nproposition and proof, when the source theory can be embedded into the target\ntheory.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9qGmUGlPtBC2DqmNQNgQHLUETk4MWIP5WVa16KswIV0","pdfSize":"169810"}
