However, despite their prominence and popularity,\ncustomizing these models using unauthorized data also brings serious privacy\nand intellectual property issues. Existing methods introduce protective\nperturbations based on adversarial attacks, which are applied to the\ncustomization samples. In this systematization of knowledge, we present a\ncomprehensive survey of protective perturbation methods designed to prevent\nunauthorized data usage in diffusion-based image generation. We establish the\nthreat model and categorize the downstream tasks relevant to these methods,\nproviding a detailed analysis of their designs. We also propose a completed\nevaluation framework for these perturbation techniques, aiming to advance\nresearch in this field.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8dGRg3pSCt3agz_rMoHihXTKoL-VlDjFqsc05f266YM","pdfSize":"125789"}
