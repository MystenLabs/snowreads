This helps\nexplain to a user why a constraint specification does not admit a solution.\nFinding MUSes can be computationally expensive for highly symmetric problems,\nas many combinations of constraints need to be considered. In the traditional\ncontext of solving satisfaction problems, symmetry has been well studied, and\neffective ways to detect and exploit symmetries during the search exist.\nHowever, in the setting of finding MUSes of unsatisfiable constraint programs,\nsymmetries are understudied. In this paper, we take inspiration from existing\nsymmetry-handling techniques and adapt well-known MUS-computation methods to\nexploit symmetries in the specification, speeding-up overall computation time.\nOur results display a significant reduction of runtime for our adapted\nalgorithms compared to the baseline on symmetric problems.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Mfx4F4EQV9DbVishQhsi9YVxBVniPcyMtw0qtCKJE8c","pdfSize":"423563"}
