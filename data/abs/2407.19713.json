We show the existence of suitable weak\nsolutions in three spatial dimensions, that is weak solutions which fulfill an\nenergy inequality, via a regularized system. The flow is modeled by a\nNavier--Stokes--Nernst--Planck--Poisson system and the anisotropy is introduced\nvia space dependent diffusion matrices in the Nernst--Planck and Poisson\nequations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QCXyuoSivh71QFt7UW0INvPjmMYMF-XwwUB-wr0MrEU","pdfSize":"977691"}
