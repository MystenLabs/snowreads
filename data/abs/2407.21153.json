To fill this gap, we introduce the \\hadath\ncorpus ($550$k tokens) as an extension of Wojood, enriched with event-argument\nannotations. We used three types of event arguments: $agent$, $location$, and\n$date$, which we annotated as relation types. Our inter-annotator agreement\nevaluation resulted in $82.23\\%$ $Kappa$ score and $87.2\\%$ $F_1$-score.\nAdditionally, we propose a novel method for event relation extraction using\nBERT, in which we treat the task as text entailment. This method achieves an\n$F_1$-score of $94.01\\%$. To further evaluate the generalization of our\nproposed method, we collected and annotated another out-of-domain corpus (about\n$80$k tokens) called \\testNLI and used it as a second test set, on which our\napproach achieved promising results ($83.59\\%$ $F_1$-score). Last but not\nleast, we propose an end-to-end system for event-arguments extraction. This\nsystem is implemented as part of SinaTools, and both corpora are publicly\navailable at {\\small \\url{https://sina.birzeit.edu/wojood}}\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"IV4_VzCmp6YUHwlfW2Xdc1lYP9DsgXwtPlK192uSAFA","pdfSize":"916152"}
