  "abstract": "  Developing whole-body tactile skins for robots remains a challenging task, as\nexisting solutions often prioritize modular, one-size-fits-all designs, which,\nwhile versatile, fail to account for the robot's specific shape and the unique\ndemands of its operational context. In this work, we introduce the GenTact\nToolbox, a computational pipeline for creating versatile whole-body tactile\nskins tailored to both robot shape and application domain. Our pipeline\nincludes procedural mesh generation for conforming to a robot's topology,\ntask-driven simulation to refine sensor distribution, and multi-material 3D\nprinting for shape-agnostic fabrication. We validate our approach by creating\nand deploying six capacitive sensing skins on a Franka Research 3 robot arm in\na human-robot interaction scenario. This work represents a shift from\none-size-fits-all tactile sensors toward context-driven, highly adaptable\ndesigns that can be customized for a wide range of robotic systems and\napplications.\n",
