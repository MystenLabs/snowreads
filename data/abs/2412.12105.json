  "abstract": "  The problems raised by anti-commons and bureaucracy have been linked since\nthe study of Buchanan and Yoon (2000). Bureaucracy involves a multitude of\nagents that have deciding power. At the view of conflicting interests, the\ndecision makers inertia or the inertia of the system itself, excessive\nadministrative procedures or too many administrative circuits push for too late\ndecisions, or for non-rational decisions in terms of value creation for\neconomic agents. Property Rights Theory explains new concerns. Considering that\nan anti-commons problem arises when there are multiple rights to exclude, the\nproblem of decision process in aquaculture projects makes sense at this level.\nHowever, little attention has been given to the setting where more than one\nperson is assigned exclusion rights, which may be exercised. Anti-commons\nproblem is analyzed in situations in which resources are inefficiently\nunder-utilized rather than over-utilized as in the familiar commons setting. In\nthis study, fisheries problems are studied and some ways to deal with the\nproblem are presented.\n",
