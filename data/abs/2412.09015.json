  "abstract": "  Motor imagery (MI) is a classical paradigm in electroencephalogram (EEG)\nbased brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Online accurate and fast decoding is\nvery important to its successful applications. This paper proposes a simple yet\neffective front-end replication dynamic window (FRDW) algorithm for this\npurpose. Dynamic windows enable the classification based on a test EEG trial\nshorter than those used in training, improving the decision speed; front-end\nreplication fills a short test EEG trial to the length used in training,\nimproving the classification accuracy. Within-subject and cross-subject online\nMI classification experiments on three public datasets, with three different\nclassifiers and three different data augmentation approaches, demonstrated that\nFRDW can significantly increase the information transfer rate in MI decoding.\nAdditionally, FR can also be used in training data augmentation. FRDW helped\nwin national champion of the China BCI Competition in 2022.\n",
