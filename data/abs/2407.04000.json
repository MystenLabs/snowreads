An old question of\nBorel and Haefliger asks whether any (possibly singular) algebraic subvariety\nof $X$ is homologically equivalent to a linear combination with integral\ncoefficients of smooth algebraic subvarieties of $X$. In general, this question\nis too optimistic, and counterexamples have been known for a long time. The aim\nof this survey is to explain how J\\'anos Koll\\'ar and Claire Voisin have\nprovided a positive answer to Borel and Haefliger's question, for subvarieties\nof dimension less than half the dimension of $X$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"R4OJFyZHKz3UbzFnTatghBHsGX5LKKxi62Yq4HUBIWw","pdfSize":"282141"}
