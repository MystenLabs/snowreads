  "abstract": "  Positional encodings are a common component of neural scene reconstruction\nmethods, and provide a way to bias the learning of neural fields towards\ncoarser or finer representations. Current neural surface reconstruction methods\nuse a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach to encoding, choosing a fixed set of\nencoding functions, and therefore bias, across all scenes. Current\nstate-of-the-art surface reconstruction approaches leverage grid-based\nmulti-resolution hash encoding in order to recover high-detail geometry. We\npropose a learned approach which allows the network to choose its encoding\nbasis as a function of space, by masking the contribution of features stored at\nseparate grid resolutions. The resulting spatially adaptive approach allows the\nnetwork to fit a wider range of frequencies without introducing noise. We test\nour approach on standard benchmark surface reconstruction datasets and achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets.\n",
