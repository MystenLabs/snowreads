Fundamentally, this is a consequence of the\nAharonov-Bohm effect or, in field-theoretic language, of a Chern-Simons term.\nThis is also intimately related to a transmutation of the exchange statistics\nof the original charges. We show that a remnant of this mechanism is found\nafter a dimensional reduction of a pure Chern-Simons theory and its subsequent\ncoupling to matter.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bprEAIh74lIHUkRWV6s_bVXf6kuWFIR26bPkqLHg6TY","pdfSize":"2495767"}
