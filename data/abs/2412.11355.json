There is a bottleneck in scalable computation for general\nscientific use as the existing solutions require high-performance computing\ndomain knowledge and are tailored for specific use cases. This study presents\nan R package `chopin` to reduce the technical burden for parallelization in\ngeocomputation. Supporting popular spatial analysis packages in R, `chopin`\nleverages parallel computing by partitioning data that are involved in a\ncomputation task. The partitioning is implemented at regular grids, data\nhierarchies, and multiple file inputs with flexible input types for\ninteroperability between different packages and efficiency. This approach makes\nthe geospatial covariate calculation to the scale of the available processing\npower in a wide range of computing assets from laptop computers to\nhigh-performance computing infrastructure. Testing use cases in environmental\nexposure assessment demonstrated that the package reduced the execution time by\norder of processing units used. The work is expected to provide broader\nresearch communities using geospatial data with an efficient tool to process\nlarge scale data.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computer Science/Performance","Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"a5o9vij9_JCOFGRnegGJ4UJ5_8RNB04gMA4E9A64stU","pdfSize":"10494588"}
