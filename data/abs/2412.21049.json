  "abstract": "  Modeling and forecasting the spread of infectious diseases is essential for\neffective public health decision-making. Traditional epidemiological models\nrely on expert-defined frameworks to describe complex dynamics, while neural\nnetworks, despite their predictive power, often lack interpretability due to\ntheir ``black-box\" nature. This paper introduces the Finite Expression Method,\na symbolic learning framework that leverages reinforcement learning to derive\nexplicit mathematical expressions for epidemiological dynamics. Through\nnumerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, FEX\ndemonstrates high accuracy in modeling and predicting disease spread, while\nuncovering explicit relationships among epidemiological variables. These\nresults highlight FEX as a powerful tool for infectious disease modeling,\ncombining interpretability with strong predictive performance to support\npractical applications in public health.\n",
