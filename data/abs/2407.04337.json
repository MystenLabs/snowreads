An accurate determination of the spin frequency change\nover time can assist in interpreting RX J0806.4-4123's properties in comparison\nto those of other XTINSs and the wider pulsar population. From 2019 to 2023 we\ncarried out a tailored X-ray timing campaign of RX J0806.4-4123 with the NICER\ninstrument. We used statistical properties of the Fourier coefficients and the\n$Z_K^2$ test for phase-connecting separate observations and finding a timing\nsolution for the entire dataset. We also developed a simple and universal\nmethod for estimating the uncertainties of frequency $\\nu$ and its derivative\n$\\dot{\\nu}$ from the empirical dependencies of $Z_K^2$ on trial values of these\nparameters, with account of all significant harmonics of the frequency.\nApplying this method, we determined a spin-down rate $\\dot{\\nu} =\n-7.3(1.2)\\times 10^{-17}\\,{\\rm Hz\\, s}^{-1}$. The resulting spin-down power\n$\\dot{E}=2.6\\times 10^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$ is the lowest among the XTINSs, and it\nis a factor of 60 lower than the X-ray luminosity of this neutron star. RX\nJ0806.4-4123 is also among the pulsars with the lowest measured $\\dot{E}$ in\ngeneral.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-gCRLEhPYypq3DnYvomtP8hgGWrpDnzkQ9yB6fLbxdA","pdfSize":"1619031"}
