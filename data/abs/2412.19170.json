Upon hydrodynamic grounds, it is reasonable to relax this\ncondition in order to account for the correlated fluid fluctuations, especially\nin the case of liquids, consistently with the inclusion of acoustic effects and\nwith the finite speed of propagation of internal shear stresses. We show that\nthe introduction of correlated stochastic processes in the basic fluctuational\npatterns defined in Giona et al. (2024), preserves the global\nfluctuation-dissipation relation, connecting diffusivity to the global friction\nfactor, and the resulting velocity fluctuations become almost everywhere smooth\nfunctions of time. Moreover, a fluctuational added mass arises as a consequence\nof correlations. This leads to a fluctuation-inertia relation, connecting the\nfluctuational added mass at microscale to its occurrence for macroscopic\nobjects.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9KnoBPTCDuOrycDgS39Saoz72tbZd4T8zZasB_kYKkE","pdfSize":"434898"}
