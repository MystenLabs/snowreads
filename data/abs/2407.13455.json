For a collection of several plane curve valuations it appeared to\ncoincide with the Alexander polynomial of the corresponding algebraic link.\nRecently, the authors defined Poincar\\'e series of a valuation or of a\ncollection of valuations in the real setting. (Actually, there were defined\nthree versions of them, however, one of them was found to be ``not\ncomputable''.) These two Poincar'e series were computed for one plane curve\nvaluation. Here we compute them for a plane divisorial valuation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dgpI5dU69ap-U0qZfHer8D9JXnhGR6ntjjJ_nahsQCs","pdfSize":"128392"}
