We identify three distinct thermodynamic phases (black holes)\nand analyze their thermodynamic properties extensively, including phase\ntransitions amongst the several phases. While the properties of the canonical\nensemble aligns with existing conjectures on BFSS thermodynamics, we uncover\nintriguing and unexpected behavior in the microcanonical ensemble.\nSpecifically, for sufficiently low energies, we observe the dominance of the\nlocalized phase. Surprisingly, we also identify an energy range where the\nnon-uniform phase becomes dominant. The transition between these phases is\nmediated by a Kol-type topology-changing phenomenon.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-aMCbtabuvW9RqXK8q657xuNOzx-yPPYmb2z89holdY","pdfSize":"2234694"}
