We\nfind that the model with non-unified gaugino masses can make a contribution\n$\\Delta a_\\mu\\sim 20 \\times 10^{-10}$ to the anomalous magnetic moment of the\nmuon, for example if $M_{1,2} \\sim 600$ GeV and $M_3\\sim 8$ TeV. The model with\nnon-universal sfermion and Higgs masses can provide even larger $\\Delta a_\\mu\n\\sim 24 \\times 10^{-10}$ if the sfermion masses for the first and the second\ngenerations are $ \\sim 400 $ GeV and that of the third is $ \\sim 8 $ TeV. We\ndiscuss the prospects for collider searches for supersymmetric particles in\nspecific benchmark scenarios illustrating these possibilities, focusing in\nparticular on the prospects for detecting the lighter smuon and the lightest\nneutralino.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2rZqmovCOquWEx6P28FSPwhULM2ermrMl35A-NNc7Ew","pdfSize":"3709051"}
