In the domain of visual object\nrecognition, prior research has illuminated inner workings of InceptionV1, but\nDNNs with different architectures have remained largely unexplored. This work\ninvestigates ResNet18 with a particular focus on its residual stream, an\narchitectural mechanism which InceptionV1 lacks. We observe that for a given\nblock, channel features of the stream are updated along a spectrum: either the\ninput feature skips to the output, the block feature overwrites the output, or\nthe output is some mixture between the input and block features. Furthermore,\nwe show that many residual stream channels compute scale invariant\nrepresentations through a mixture of the input's smaller-scale feature with the\nblock's larger-scale feature. This not only mounts evidence for the\nuniversality of scale equivariance, but also presents how the residual stream\nfurther implements scale invariance. Collectively, our results begin an\ninterpretation of the residual stream in visual object recognition, finding it\nto be a flexible feature manager and a medium to build scale invariant\nrepresentations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4BsgKG_cpdiRRUoQQVOfMufURn6pKdQr0XWxYbX_n-M","pdfSize":"32827948"}
