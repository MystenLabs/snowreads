It was specified by the\nproperty to act on an $O_{\\ell+1}$-fixed vector in a\n$GL_{\\ell+1}(\\mathbb{R})$-principal series representation via multiplication by\nthe local Archimedean $L$-factor canonically attached to the representation. In\nthis note we propose another way to define the Hecke-Baxter operator,\nidentifying it with a generalized Whittaker function for an extension of the\nLie group $GL_{\\ell+1}(\\mathbb{R})\\times GL_{\\ell+1}(\\mathbb{R})$ by a\nHeisenberg Lie group. We also show how this Whittaker function can be lifted to\na matrix element of an extension of the Lie group\n$Sp_{2\\ell+2}(\\mathbb{R})\\times Sp_{2\\ell+2}(\\mathbb{R})$ by a Heisenberg Lie\ngroup.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"meawSsJfHo2m6zthnMuJBB4PZTALuMypq9qD8P8mTVo","pdfSize":"260249"}
