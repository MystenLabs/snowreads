These analyses are based on proton-proton collision data collected\nby both experiments at the CERN LHC, with a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV.\nThe data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of up to 140 fb$^{-1}$.\nFiducial Differential cross sections are measured for various observables\nsensitive to the production and decay of the Higgs boson. All measurements\nalign with Standard Model predictions. The results are used to constrain\npotential anomalous interactions between the Higgs boson and other Standard\nModel particles.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VIJS3HlHNwpIJDcgQtjqyDITAQuwLKQ06KOn62jzskc","pdfSize":"1269204"}
