Assuming the Generalised Riemann\nHypothesis for Dirichlet $L$-functions (GRH), we show that for every\nsufficiently large even integer $N$ there are $a,b \\geq 1$ such that $$ a+b = N\n\\text{ and } \\lambda(a) = \\lambda(b) = -1. $$ This conditionally answers an\nanalogue of the binary Goldbach problem for the Liouville function, posed by\nShusterman.\n  The latter is a consequence of a quantitative lower bound on the frequency of\nsign patterns attained by $(\\lambda(n),\\lambda(N-n))$, for sufficiently large\nprimes $N$. We show, assuming GRH, that there is a constant $C > 0$ such that\nfor each pattern $(\\eta_1,\\eta_2) \\in \\{-1,+1\\}^2$ and each prime $N \\geq N_0$,\n$$ |\\{n < N : (\\lambda(n),\\lambda(N-n)) = (\\eta_1,\\eta_2)\\}| \\gg N e^{-C(\\log\n\\log N)^{6}}. $$ The proof makes essential use of the Pierce expansion of\nrational numbers $n/N$, which may be of interest in other binary problems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VwKUVOAhfp4tosfx-32o0bOmUakKjDlrXLyb0rv2my4","pdfSize":"353258"}
