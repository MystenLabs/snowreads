  "abstract": "  We analyze the discrete-time dynamics of a model of non-interacting fermions\non a finite graph coupled to an infinite reservoir formed by a bosonic quantum\nwalk on Z. This dynamics consists of consecutive applications of free\nevolutions of the fermions and bosons followed by a local coupling between\nthem. The unitary operator implementing this coupling generates fermionic\ntransitions between two fixed vertices induced by absorption and emission of\nbosons at a single lattice site. The free fermion evolution is given by a\nsecond-quantized single-particle unitary operator satisfying some genericity\nassumptions, in particular it produces hopping of fermions between all\nvertices. The free boson evolution is given by the second-quantized shift\noperator on Z. We derive explicitly the Heisenberg dynamics of fermionic\nobservables and obtain a systematic expansion in the large-coupling regime,\nwhich we control by using spectral methods. We also prove that the reduced\nstate of the fermions converges in the large-time limit to an\ninfinite-temperature Gibbs\n",
