The structure of a given cycle is determined by\nthe strongly connected components (or strong components, SCs) that appear after\nsuppressing the arcs of the cycle. By this process and by the contraction of\nall SCs into single vertices we obtain a Hasse diagram from the MSD. Among\nother properties, we show that any SC conformed by more than one vertex (non\ntrivial SC) has at least one linear vertex (a vertex with indegree and\noutdegree equal to 1) in the MSD (Theorem 1); that in the Hasse diagram at\nleast one linear vertex exists for each non trivial maximal (resp. minimal)\nvertex (Theorem 2); that if an SC contains a number $\\lambda$ of vertices of\nthe cycle then it contains at least $\\lambda$ linear vertices in the MSD\n(Theorem 3); and, finally, that given a cycle of length $q$ contained in the\nMSD, the number $\\alpha$ of linear vertices contained in the MSD satisfies\n$\\alpha \\geq \\lfloor (q+1)/2 \\rfloor$ (Theorem 4).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"2y_2y7guseCM6zUyD_wMDmZ1XwRaB8WMWsysKpcNmo0","pdfSize":"161011"}
