  "abstract": "  Within the dynamic world of Big Data, traditional systems typically operate\nin a passive mode, processing and responding to user queries by returning the\nrequested data. However, this methodology falls short of meeting the evolving\ndemands of users who not only wish to analyze data but also to receive\nproactive updates on topics of interest. To bridge this gap, Big Active Data\n(BAD) frameworks have been proposed to support extensive data subscriptions and\nanalytics for millions of subscribers. As data volumes and the number of\ninterested users continue to increase, the imperative to optimize BAD systems\nfor enhanced scalability, performance, and efficiency becomes paramount. To\nthis end, this paper introduces three main optimizations, namely: strategic\naggregation, intelligent modifications to the query plan, and early result\nfiltering, all aimed at reinforcing a BAD platform's capability to actively\nmanage and efficiently process soaring rates of incoming data and distribute\nnotifications to larger numbers of subscribers.\n",
