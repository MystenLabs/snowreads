When applied to the\nRobertson-Walker metric, it simplifies the analysis of cosmological evolution\nby dividing the Einstein field equations into constraint and evolution\nequations. It introduces the lapse function $N$ and the shift vector $N^i$,\nwhich control how time and spatial coordinates evolve between hypersurfaces. In\nstandard model cosmology, $N = 1$ and $N^i = 0$ for the Robertson-Walker\nmetric. However, the $N$ becomes a function of time when we apply the metric to\nthe minimally extended varying speed of light model. This approach allows for a\nmore direct examination of the evolution of spatial geometry and offers\nflexibility in handling scenarios where the lapse function and shift vector\nvary. In this manuscript, we derive the model's $N$ and $N^i$, along with the\nconstraint and evolution equations, and demonstrate their consistency with the\nexisting Einstein equations. We have shown in a previous paper that the\npossibility of changes in the speed of light in the Robertson-Walker metric is\ndue to cosmological time dilation. Through the $3+1$ formalism, we can make the\nphysical significance more explicit and demonstrate that it can be interpreted\nas the lapse function. From this, we show that the minimally extended varying\nspeed of light model is consistent.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"s-IP0hR5Zhp8ZYeF24UevTZA2S4FO-E80O4_uXObh4o","pdfSize":"412384"}
