  "abstract": "  Polarization flutter, produced by an applied AC electric field drives an\nequilibrium ferroelectric nematic ($\\mathrm{N_F}$) liquid crystal (LC) through\na transition into a dissipative active ferroelectric nematic state exhibiting\nstrong elasto-hydrodynamic intermolecular interaction. In such a fluttering\nferroelectric, the typical equilibrium $\\mathrm{N_F}$ textural features adopted\nto reduce electrostatic energy, such as preferences for director bend, and\nalignment of polarization parallel to LC/air interfaces, are overcome, giving\nway to nonequilibrium conjugate structures in which director splay, and\nalignment of polarization normal to $\\mathrm{N_F}$/air interfaces are\npreferred. Viewing the latter textures as those of an active nematic phase\nreveals that self-organization to reduce effective viscosity and resulting\ndissipation generates a flow-driven apparent nematic elasticity and interface\nstructuring that dominates equilibrium LC elastic and surface forces.\n",
