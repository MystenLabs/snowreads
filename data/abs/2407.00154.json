They are constructed from mixed-angulations of surfaces and\noften admit a (relative) Calabi--Yau structure. We discovered these algebras\nthrough two very distinct routes, one involving perverse schobers whose stalks\nare cyclic quotients of the derived categories of relative Ginzburg algebras,\nand another involving deformations of partially wrapped Fukaya categories of\nsurfaces. Applying the results of our previous work arXiv:2303.18249, we\ndescribe the spaces of stability conditions on the derived categories of these\nalgebras in terms of spaces of quadratic differentials.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dH9xMr_cg6EGaQU10BUHr1Hdc_-XYKBGHw1ikmZvmb0","pdfSize":"815359"}
