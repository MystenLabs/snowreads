  "abstract": "  Pansharpening is a crucial task in remote sensing, enabling the generation of\nhigh-resolution multispectral images by fusing low-resolution multispectral\ndata with high-resolution panchromatic images. This paper provides a\ncomprehensive analysis of traditional and deep learning-based pansharpening\nmethods. While state-of-the-art deep learning methods have significantly\nimproved image quality, issues like spectral distortions persist. To address\nthis, we propose enhancements to the PSGAN framework by introducing novel\nregularization techniques for the generator loss function. Experimental results\non images from the Worldview-3 dataset demonstrate that the proposed\nmodifications improve spectral fidelity and achieve superior performance across\nmultiple quantitative metrics while delivering visually superior results.\n",
