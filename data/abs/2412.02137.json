{"id":"2412.02137","title":"From Pixels to Planes: Minimum Ground Sample Distance for Aircraft","authors":"Matthew Ciolino, Willie Maddox","authorsParsed":[["Ciolino","Matthew",""],["Maddox","Willie",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 14:55:44 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-04","timestamp":1732114544000,"abstract":"  This study investigates the impact of ground sample distance (GSD) on the\ndetection performance of various sized aircraft using the proprietary AllPlanes\n120 dataset. The data set comprises 120 civilian, military and museum aircraft\nfrom multiple satellite/aerial sources collected over two years. Resolutions\nranging from 2.4 to 0.3 meters GSD were simulated. Performance metrics were\nderived from a YOLOv8s model trained on down-sampled versions of zoom level 19\n(0.3m GSD) imagery. The results indicate that a GSD of at least 0.86m is\nrequired to accurately detect most aircraft, particularly those with wingspans\nshorter than 20 meters. Due to weight constraints in high-altitude platforms,\nthis GSD specification can inform camera design to minimize weight while\nmaintaining detection accuracy.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MyHT44thPzqPEPvRETYWrBe3XsS4U6F0lyEchcRtU-0","pdfSize":"1347519"}
