Loxodromes are special curves which\ncut all meridians on the Earth's surface at a constant angle and they are very\npopular in engineering. Ships sailing and airplanes flying along a fixed\nmagnetic compass course move along this curve. The Mercator projections of the\nloxodromes on the sphere correspond to the lines and their stereographic\nprojections to the logarithmic spirals. In general, loxodromes are not great\ncircle arcs (geodesics). Geodesics correspond to the shortest distance between\ntwo points on the Earth's surface. Since loxodromes do not need to change\ncourse, they are important in navigation. Up till now, there have been many\nimportant studies of loxodromes on different surfaces (sphere, ellipsoid,\nrotational, helicoidal, canal, twisted, etc.) and in different ambient spaces\n(Euclidean, Minkowski, simply isotropic, etc.). However, there is no study on\nloxodromes in pseudo-isotropic space I_p^3. In I_p^3, different\npseudo-isotropic angles can be defined depending on whether the vectors are\nspace-like or time-like as in Minkowski space. In this study, we will first\ndefine these angles in I_p^3. Then, the equations of space-like and time-like\nloxodromes and geodesics on rotational surfaces will be obtained. Some examples\nwill also be provided.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"htyWdfzqMeA5MiDLmFcmEMjLGfoarcTfGiPtW2I37G4","pdfSize":"560728"}
