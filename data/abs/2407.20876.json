The process requires tedious manual work, which limits the size of the\ncorpora that can be studied. Few works have attempted to automate this task,\nand none have been properly released and evaluated from a computer vision\nperspective. We propose a fully automatic approach that introduces several\ninnovations compared to previous methods. We rely on fast and robust local\ndescriptors matching that is set automatically. Second, the core of our\nproposal is a clustering-based approach that uses an intrinsic metric (that\ndoes not need the ground truth labels) to determine its critical\nhyper-parameters. We validate the approach on two corpora of Greek coins,\npropose an automatic implementation and evaluation of previous baselines, and\nshow that our approach significantly outperforms them.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Fu8kJKj31xGeyrOHXl4Yx7Epk-wQtBjHuDPQV7D1d6A","pdfSize":"970409","objectId":"0x0168b74a8d9b36a9c1705212f481b9fca5e63b14ade80af89a4bc3c9a400f75c","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
