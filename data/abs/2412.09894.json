Considering the points as fixed (not random)\nentities and focusing on the worst-case, this article uncovers a prediction\nprocedure that is optimal relatively to some model-set information about $f$.\nWhen the model sets are convex, this procedure turns out to be an affine map\nconstructed by solving a convex optimization program. The theoretical result is\nspecified in the two practical frameworks of (reproducing kernel) Hilbert\nspaces and of spaces of continuous functions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"16oewMqfgblERYIuECQSadiVvl5XoIG8qgtO2Y5eAVQ","pdfSize":"270352"}
