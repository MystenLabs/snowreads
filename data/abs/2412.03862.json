  "abstract": "  The Union-Closed Sets Conjecture asks whether every union-closed set family\n$\\mathcal{F}$ has an element contained in $\\frac12 |\\mathcal{F}|$ of its sets.\nIn 2022, Nagel posed a generalisation of this problem, suggesting that the\n$k$th most popular element in a union-closed set family must be contained in at\nleast $\\frac{1}{2^{k-1} + 1} |\\mathcal{F}|$ sets.\n  We combine the entropic method of Gilmer with the combinatorial arguments of\nKnill to show that this is indeed the case for all $k \\ge 3$, and when $k = 2$\nand either $|\\mathcal{F}| \\le 44$ or $|\\mathcal{F}| \\ge 114$, and characterise\nthe families that achieve equality.\n  Furthermore, we show that when $|\\mathcal{F}| \\to \\infty$, the $k$th most\nfrequent element will appear in at least $\\left( \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{5}}{2} - o(1)\n\\right) |\\mathcal{F}|$ sets, reflecting the recent progress made for the\nUnion-Closed Set Conjecture.\n",
