MIMO detection poses considerable challenges due to the\ninterference and noise introduced by the concurrent transmission of multiple\nstreams. Efficient Uplink (UL) MIMO detection algorithms are crucial for\ndecoding these signals accurately and ensuring robust communication. In this\npaper a MIMO detection algorithm is proposed which improves over the\nExpectation Propagation (EP) algorithm. The proposed algorithm is based on a\nGaussian Mixture Model (GMM) approximation for Belief Propagation (BP) and EP\nmessages. The GMM messages better approximate the data prior when EP fails to\ndo so and thus improve detection. This algorithm outperforms state of the art\ndetection algorithms while maintaining low computational complexity.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"U6wQuclEthIxvFwSxkWs8cpd_pvT7YyhFcuMI1anAnI","pdfSize":"184782"}
