A naturally small portal to the dark sector is\nobtained if dark-sector interactions stem from a non-Abelian hidden gauge group\nthat couples through kinetic mixing with the hypercharge boson. In this work,\nwe investigate the phenomenology of such a portal of dimension five in the\npresence of CP violation, focusing on its signatures in fermion electric dipole\nmoments. We show that, currently unbounded regions of the parameter space from\ndark photon searches can be indirectly probed with upcoming electron dipole\nmoment experiments for dark boson masses in the range $1-100$ GeV. We also\ndiscuss two particular scenarios where a $SU(2)_D$ dark gauge group\nspontaneously breaks into either an Abelian $U(1)_D$ or nothing. In both cases,\nwe show that potentially observable electron dipole moments can be produced in\nvast regions of the parameter space compatible with current experimental\nconstraints and observed dark matter abundance.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cepCMtclDzyjq6muzTeT9M7zf6v3_7GmDPFQnlfV-bs","pdfSize":"1127854"}
