  "abstract": "  Ion Beam Analysis (IBA) is an established tool for material characterization,\nproviding precise information on elemental composition, depth profiles, and\nstructural information in the region near the surface of materials. However,\ntraditional data processing methods can be slow and computationally intensive,\nlimiting the efficiency and speed of the analysis. This article explores the\ncurrent landscape of applying Machine Learning Algorithms (MLA) in the field of\nIBA, demonstrating the immense potential to optimize and accelerate processes.\nWe present how ML has been employed to extract valuable insights from large\ndatasets, automate repetitive tasks, and enhance the interpretability of\nresults, with practical examples of applications in various IBA techniques,\nsuch as RBS, PIXE, and others. Finally, perspectives on using MLA to approach\nopen problems in IBA are also discussed.\n",
