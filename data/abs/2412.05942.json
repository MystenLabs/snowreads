There are two main\ncontributions in this thesis.\n  The first main contribution concerns a special class of S-FGs where the\npartition function of each S-FG equals the permanent of a nonnegative square\nmatrix. The Bethe partition function for such an S-FG is called the Bethe\npermanent. A combinatorial characterization of the Bethe permanent is given by\nthe degree-$M$ Bethe permanent, which is defined based on the degree-$M$ graph\ncovers of the underlying S-FG. In this thesis, we prove a\ndegree-$M$-Bethe-permanent-based lower bound on the permanent of a non-negative\nsquare matrix, resolving a conjecture proposed by Vontobel in [IEEE Trans. Inf.\nTheory, Mar. 2013]. We also prove a degree-$M$-Bethe-permanent-based upper\nbound on the permanent of a non-negative matrix. In the limit $M \\to \\infty$,\nthese lower and upper bounds yield known Bethe-permanent-based lower and upper\nbounds on the permanent of a non-negative square matrix.\n  The second main contribution is giving a combinatorial characterization of\nthe Bethe partition function for DE-FGs in terms of finite graph covers. In\ngeneral, approximating the partition function of a DE-FG is more challenging\nthan for an S-FG because the partition function of the DE-FG is a sum of\ncomplex values and not just a sum of non-negative real values. Moreover, one\ncannot apply the method of types for proving the combinatorial characterization\nas in the case of S-FGs. We overcome this challenge by applying a suitable\nloop-calculus transform (LCT) for both S-FGs and DE-FGs. Currently, we provide\na combinatorial characterization of the Bethe partition function in terms of\nfinite graph covers for a class of DE-FGs satisfying an (easily checkable)\ncondition.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3xyCIchJytn3BC38aY6uXkn4SOjzEDiY7Wu7Iffoz0E","pdfSize":"1753797"}
