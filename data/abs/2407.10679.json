Large asteroid impacts and supervolcanic eruptions have been\nsuggested as stochastic geological events that could cause a sudden end to\nglobal glaciation via a runaway melting process. Here, we employ an energy\nbalance climate model to simulate the evolution of Snowball Earth's surface\ntemperature after such events. We find that even a large impactor (diameters of\n$d \\sim 100\\,\\mathrm{km}$) and the supervolcanic Toba eruption\n($74\\,\\mathrm{kyr}$ ago), are insufficient to terminate a Snowball state unless\nbackground CO$_2$ has already been driven to high levels by long-term\noutgassing. We suggest, according to our modeling framework, that Earth's\nSnowball states would have been resilient to termination by stochastic events.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"smzURm0lKRhYqBC8rXOgqKeYn-zjUsKG_ClhH2i4fjg","pdfSize":"4114351"}
