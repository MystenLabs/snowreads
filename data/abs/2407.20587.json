Using\nSeoul's credit card data from 2018 to 2023, we find a clear preference for\nshopping at amenities close to consumers' residences, particularly for trips\nwithin a 2 km radius, where relatedness density significantly influences\npurchasing decisions. The COVID-19 pandemic initially reduced this effect at\nshorter distances but rebounded in 2023, suggesting a resilient return to\npre-pandemic patterns, which vary over regions. Our findings highlight the\nresilience of local shopping preferences despite economic disruptions,\nunderscoring the importance of amenity-relatedness in urban consumer behavior.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DR0wTr8XCvWxcLpQuM3TcJ7eAXXsZNjMvC6RawDjSxY","pdfSize":"2916855"}
