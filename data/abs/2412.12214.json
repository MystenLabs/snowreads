  "abstract": "  Liver cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with\nits high genetic heterogeneity complicating diagnosis and treatment. This study\nintroduces DLSOM, a deep learning framework utilizing stacked autoencoders to\nanalyze the complete somatic mutation landscape of 1,139 liver cancer samples,\ncovering 20,356 protein-coding genes. By transforming high-dimensional mutation\ndata into three low-dimensional features, DLSOM enables robust clustering and\nidentifies five distinct liver cancer subtypes with unique mutational,\nfunctional, and biological profiles. Subtypes SC1 and SC2 exhibit higher\nmutational loads, while SC3 has the lowest, reflecting mutational\nheterogeneity. Novel and COSMIC-associated mutational signatures reveal\nsubtype-specific molecular mechanisms, including links to hypermutation and\nchemotherapy resistance. Functional analyses further highlight the biological\nrelevance of each subtype. This comprehensive framework advances precision\nmedicine in liver cancer by enabling the development of subtype-specific\ndiagnostics, biomarkers, and therapies, showcasing the potential of deep\nlearning in addressing cancer complexity.\n",
