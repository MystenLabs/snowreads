In this study, we take the lead in\ndescribing corresponding exploration scenarios, including underlying\nrequirements and available exploration strategies. To facilitate practical\napplications, we propose a visual analysis approach to the formulation of\nexploration strategies. Our approach applies a reinforcement learning model to\nprovide diverse suggestions for exploration strategies according to the\nexploration intent of users. A novel visual design for representing uncertainty\nin correlation patterns is integrated into our prototype system to support the\nproposed approach. Finally, we implemented a user study and two case studies.\nThe results of these studies verified that our approach can help develop\nstrategies that satisfy the exploration intent of users.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zdhvw_yOKLZdjptLDsMrcvXCRezYnqNAFYrQ-agRhCo","pdfSize":"1895602","objectId":"0xc8bf37c4c47dde2fddf1cdf3d7acacdf5432619bab24e4a541d8036ff21376e3","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
