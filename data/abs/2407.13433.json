In this paper, we study the precision bound for the\nscheme using two-mode squeezed Gaussian states. The quantum Fisher information\nis calculated and its maximization is used to determine the optimal parameters.\nWe find that two single-mode squeezed vacuum states are the optimal inputs and\nthe corresponding precision bound is superior to the Heisenberg limit by a\nfactor of 2. For practical purposes, we consider the effects originating from\nphoton loss. The precision bound can still outperform the shot-noise limit when\nthe lossy rate is below 0.4. Our work may demonstrate a significant and\npromising step towards practical quantum metrology.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eUN7bPz1mM2m3hVG8XNo1cK-qyGqdPRsGyQEkDu1SM4","pdfSize":"575199","objectId":"0x4386e7b5c28a183d30dea7d4646c22ee81e0778481780144c9f53a6fe2adb1f6","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
