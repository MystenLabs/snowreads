Scaling laws for the velocity and physical\nextension of the contraction front are consistent with our numerical\nsimulations, and may be generally applicable to related systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons","Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZZXGH1ImaUtA10HEbYA3tqgRiMrjWxe7DtwGrwVW1rQ","pdfSize":"1164032"}
