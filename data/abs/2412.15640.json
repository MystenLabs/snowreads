The proof relies mainly on geometry and on the\nclassical lemma of Bishop and Phelps. In addition, this approach allows us to\nprovide a simplified proof of the Clakre-Ledyaev inequality. The approach is\nprimal in the sense that no dual arguments are used.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KQEyKgKI7Ay8gv6N8zlDXJbrZguNuJUCEpARPode574","pdfSize":"161467"}
