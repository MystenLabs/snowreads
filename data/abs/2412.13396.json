We show that if $I:\\mathcal{C}\\rightarrow\n\\mathcal{D}$ is an interpretation functor such that $I\\mathcal{X}\\subseteq\n\\text{mod}$-$S$ and whose restriction to $\\mathcal{X}$ is full then $I$ is full\non pure-injective modules. We apply this theorem to an extension of a functor\nintroduced by Ringel and Roggenkamp which, in particular, allows us to describe\nthe torsion-free part of the Ziegler spectra of tame B\\\"ackstr\\\"om orders. We\nalso introduce the notion of a pseudogeneric module over an order which is\nintended to play the same role for lattices over orders as generic modules do\nfor finite-dimensional modules over finite-dimensional algebras.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"L1BmBoAmDhFryYQQcGlnA95p348ICCD-m-AOkzEOL2Y","pdfSize":"484324"}
