Despite significant research efforts in log\nanomaly detection over the past decade, it remains unclear what are\npractitioners' expectations on log anomaly detection and whether current\nresearch meets their needs. To fill this gap, we conduct an empirical study,\nsurveying 312 practitioners from 36 countries about their expectations on log\nanomaly detection. In particular, we investigate various factors influencing\npractitioners' willingness to adopt log anomaly detection tools. We then\nperform a literature review on log anomaly detection, focusing on publications\nin premier venues from 2014 to 2024, to compare practitioners' needs with the\ncurrent state of research. Based on this comparison, we highlight the\ndirections for researchers to focus on to develop log anomaly detection\ntechniques that better meet practitioners' expectations.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"P_Cc7EV5FUqDhlEZZrdQ9xLuhyOMmgyW2KymrMzLkA4","pdfSize":"831136"}
