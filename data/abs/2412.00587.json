We consider two kinds of functionals: average cost per unit time and\nlong run risk sensitive. We impose uniform ergodicity assumption, which is\nlater is relaxed and suitable convergence of controlled transition\nprobabilities.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UwWAaJczoneC4tmbAE0abLgBMwFrnwVkCKxfi3FHRH4","pdfSize":"203596"}
