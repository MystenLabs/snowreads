  "abstract": "  A self-similar solution of the linearised magnetohydrodynamic equations\ndescribing the propagation of the Alfv\\'en pulse in an axially symmetric\nmagnetic tube of variable diameter is obtained. The electric field component\ninduced by the non-linear Alfv\\'en wave and directed along the tube surface,\ni.e., accelerating particles along the magnetic field, is determined on the\nbasis of the perturbation theory and specified to the case of a magnetic flux\ntube homogeneous over its cross section. For the chromospheric tubes, whose\nconfiguration is given by the barometric law of plasma pressure decrease, the\nconditions for achieving the super-Dreicer electric field limit necessary to\ndrive the accelerated high-energy electrons into the coronal part of the loop\nare established.\n",
