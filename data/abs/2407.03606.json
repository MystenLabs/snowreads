In particular, a CP code without its character can be viewed as\na subcode of a Reed-Solomon (RS) code, where a certain subset of the\ncoefficients of the message polynomial is set to zeros. We then demonstrate how\nclassical decoding methods, including list decoders, for RS codes can be\nleveraged for decoding CP codes. For instance, it is shown that, in almost all\ncases, the list decoder behaves as a unique decoder. We also present a\nprobabilistic analysis of the improvements in list decoding of CP codes when\nleveraging their certain structure as subcodes of RS codes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6H3AhLwlItcELKoOzyE1OUkC1nePAtaft5lbD9V9yRI","pdfSize":"164422"}
