Using agent-based simulations, we\nfind that even with a small fraction of $B$ particles, the phase behavior of\nthe system can be changed qualitatively, which becomes reentrant as a function\nof noise strength: traveling bands arise not only near the flocking transition,\nbut also in the low-noise regime, separated in the phase diagram by a\nhomogeneous polar liquid regime. We find that the ordered bands in the\nlow-noise regime travel through an ordered background, in contrast to their\nmetric counterparts. We develop a coarse-grained field theory, which can\naccount for the reentrant phase behavior qualitatively, provided the\nhigher-order angular modes are taken into consideration.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"R9XzO1CpMY8yYIFtJbktotvyubXWpWk50TrK_Oh_T8k","pdfSize":"5078356"}
