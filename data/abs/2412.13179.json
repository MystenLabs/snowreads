Open source\ndatasets for such parking lots are scarce, particularly for US cities. This\npaper introduces the idea of using Near-Infrared (NIR) channels as input and\nseveral post-processing techniques to improve the prediction of off-street\nsurface parking lots using satellite imagery. We constructed two datasets with\n12,617 image-mask pairs each: one with 3-channel (RGB) and another with\n4-channel (RGB + NIR). The datasets were used to train five deep learning\nmodels (OneFormer, Mask2Former, SegFormer, DeepLabV3, and FCN) for semantic\nsegmentation, classifying images to differentiate between parking and\nnon-parking pixels. Our results demonstrate that the NIR channel improved\naccuracy because parking lots are often surrounded by grass, even though the\nNIR channel needed to be upsampled from a lower resolution. Post-processing\nincluding eliminating erroneous holes, simplifying edges, and removing road and\nbuilding footprints further improved the accuracy. Best model, OneFormer\ntrained on 4-channel input and paired with post-processing techniques achieves\na mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 84.9 percent and a pixel-wise accuracy\nof 96.3 percent.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4QCD3LaqJLeCDvlFE8mv-jMjHl5eKEwEbo7TQRhDcRc","pdfSize":"10444180"}
