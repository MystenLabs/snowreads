One of the biggest hurdles\nfacing Chinese Chess application development is a proper system for judging\ngames correctly. This paper introduces a complete algorithm for ruling the WXF\nrules correctly in all 110 example cases found in the WXF manual. We introduce\nseveral novel optimizations for speeding up the repetition handling without\ncompromising the program correctness. This algorithm is usable in engines, and\nwe saw a total increase in playing strength by +10 point rating increase, or an\nincreased 5% winrate when integrating this approach into our prototype engine.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"B_zhH3gbSc6Qk9DPrYF5g_6nMxcVGjKnN0N9EjhXZa4","pdfSize":"819462"}
