  "abstract": "  We present high angular resolution imaging from the {\\sl Hubble Space\nTelescope} combined with adaptive optics imaging results from the {\\sl Keck}-II\ntelescope to determine the mass of the OGLE-2012-BLG-0563L host star and planet\nto be $M_{\\rm host} = 0.801\\pm 0.033M_\\odot$ and $M_{\\rm planet} = 1.116 \\pm\n0.087 M_{\\rm Jupiter}$, respectively, located at a distance of $D_L = 5.46\\pm\n0.56\\,$kpc. There is a close-wide degeneracy in the light curve models that\nindicates star-planet projected separation of $1.50\\pm 0.16\\,$AU for the close\nmodel and $8.41\\pm 0.87\\,$AU for the wide model. We used the image-constrained\nmodeling method to analyze the light curve data with constraints from this high\nangular resolution image analysis. This revealed systematic errors in some of\nthe ground-based light curve photometry that led to an estimate of the angular\nEinstein Radius, $\\theta_E$, that was too large by a factor of $\\sim 2$. The\nhost star mass is a factor of 2.4 larger than the value presented in the\n\\citet{fukui15} discovery paper. Although most systematic photometry errors\nseen in ground-based microlensing light curve photometry will not be repeated\nin data from the {\\sl Roman Space Telescope}'s Galactic Bulge Time Domain\nSurvey, we argue that image constrained modeling will be a valuable method to\nidentify possible systematic errors in {\\sl Roman} photometry.\n",
