This\narticle identifies two types of anthropocentric bias that have been neglected:\noverlooking how auxiliary factors can impede LLM performance despite competence\n(Type-I), and dismissing LLM mechanistic strategies that differ from those of\nhumans as not genuinely competent (Type-II). Mitigating these biases\nnecessitates an empirically-driven, iterative approach to mapping cognitive\ntasks to LLM-specific capacities and mechanisms, which can be done by\nsupplementing carefully designed behavioral experiments with mechanistic\nstudies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gYjCFaES51zs57-5lzyzR_BZIPlrlYR-Ry6UGoXeniI","pdfSize":"112542"}
