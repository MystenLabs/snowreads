  "abstract": "  Network performance modeling presents important challenges in modern computer\nnetworks due to increasing complexity, scale, and diverse traffic patterns.\nWhile traditional approaches like queuing theory and packet-level simulation\nhave served as foundational tools, they face limitations in modeling complex\ntraffic behaviors and scaling to large networks. This project presents an\nextended implementation of RouteNet-Fermi, a Graph Neural Network (GNN)\narchitecture designed for network performance prediction, with additional\nrecurrent neural network variants. We improve the the original architecture by\nimplementing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells and Recurrent Neural Network\n(RNN) cells alongside the existing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) cells\nimplementation. This work contributes to the understanding of recurrent neural\narchitectures in GNN-based network modeling and provides a flexible framework\nfor future experimentation with different cell types.\n",
