In this paper, we obtain\nthe canonical cycle using the Yau cycle for certain surface singularities of\ndegree two. Furthermore, we obtain a formula of arithmetic genera and an upper\nbound of geometric genera for these singularities. We also give some properties\nabout the classification of weighted dual graphs of certain surface\nsingularities of degree two.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"dAneNLLFoijVcLaoNwWZKUSekZ5gu_irPcHP4xpB8J0","pdfSize":"259196"}
