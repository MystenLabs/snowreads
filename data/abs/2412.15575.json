  "abstract": "  In this brief note, we tentatively investigate the possibility that the radio\nfilaments are produced when the Galactic center wind washes over magnetic field\nstructures. The electrons and ions, with their disparate charge-to-mass ratios,\nare deflected differently by the magnetic field, and a current results. The\ncurrent is subsequently Z-pinched into filaments, creating an\nelectron-accelerating electric field along the way, because the magnetic field\nnecessarily rearranges during the dynamic constriction process. An axial\nmagnetic field also arises, possibly via the diocotron channel, to eventually\nquench the pinching and stabilize the filaments against a variety of\ninstabilities.\n",
