We prove a free-boundary\nmonotonicity inequality for $E$ at a point $x\\in \\partial\\Omega$, under a\ngeometric property called ``visibility'', that $\\Omega$ is required to satisfy\nin a neighborhood of $x$. Incidentally, the visibility property is satisfied by\na considerably large class of Lipschitz and possibly non-smooth domains. Then,\nwe prove the existence of the density of the relative perimeter of $E$ at $x$,\nas well as the fact that any blow-up of $E$ at $x$ is necessarily a\nperimeter-minimizing cone within the tangent cone to $\\Omega$ at $x$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hqqAOacWDtJ9_YsDu_QNgKG3ztEoJ6LKZG57Qour9CU","pdfSize":"725159"}
