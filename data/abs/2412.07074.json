First, we develop a CSF\nestimation model for OFDM systems that relies solely on discrete pilot symbols\nin the time-frequency (TF) domain, positioned at predefined resource elements.\nWe then present theorems to elucidate the relationship between CSF compactness\nand pilot spacing in the TF domain for accurate CSF acquisition. Based on the\nestimated CSF, we finally estimate the CTF for data symbols. Numerical results\nshow that, in high-mobility scenarios, the proposed approach outperforms\ntraditional interpolation-based methods and closely matches the optimal\nestimator in terms of estimation accuracy. This work may pave the way for CSF\nestimation in commercial OFDM systems, benefiting high-mobility communications,\nintegrated sensing and communications, and related applications.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xu9LHOOauJo82I6Y7IoJEcMc5kvGurssAUlcXFaRFIU","pdfSize":"493046"}
