We investigate a class of robust heteroclinic\ncycles that does not satisfy the usual condition that all connections between\nequilibria lie in flow-invariant subspaces of equal dimension. We refer to\nthese as robust heteroclinic cycles in pluridimensions. The stability of these\ncycles cannot be expressed in terms of ratios of contracting and expanding\neigenvalues in the usual way because, when the subspace dimensions increase,\nthe equilibria fail to have contracting eigenvalues. We develop the stability\ntheory for robust heteroclinic cycles in pluridimensions, allowing for the\nabsence of contracting eigenvalues. We present four new examples, each with\nfour equilibria and living in four dimensions, that illustrate the stability\ncalculations. Potential applications include modelling the dynamics of evolving\npopulations when there are transitions between equilibria corresponding to\nmixed populations with different numbers of species.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cBAZESla1kaGeQkbwtsuC6oI5eMF6FAqtB5NGoi7l00","pdfSize":"1087466"}
