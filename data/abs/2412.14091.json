In this paper we initiate the study of the positive orthogonal\nGrassmannian $\\mathrm{OGr}_+(k,n)$ for general values of $k$ and $n$. We\ndetermine the boundary structure of the quadric $\\mathrm{OGr}_+(1,n)$ in\n$\\mathbb{P}_+^{n-1}$ and show that it is a positive geometry. We show that\n$\\mathrm{OGr}_+(k,2k+1)$ is isomorphic to $\\mathrm{OGr}_+(k+1,2k+2)$ and\nconnect its combinatorial structure to matchings on $[2k+2]$. Finally, we show\nthat in the case $n > 2k+1$, the positroid cells of $\\mathrm{Gr}_+(k,n)$ do not\ninduce a CW cell decomposition of $\\mathrm{OGr}_+(k,n)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"y5Dm6vhLdX6HRgrdfNfVW-XqbiM8PYTd03ywEQzipiw","pdfSize":"371070"}
