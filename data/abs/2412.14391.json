While statistical tests for the presence of distributional\ninvariance with respect to groups have a long history, tests for conditional\nsymmetry in the form of equivariance or conditional invariance are absent from\nthe literature. This work initiates the study of nonparametric randomization\ntests for symmetry (invariance or equivariance) of a conditional distribution\nunder the action of a specified locally compact group. We develop a general\nframework for randomization tests with finite-sample Type I error control and,\nusing kernel methods, implement tests with finite-sample power lower bounds. We\nalso describe and implement approximate versions of the tests, which are\nasymptotically consistent. We study their properties empirically on synthetic\nexamples, and on applications to testing for symmetry in two problems from\nhigh-energy particle physics.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Machine Learning","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"b9CU3ECSTAR_O_CoO1RNxvNpvJTIQvTJlpyFuOgIB3I","pdfSize":"2408843"}
