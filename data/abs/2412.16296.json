  "abstract": "  The most precise measurement to date of the W boson hadronic decay branching\nfraction ratio $R_\\mathrm{c}^\\mathrm{W}$ = $\\mathcal{B}$(W $\\to$\ncq)/$\\mathcal{B}$(W $\\to$ $\\mathrm{q\\bar{q}'}$) is presented. The measurement\nis based on a sample of proton-proton collision data from the CERN LHC\ncollected by the CMS experiment at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV in\n2016-2018 with an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. The large cross\nsection of top quark-antiquark production at the LHC offers a sizable\nhigh-purity sample of \\PW bosons suitable for this measurement. Events with one\ncharged lepton (electron or muon) and at least four jets, two tagged as bottom\nquark jets, are analyzed. Charm jets are tagged using the presence of a muon\ninside the jet. The result, $R_\\mathrm{c}^\\mathrm{W}$ = 0.489 $\\pm$ 0.020, is\nconsistent with the standard model prediction and is twice as precise as the\ncurrent world-average value.\n",
