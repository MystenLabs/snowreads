  "abstract": "  Recently Dong, Rath and Kudler-Flam proposed a modified cosmic brane\nprescription for computing the R\\'{e}nyi entropy $S_\\alpha$ of a holographic\nsystem in the presence of multiple extremal surfaces. This prescription was\nfound by assuming a diagonal approximation, where the R\\'{e}nyi entropy is\ncomputed after first measuring the areas of all extremal surfaces. We derive\nthis diagonal approximation and show that it accurately computes R\\'{e}nyi\nentropies up to $O(\\log G)$ corrections. For $\\alpha<1$, this allows us to\nderive the modified cosmic brane prescription, which differs from the original\ncosmic brane prescription at leading order in $G$. For $\\alpha>1$, it leads to\nthe original cosmic brane prescription without needing to assume that replica\nsymmetry is unbroken in the bulk.\n",
