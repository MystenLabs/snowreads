Fuzzy testing is a dynamic analysis software testing\ntechnique that consists of feeding faulty input data to a System Under Test\n(SUT) and observing its behavior. Specifically regarding black-box RESTful API\ntesting, recent literature has attempted to automate this technique using\nheuristics to perform the input search and using the HTTP response status codes\nfor classification. However, most approaches do not keep track of code\ncoverage, which is important to validate the solution. This work introduces a\nblack-box RESTful API fuzzy testing tool that employs Reinforcement Learning\n(RL) for vulnerability detection. The fuzzer operates via the OpenAPI\nSpecification (OAS) file and a scenarios file, which includes information to\ncommunicate with the SUT and the sequences of functionalities to test,\nrespectively. To evaluate its effectiveness, the tool was tested on the\nPetstore API. The tool found a total of six unique vulnerabilities and achieved\n55\\% code coverage.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ADjdV3f1XQpc0BVjl3jM-fhAOFgAI2onI3YHzWQWTQo","pdfSize":"537311"}
