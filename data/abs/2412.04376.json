We accurately estimate $b(T)$ at temperatures\nbetween 2~K and 20~K, using a.c. susceptibility measurements that, crucially,\nstretch up to the relatively high frequency of $f = 10^6$ Hz. We show that\nprevious noise measurements underestimate $b(T)$ and we suggest reasons for\nthis. Our results establish deviations in $b(T)$ from $b=2$ up to about 20 K.\nHowever studies on different samples confirms that $b(T)$ is sample dependent:\nthe details of this dependence agree in part, though not completely, with\nprevious studies of the effect of crystal defects on monopole population and\ndiffusion. Our results establish the form of $b(T)$ which characterises the\nsubtle, and evolving, nature of monopole diffusion in the dense Coulomb fluid,\na highly correlated state, where several dynamical processes combine. They do\nnot rule out the importance of a fractal landscape picture emerging at lower\ntemperatures where the monopole gas is dilute.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DNgtuitEVaUr_UVzah0dqn0dwj0Grt5jjUiBiefFjZk","pdfSize":"907029"}
