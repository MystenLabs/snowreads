We propose several metrics to perform automatic speaker verification\nbased only on phoneme durations. Experimental results demonstrate that phoneme\ndurations leak some speaker information and can reveal speaker identity from\nboth original and anonymized speech. Thus, this work emphasizes the importance\nof taking into account the speaker's speech rate and, more importantly, the\nspeaker's phonetic duration characteristics, as well as the need to modify them\nin order to develop anonymization systems with strong privacy protection\ncapacity.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Sound"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VIOxGv8Em1Gjihgb_5hM_XV6fDWGZTzR1QwoRM3qXfU","pdfSize":"138778"}
