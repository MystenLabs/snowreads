While high-definition (HD) maps can readily provide such\ninformation, they suffer from high labeling and maintenance costs. Accordingly,\nmany recent works have proposed methods for estimating HD maps online from\nsensor data. The vast majority of recent approaches encode multi-camera\nobservations into an intermediate representation, e.g., a bird's eye view (BEV)\ngrid, and produce vector map elements via a decoder. While this architecture is\nperformant, it decimates much of the information encoded in the intermediate\nrepresentation, preventing downstream tasks (e.g., behavior prediction) from\nleveraging them. In this work, we propose exposing the rich internal features\nof online map estimation methods and show how they enable more tightly\nintegrating online mapping with trajectory forecasting. In doing so, we find\nthat directly accessing internal BEV features yields up to 73% faster inference\nspeeds and up to 29% more accurate predictions on the real-world nuScenes\ndataset.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1S1UW1CiIaVPYrB7ikpUhn6o2gdFzEN8h0uoNjM6opc","pdfSize":"4639693"}
