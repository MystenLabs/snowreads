One of our\napproaches consists in reversing, as much as possible, the gadgetization of\nHadamard gates, which is a procedure used by some $T$-count optimizers to\ncircumvent Hadamard gates at the expense of additional qubits. We prove the\nNP-hardness of this problem and we present an algorithm for solving it. We also\npropose a more general approach to optimize the number of qubits by showing how\nit relates to the problem of finding a minimal-width path-decomposition of the\ngraph associated with a given ZX-diagram. This approach can be used to optimize\nthe number of qubits for any computational model that can natively be depicted\nin ZX-calculus, such as the Pauli Fusion computational model which can\nrepresent lattice surgery operations. We also show how this method can be used\nto efficiently optimize the number of qubits in a quantum circuit by using the\nZX-calculus as an intermediate representation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AlrUrsOihmY85b_sDhETehBBDZIH9f_LPO4qeDk16bs","pdfSize":"545441"}
