  "abstract": "  We report integral field spectroscopy observations with the Near-Infrared\nSpectrograph on board JWST targeting the 60 kpc environment surrounding the\nmost luminous quasar known at $z=4.6$. We detect ionized gas filaments on 40\nkpc scales connecting a network of merging galaxies likely to form a cluster.\nWe find regions of low ionization consistent with large-scale shock excitation\nsurrounding the central dust-obscured quasar, out to distances nearly eight\ntimes the effective stellar radius of the quasar host galaxy. In the nuclear\nregion, we find an ionized outflow driven by the quasar with velocities\nreaching 13,000 km s$^{-1}$, one of the fastest discovered to date with an\noutflow rate of 2000 M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and a kinetic luminosity of\n6$\\times10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$ resulting in coupling efficiency between the\nbolometric luminosity of the quasar and the outflow of 5%. The kinetic\nluminosity of the outflow is sufficient to power the turbulent motion of the\ngas on galactic and circumgalactic scales and is likely the primary driver of\nthe radiative shocks on interstellar medium and circumgalactic medium scales.\nThis provides compelling evidence supporting long-standing theoretical\npredictions that powerful quasar outflows are a main driver in regulating the\nheating and accretion rate of gas onto massive central cluster galaxies.\n",
