  "abstract": "  This paper presents the Byzantine fault-tolerant agreement protocols Flutter\nand Blink. Both algorithms are deterministic, leaderless and signature-free;\nboth assume partial synchrony and at least $(5f + 1)$ servers, where $f$ bounds\nthe number of faults. The main contribution, Flutter, is a Total-Order\nBroadcast implementation that achieves faster broadcast-to-delivery latency by\nremoving the extra message delay associated with serializing messages through a\nleader. In the \"good case\" where all processes are correct, the network is\nsynchronous, and local clocks are well-synchronized, Flutter delivers client\nrequests in $(2\\Delta + \\epsilon)$ time units, $\\Delta$ being the message delay\nand $\\epsilon$ an arbitrarily small constant. Under the same conditions,\nstate-of-the-art protocols require $3\\Delta$ time units. Flutter's good-case\nlatency is quasi-optimal, meaning it cannot be improved upon by any finite\namount. Under the hood, Flutter builds upon Blink, a (Representative) Binary\nConsensus implementation whose fast path enables decisions in $\\Delta$ time\nunits when all correct servers propose the same value. Blink generalizes the\nexisting Binary Consensus solution Bosco from the $(7f + 1)$ to the $(5f + 1)$\nsetting.\n",
