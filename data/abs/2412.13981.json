Our source is based on a\ncryogenic dissociator of molecular hydrogen at 0.6 K followed by a series of\nthermal accommodators at 0.5, 0.2 and 0.13 K with inner surfaces covered by a\nsuperfluid helium film. All components are thermally anchored to corresponding\nstages of a dilution refrigerator. The source provides a continuous flux of\n7$\\cdot$$10^{13}$ H atoms/s in a temperature range of 130-200 mK. We have\nsuccessfully used the source for loading a large Ioffe-Pritchard magnetic trap\nrecently built in our laboratory [arXiv:2108.09123 or Rev. Sci. Instr. 93 (2),\n023201 (2022)]. Calorimetric measurements of the atomic recombination heat\nallow reliable determination of the atomic flux and H gas density in the trap.\nWe have tested the performance of the source and loading of H atoms into the\ntrap at various configurations of the trapping field, reducing the magnetic\nbarrier height to 75% and 50% of the nominal value of 0.8 T (0.54 K) as well as\nat the open configuration of the trap at its lower end, when the atoms are in\ncontact with the trapping cell walls covered by a superfluid helium film. In\nthe latter case, raising the trapping cell temperature to 200-250 mK, the\nlow-field seeking atoms at densities exceeding 10$^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$ can be\nstored for the time over 1000 s, sufficiently long for experiments on precision\nspectroscopy of cold H gas.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1vFAnUAMLRSiLe8FthH0nRpn6pz2J8Jri215-0ZsWVw","pdfSize":"1760657"}
