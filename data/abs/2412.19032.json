In the present\nstudy, to establish such a thermodynamic scenario, cosmological equations in a\nflat Friedmann-Lema\\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker universe were derived from the\nfirst law, using an arbitrary entropy $S_{H}$ on a cosmological horizon. Then,\nthe cosmological equations were formulated based on a general formulation that\nincludes two extra driving terms, $f_{\\Lambda}(t)$ and $h_{\\textrm{B}}(t)$,\nwhich are usually used for, e.g., time-varying $\\Lambda (t)$ cosmology and bulk\nviscous cosmology, respectively. In addition, thermodynamic constraints on the\ntwo terms are examined using the second law of thermodynamics, extending a\nprevious analysis [Phys. Rev. D 99, 043523 (2019) (arXiv:1810.11138)]. It is\nfound that a deviation $S_{\\Delta}$ of $S_{H}$ from the Bekenstein-Hawking\nentropy plays important roles in the two terms. The second law should constrain\nthe upper limits of $f_{\\Lambda}(t)$ and $h_{\\textrm{B}}(t)$ in our late\nUniverse. The orders of the two terms are likely consistent with the order of\nthe cosmological constant $\\Lambda_{\\textrm{obs}}$ measured by observations. In\nparticular, when the deviation $S_{\\Delta}$ is close to zero,\n$h_{\\textrm{B}}(t)$ and $f_{\\Lambda}(t)$ should reduce to zero and a constant\nvalue (consistent with the order of $\\Lambda_{\\textrm{obs}}$), respectively, as\nif a consistent and viable scenario could be obtained from thermodynamics.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"wSn1pJfCGPvnxn_r4WAmlrY7GgbdINEznLc0Ki9sDgM","pdfSize":"288236"}
