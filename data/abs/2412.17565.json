The exponential growth of data collected from base\nstations poses significant challenges to processing and analysis. While machine\nlearning (ML) algorithms have emerged as powerful tools for handling these\nlarge datasets and providing accurate predictions, their environmental impact,\nparticularly in terms of energy consumption, is often overlooked in favor of\ntheir predictive capabilities. This study investigates the potential of two\nbio-inspired models: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and Reservoir Computing\nthrough Echo State Networks (ESNs) for cellular traffic forecasting. The\nevaluation focuses on both their predictive performance and energy efficiency.\nThese models are implemented in both centralized and federated settings to\nanalyze their effectiveness and energy consumption in decentralized systems.\nAdditionally, we compare bio-inspired models with traditional architectures,\nsuch as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Multi-Layer Perceptrons\n(MLPs), to provide a comprehensive evaluation. Using data collected from three\ndiverse locations in Barcelona, Spain, we examine the trade-offs between\npredictive accuracy and energy demands across these approaches. The results\nindicate that bio-inspired models, such as SNNs and ESNs, can achieve\nsignificant energy savings while maintaining predictive accuracy comparable to\ntraditional architectures. Furthermore, federated implementations were tested\nto evaluate their energy efficiency in decentralized settings compared to\ncentralized systems, particularly in combination with bio-inspired models.\nThese findings offer valuable insights into the potential of bio-inspired\nmodels for sustainable and privacy-preserving cellular traffic forecasting.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3yXcAjI-pv0scVMv9S9BFiOPpri9LaFD9AsFXc7JMA4","pdfSize":"1582294"}
