  "abstract": "  We develop the fibration method to produce rational (or integral) points on\nthe total space with few multiple fibers over the projective line over number\nfields. As its application, we prove strong approximation without off any place\nand arithmetic purity for two classes of open rationally connected varieties:\nthe smooth locus of singular del Pezzo surfaces of degree $\\geq 4$ and the\nsmooth locus of complete normal toric varieties. We also study strong\napproximation for the intersection of two affine quadrics. As its application,\nwe get an unconditional result of fibration method for rank 4.\n",
