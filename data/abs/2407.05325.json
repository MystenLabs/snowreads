To achieve this, our study will begin by\nexamining the characteristics of topological charged black holes in dilaton\ngravity. Specifically, we will concentrate on the impact of the topological\nconstant on the event horizon of these black holes. Subsequently, we will\nanalyze these black holes, considering their thermodynamic and conserved\nquantities, in order to assess the validity of the first law of thermodynamics.\nWe explore the thermodynamic topology of these black holes by treating them as\nthermodynamic defects. For our study, we examine two types of thermodynamic\nensembles: the fixed $q$ ensemble and the fixed $\\phi$ ensemble. To study the\nimpact of the topological constant ($% k$) on thermodynamic topology, we\nconsider all possible types of curvature hypersurfaces that can form in these\nblack holes. By calculating the topological charges at the defects within their\nthermodynamic spaces, we analyze both the local and global topology of these\nblack holes. We also investigate how the parameters of dilaton gravity affect\nthe thermodynamic topology of black holes and highlight the differences\ncompared to charged black holes in the General Relativity.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JejmRrjD2MYDXcm3pZZj2MQM2euns2mU7xiXWZk4N1c","pdfSize":"2201186"}
