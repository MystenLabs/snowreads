  "abstract": "  Acquiring a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between foam\nfriction and surface roughness is essential for achieving precise control over\ntheir flow dynamics. In particular, a major challenge is to reduce friction,\nwhich can be achieved with rough surfaces in the situation where a liquid\ninfuses the asperities. In this study, we propose to explore self-infused\nsurfaces. We first present simple observations to demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our surface design by recording the motion of a foam puddle on a smooth\nsurface and a self-SLIPS. To quantify friction reduction, we conduct stress\nmeasurements on surfaces moved at a constant velocity. Finally, we interpret\nthe variation of the friction force with the velocity by a model considering an\neffective slip length of the surface. This research paves the way for a novel\napproach to mitigate dissipation in liquid foam flows, holding significant\nimplications for reducing energy consumption in conveying foams for industrial\nprocesses and various end-use applications.\n",
