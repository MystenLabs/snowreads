The key objective of ML-based PDE solvers is to output a\nsufficiently accurate solution faster than standard numerical methods, which\nare used as a baseline comparison. We first perform a systematic review of the\nML-for-PDE solving literature. Of articles that use ML to solve a fluid-related\nPDE and claim to outperform a standard numerical method, we determine that 79%\n(60/76) compare to a weak baseline. Second, we find evidence that reporting\nbiases, especially outcome reporting bias and publication bias, are widespread.\nWe conclude that ML-for-PDE solving research is overoptimistic: weak baselines\nlead to overly positive results, while reporting biases lead to underreporting\nof negative results. To a large extent, these issues appear to be caused by\nfactors similar to those of past reproducibility crises: researcher degrees of\nfreedom and a bias towards positive results. We call for bottom-up cultural\nchanges to minimize biased reporting as well as top-down structural reforms\nintended to reduce perverse incentives for doing so.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IdVo1iHgr_RDY2CBZqm5Ks8zA_jo9-7BlHh-dcygzUw","pdfSize":"553380"}
