Nine\ndistinct configurations, varying in object sizes and distances, were explored\nto evaluate task complexity using metrics such as completion time, error rate,\nand throughput. Our results support Fitts' Law, showing that increased\ndistances generally increase task difficulty. However, contrary to its\npredictions, larger objects also led to higher complexity, possibly due to the\nsystem's limitations in tracking them. Based on these findings, we suggest\nusing tangible cubes between 1.5\" and 2\" in size and limiting the distance\nbetween objects to 2\" for optimal interaction in the system's 3D space. Future\nresearch should explore additional configurations and shapes to further\nvalidate Fitts' Law in the context of 3D object manipulation in systems like\nPointARs. This could help refine guidelines for designing mixed reality\ninterfaces.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"h0DxxfkKj40h9EKCSQz-kvZ7qieHGXOGZfmdx83TVyc","pdfSize":"8899479"}
