The direct product group permutation (DPGP)\ncodes, introduced independently by Kl\\o ve et al. and Tamo et al., represent\nthe best-known permutation codes in terms of both size and minimum distance.\nThese codes possess algebraic structures that facilitate efficient encoding and\ndecoding algorithms. In particular, this study focuses on recursively extended\npermutation (REP) codes, which were also introduced by Kl\\o ve et al. We\nexamine the properties of REP codes and prove that, in terms of size and\nminimum distance, the optimal REP code is equivalent to the DPGP codes.\nFurthermore, we present efficient encoding and decoding algorithms for REP\ncodes.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ay-dbtNHkpHj4ftgDeLc6MIqEE_S8FvlGrP1J4xnEBM","pdfSize":"208087"}
