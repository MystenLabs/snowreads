Data, collected by the CMS\nexperiment in 2016 at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of\n$\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}}$ = 8.16 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of\n175 nb$^{-1}$, were used. The scaling factors in the ratio are determined using\na novel approach based on the Z $\\to$ $\\mu^+\\mu^-$ cross sections measured in\nthe same events. The scaled ratio for B$^+$ is consistent with unity for all\nevent multiplicities, putting stringent constraints on nuclear modification for\nheavy flavor.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RgX0MDoh01S4sy4akA4aJzKV8OTOh32xzB3FDYfbmyE","pdfSize":"1155917"}
