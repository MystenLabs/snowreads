  "abstract": "  Within a framework of two-component Ginzburg-Landau theory as a model of\nsuperconducting FeSe, we study the spatial structure of vortex states in the\npresence of nematic twin boundary in an s + d wave nematic superconductor. The\nresult shows that the orientation of the nematic vortex core is rotated 90\ndegrees across the twin boundary, and just at the twin boundary the nematic\nvortex becomes two fractional vortices with the topological nature of core-down\nand core-up merons. The exotic vortex states may be confirmed by observing the\ntime evolution of vortex flow when the vortices are trapped in and escape from\nthe nematic twin boundary.\n",
