  "abstract": "  We present a scheme for achieving broadband complete reflection by\nconstructing photonic bandgap via collective atom-atom interaction in a\none-dimensional (1D) waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) system. Moreover,\nwe propose several strategies to further expand the ultrahigh reflection\nwindows, including increasing the number of atoms with separations near the\nBragg distance and inducing gradient frequency modulation among the atoms. The\ncenter frequency and bandwidth of the ultrahigh reflection window are\ndynamically adjustable by applying external electromagnetic field. The results\nhere can enrich the many-body physics of waveguide-QED system and offer a\npathway for achieving broadened ultrahigh reflection in a controllable way,\nwhich can find important applications in the realms of chip-integrated band\nfilter, quantum storage, optical switching, and wavelength-selective devices.\n",
