The methods required\nare much more involved than in the case of usual partitions since the\ngenerating functions are not modular and also do not posses product expansions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TR6XweZRFDdwnsoe1NVj5SW-zS9k4NQm2icQgZWDgEA","pdfSize":"272744"}
