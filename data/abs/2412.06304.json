We\ndemonstrate this method in deuteron bound state and nucleon - nucleon\nscattering calculations. Backpropagation, implemented in the Python pytorch\nlibrary, is used to calculate the gradients with respect to model parameters\nand propagate errors from these parameters to the deuteron binding energy and\nselected phase-shift parameters. The uncertainty values obtained using this\napproach are validated by directly sampling from the potential parameters. We\nfind very good agreement between two ways of estimating that uncertainty.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"d7JHOUUXK8HTMBJw7BmNn4PXrV_a4wYLfHHhdcTcDXM","pdfSize":"603752"}
