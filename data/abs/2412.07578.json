These approaches have emerged as\ndistinct concepts, with little notational consistency between them. In this\npaper we propose a universal description of fermion-qubit mappings, which\nreveals the relationship between ternary tree transformations and linear\nencodings. Using our notation, we show that every product-preserving ternary\ntree transformation is equivalent to a linear encoding of the Fock basis.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IjnXzf0IuDXbgmBqOiIwQTkqBFVUcvnlHoJZo8UGX3o","pdfSize":"2550790"}
