The study of classifiers has intensified in recent years with\nthe launch and quick growth of the iClassifier project, a web-based platform\nfor annotation and analysis of classifiers in ancient and modern languages.\nThanks to the data contributed by the project participants, it is now possible\nto formulate the identification of classifiers in AE texts as an NLP task. In\nthis paper, we make first steps towards solving this task by implementing a\nseries of sequence-labelling neural models, which achieve promising performance\ndespite the modest amount of training data. We discuss tokenisation and\noperationalisation issues arising from tackling AE texts and contrast our\napproach with frequency-based baselines.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"l3hRCA38aLDPC6J9Hq96cObyyEk41ZKa054bSoVCT6A","pdfSize":"267343"}
