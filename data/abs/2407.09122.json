The findings further reveal that the thermodynamic topological\ncharacteristics of the RegMax AdS black holes are strongly influenced by the\ncharacteristic parameter of the regularized Maxwell theory. Additionally, we\ninvestigate the phase transition between low and high entropy thermal states\nwithin a canonical ensemble in the dual CFT. Our observations indicate that the\nphase transition behavior of the thermal states mirrors that of the black\nholes. By modeling the phase transition process as a stochastic process, we are\nable to calculate the rates of phase transition between the thermal states.\nThis result enhances our understanding of the dominant processes involved in\nthe phase transition of the thermal states in the dual CFT.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hGkHLK8UID0d_E8GH7M6qMmIIm8PKcvZiZq9VUHymFQ","pdfSize":"863943","objectId":"0x67c18cfd1dc2e81aab7779d2328e3132f8d21701ffe34943a7afa1c1fed5f723","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
