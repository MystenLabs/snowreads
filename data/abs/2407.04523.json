Surprisingly, these\nphotovoltages exceed the cells' built-in potentials, often with large energetic\noffsets reported between the perovskite and transport layer semiconductor band\nedges - contradicting standard photovoltaic design principles. Here we show\nthat this tolerance to energetic offsets results from mixed ionic/electronic\nconduction in the perovskite layer. Combining drift-diffusion simulations with\nexperiments probing the current-voltage performance of PSCs as a function of\nion distribution, we demonstrate that electrostatic redistribution of ionic\ncharge reduces surface recombination currents at steady-state, increasing the\nphotovoltage by tens to hundreds of millivolts. Thus, mobile ions can reduce\nthe sensitivity of photovoltage to energetic misalignments at\nperovskite/transport layer interfaces, benefitting overall efficiency. Building\non these insights, we show how photovoltaic design principles are modified to\naccount for mobile ions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"znU7ca2P9joZLervjHmXBdt9jkOjsCDv3IEif8I3r48","pdfSize":"5547985"}
