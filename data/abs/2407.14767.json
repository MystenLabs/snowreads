We propose metrics to evaluate\nthe trade-off between performance improvements and user burden, and investigate\nwhether LLMs can determine when to request help and examine their performance\nwith varying levels of information availability. Our experiments reveal that\nwithout external feedback, many LLMs struggle to recognize their need for\nadditional support. Our findings highlight the importance of external signals\nand provide insights for future research on improving support-seeking\nstrategies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"EcxUbmdnt9YNmqksBajndzigDvj29DpV8EVFt4flJAM","pdfSize":"1016888"}
