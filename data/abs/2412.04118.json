Within this generalized framework, we introduce two different\nproblems that extend the classical seriation problem: an optimization problem\nand a decision problem. We establish that these problems are NP-hard and\nNP-complete, respectively. Despite this complexity results, we identify several\nnon-trivial instances where these problems can be solved in polynomial time,\nproviding valuable insights into their tractability.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Discrete Mathematics","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"gEdHSPgayfE6wqvJPiOvelrhSKifRsmRImTcUk3ii0o","pdfSize":"238720"}
