The cascades (initiated by photons from\n$\\pi^0\\rightarrow \\gamma \\gamma$) can lead to 3-4 orders of magnitude increase\nof the event rate relative to using primary production alone. We provide new\nSHiP sensitivity projections for dark photons and electrophilic gauge bosons,\nwhich are significantly improved compared to previous literature. The main gain\nin sensitivity occurs for long-lived dark vectors with masses below $\\sim\n50-300~{\\rm MeV}$. The dominant production mode in this parameter space is\nlow-energy annihilation $e^+ e^- \\rightarrow V(\\gamma)$. This motivates a\ndetailed study of backgrounds and efficiencies in the SHiP experiment for\nsub-GeV signals.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"m5l8qAl-mhqitOCe0avsQIkP488l3K_f5hbZYbmq9NE","pdfSize":"1390476"}
