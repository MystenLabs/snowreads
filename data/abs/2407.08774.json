We explicitly\ndemonstrate that these issues, previously reported in the literature, are\nactually due to the breakdown of the well-posedness of the initial-value\nproblem. This is akin to shortcomings observed in scalar-tensor theories when\nderivative self-interactions are included. Building on previous work done for\nk-essence, we characterize the well-posedness breakdowns, differentiating\nbetween Tricomi and Keldysh-like behaviors. We show that these issues can be\navoided by ``fixing the equations'', enabling stable numerical evolutions in\nspherical symmetry. Additionally, we show that for a class of vector\nself-interactions, no Tricomi-type breakdown takes place. Finally, we\ninvestigate initial configurations for the massive vector field which lead to\ngravitational collapse and the formation of black holes.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ap5PdxadIwVvzqRDah-kaF0W3aHeFmT4DUS0KrMPG28","pdfSize":"1736717"}
