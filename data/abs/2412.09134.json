  "abstract": "  We present a comprehensive joint analysis of two distinct methodologies for\nmeasuring the mass of galaxy clusters: hydrostatic measurements and caustic\ntechniques. We show that by including cluster-specific assumptions obtained\nfrom hydrostatic measurements in the caustic method, the potential mass bias\nbetween these approaches can be significantly reduced. Applying this approach\nto two well-observed massive galaxy clusters A2029 and A2142. We find no\ndiscernible mass bias, affirming the method's validity. We then extend the\nanalysis to modified gravity models and draw a similar conclusion when applying\nour approach. Specifically, our implementation allows us to investigate\nChameleon and Vainshtein screening mechanisms, tightening the posteriors and\nenhancing our understanding of these modified gravity scenarios.\n",
