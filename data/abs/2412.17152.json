Yet,\ndifferences between these methods still remain mostly unknown, which limits\ntheir applicability for practitioners. In this work, we introduce a unified\nframework for local and global feature-based explanations using two\nwell-established concepts: functional ANOVA (fANOVA) from statistics, and the\nnotion of value and interaction from cooperative game theory. We introduce\nthree fANOVA decompositions that determine the influence of feature\ndistributions, and use game-theoretic measures, such as the Shapley value and\ninteractions, to specify the influence of higher-order interactions. Our\nframework combines these two dimensions to uncover similarities and differences\nbetween a wide range of explanation techniques for features and groups of\nfeatures. We then empirically showcase the usefulness of our framework on\nsynthetic and real-world datasets.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FCVsZkPmU4eU2JjeqTlt_J17AjQBeQnRJSirJojpO9Y","pdfSize":"2510676"}
