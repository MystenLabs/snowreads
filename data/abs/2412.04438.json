  "abstract": "  We present a pattern emerging from stellar obliquity measurements in\nsingle-star systems: planets with high planet-to-star mass ratios ($M_{\\rm\np}/M{_*}$$>$ $2\\times10^{-3}$) -- such as super-Jupiters, brown dwarf\ncompanions, and M-dwarfs hosting Jupiter-like planets -- tend to be aligned,\neven around hot stars. This alignment represents a 3.7$\\sigma$ deviation from\nthe obliquity distribution observed in systems with lower mass ratios ($M_{\\rm\np}/M{_*}$$<$ $2\\times10^{-3}$), which predominantly include Jupiters and\nsub-Saturns. The only known outlier system, XO-3, exhibits misalignment\nconfirmed via our newly collected Rossiter-McLaughlin effect measurement\n($\\lambda=41.8^{+2.1}_{-2.0}$ degrees). However, the relatively large\n$\\textit{Gaia}$ Renormalized Unit Weight Error (RUWE) of XO-3 suggests that it\nmay harbor an undetected binary companion, potentially contributing to its\nmisalignment. Given that tidal realignment mechanisms are weak for hot stars,\nthe observed alignment in high $M_{\\rm p}/M{_*}$ systems is likely\n$\\textit{primordial}$ rather than resulting from tidal interactions. One\npossible explanation is that only dynamically isolated planets can continue\naccreting gas and evolve into super-Jupiters while maintaining their primordial\nalignment. Conversely, planets formed in compact configurations may be unable\nto grow beyond the gap-opening mass, for which our work suggests an empirical\nboundary $M_{\\rm p}/M{_*}$$=$ $2\\times10^{-3}$, identified between aligned high\n$M_{\\rm p}/M{_*}$ systems and misaligned low $M_{\\rm p}/M{_*}$ systems, with\ndynamical instabilities contributing to the diverse spin-orbit misalignments\nobserved in the latter.\n",
