In this paper we examine the palindromic\nperiodicities occurring in some classical infinite words, such as Sturmian\nwords, episturmian words, the Thue-Morse word, the period-doubling word, the\nRudin-Shapiro word, the paperfolding word, and the Tribonacci word, and prove a\nnumber of results about them. We also prove results about words with the\nsmallest number of palindromic periodicities.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KPJk7EQoLxdiC78RVJ6huNw5PuFMBipO7Q2_FaJTJ6o","pdfSize":"676929","objectId":"0xbdceb39de2baed2385579341c7dce94a6f443be8409001e01525e2f08b575d4b","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
