Neutral ground state carbon dioxide is excited to $nd\\sigma_g$\nHenning sharp Rydberg states with an attosecond extreme ultraviolet pulse\ntrain. A time delayed near infrared probe pulse is used to photoionize these\nstates to their corresponding ionization limit $B^2\\Sigma_u^+$. We obtain\ndifferential kinetic energy spectrograms and angular distributions for\nphotoionization and autoionization channels. We model the competition between\npredissociation and autoionization in the Rydberg state dynamics and analyze\ndifferential photoelectron yield as a function of the time delay to extract\npreviously unknown autoionization and predissociation lifetimes for three\nHenning sharp states (n = 4, 5, 6).\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"q9rNhJ8CWHD-Al5jR6yusRi-8wnyQW6uVPkHF3sTGkY","pdfSize":"5351649","objectId":"0x9d89dd15a96567caa4f5317d2d1295ec0713af20b9e112d3d135dcb21a69cc5a","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
