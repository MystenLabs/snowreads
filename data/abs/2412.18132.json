  "abstract": "  Let $p$ be a prime number, it is shown that tiling and spectral sets coincide\nin $\\mathbb Z_{p^2}\\times\\mathbb Z_{p^2}$ by considering equivalently\nsymplectic spectral pairs. Symplectic structures appear naturally in\ntime-frequency analysis and provides a perspective to reveal patterns that may\nnot be so evident in the Euclidean setting. The main approach here is however\nstill to count the size of the zero set and analyze its contents. Some\nauxiliary results concerning tiling sets and spectral sets of sizes $p$ and\n$p^{2m-1}$ in $\\mathbb Z_{p^m}\\times\\mathbb Z_{p^m}$ are also presented.\n",
