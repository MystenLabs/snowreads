In previous work, it\nwas found a feature that makes a quantum reservoir valuable: contractive\ndynamics of the quantum reservoir channel toward input-dependent fixed points.\nThese results are enhanced in this paper by finding conditions that guarantee a\ncrucial aspect of the reservoir's design: distinguishing between different\ninput sequences to ensure a faithful representation of temporal input data.\nThis is implemented by finding a condition that guarantees injectivity in\nreservoir computing filters, with a special emphasis on the quantum case. We\nprovide several examples and focus on a family of quantum reservoirs that is\nmuch used in the literature; it consists of an input-encoding quantum channel\nfollowed by a strictly contractive channel that enforces the echo state and the\nfading memory properties. This work contributes to analyzing valuable quantum\nreservoirs in terms of their input dependence.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zIB9M8G1QxGBgkxsEDYnYdHYkHx0r2WtoBcJrP2NJ70","pdfSize":"786599"}
