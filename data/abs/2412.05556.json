Such a framework is crucial for augmenting real-world\ndata, improving benchmarking, and making informed retraining decisions when\nadapting to new deployment settings, such as different sites or frequency\nbands. The proposed framework is employed to design metrics based on UMAP\ntopology-preserving dimensionality reduction, leveraging Wasserstein and\nEuclidean distances on latent space KNN clusters. The designed metrics show\ncorrelations above 0.85 between dataset distances and model performances on a\nchannel state information compression unsupervised machine learning task\nleveraging autoencoder architectures. The results show that the designed\nmetrics outperform traditional methods.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computer Science/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"TpjvbvMNmLn_myPlx_bKW7mCSdoRtEvHODwpMINtuUo","pdfSize":"13189795"}
