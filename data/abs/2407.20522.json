Through quantitative analysis, we found\nthat drivers' hourly wages are significantly influenced by factors such as\nrace/ethnicity, health insurance status, tenure to the platform, and working\nhours. Despite platforms' policies not intentionally embedding biases,\ndisparities persist based on these characteristics. For ride fares, we propose\na method to audit the pricing policy of a proprietary algorithm by replicating\nit; we conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the predicted rideshare fare\nis greater than the taxi fare, taking into account the approximation error in\nthe replicated model. Challenges in accessing data and transparency hinder our\nability to isolate discrimination from other factors, underscoring the need for\ncollaboration with rideshare platforms and drivers to enhance fairness in\nalgorithmic wage determination and pricing.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JvsIC6JyjziZTELl1XV-Xc3NEJSu1uzDMp-lHCn5CnU","pdfSize":"760004"}
