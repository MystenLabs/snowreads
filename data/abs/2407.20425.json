This\nstudy utilizes events with a four-muon final state. We use two data sets,\ncomprising 41.5 fb$^{-1}$ and 59.7 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, recorded in 2017 and 2018 by the CMS experiment at the\nCERN LHC. The study of the 2018 data set includes a search for displaced\nsignatures of a new boson within the proper decay length range of 0 $\\lt$\n$c\\tau$ $\\lt$ 100 $\\mu$m. Our results are combined with a previous CMS result,\nbased on 35.9 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV\ncollected in 2016. No significant deviation from the expected background is\nobserved. Results are presented in terms of a model-independent upper limit on\nthe product of cross section, branching fraction, and acceptance. The findings\nare interpreted across various benchmark models, such as an axion-like particle\nmodel, a vector portal model, the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard\nmodel, and a dark supersymmetric scenario, including those predicting a\nnon-negligible proper decay length of the new boson. In all considered\nscenarios, substantial portions of the parameter space are excluded, expanding\nupon prior results.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KPqwUgKil_kCyvGqDVi_8X12hrLKAKwRSEimGvKnxKs","pdfSize":"8186146"}
