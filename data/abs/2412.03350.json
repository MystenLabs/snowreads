  "abstract": "  We derive asymptotic formulas with a secondary term for the (smoothly\nweighted) count of number of integer solutions of height $\\leqslant B$ with\nlocal conditions to the equation $F(x_1,x_2,x_3)=m$, where $F$ is a\nnon-degenerate indefinite ternary integral quadratic form, and $m$ is a\nnon-zero integer satisfying $-m\\Delta_F=\\square$ which can grow like\n$O(B^{2-\\theta})$ for some fixed $\\theta>0$. Our approach is based on the\n$\\delta$-variant of the Hardy--Littlewood circle method developed by\nHeath-Brown.\n",
