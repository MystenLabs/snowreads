  "abstract": "  Let $G$ be a connected reductive algebraic group over an algebraically closed\nfield $k$ of characteristic $p > 0$ and let $\\ell$ be a prime number different\nfrom $p$. Let $U \\subseteq G$ be a maximal unipotent subgroup, $T$ a maximal\ntorus normalizing $U$ and $W$ the Weyl group of $G$. Let $\\mathcal{L}$ be a\nnon-degenerate multiplicative $\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}_{\\ell} $-local system on\n$U$. R. Bezrukavnikov and the second author have proved that the bi-Whittaker\ncategory, namely the triangulated monoidal category of $(U,\n\\mathcal{L})$-biequivariant $\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}_{\\ell}$-complexes on $G$ is\nmonoidally equivalent to an explicit thick triangulated monoidal subcategory\n$\\mathscr{D}_{W}^{\\circ}(T) \\subseteq \\mathscr{D}_{W}(T)$ of \"central sheaves\"\non the torus. In particular it has the structure of a symmetric monoidal\ncategory coming from the symmetric monoidal structure on $\\mathscr{D}_W(T)$.\n  In this paper, we give another construction of a symmetric monoidal structure\non the above category and prove that it agrees with the one coming from the\nabove construction. For this, among other things, we generalize a proof by\nGelfand for finite groups to the geometric setup.\n",
