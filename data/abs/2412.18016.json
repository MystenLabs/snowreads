  "abstract": "  There has been a recent surge in development of accurate machine learning\n(ML) weather prediction models, but evaluation of these models has mainly been\nfocused on medium-range forecasts, not their performance in cycling data\nassimilation (DA) systems. Cycling DA provides a statistically optimal estimate\nof model initial conditions, given observations and previous model forecasts.\nHere, real surface pressure observations are assimilated into several popular\nML models using an ensemble Kalman filter, where accurate ensemble covariance\nestimation is essential to constrain unobserved state variables from sparse\nobservations. In this cycling DA system, deterministic ML models accumulate\nsmall-scale noise until they diverge. Mitigating this noise with a spectral\nfilter can stabilize the system, but with larger errors than traditional\nmodels. Perturbation experiments illustrate that these models do not accurately\nrepresent short-term error growth, leading to poor estimation of cross-variable\ncovariances.\n",
