  "abstract": "  The production of $D^{\\pm}$ and $D_{s}^{\\pm}$ charmed mesons is measured\nusing the $D^{\\pm}/D_{s}^{\\pm} \\to \\phi(\\mu\\mu)\\pi^{\\pm}$ decay channel with\n137 fb$^{-1}$ of $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV proton-proton collision data collected\nwith the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider during the years\n2016-2018. The charmed mesons are reconstructed in the range of transverse\nmomentum $12 < p_\\mathrm{T} < 100$ GeV and pseudorapidity $|\\eta| < 2.5$. The\ndifferential cross-sections are measured as a function of transverse momentum\nand pseudorapidity, and compared with next-to-leading-order QCD predictions.\nThe predictions are found to be consistent with the measurements in the visible\nkinematic region within the large theoretical uncertainties.\n",
