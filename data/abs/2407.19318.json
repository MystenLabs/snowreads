This comprehensive review examines the most effective\nApplication State Management (ASM) techniques, categorized into Local State\nManagement, State Management Libraries, and Server-Side State Management. By\nanalyzing popular front end frameworks the study delves into local state\nmanagement mechanisms. It also evaluates the state of front end management\nlibraries, highlighting their implementations, benefits, and limitations.\nServer-side state management techniques, particularly caching, are discussed\nfor their roles in enhancing data retrieval efficiency. This paper offers\nactionable insights for developers to build scalable, responsive applications,\naiming to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical\napplication. This study's critical analysis and recommendations aim to guide\nfuture research and development in ASM, contributing to the advancement of\nmodern application architecture.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YFoJde-g8VbBRAFmoy5J1tf38rC3DuTAulskBciVyvA","pdfSize":"658665"}
