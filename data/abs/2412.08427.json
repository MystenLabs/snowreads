We will study the existence of at least\none or two solutions in the cone $X=\\{u\\in H^s_0(\\Omega): u\\geq 0\\}$ using\nvariational methods. For this purpose, we analyze two scenarios: the asymptotic\nsublinear and linear growth cases for the reaction term. Additionally, in the\nsublinear case, we establish a nonexistence result.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KqXMA5i2qNOP4RdBrko7MvItsiaizcEPZb3CuwhX06k","pdfSize":"269566"}
