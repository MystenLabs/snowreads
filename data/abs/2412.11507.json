  "abstract": "  Observations of protoplanetary disks have revealed the presence of both\ncrescent-shaped and ring-like structures in dust continuum emission. These\ncrescents are thought to arise from dust-trapping vortices generated by the\nRossby Wave Instability (RWI), which induces density waves akin to those caused\nby planets. These vortices have the potential to create gaps and rings within\nthe disk, resulting from the dissipation of their density waves. We carry out\n2D hydrodynamic simulations in the shearing box to investigate vortex-disk\ninteraction. We find that long-lived vortices can produce dust rings and gaps\nin inviscid discs detectable by ALMA, and a more elongated vortex produces\nrings at larger separations. Vortex-induced density waves carry over two orders\nof magnitude higher angular momentum flux compared to planet-induced ones that\nshock at the same location, making the former much more effective at producing\ndust gaps and rings far away.\n",
