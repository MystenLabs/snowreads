The radiative stabilization mechanism can stabilize the modulus\n$\\tau$ of the finite modular symmetry $\\Gamma_N$ ($N \\in \\mathbb{N}$) at\n$\\mathrm{Im}\\,\\tau \\gg 1$, where the shift symmetry $\\tau \\to \\tau+1$ remains\nunbroken approximately. The shift symmetry can be considered as the residual\n$\\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry which realizes the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism with the\nhierarchy parameter $e^{- 2\\pi \\mathrm{Im}\\,\\tau/N} \\ll 1$. In this work, we\nstudy the stabilization of multiple moduli fields, so that various hierarchical\nvalues of the modular forms coexist in a model. For example, one modulus\nstabilized at $\\mathrm{Im}\\,\\tau_1 \\sim 3$ is responsible for the hierarchical\nstructure of the quarks and leptons in the Standard Model, and another modulus\nstabilized at $\\mathrm{Im}\\,\\tau_2 \\sim 15$ can account for the flatness of the\n$\\mathrm{Re}\\,\\tau_2$ direction which may be identified as the QCD axion.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"g1jb7zMKLzBszbERD356U3SPMuuYaaeiAUUS10CYrTA","pdfSize":"1349054"}
