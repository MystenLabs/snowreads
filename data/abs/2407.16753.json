This allows us to imbue tensor networks with some interesting\nadditional structure. The geometry of the graph describing the tensor network\nstate is determined dynamically, giving a notion of background independence.\nThe tensor network states have a $U(N)$ invariance, which (a) allows us to\nconsider continuous families of entanglement cuts even with a finite number of\ntensors and (b) includes a notion of bulk coordinate reparameterization and\narea-preserving diffeomorphism invariance in the large N limit. These tensor\nnetworks also have a natural scale of nonlocality that behaves similarly to a\nstring scale, suggesting a potential toy model for sub-AdS physics. Emergent\n$U(p)$ gauge fields naturally appear on the tensor network links.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"J1rYCfCVHqqLdWbFBe5pydnbpLUObLlu_W1mKxr7Mzs","pdfSize":"1873830"}
