This paper explores the potential of Modified Gravity (MOG),\nspecifically Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity (STVG), to account for the rapid\nformation of these galaxies in the early universe. By enhancing the\ngravitational constant through a dimensionless parameter $\\alpha$ and\nincorporating a massive vector field $\\phi_\\mu$, MOG predicts deeper\ngravitational wells that can accelerate the collapse of baryonic matter. We\npresent theoretical insights demonstrating how MOG can facilitate the increase\nin star formation rate and early formation of galaxies, offering a compelling\nalternative to LCDM. Our findings suggest that MOG provides a viable framework\nfor understanding the rapid growth of galaxies observed by JWST.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8vO3LcDsDNRmrf7nIDBz8sKMajnbMyshOohSSILni6c","pdfSize":"442776"}
