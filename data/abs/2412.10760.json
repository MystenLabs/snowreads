Given $n$ jobs, each with processing times and deadlines, we aim to\nminimize the number of machines while ensuring deadlines are met and the fixed\norder is maintained. We show that the first-fit algorithm solves the problem\noptimally with unit processing times and is a 2-approximation in the following\nfour cases: (1) the order aligns with non-increasing slacks, (2) the order\naligns with non-decreasing slacks, (3) the order aligns with non-increasing\ndeadlines, and (4) the optimal solution uses at most 3 machines. For the\ngeneral problem we provide an $O(\\log n)$-approximation.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IR1mLPzMUx0YZEGG__WGr3NQTHXlyLmsbxXDE1GJFhA","pdfSize":"499677"}
