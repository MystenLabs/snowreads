To this end, node filtration has been widely used as an attempt to\nobtain the topological information of a graph using persistence diagrams.\nHowever, these attempts have faced the problem of losing node embedding\ninformation, which in turn prevents them from providing a more expressive graph\nrepresentation. To tackle this issue, we shift our focus to edge filtration and\nintroduce a novel edge filtration-based persistence diagram, named Topological\nEdge Diagram (TED), which is mathematically proven to preserve node embedding\ninformation as well as contain additional topological information. To implement\nTED, we propose a neural network based algorithm, named Line Graph\nVietoris-Rips (LGVR) Persistence Diagram, that extracts edge information by\ntransforming a graph into its line graph. Through LGVR, we propose two model\nframeworks that can be applied to any message passing GNNs, and prove that they\nare strictly more powerful than Weisfeiler-Lehman type colorings. Finally we\nempirically validate superior performance of our models on several graph\nclassification and regression benchmarks.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4yjqVUJI5MKV5L2DRqFt7pK6RYt5rQeoJ6T5MHNiuB0","pdfSize":"949119"}
