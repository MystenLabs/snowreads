  "abstract": "  We introduce a new sequential transformer reinforcement learning architecture\nRLT4Rec and demonstrate that it achieves excellent performance in a range of\nitem recommendation tasks. RLT4Rec uses a relatively simple transformer\narchitecture that takes as input the user's (item,rating) history and outputs\nthe next item to present to the user. Unlike existing RL approaches, there is\nno need to input a state observation or estimate. RLT4Rec handles new users and\nestablished users within the same consistent framework and automatically\nbalances the \"exploration\" needed to discover the preferences of a new user\nwith the \"exploitation\" that is more appropriate for established users.\nTraining of RLT4Rec is robust and fast and is insensitive to the choice of\ntraining data, learning to generate \"good\" personalised sequences that the user\ntends to rate highly even when trained on \"bad\" data.\n",
