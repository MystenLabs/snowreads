The principal\nsymbol and its globality is discussed for a general quasi-linear PDE system,\nregardless the algebraic structure the configuration space can have. We also\ndiscuss how the typical relativistic model can be under-determined and\nover-determined at the same time as well as how one can define out of it a\nwell-posed Cauchy problem. This issue leads us to pre-quantum configurations\nand Cauchy bubbles as the way to set up evolution problems in a compact region\nof spacetime, taking into account that relativistic models are defined on bare\nmanifolds. The typical application we shall sketch is standard GR.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ll4SHtU7IgSW7BCfIRoY5Vuoh5q79e-zq3HKvV5m8IQ","pdfSize":"320002"}
