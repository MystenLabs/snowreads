  "abstract": "  We present a detailed analysis of AT 2020nov, a tidal disruption event (TDE)\nin the center of its host galaxy, located at a redshift of $z = 0.083$. AT\n2020nov exhibits unique features, including double-peaked Balmer emission\nlines, a broad UV/optical flare, and a peak log luminosity in the extreme\nultra-violet (EUV) estimated at $\\sim$$45.66^{+0.10}_{-0.33} \\; \\mathrm{erg} \\,\n\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$. A late-time X-ray flare was also observed, reaching an\nabsorbed luminosity of $1.67 \\times 10^{43} \\; \\mathrm{erg} \\, \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\napproximately 300 days after the UV/optical peak. Multi-wavelength coverage,\nspanning optical, UV, X-ray, and mid-infrared (MIR) bands, reveals a complex\nspectral energy distribution (SED) that includes MIR flaring indicative of dust\nechoes, suggesting a dust covering fraction consistent with typical TDEs.\nSpectral modeling indicates the presence of an extended, quiescent disk around\nthe central supermassive black hole (SMBH) with a radius of\n$\\sim$$5.06^{+0.59}_{-0.77} \\times 10^4 \\; \\mathrm{R_g}$. The multi-component\nSED model, which includes a significant EUV component, suggests that the\nprimary emission from the TDE is reprocessed by this extended disk, producing\nthe observed optical and MIR features. The lack of strong AGN signatures in the\nhost galaxy, combined with the quiescent disk structure, highlights AT 2020nov\nas a rare example of a TDE occurring in a galaxy with a dormant but extended\npre-existing accretion structure.\n",
