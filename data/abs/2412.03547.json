  "abstract": "  For a galaxy, given its observed rotation curve, can one directly infer\nparameters of the dark matter density profile (such as dark matter particle\nmass $m$, scaling parameter $s$, core-to-envelope transition radius $r_t$ and\nNFW scale radius $r_s$), along with Baryonic parameters (such as the stellar\nmass-to-light ratio $\\Upsilon_*$)? In this work, using simulated rotation\ncurves, we train neural networks, which can then be fed observed rotation\ncurves of dark matter dominated dwarf galaxies from the SPARC catalog, to infer\nparameter values and their uncertainties. Since observed rotation curves have\nerrors, we also explore the very important effect of noise in the training data\non the inference. We employ two different methods to quantify uncertainties in\nthe estimated parameters, and compare the results with those obtained using\nBayesian methods. We find that the trained neural networks can extract\nparameters that describe observations well for the galaxies we studied.\n",
