In this article, we study the local\ngeometry of the Bianchi eigenvariety around non-cuspidal classical points, in\nparticular, ordinary non-cuspidal base change points. To perform this study we\nintroduce Bianchi Eisenstein eigensystems and prove strong multiplicity-one\nresults on the cohomology of the corresponding Bianchi threefolds. We believe\nthese results are of independent interest.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xZph-3cpu9X9BUa7mdN0Yf8JGLthLlfp_XDSiOPuosQ","pdfSize":"384865"}
