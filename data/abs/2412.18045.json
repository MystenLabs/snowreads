  "abstract": "  Let $K$ be an imaginary quadratic field. In this article, we study the local\ngeometry of the Bianchi eigenvariety around non-cuspidal classical points, in\nparticular, ordinary non-cuspidal base change points. To perform this study we\nintroduce Bianchi Eisenstein eigensystems and prove strong multiplicity-one\nresults on the cohomology of the corresponding Bianchi threefolds. We believe\nthese results are of independent interest.\n",
