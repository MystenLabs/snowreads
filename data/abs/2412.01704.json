Building on the work of Meyers (1980) and Chen\net al. (2016), we propose a new performance-based variable premium scheme for\nreinsurance policies, where the premium depends on both the distribution of the\nceded loss and the actual realized loss. Under this scheme, the insurer and the\nreinsurer face a random premium at the beginning of the policy period. Based on\nthe realized loss, the premium is adjusted into either a ''reward'' or\n''penalty'' scenario, resulting in a discount or surcharge at the end of the\npolicy period. We characterize the optimal reinsurance policy from the\ninsurer's perspective under this new variable premium scheme. In addition, we\nformulate a Bowley optimization problem between the insurer and the monopoly\nreinsurer. Numerical examples demonstrate that, compared to the expected-value\npremium principle, the reinsurer prefers the variable premium scheme as it\nreduces the reinsurer's total risk exposure.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Risk Management"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"BeXlk1ZX2yDUGvCH4drN6aMFCZF-Z6nKfodUXjY5fLo","pdfSize":"1246178"}
