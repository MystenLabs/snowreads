The effect of stress is introduced by scaling the\narctangent function argument (magnetic field) proportionally to stress. The\nmagnetization curve is modelled by one or two arctangent functions. Despite of\nits simplicity, the model gives a very good agreement with experimental curves,\nreproducing all stress-induced features usually observed on the magnetization\ncurves including the common crossover point and constricted hysteresis loops.\nThe popular effective field concept in this model is just a consequence of a\nsimple scaling of the magnetic field. We show that the differential\nsusceptibility is inversely proportional to the applied stress for all\nmagnetization values. We propose to analyze the field and differential\nsusceptibility as a function of magnetization in contrast to convenient M(H)\nloops.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9_q8QNbkXmfLEt2A3MjXI62w6nDHCIPP4PrMVq_wqko","pdfSize":"517792"}
