We show that the linear series Clifford\nindex and the resolution Clifford index are equal for a general ribbon of\narithmetic genus $p_a$ on a general curve of genus $g$ with $p_{a} \\geq\n\\operatorname{max}\\{3g+7, 6g-4\\}$. Among non-general ribbons, the case of split\nribbons is particularly interesting. Equality of the two Clifford indices for a\nsplit ribbon is related to the gonality conjecture for $C$ and it implies\nGreen's conjecture for all double covers $C'$ of $C$ with $g(C') \\geq\n\\textrm{max}\\{3g+2, 6g-4\\}$. We reduce it to the vanishing of certain Koszul\ncohomology groups of an auxiliary module of syzygies associated to $C$, which\nmay be of independent interest.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NGG1PDl1fKa9jbagQr3m5Fr_DIfeRew3A0f0_UZ_T2k","pdfSize":"315961"}
