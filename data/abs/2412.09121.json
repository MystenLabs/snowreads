  "abstract": "  We propose MMD-OPT: a sample-efficient approach for minimizing the risk of\ncollision under arbitrary prediction distribution of the dynamic obstacles.\nMMD-OPT is based on embedding distribution in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space\n(RKHS) and the associated Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). We show how these two\nconcepts can be used to define a sample efficient surrogate for collision risk\nestimate. We perform extensive simulations to validate the effectiveness of\nMMD-OPT on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Importantly, we show that\ntrajectory optimization with our MMD-based collision risk surrogate leads to\nsafer trajectories at low sample regimes than popular alternatives based on\nConditional Value at Risk (CVaR).\n",
