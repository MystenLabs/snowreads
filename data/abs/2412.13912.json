  "abstract": "  To support future spatial machine intelligence applications, lifelong\nsimultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) has drawn significant attentions.\nSLAM is usually realized based on various types of mobile robots performing\nsimultaneous and continuous sensing and communication. This paper focuses on\nanalyzing the energy efficiency of robot operation for lifelong SLAM by jointly\nconsidering sensing, communication and mechanical factors. The system model is\nbuilt based on a robot equipped with a 2D light detection and ranging (LiDAR)\nand an odometry. The cloud point raw data as well as the odometry data are\nwirelessly transmitted to data center where real-time map reconstruction is\nrealized based on an unsupervised deep learning based method. The sensing\nduration, transmit power, transmit duration and exploration speed are jointly\noptimized to minimize the energy consumption. Simulations and experiments\ndemonstrate the performance of our proposed method.\n",
