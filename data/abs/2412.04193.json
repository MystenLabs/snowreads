This trend threatens to exacerbate\nexisting social inequalities and limits LLM applications, yet the research\ncommunity lacks operationalized performance measurements in DA. We present a\nframework that comprehensively assesses LLMs' DA modeling capabilities across\nfour dimensions: fidelity, understanding, quality, and diglossia. We evaluate\nnine LLMs in eight DA varieties and provide practical recommendations. Our\nevaluation suggests that LLMs do not produce DA as well as they understand it,\nnot because their DA fluency is poor, but because they are reluctant to\ngenerate DA. Further analysis suggests that current post-training can\ncontribute to bias against DA, that few-shot examples can overcome this\ndeficiency, and that otherwise no measurable features of input text correlate\nwell with LLM DA performance.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"o1tf8-YMd5W2uwl6JEWJ1Pu29CyRb-7DcjLDRW2hEO4","pdfSize":"2116828"}
