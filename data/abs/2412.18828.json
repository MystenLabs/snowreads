  "abstract": "  Recently, in the area of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) applications, Wu et al.\nproposed an authentication and key establishment scheme and claimed their\nprotocol is secure. Nevertheless, cryptanalysis shows the scheme fails to\nprovide robustness against key computation attack, mobile user impersonation\nattack and traceability attack. Vulnerabilities in their scheme lead to the\nexposure of mobile users' long term secret to mobile edge server provided both\nparties complete a successful session. This enables any malicious edge servers,\nwho had communicated with the user earlier, to compute current session keys\nbetween the user and other legitimate servers. Also, since long term secret is\nexposed, such malicious servers can impersonate the user. We present a\ncryptanalysis of the scheme.\n",
