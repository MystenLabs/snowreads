One of the key\ningredients of prior successes in CV and NLP was the broad acceptance of\ndifficult benchmarks that distilled key subproblems into approachable tasks\nthat any junior researcher could investigate, but good benchmarks for\nbiophysical domains are rare. This scarcity is partially due to a narrow focus\non benchmarks which simulate biophysical data; we propose instead to carefully\nabstract biophysical problems into simpler ones with key geometric\nsimilarities. In particular we propose a new class of closed-form test\nfunctions for biophysical sequence optimization, which we call Ehrlich\nfunctions. We provide empirical results demonstrating these functions are\ninteresting objects of study and can be non-trivial to solve with a standard\ngenetic optimization baseline.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YVAKZspcjSdOEJ5S3ex753FY-tRLj0XZGKisFnRcVvE","pdfSize":"12604501","objectId":"0x887158288fa86db2f7f0dad8c36475dcafbe904e35998f8b528007bd333e59dd","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
