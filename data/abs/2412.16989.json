  "abstract": "  In General Relativity, gravity around a black hole is universally regarded as\nan attractive force. However, quantum effects may significantly alter this\nclassical picture and thus affect the dynamics of test particles. In this work,\nwe investigate geodesic motion in a recently proposed covariant effective\nquantum black hole model. Our analytical study reveals that, at the Planck\nscale, gravity can exhibit a repulsive character, most notably in trajectories\ninvolving turning points. These findings suggest that quantum corrections could\nfundamentally modify our conventional understanding of gravitational\ninteractions in certain regimes.\n",
