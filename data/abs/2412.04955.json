The pioneering methods reconstruct\nrealistic head avatars with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), which have been\nlimited by training and rendering speed. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (3DGS) significantly improve the efficiency of training and\nrendering. However, the surface inconsistency of 3DGS results in subpar\ngeometric accuracy; later, 2DGS uses 2D surfels to enhance geometric accuracy\nat the expense of rendering fidelity. To leverage the benefits of both 2DGS and\n3DGS, we propose a novel method named MixedGaussianAvatar for realistically and\ngeometrically accurate head avatar reconstruction. Our main idea is to utilize\n2D Gaussians to reconstruct the surface of the 3D head, ensuring geometric\naccuracy. We attach the 2D Gaussians to the triangular mesh of the FLAME model\nand connect additional 3D Gaussians to those 2D Gaussians where the rendering\nquality of 2DGS is inadequate, creating a mixed 2D-3D Gaussian representation.\nThese 2D-3D Gaussians can then be animated using FLAME parameters. We further\nintroduce a progressive training strategy that first trains the 2D Gaussians\nand then fine-tunes the mixed 2D-3D Gaussians. We demonstrate the superiority\nof MixedGaussianAvatar through comprehensive experiments.
