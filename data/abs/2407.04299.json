It is shown that the\nvisible height $h$ of the monatomic step on Pb(111) surface demonstrates\noscillatory dependence on bias voltage $U$. The period of these oscillations\ncoincides with the period of the oscillations of both local tunneling\nconductance ($dI/dU$) and the rate of the STM tip displacement ($dZ/dU$) at\nsweeping $U$. It points to the fact that the observed oscillations of the\nvisible height of monatomic Pb(111) step are controlled by coherent resonant\ntunneling of electrons from the STM tip to Pb(111) film through quantum-well\nstates in thin Pb(111) film. We argue that the maximum and minimum visible\nheights of the monatomic Pb(111) step correspond to the bias voltages, at which\nlocal densities of states for the Pb(111) terraces of different thicknesses are\nequal.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"2VWbpwtnJzQAij4Zkhhz76SRI0pnYcuT5L34-qk_vPo","pdfSize":"1778311"}
