We introduce a set\nof flow models that can recover component-wise, invertible transformation of\nexogenous variables. Our flow-based methods offer flexible model design while\nmaintaining causal consistency regardless of the number of discretization\nsteps. We propose design improvements that enable simultaneous learning of all\ncausal mechanisms and reduce abduction and prediction complexity to linear O(n)\nrelative to the number of layers, independent of the number of causal\nvariables. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art approaches and delivers consistent performance across a wide\nrange of structural causal models in answering observational, interventional,\nand counterfactual questions. Additionally, our method achieves a significant\nreduction in computational time compared to existing diffusion-based\ntechniques, making it practical for large structural causal models.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"quAcg13lOG-bsP-kNiOhcTv8q6bTIy474g-emz6LSjk","pdfSize":"1832521"}
