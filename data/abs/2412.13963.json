Only\n6$\\pm$4% of our single-lined He-rich hot subdwarfs that only show spectroscopic\nfeatures of hot subdwarfs are found to be RV variable, which is lower than the\nfraction of single-lined He-poor sdB stars (31$\\pm$3%). Single-lined sdB stars\nwith effective temperatures ($T_{\\rm eff}$) $\\sim$ 25,000 $-$ 33,000 K show an\nRV-variability fraction of 34$\\pm$5%, while lower RV-variability fractions are\nobserved for single-lined sdB stars cooler than about 25,000 K (11$\\pm$4%),\nsingle-lined sdB/OB stars with $T_{\\rm eff}$ $\\sim$ 33,000 $-$ 40,000 K and\nsurface gravities about 5.7 $-$ 6.0 (13$\\pm$3%), as well as single-lined sdO/B\nstars with $T_{\\rm eff}$ $\\sim$ 45,000 $-$ 70,000 K (10$\\pm$7%). Single-lined\nhot subdwarfs with $T_{\\rm eff}$ $\\sim$ 35,000 $-$ 45,000 K located above the\nextreme horizontal branch (EHB) show a similar RV-variability fraction of\n34$\\pm$9% as single-lined sdB stars at about 25,000 $-$ 33,000 K. The largest\nRV-variability fraction of 51$\\pm$8% is found in single-lined hot subdwarfs\nbelow the canonical EHB. The detected RV-variability fraction of our composite\nhot subdwarfs with an infrared excess in their spectral energy distributions is\n9$\\pm$3%, which is lower than that fraction of single-lined hot subdwarfs.\nSince the average RV uncertainty we measured in the LAMOST spectra is about 7.0\nkm/s, the lower detected RV-variability fraction for composite hot subdwarfs is\nexpected because the RV amplitudes associated with long-period systems are\nlower.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cTmwQxjE0ikBLgc7VzMO7Lu5FpoCgxY3wwtutJA4YUE","pdfSize":"3079335"}
