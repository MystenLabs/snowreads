The optimal hedging strategy is obtained through a deep\npolicy gradient-type reinforcement learning algorithm, with a novel hybrid\nneural network architecture improving the training performance. The favorable\ninclusion of forward-looking information embedded in the volatility surface\nallows our procedure to outperform several conventional benchmarks such as\npractitioner and smiled-implied delta hedging procedures, both in simulation\nand backtesting experiments.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Risk Management","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QsdQ1iit_herXf8oL05ufMfB4_Cl_6fIzjFNx7m41xk","pdfSize":"1053576","objectId":"0x8f3aca0a8ad89214d9625fe49725f72f9af1000e3e7401d465081fe6b87fe249","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
