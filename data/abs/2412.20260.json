  "abstract": "  Circuit algebras are a symmetric analogue of Jones's planar algebras\nintroduced to study finite-type invariants of virtual knotted objects. Circuit\nalgebra structures appear, in different forms, across mathematics. This paper\nprovides a dictionary for translating between their diverse incarnations and\ndescribing their wider context. A formal definition of a broad class of circuit\nalgebras is established and three equivalent descriptions of circuit algebras\nare provided: in terms of operads of wiring diagrams, modular operads and\ncategories of Brauer diagrams. As an application, circuit algebra\ncharacterisations of algebras over the orthogonal and symplectic groups are\ngiven.\n",
