Due\nto their great computational cost I propose to encode them in neural networks.\nFor that I use a combination of neural networks that take events with\napproximate off-shell effects and transform them into events that match those\nobtained with full off-shell calculations. This was shown to work reliably and\nefficiently at leading order. Here I discuss first steps extending this method\nto include higher order effects.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LPQ-tdAq16YTN0Zt9K9Xu2ydQhEPVjj51hIf0Zt9zJM","pdfSize":"920359"}
