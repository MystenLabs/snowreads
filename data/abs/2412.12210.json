  "abstract": "  In this paper, we construct an isotropic cosmological model in the $ f(Q, T)\n$ theory of gravity in the frame of a flat FLRW spacetime being $ Q $ the\nnon-metricity tensor and $ T $ the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. The\ngravity function is taken to be a quadratic equation, $ f(Q, T)=\\zeta Q^2 +\n\\gamma T $, where $ \\zeta<0 $ and $ \\gamma $ are the arbitrary constants. We\nconstrain the model parameters $ \\alpha $ and $ H_0 $ using the recent\nobservational datasets: the Hubble dataset (OHD), the Pantheon dataset of $\n1048 $ points, and the joint dataset (OHD + Pantheon). The universe model\ntransits from an early deceleration state to an acceleration in late times.\nThis model also provides the ekpyrotic phase of the universe on the high\nredshift $ z>12.32 $. In this model, the Big Bang is described as a collision\nof branes, and thus, the Big Bang is not the beginning of time. Before the Big\nBang, there is an ekpyrotic phase with the equation of state $ \\omega >> 1 $.\nIn late times, the undeviating Hubble measurements reduce the $ H_0 $ tension\nin the reconstructed $ f(Q, T) $ function. Additionally, we study various\nphysical parameters of the model. Finally, our model describes a quintessence\ndark energy model at later times.\n",
