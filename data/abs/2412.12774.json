  "abstract": "  This paper proposes a novel interdisciplinary framework for the critical\nevaluation of text-to-image models, addressing the limitations of current\ntechnical metrics and bias studies. By integrating art historical analysis,\nartistic exploration, and critical prompt engineering, the framework offers a\nmore nuanced understanding of these models' capabilities and societal\nimplications. Art historical analysis provides a structured approach to examine\nvisual and symbolic elements, revealing potential biases and\nmisrepresentations. Artistic exploration, through creative experimentation,\nuncovers hidden potentials and limitations, prompting critical reflection on\nthe algorithms' assumptions. Critical prompt engineering actively challenges\nthe model's assumptions, exposing embedded biases. Case studies demonstrate the\nframework's practical application, showcasing how it can reveal biases related\nto gender, race, and cultural representation. This comprehensive approach not\nonly enhances the evaluation of text-to-image models but also contributes to\nthe development of more equitable, responsible, and culturally aware AI\nsystems.\n",
