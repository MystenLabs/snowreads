  "abstract": "  Stochastic frontier models have attracted significant interest over the years\ndue to their unique feature of including a distinct inefficiency term alongside\nthe usual error term. To effectively separate these two components, strong\ndistributional assumptions are often necessary. To overcome this limitation,\nnumerous studies have sought to relax or generalize these models for more\nrobust estimation. In line with these efforts, we introduce a latent group\nstructure that accommodates heterogeneity across firms, addressing not only the\nstochastic frontiers but also the distribution of the inefficiency term. This\nframework accounts for the distinctive features of stochastic frontier models,\nand we propose a practical estimation procedure to implement it. Simulation\nstudies demonstrate the strong performance of our proposed method, which is\nfurther illustrated through an application to study the cost efficiency of the\nU.S. commercial banking sector.\n",
