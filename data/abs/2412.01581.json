Here, $L$ is the two-particle\nresponse function which we calculate by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation\nwith the static, first-order $GW$ kernel. The same kernel is added to $\\Sigma$\ndirectly. For a set of medium organic molecules, we show that including the\nvertex both in $L$ and $\\Sigma$ is crucial. This approach retains the good\nperformance of qs$GW$ for predicting first ionization potentials and\nfundamental gaps, while it greatly improves the description of electron\naffinities. Its good performance places qs$\\Sigma^{\\text{BSE}}@L^{\\text{BSE}}$\namong the best-performing electron propagator methods for charged excitations.\nAdding the vertex in $L$ only, as commonly done in the solid state community,\nleads to devastating results for electron affinities and fundamental gaps. We\nalso test the performance of BSE@qs$GW$ and\nqs$\\Sigma^{\\text{BSE}}@L^{\\text{BSE}}$ for neutral charge-transfer excitation\nand find both methods to perform similar. We conclude that\n$\\Sigma^{\\text{BSE}}@L^{\\text{BSE}}$ is a promising approximation to the\nelectronic self-energy beyond $GW$. We hope that future research on dynamical\nvertex effects, second-order vertex corrections, and full self-consistency will\nimprove the accuracy of this method, both for charged and neutral excitation\nenergies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HhMetUSU7MBOujNpBJMTTWh5W2sHZoboIDb35WqL_u0","pdfSize":"1461473"}
