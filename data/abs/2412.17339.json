These include limitations in domain-specific\ngeological knowledge and difficulties in reasoning across multiple\nremote-sensing images, further exacerbating long-context issues. To address\nthese, we present MineAgent, a modular framework leveraging hierarchical\njudging and decision-making modules to improve multi-image reasoning and\nspatial-spectral integration. Complementing this, we propose MineBench, a\nbenchmark specific for evaluating MLLMs in domain-specific mineral exploration\ntasks using geological and hyperspectral data. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of MineAgent, highlighting its potential to\nadvance MLLMs in remote-sensing mineral exploration.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"A-2rE-dEYV924BmftWlh79r9F4TlwCqqVzM3tljFN_A","pdfSize":"14821611"}
