Therefore, we define a subspace of the space of invariant vectors for\nthe Weil representation which maps surjectively onto the space of modular units\nthat are Borcherds products. Moreover, we show that every boundary divisor of a\nBorcherds product can be obtained in this way. As a byproduct we obtain new\nidentities of eta products.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"enLM2SwK3ueZ5Ifv9OSR_UoDiaAXDlnqvi0WrWfBhh4","pdfSize":"285733"}
