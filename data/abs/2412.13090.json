  "abstract": "  The Cosmic Dark Ages mark a pivotal era of the universe's evolution,\ntransitioning from a neutral, opaque medium to the emergence of the first stars\nand galaxies that initiated cosmic reionization. This study examines the\nthermodynamics of the intergalactic medium (IGM), molecular hydrogen cooling,\nand gravitational collapse that led to structure formation. Key emission lines,\nsuch as Lyman-alpha (Ly$\\alpha $) and [C II] 158 $\\mu m$, are analyzed as\ntracers of star formation, metallicity, and IGM conditions. Simulations\nhighlight Ly$\\alpha $ scattering profiles and [C II] emission as critical\ndiagnostics of early galaxy evolution. The findings provide a theoretical\nframework to interpret high-redshift observations, advancing our understanding\nof the universe's transition from darkness to illumination.\n",
