A classical consequence of the John Ellipsoid Theorem\nis that the Banach-Mazur distance of a symmetric convex body $K \\subseteq\n\\mathbb{R}^n$ to the $n$-dimensional Euclidean ball is not greater than\n$\\sqrt{n}$. Equality holds in every dimension $n$ for the unit balls of\n$\\ell_1^n$ and $\\ell_{\\infty}^n$, that is, for cross-polytopes and\nparallelotopes in dimension $n$. While it is known that in dimension $n \\geq\n4$, there are more convex bodies (not affinely equivalent to either of the\nprevious two) with the distance $\\sqrt{n}$ to the ball, and that for $n=2$ the\nparallelogram is unique, the characterization of the equality case for\ndimension $n=3$ seems to have never been published. We prove that the\nthree-dimensional cross-polytopes and parallelotopes are the only symmetric\nconvex bodies in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with the distance $\\sqrt{3}$ to the Euclidean\nball. Moreover, in the planar case we establish the stability of the uniqueness\nof the parallelogram with the best possible (linear) order of the estimate. We\nalso consider the maximal possible Banach-Mazur distance between planar\n$1$-symmetric convex bodies. In this case, we prove that the maximal possible\ndistance is $\\sqrt{2}$ and characterize the equality case, which again involves\na parallelogram.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1G5_SpkX_3FGwN-DH6byg8E2g05VHVNugE-9nqn7u9k","pdfSize":"408024"}
