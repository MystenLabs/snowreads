One element that was\nmissing in the literature was the notion of relative cohomology in this\nsetting. The main aim of this paper is to develop the structural theory of this\nnotion, the relation between the relative cohomology of groupoids and that of\nalgebroids via van Est maps, and to indicate how it can be used to provide an\nintrinsic definition of characteristic classes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mbLNlJHXOQAJ7O7bDyQjNDCB7MLwRhZ2jeevYaNehYY","pdfSize":"422076","objectId":"0x1620a4ba12a7bd106f13b3c530290505758ac501c9c92f6914c2a415f4ea4299","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
