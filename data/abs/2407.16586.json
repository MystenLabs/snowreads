In this study, we present a high-performance, multi-GPU\nimplementation of the analytical nuclear gradient for Kohn-Sham time-dependent\ndensity functional theory (TDDFT), employing the Tamm-Dancoff approximation\n(TDA) and Gaussian-type atomic orbitals as basis functions. We discuss\nGPU-efficient algorithms for the derivatives of electron repulsion integrals\nand exchange-correlation functionals within the range-separated scheme. As an\nillustrative example, we calculated the TDA-TDDFT gradient of the S1 state of a\nfull-scale green fluorescent protein with explicit water solvent molecules,\ntotaling 4353 atoms, at the wB97X/def2-SVP level of theory. Our algorithm\ndemonstrates favorable parallel efficiencies on a high-speed distributed system\nequipped with 256 Nvidia A100 GPUs, achieving >70% with up to 64 GPUs and 31%\nwith 256 GPUs, effectively leveraging the capabilities of modern\nhigh-performance computing systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YGQEPo2_8u6tLhPIY8sZmuYqsPLCBAIuqKhGZyQc6oc","pdfSize":"2725894","objectId":"0x90736b3b8623ff8e3fd1657fb70f24d0b0207c4666c3cd5b6b1de089b91ba1b4","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
