  "abstract": "  The article uses an arithmetic-geometric Fibonacci series to find the\nexpected value of trials needed to observe k consecutive successes for the\nfirst time in a Bernoulli experiment using a recurrence relation. It is\nimportant to note that this is not a new result, but to the best of the\nauthors' knowledge at the time of uploading, this is a novel derivation of a\nwell-established result. The other derivations of this result are cited in the\nreferences section.\n",
