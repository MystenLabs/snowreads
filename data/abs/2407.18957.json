These factors, which\nfrequently influence trading behaviors, are critical elements in the quest for\nmaximizing investors' profits. Our work attempts to solve this problem through\nlarge language model based agents. We have developed a multi-agent AI system\ncalled StockAgent, driven by LLMs, designed to simulate investors' trading\nbehaviors in response to the real stock market. The StockAgent allows users to\nevaluate the impact of different external factors on investor trading and to\nanalyze trading behavior and profitability effects. Additionally, StockAgent\navoids the test set leakage issue present in existing trading simulation\nsystems based on AI Agents. Specifically, it prevents the model from leveraging\nprior knowledge it may have acquired related to the test data. We evaluate\ndifferent LLMs under the framework of StockAgent in a stock trading environment\nthat closely resembles real-world conditions. The experimental results\ndemonstrate the impact of key external factors on stock market trading,\nincluding trading behavior and stock price fluctuation rules. This research\nexplores the study of agents' free trading gaps in the context of no prior\nknowledge related to market data. The patterns identified through StockAgent\nsimulations provide valuable insights for LLM-based investment advice and stock\nrecommendation.
