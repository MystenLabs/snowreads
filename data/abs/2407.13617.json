Notable examples include the\nSachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and its variations, all characterised by some form or\nrandomness and all to all couplings. Here we study many-body quantum chaos in a\nquantum impurity model showing Non-Fermi-Liquid physics, the overscreened\nmultichannel $SU(N)$ Kondo model. We compute exactly the low-temperature\nbehavior of the out-of time order correlator in the limit of large $N$ and\nlarge number of channels $K$, at fixed ratio $\\gamma=K/N$. Due to strong\ncorrelations at the impurity site the spin fractionalizes in auxiliary fermions\nand bosons. We show that all the degrees of freedom of our theory acquire a\nLyapunov exponent which is linear in temperature as $T\\rightarrow 0$, with a\nprefactor that depends on $\\gamma$. Remarkably, for $N=K$ the impurity spin\ndisplays maximal chaos, while bosons and fermions only get up to half of the\nmaximal Lyapunov exponent. Our results highlights two new features: a\nnon-disordered model which is maximally chaotic due to strong correlations at\nits boundary and a fractionalization of quantum chaos.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"czW3sMdoTyya13fHNrHr5drWMo7Y8Ort2-kOt2ZokBA","pdfSize":"1106664"}
