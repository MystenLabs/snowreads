Let $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ be an\nimaginary quadratic field and $\\phi$ be a Hecke character of $K$ of infinite\ntype (1,0) whose restriction to $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the quadratic character\ncorresponding to $K/\\mathbb{Q}$. We consider a class of Hecke characters\n$\\chi$, which are anticyclotomic twists of $\\phi$ with ramification in a\nprescribed finite set of primes. We shall prove the central vanishing order of\nthe Hecke $L$-function $L(s,\\chi$) attached to each $\\chi$ is 0 or 1 depending\non the root number $W(\\chi)$ for all but finitely many such $\\chi$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rwbbN3xYakvUT_CHTGa8GVB78sbGeX0B6zkUL1XJq3Y","pdfSize":"222196"}
