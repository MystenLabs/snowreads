We develop a model\nintegrating structural change and regional disparities to jointly capture these\nphenomena. A key modeling innovation ensuring analytical tractability is the\nintroduction of non-homothetic Cobb-Douglas preferences, which are\ncharacterized by constant unitary elasticity of substitution and non-constant\nincome elasticity. As labor productivity increases over time, economic\nwell-being rises, leading to a declining expenditure share on agricultural\ngoods. Labor reallocates away from agriculture, and industry concentrates\nspatially, further increasing aggregate productivity: structural change and\nregional disparities are two mutually reinforcing outcomes and propagators of\nthe growth process.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0QrdoHWh3Fplo8Iox_NH5kgr99MuiyjiK-9qwLrlD_I","pdfSize":"1600293"}
