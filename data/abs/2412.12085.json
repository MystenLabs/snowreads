  "abstract": "  We consider protocols for estimating the parameter in a single-parameter\nunital qubit channel, assuming that the available initial states are highly\nmixed with very low purity. We compare two protocols: one uses $n$ qubits\nprepared in a particular correlated input state and subsequently invokes the\nchannel on one qubit. The other uses a single qubit and invokes the channel\nonce. We compare the accuracy of the protocols using the quantum Fisher\ninformation for each. We extend the results of Collins [1] by allowing for\nadditional noisy evolution on the spectator qubits in the $n$-qubit protocol.\nWe provide simple algebraic expressions that will determine when the $n$-qubit\nprotocol is superior and provide techniques that can alleviate certain types of\nnoise. We show that for certain types of noisy evolution the $n$-qubit protocol\nwill be inferior but for others it will be superior.\n",
