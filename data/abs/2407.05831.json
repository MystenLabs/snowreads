Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics explores charged\nlepton flavor violation (CLFV), particularly through new particle candidates\nsuch as the $Z^{'}$. This article focuses on maximal LFV interactions\nfacilitated by the $Z^{'}$ boson, specifically targeting its off-diagonal\ninteractions with the first and second generations of charged and neutral\nleptons. In our ultraviolet (UV) model for the origin of the $Z^{'}$, inspired\nby the work of [R.Foot \\textit{et al.,}~arxiv:hep-ph/9401250], we utilize the\ndiscrete $Z_2$ symmetry to investigate the maximal LFV mediated by the $Z^{'}$\nbetween the muon ($\\mu$) and electron ($e$) arising from the additional\nscalars. This symmetry prohibits flavor-conserving interactions between $Z'$\nand $\\mu^+\\mu^-,\\, e^+e^-$. In conjunction with collider, $(g-2)_{\\mu},\n(g-2)_e$, inverse $\\mu$ decay and LFV decay constraints, we provide forecasts\nfor anticipated limits derived from processes such as $\\nu_\\mu N \\to \\nu_e\n\\mu^+ e^- N$ in neutrino trident experiments like the DUNE experiment. These\nlimits highlight the prospective scope and significance of LFV investigations\nwithin these experimental frameworks. From the range of mass between 0.01 GeV\nand 10 GeV, the most stringent limit arise from $ \\textit{B} (\\mu \\to e + X\n+\\gamma)$ for $M_{Z^{'}} < m_\\mu$ while neutrino trident processes constrain\neffectively as $M_{Z^{'}} \\to 10$ GeV.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"BUImaS0CLX__1KGZt-imu8_GgNKh55lbwARtiZiXXgI","pdfSize":"799379"}
