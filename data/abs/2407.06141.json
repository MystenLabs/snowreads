To predict a single output 3D pose\nsequence, we generate and aggregate multiple 3D pose hypotheses. For better\naggregation results, we develop a method to score these hypotheses during\ntraining, effectively integrating conformal prediction into the learning\nprocess. This process results in a differentiable conformal predictor that is\ntrained end2end with the 3D pose estimator. Post-training, the learned scoring\nmodel is used as the conformity score, and the 3D pose estimator is combined\nwith a conformal predictor to select the most accurate hypotheses for\ndownstream aggregation. Our results indicate that using a simple mean\naggregation on the conformal prediction-filtered hypotheses set yields\ncompetitive results. When integrated with more sophisticated aggregation\ntechniques, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various\nmetrics and datasets while inheriting the probabilistic guarantees of conformal\nprediction.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5xwv9CE4m9LKsPKYTwyd8NH20a3DIpQRXB6K5fElkFk","pdfSize":"5309507"}
