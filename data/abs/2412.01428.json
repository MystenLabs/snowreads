  "abstract": "  The present work investigates the possible range of the spectral index $n_s$\nand the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ for a sub-class of the generalized\nmulti-scalar field inflation, which includes a linear coupling term between the\nmulti-scalar field potential and the canonical Lagrangian. This coupling\ninfluences the slow-roll parameters and also alters our predictions for $n_{s}$\nand $r$, which directly depend on those parameters. More precisely, compared to\nstandard multi-field inflation, the values of $n_{s}$ and $r$ decrease to\nlevels consistent with the recent Planck+BICEP/Keck constraint. Interestingly,\nthis validates the chaotic-type potential $V=\\sum_{i} \\mu_{i} \\phi_{i}^{p}$,\nwhich were previously ruled out in the light of the current observations.\n",
