  "abstract": "  It is of interest to know the sharp bounds of the Hankel determinant, Zalcman\nfunctionals, Fekete-Szeg$ \\ddot{o} $ inequality as a part of coefficient\nproblems for different classes of functions. Let $\\mathcal{H}$ be the class of\nfunctions $ f $ which are holomorphic in the open unit disk\n$\\mathbb{D}=\\{z\\in\\mathbb{C}: |z|<1\\}$ of the form\n  \\begin{align*}\n  f(z)=z+\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty}a_nz^n\\; \\mbox{for}\\; z\\in\\mathbb{D}\n  \\end{align*}\n  and suppose that\n  \\begin{align*}\n  F_{f}(z):=\\log\\dfrac{f(z)}{z}=2\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\gamma_{n}(f)z^n, \\;\\;\nz\\in\\mathbb{D},\\;\\;\\log 1:=0,\n  \\end{align*}\n  where $ \\gamma_{n}(f) $ is the logarithmic coefficients. The second Hankel\ndeterminant of logarithmic coefficients $H_{2,1}(F_{f}/2)$ is defined as:\n$H_{2,1}(F_{f}/2) :=\\gamma_{1}\\gamma_{3} -\\gamma^2_{2}$, where $\\gamma_1,\n\\gamma_2,$ and $\\gamma_3$ are the first, second and third logarithmic\ncoefficients of functions belonging to the class $\\mathcal{S}$ of normalized\nunivalent functions. In this article, we first establish sharp inequalities\n$|H_{2,1}(F_{f}/2)|\\leq 1/64$ with logarithmic coefficients for the classes of\nstarlike functions associated with Gregory coefficients. In addition, we\nestablish the sharpness of Fekete-Szeg$ \\ddot{o} $ inequality, Zalcman\nfunctional and generalized Zalcman functional for the class starlike functions\nassociated with Gregory coefficients.\n",
