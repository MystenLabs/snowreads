  "abstract": "  Let $(M,g)$ be a compact Riemann surface with area $1$, we shall study the\nToda system $$\n  \\begin{cases}\n  -\\Delta u_1 = 2\\rho_1(h_1e^{u_1}-1) - \\rho_2(h_2e^{u_2}-1),\\\\\n  -\\Delta u_2 = 2\\rho_2(h_2e^{u_2}-1) - \\rho_1(h_1e^{u_1}-1),\n  \\end{cases} $$ on $(M,g)$ with $\\rho_1=4\\pi$, $\\rho_2\\in(0,4\\pi)$, $h_1$ and\n$h_2$ are two smooth functions on $M$. In Jost-Lin-Wang's celebrated article\n(Comm. Pure Appl. Math., 59 (2006), no. 4, 526--558), they obtained a\nsufficient condition for the existence of this Toda system when $h_1$ and $h_2$\nare both positive. In this paper, we shall improve this result to the case\n$h_1$ and $h_2$ can change signs. We shall pursue a variational method and use\nthe standard blowup analysis. Among other things, the main contribution in our\nproof is to show the blowup can only happen at one point where $h_1$ is\npositive.\n",
