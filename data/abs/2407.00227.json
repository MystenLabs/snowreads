The BHV metric space has enabled the analysis of\ncollections of trees that share a common set of leaves, but many genes are not\nshared, even between closely related species. BHV extension spaces represent\ntrees with non-identical leaf sets in a common BHV space, but limited\nanalytical tools exist for extension spaces. We define the distance between two\nphylogenetic trees with non-identical leaf sets as the shortest BHV distance\nbetween their extension spaces, and develop a reduced gradient algorithm to\ncompute this distance. We study the scalability of our algorithm and apply it\nto analyze gene trees spanning multiple domains of life. Our distance and\nalgorithm offer a fully general, interpretable approach to analyzing both\nancient and recent evolutionary divergence.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Iyv6EmLM18B3nC3D0r8S8GGH2fkLJQxZgISKvISHWrw","pdfSize":"2034656"}
