Luminescence\nmeasurements were performed up to 10 GPa, while the Raman spectra were measured\nup to 20 GPa. The luminescence data revealed a linear blue shift of the\nemission maximum from about 2.5 eV at ambient pressure to 3.1 eV at 5 GPa and a\nstrong intensity quenching. The indirect-to-direct bandgap transition at about\n5 GPa, a phenomenon previously predicted only theoretically, was used to\nexplain the strong quenching of the luminescence. This model was confirmed by\nfitting luminescence intensity data and analysis of the luminescence decay\nkinetics, which exhibited a shortening of the pulse decay time with the\npressure increase. Raman spectra confirmed the stability of Cs2ZrCl6 up to 20\nGPa and showed no evidence of the pressure-induced structural phase\ntransitions. An energetic scheme of excitonic levels, which takes into account\nthe indirect-to-direct band gasp transition, was proposed to explain the rapid\nluminescence quenching with increasing pressure.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"s9ZYcUpey7Q1HgJZX16MdRdsDOhTWGXir0Kcy8vDZuY","pdfSize":"1648297"}
