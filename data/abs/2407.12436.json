The results are qualitatively similar in all\ncases: a two-dimensional gas spanning from the infinite dilution limit to a\nsecond-layer helium density of 0.048 +/- 0.004 Ang^{-2}. That gas is in\nequilibrium with a 7/12 commensurate structure, more stable than any\nincommensurate triangular solid of similar density. These findings are in\nreasonably good agreement with available experimental data.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0uMcoftmyBRqLOPw8VGczMG1fDZiZOE4-7ysals3CRg","pdfSize":"206927"}
