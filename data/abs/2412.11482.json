  "abstract": "  This correspondence presents a probabilistic generalization of the\nGeneralized Optimal Sub-Pattern Assignment (GOSPA) metric, termed P-GOSPA. The\nGOSPA metric is widely used to evaluate the distance between finite sets,\nparticularly in multi-object estimation applications. The P-GOSPA extends GOSPA\ninto the space of multi-Bernoulli densities, incorporating inherent uncertainty\nin probabilistic multi-object representations. Additionally, P-GOSPA retains\nthe interpretability of GOSPA, such as its decomposition into localization,\nmissed detection, and false detection errors in a sound and meaningful manner.\nExamples and simulations are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the\nproposed P-GOSPA metric.\n",
