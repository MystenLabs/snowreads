The key idea is to use Hardy-Littlewood maximal inequality, a\nversion of the transference principle, and certain norm estimates of\ndifferences between ergodic averages and martingales.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"X-dxJYoe-rRH2CY4Nh9UcT8X2dnK46uKx_O6IZEXviA","pdfSize":"299976"}
