  "abstract": "  We present a method whereby the finite element method is used to train\nphysics-informed neural networks that are suitable for surrogate modeling. The\nmethod is based on a custom convolutional operation called stencil convolution\nwhich leverages the inverse isoparametric map of the finite element method. We\ndemonstrate the performance of the method in several training and testing\nscenarios with linear boundary-value problems of varying geometries. The\nresulting neural networks show reasonable accuracy when tested on unseen\ngeometries that are similar to those used for training. Furthermore, when the\nnumber of training geometries is increased the testing errors systematically\ndecrease, demonstrating that the neural networks learn how to generalize as the\ntraining set becomes larger. Further extending the method to allow for variable\nboundary conditions, properties, and body forces will lead to a general-purpose\nsurrogate modeling framework that can leverage existing finite element codes\nfor training.\n",
