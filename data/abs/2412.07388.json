Such models are interesting from a healthcare\nperspective, as these voice-controlled assistants may support the elderly and\nenable remote health monitoring. The bottleneck for efficacy, however, is how\nwell these devices work in practice and how the elderly experience them, but\nresearch on this topic is scant. We review elderly use of voice-controlled AI\nand highlight various user- and technology-centered issues, that need to be\nconsidered before effective speech-controlled AI for elderly care can be\nrealized.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Computers and Society","Computer Science/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"F9MIYEUQfaDmrmCXYKHpmI_qAf-fsfy_HoYkx73ZXuc","pdfSize":"346464"}
