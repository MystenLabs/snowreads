Specifically, an FDA-assisted wiretap channel is considered,\nwhere the transmit beamforming and frequency offsets at each antenna are\njointly optimized. A novel alternating optimization-based method is introduced\nto address the non-convex problem of secure transmission, focusing on\nminimizing transmit power and maximizing the secrecy rate. Numerical results\nare provided to demonstrate the superiority of the FDA-based framework compared\nto systems employing traditional phased array antennas in secure transmission.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cVDQY2juzXQFIprdaN5mHwU4KcCoV5TiGKO2sthc3ZY","pdfSize":"341021"}
