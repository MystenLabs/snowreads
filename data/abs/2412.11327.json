For the first time results are presented at\nnext-to- and next-to-next-to-leading order, with one and two additional\nphotons, respectively, for radiation from the initial and final states. The\ncomparison with the predictions from Phokhara and AfkQed generators reveals\ndiscrepancies for the former in the one-photon rates and angular distributions.\nWhile this disagreement has a negligible effect on the $e^+e^- \\to \\pi^+\\pi^-\n(\\gamma)$ cross section measured by $BaBar$, the impact on the KLOE and BESIII\nmeasurements is estimated and found to be indicative of significant systematic\neffects. The findings shed a new light on the longstanding deviation among the\nmuon $g-2$ measurement, the Standard Model prediction using the data-driven\ndispersive approach for calculation of the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP),\nand the comparison with lattice QCD calculations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"F3cr4zzkbQrDl1iTosU1eBd_Dk-nyxynzbay7DpspIw","pdfSize":"739874"}
