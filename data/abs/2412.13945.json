A subgraph\nis called rainbow if all its edges have different colors. The problem of\nfinding rainbow subgraphs or other restricted structures in edge-colored graphs\nhas a long history, dating back to Euler's work on Latin squares. It has also\nproven to be a powerful method for studying several well-known questions in\nother areas.\n  In this survey, we will provide a brief introduction to this topic, discuss\nseveral results in this area, and demonstrate their applications to problems in\ngraph decomposition, additive combinatorics, theoretical computer science, and\ncoding theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computer Science/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oKqerrfSwcIGVJ9OIo5woTpn5ZNaWN82kyYR_EonFDM","pdfSize":"288961"}
