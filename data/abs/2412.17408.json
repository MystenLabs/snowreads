  "abstract": "  Given news articles about an entity, such as a public figure or organization,\ntimeline summarization (TLS) involves generating a timeline that summarizes the\nkey events about the entity. However, the TLS task is too underspecified, since\nwhat is of interest to each reader may vary, and hence there is not a single\nideal or optimal timeline. In this paper, we introduce a novel task, called\nConstrained Timeline Summarization (CTLS), where a timeline is generated in\nwhich all events in the timeline meet some constraint. An example of a\nconstrained timeline concerns the legal battles of Tiger Woods, where only\nevents related to his legal problems are selected to appear in the timeline. We\ncollected a new human-verified dataset of constrained timelines involving 47\nentities and 5 constraints per entity. We propose an approach that employs a\nlarge language model (LLM) to summarize news articles according to a specified\nconstraint and cluster them to identify key events to include in a constrained\ntimeline. In addition, we propose a novel self-reflection method during summary\ngeneration, demonstrating that this approach successfully leads to improved\nperformance.\n",
