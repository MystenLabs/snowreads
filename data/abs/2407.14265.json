In this paper, we associate to each $\\mathfrak{m}$-primary\nideal $I$ of $\\mathcal{O}_{X,0}$ a continuous function $\\mathcal{I}_I$ defined\non the set of positive (suitably normalized) semivaluations of\n$\\mathcal{O}_{X,0}$. We prove that the function $\\mathcal{I}_{\\mathfrak{m}}$ is\ndetermined by the outer Lipschitz geometry of the surface $(X, 0)$. We further\ndemonstrate that for each $\\mathfrak{m}$-primary ideal $I$, there exists a\ncomplex surface germ $(X_I, 0)$ with an isolated singularity whose\nnormalization is isomorphic to $(X, 0)$ and $\\mathcal{I}_I =\n\\mathcal{I}_{\\mathfrak{m}_I}$, where $\\mathfrak{m}_I$ is the maximal ideal of\n$\\mathcal{O}_{X_I,0}$. Subsequently, we construct an infinite family of complex\nsurface germs with isolated singularities, whose normalizations are isomorphic\nto $(X,0)$ (in particular, they are homeomorphic to $(X,0)$) but have distinct\nouter Lipschitz types.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bfBm_rOhscmgc8j1qjiNZDtmjGyZ5Y7SxN1yHBBhNL4","pdfSize":"476850"}
