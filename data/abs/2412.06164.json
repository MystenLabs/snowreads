Polyhedral meshes\nare more natural for certain applications than pure triangular or quadrilateral\nmeshes, which thus received significant interest as an alternative\nrepresentation. We consider finite element methods using barycentric\ncoordinates as basis functions and the modern virtual finite element approach.\nWe evaluate them on a suite of classical graphics problems to understand their\nbenefits and limitations compared to standard techniques on simplicial\ndiscretizations. Our analysis provides recommendations and a benchmark for\ndeveloping polyhedral meshing techniques and corresponding analysis techniques.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Graphics","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"YPOoXF185DZ4zak_QSVpMnxDKcNq9woKeimYElrQsJE","pdfSize":"27718046"}
