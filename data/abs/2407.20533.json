An exotic quantum spin state is found to\narise from a melting of the $\\boldsymbol{Q} = 0$ long-range magnetic order by a\ntopological transition, when a small anisotropic third nearest-neighbor\nantiferromagnetic Heisenberg interaction is turned on. This novel state is a\ngapped quantum spin liquid, characterized by a topological order with\nground-state degeneracy $n_g = 4$ and topological entanglement entropy $\\gamma\n= \\ln 2$, suggesting it is an Abelian topological phase. Furthermore, the Chern\nnumbers of the spin-up (-down) spinon occupied bands of this state are\n$C_{\\uparrow \\downarrow} = \\pm 1$, respectively. From this perspective, this\nstate is also a time-reversal symmetric (total Chern number $C_{total} = 0$)\ntopological insulator with spinons as the chiral edge states, which carry\nopposite spin and move in the opposite direction. It is analogous to the\nquantum spin Hall state but the spin current is carried by deconfined spinons\nin a quantum spin liquid, so is dubbed as the spinon quantum spin Hall state.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5orn1VLAsTZ7buGux8mx3cRZ4o32QGZ4udw50wy5jQI","pdfSize":"1351323"}
