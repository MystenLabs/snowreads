  "abstract": "  Tactile sensing is used in robotics to obtain real-time feedback during\nphysical interactions. Fine object manipulation is a robotic application that\nbenefits from a high density of sensors to accurately estimate object pose,\nwhereas a low sensing resolution is sufficient for collision detection.\nIntroducing variable sensing resolution into a single tactile sensing array can\nincrease the range of tactile use cases, but also invokes challenges in\nlocalizing internal sensor positions. In this work, we present a mutual\ncapacitance sensor array with variable sensor density, VARSkin, along with a\nlocalization method that determines the position of each sensor in the\nnon-uniform array. When tested on two distinct artificial skin patches with\nconcealed sensor layouts, our method achieves a localization accuracy within\n$\\pm 2mm$. We also provide a comprehensive error analysis, offering strategies\nfor further precision improvement.\n",
