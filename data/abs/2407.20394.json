Inspired by this approach, we give a\ndifferent decomposition of the $d$-dimensional isotropic $\\alpha$-stable L\\'evy\nprocesses in terms of orthogonal coordinates. Accordingly we are able to\ndevelop a number of $n$-tuple laws for first entrance into a half-space. We\nalso numerically construct the law of first entry of the process into a slab of\nthe form $(-1, 1)\\times \\mathbb{R}^{d-1}$ using a walk-on-half-spaces Monte\nCarlo approach.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_g-DqCk2qjyT20An3BPlWy1O3hv5try2uH3uMpiZyvQ","pdfSize":"2526358"}
