Data samples requiring\nthe coincidence of scintillation and ionization signals (paired), as well as\nunpaired ionization-only signals (US2), are selected with energy threshold of\napproximately 1.1 keV (0.33 keV) nuclear recoil energy. Combining the\ncommissioning run and the first science run of PandaX-4T, a total exposure of\n1.20 and 1.04 tonne$\\cdot$year are collected for the paired and US2,\nrespectively. After unblinding, 3 and 332 events are observed with an\nexpectation of 2.8$\\pm$0.5 and 251$\\pm$32 background events, for the paired and\nUS2 data, respectively. A combined analysis yields a best-fit $^8$B neutrino\nsignal of 3.5 (75) events from the paired (US2) data sample, with $\\sim$37\\%\nuncertainty, and the background-only hypothesis is disfavored at 2.64$\\sigma$\nsignificance. This gives a solar $^8$B neutrino flux of\n($8.4\\pm3.1$)$\\times$10$^6$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, consistent with the standard\nsolar model prediction. It is also the first indication of solar $^8$B neutrino\n``fog'' in a dark matter direct detection experiment.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nYhmw4moLSdZvSiCvP6FwxhEIKbPDFBpLkLdnWvW6P4","pdfSize":"688892"}
