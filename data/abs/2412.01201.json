  "abstract": "  We include the $\\Delta$-isobars in the equation of state (EOS) of neutron\nstar (NS) and study its effects with various parameter sets of the RMF model.\nWe compare our results with the NS's constraints from the mass-radius\nmeasurement of PSR J0348+0432, PSR J1614-2230, PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620,\nPSR J0952-0607, and tidal deformability of GW170817. We calculate the\nmass-radius profile and tidal deformabilities of the NS using 21 parameter sets\nof the RMF model.Analyzing the result with various parameters, it is clear that\nonly few parameter sets can satisfy simultaneously the constraints from NICER\nand GW170817. NLD parameter set satisfy all the constraints of NICER and\nGW170817. For its strong predictive power for the bulk properties of the\nneutron star, we take NLD parameter set as a representative for the detailed\ncalculation of effect of $\\Delta$-isobar on neutron star properties. We\ndemonstrate that it is possible that $\\Delta$-isobar can produce at 2-3 times\nthe saturation density by adjusting the coupling constants $X_{\\sigma\\Delta}$,\n$X_{\\rho\\Delta}$ and $X_{\\omega\\Delta}$ in an appropriate range. Bulk\nproperties of the NS like mass-radius profile and tidal deformability is\nstrongly affected by the interaction strength of $\\Delta$-isobar. Our\ncalculation shows that it is also possible that by choosing $X_{\\sigma\\Delta}$,\n$X_{\\rho\\Delta}$ and $X_{\\omega\\Delta}$ to a suitable range the threshold\ndensity of $\\Delta^-$-isobar become lower than $\\Lambda^0$ hyperon. For a\nparticular value of $\\Delta$-coupling constants, the $R_{1.4}$ decrease by 1.7\nkm. This manuscipt give an argumentative justification for allowing\n$\\Delta$-isobar degrees of freedom in the calculation of the NS properties.\n",
