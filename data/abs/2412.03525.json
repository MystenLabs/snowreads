In\nthis paper, we continue our study of pin classes, which are permutation classes\nthat comprise all the finite subpermutations contained in an infinite pin\npermutation. We show that there is a phase transition at $\\mu\\approx 3.28277$:\nthere are uncountably many different pin classes whose growth rate is equal to\n$\\mu$, yet only countably many below $\\mu$. Furthermore, by showing that all\npin classes with growth rate less than $\\mu$ are essentially defined by pin\npermutations that possess a periodic structure, we classify the set of growth\nrates of pin classes up to $\\mu$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"siZVU0R-IwG97gzCHUtGaAImOYFqXrWisXAw4NEotJw","pdfSize":"261911"}
