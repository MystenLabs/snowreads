  "abstract": "  We apply Bayesian techniques to compare a simple, empirical model for\njet-quenching in heavy-ion collisions to centrality-dependent jet-$R_{AA}$\nmeasured by ATLAS for Pb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$~TeV. We find\nthat the $R_{AA}$ values for central collisions are adequately described with a\nmodel for the mean $p_T$-dependent jet energy-loss using only 2-parameters.\nThis model is extended by incorporating 2D initial geometry information from\nTRENTO and compared to centrality-dependent $R_{AA}$ values. We find that the\nresults are sensitive to value of the jet-quenching formation time, $\\tau_f$,\nand that the optimal value of $\\tau_f$ varies with the assumed path-length\ndependence of the energy-loss. We construct a covariance error matrix for the\ndata from the $p_T$ dependent contributions to the ATLAS systematic errors and\nperform Bayesian calibrations for several different assumptions for the\nsystematic error correlations. We show that most-probable functions and\n$\\chi^2$ values are sensitive to assumptions made when fitting to correlated\nerrors.\n",
