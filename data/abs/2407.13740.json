In this study we focus on a\nsub-sample of nine microlensing events, selected based on their long\ntimescales, small microlensing parallaxes and joint observations by the Gaia\nmission, to increase the probability that the chosen lenses are massive and the\nmass is measurable. Among the selected events we identify lensing black holes\nand neutron star candidates, with potential confirmation through forthcoming\nrelease of the Gaia time-series astrometry in 2026. Utilizing Bayesian analysis\nand Galactic models, along with the Gaia Data Release 3 proper motion data,\nfour good candidates for dark remnants were identified: OGLE-2016-BLG-0293,\nOGLE-2018-BLG-0483, OGLE-2018-BLG-0662, and OGLE-2015-BLG-0149, with lens\nmasses of $2.98^{+1.75}_{-1.28}~M_{\\odot}$, $4.65^{+3.12}_{-2.08}~M_{\\odot}$,\n$3.15^{+0.66}_{-0.64}~M_{\\odot}$ and $1.4^{+0.75}_{-0.55}~M_{\\odot}$,\nrespectively. Notably, the first two candidates are expected to exhibit\nastrometric microlensing signals detectable by Gaia, offering the prospect of\nvalidating the lens masses. The methodologies developed in this work will be\napplied to the full Spitzer microlensing sample, populating and analyzing the\ntime-scale ($t_{\\rm E}$) vs. parallax ($\\pi_{\\rm E}$) diagram to derive\nconstraints on the population of lenses in general and massive remnants in\nparticular.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"c-JPUs-2DMzIr_AzFjz4R711yLr2IdwohHYOR7PKx2M","pdfSize":"4989474","objectId":"0xfd3b7f1527b9f9715f6b934a1387e09de3f37cb8d8fb9abaa867648685c7c4a3","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
