Glass-like dynamical characteristics have been observed in various\nbiological systems from micro to macro length scales. As activity induces\nadditional fluctuations in the system, studying how they couple with density\nfluctuations is an interesting question to address. Via extensive molecular\ndynamics simulations, We show that activity enhances density fluctuations more\nstrongly than its passive counterpart. Increasing activity beyond a limit\nresults in the sub-Arrhenieus-type relaxation behavior in active glasses. We\nalso propose a unified scaling theory that can rationalize the relaxation\nspectrum over a broad parameter range using the concept of an effective\ntemperature. In particular, we show that our scaling theory can capture the\ndynamical crossover from super to sub-Arrhenius relaxation behavior by changing\nactivity from small to large values. Furthermore, We present non-trivial system\nsize dependencies of the relaxation time at large activity limits that have not\nbeen found in any passive systems or even in active systems at small\nactivities.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kW-9yI6UDyJFKDUpS2mKoIdbej-XuJ2XuMAh3RNriMA","pdfSize":"2491992"}
