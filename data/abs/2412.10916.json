  "abstract": "  This paper addresses distributed learning of a complex object for multiple\nnetworked robots based on distributed optimization and kernel-based support\nvector machine. In order to overcome a fundamental limitation of polynomial\nkernels assumed in our antecessor, we employ Gaussian kernel as a kernel\nfunction for classification. The Gaussian kernel prohibits the robots to share\nthe function through a finite number of equality constraints due to its\ninfinite dimensionality of the function space. We thus reformulate the\noptimization problem assuming that the target function space is identified with\nthe space spanned by the bases associated with not the data but a finite number\nof grid points. The above relaxation is shown to allow the robots to share the\nfunction by a finite number of equality constraints. We finally demonstrate the\npresent approach through numerical simulations.\n",
