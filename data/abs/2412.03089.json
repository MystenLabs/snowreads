  "abstract": "  Resistive Random-Access Memory (ReRAM) crossbar arrays are promising\ncandidates for in-situ matrix-vector multiplication (MVM), a frequent operation\nin Deep Learning algorithms. Despite their advantages, these emerging\nnon-volatile memories are susceptible to errors due to non-idealities such as\nimmature fabrication processes and runtime errors, which lead to accuracy\ndegradation in Processing-in-Memory (PIM) accelerators. This paper proposes an\nonline soft error detection and correction method in ReRAM crossbar arrays. We\nutilize a test input vector and Error Correcting Codes (ECCs) to detect and\ncorrect faulty columns. The proposed approach demonstrates near fault-free\naccuracy for Neural Networks (NNs) on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, with low\narea overhead and power consumption compared to recent methods.\n",
