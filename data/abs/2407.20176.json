Previous research found it hard to\nalter the perceived emotional valence of lead sheets only by harmonizing the\nsame melody with different chords, which may be attributed to the constraints\nimposed by the melody itself and the limitation of existing music\nrepresentation. In this paper, we propose a novel functional representation for\nsymbolic music. This new method takes musical keys into account, recognizing\ntheir significant role in shaping music's emotional character through\nmajor-minor tonality. It also allows for melodic variation with respect to keys\nand addresses the problem of data scarcity for better emotion modeling. A\nTransformer is employed to harmonize key-adaptable melodies, allowing for keys\ndetermined in rule-based or model-based manner. Experimental results confirm\nthe effectiveness of our new representation in generating key-aware harmonies,\nwith objective and subjective evaluations affirming the potential of our\napproach to convey specific valence for versatile melody.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"4kfkwtOO64LiLK8A-th-YH0aoKYH3erwF7x34HEkTns","pdfSize":"1602368"}
