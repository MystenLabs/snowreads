Two rigorous parametric\nadjustment models are discussed. The first one is a well-known model of\nadjustment in the geodetic coordinate system. This model is completely rigorous\n(functional and stochastic parts) and uses unreduced distance and direction\nobservations. The proposed alternative is a model of planar network adjustment\nwith observations rigorously reduced directly to the mapping plane. These\nground-to-grid reductions are simple and universal, regardless of which map\nprojection is used. Slightly different results of the planar network adjustment\nare obtained. The differences are attributed to a non-rigorous stochastic\nmodel. In theory, the stochastic properties of the reduced observations should\nalso be adapted. However, these differences are very small and can always be\nneglected in geodetic and surveying practice.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ClovqLnJT80UQuRaIrmaQns7mDF07qWFTkL6-yAHXig","pdfSize":"1161507"}
