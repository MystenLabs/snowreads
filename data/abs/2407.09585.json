By leveraging architectural self-similarity in Deep\nNeural Networks (DNNs), we quantify fractal dimensions and \\textit{roughness}\nto deeply understand their dynamics and enhance the quality of\n\\textit{intrinsic} explanations. Our approach integrates principles from Chaos\nTheory to improve visualizations of fractal evolution and utilizes a\nGraph-Based Neural Network for reconstructing network topology. This strategy\naims at advancing the \\textit{intrinsic} explainability of connectionist\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wpmilws43gTvrW8gVWo1OjXSoE_ZcCFusGvI7qll3rE","pdfSize":"1731068"}
