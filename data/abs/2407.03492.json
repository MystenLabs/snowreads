Results include generalizations of theorems\nfrom symmetric to combinatorially symmetric matrices, special bases of matrix\nnullspaces derived from transversal sets, and examples of issues that arise\nwhen considering only minimal forts and how to avoid them. We also show an\nimportant difference between constructing symmetric and combinatorially\nsymmetric matrices associated to a graph whose nullspaces are supported on\ncollections of disjoint forts.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"FUcVTlR8W-tZyc6iTwWl5kxtbaZWkeoVjwzyplMvPAY","pdfSize":"185368"}
