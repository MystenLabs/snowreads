  "abstract": "  Polarimetric images of accreting black holes encode important information\nabout laws of strong gravity and relativistic motions of matter. Recent\nadvancements in instrumentation enabled such studies in two objects:\nsupermassive black holes M87* and Sagittarius A*. Light coming from these\nsources is produced by synchrotron mechanism whose polarization is directly\nlinked to magnetic field lines, and propagates towards the observer in a curved\nspacetime. We study the distortions of the gas image by the analytical\nray-tracing technique for polarized light artpol, that is adapted for the case\nof synchrotron emission. We derive analytical expressions for fast conversion\nof intensity/flux, polarization degree and polarization angle from the local to\nobserver's coordinates. We put emphasis on the non-zero matter elevation above\nthe equatorial plane and non-circular matter motions. Applications of the\ndeveloped formalism include static polarimetric imaging of the black hole\nvicinity and dynamic polarimetric signatures of matter close to the compact\nobject.\n",
