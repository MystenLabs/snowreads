The linear one that is obtained by superimposing a\nfinite-energy Airy envelope to the valley Hall edge state shows\nself-accelerating, non-diffracting and self-healing properties, with the\naccelerating trajectory not exactly a parabola. For the nonlinear one which\nexhibits well self-accelerating and non-diffracting properties that may turn\nover the moving direction of the valley Hall edge state, it is constructed by\nsuperimposing the self-trapped self-accelerating envelope that is obtained from\nthe envelope equation to the valley Hall edge state. The nonlinear\nself-accelerating valley Hall edge state can circumvent sharp corners without\nback-scattering, but it is impossible to completely prohibit radiating into the\nbulk because the topological protection and the self-accelerating demand\ncontrary length of the oscillating tail. The results exhibit the possibility on\nmanipulating topological edge states via self-accelerating waves, and pave the\nway for the self-accelerating topological photonics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"LuSw4mE6u4i-f-lDQ4cCic8nAZx2dFR2l2bOAV2sUg0","pdfSize":"2313827"}
