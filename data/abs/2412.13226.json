We show that\nthere are three classes of generalized models, one class for complex fields and\ntwo different classes for real fields. All models in these three classes have\ntravelling-wave solutions and satisfy the relativistic dispersion relation.\nMoreover, all models of the complex class and models of only one class of the\ntwo real classes recover the standard Klein-Gordon model. We also build the\nLagrangian and the Hamiltonian for the three classes of models. The fields in\nthe models of these three classes could in principle have the mass dimension\nvarying from zero to one and this can allow us to construct interaction terms,\nother than $\\lambda \\Phi^4$, with coupling constants with positive or zero mass\ndimensions. Furthermore, we also show that there is a subclass of equations in\nthe complex class which has a Lorentzian soliton solution.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PhpZSQsV5ZVFj0rsO1-L6e650USv5cIplMVeYIi0aOE","pdfSize":"404754"}
