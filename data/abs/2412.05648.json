  "abstract": "  The aim of this paper is to investigate inequalities that are analogous to\nthe Minkowski and H\\\"older inequalities by replacing the addition and the\nmultiplication by a more general operation, and instead of using power means,\ngeneralized Bajraktarevi\\'c means are considered, in particular, Gini means. A\nfurther aim is to introduce the concept of local and global validity of such\ninequalities and to characterize them in both senses.\n",
