  "abstract": "  The relationship between different dissipativity concepts for linear\ntime-varying systems is studied, in particular between port-Hamiltonian\nsystems, passive systems, and systems with nonnegative supply. It is shown that\nlinear time-varying port-Hamiltonian systems are passive, have nonnegative\nsupply rates, and solve (under different smoothness assumptions)\nKalman-Yakubovich-Popov differential and integral inequalities. The converse\nrelations are also studied in detail. In particular, sufficient conditions are\npresented to obtain a port-Hamiltonian representation starting from any of the\nother dissipativity concepts. Two applications are presented.\n",
