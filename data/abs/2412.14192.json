  "abstract": "  We consider a two-dimensional Lorentz-invariant field model with a $\\phi^{4}$\npotential modified by a term that introduces asymmetries at the manifold space.\nIn this framework, the model recovers its original symmetry only when $p=0$.\nThe asymmetry introduced in the potential suggests that, even when one of the\nminima diverges asymptotically, kink/antikink-like configurations emerge in the\ntheory, shifting the critical point of the energy density away from the center\nof the kink-like solutions. Hence, we note that the model supports asymmetrical\nkink/antikink-like topological solutions. Furthermore, an analysis of the\nexcitation spectrum of these solutions revealed the absence of vibrational\nmodes. Finally, we examine the dynamical solutions for different values of\ninitial speed by allowing us to verify the effects of asymmetries on the\ncollision properties.\n",
