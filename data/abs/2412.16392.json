The collective atomic motion is shown to be polarized in a\ndirection related to the linear polarization of the incoming laser pulse. Using\na driven-oscillator model, the lifetime of the oscillator's driving force is\ndetermined to 37(30) fs. This is much shorter than the lifetime of excited\ncarriers in graphite but similar to the time scale of the loss of the hot\ncarrier's k-space anisotropy.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"k2QWyggBZyVhRYA3796JCh1-vIe5CxKEiXMn9wl1o00","pdfSize":"1302633"}
