  "abstract": "  We study a novel production and decay mechanism for a bi-adjoint spin zero\nparticle in the (8,3,0) representation of the Standard Model gauge groups. This\nwork is part of a series studying new production processes for exotic particles\nin higher representations of Standard Model color and weak charge. We study a\nnew dimension 5 effective operator model which couples an exotic bi-adjoint\nscalar field to the SU(3) and SU(2) field strength tensors. We explore the\nW-gluon resonant decay of the charged component of this new exotic field. We\ndiscuss LHC production modes of the charged and neutral bi-adjoint state and\nfind a new single production mode for the charged state that is the dominant\nLHC production mode for TeV-scale masses. We introduce a new HL-LHC search in\nthis asymmetric W-gluon fusion process in which a single bi-adjoint is produced\nin association with a hard forward quark jet. We have 5 sigma discovery\npotential for bi-adjoint masses up to 3 TeV for 10 TeV scalar effective\noperator cutoffs. We also find 2 sigma sensitivity of HL-LHC for bi-adjoint\nmasses up to 4 TeV and effective cut-offs in the 15 TeV range for the full 3\ninverse atto-barn data set.\n",
