However, the\ninstruction-following capability of large language models (LLMs) offers a\nshortcut to effectively solve NLP tasks, questioning the utility of semantic\ngraphs. Meanwhile, recent work has also shown the difficulty of using meaning\nrepresentations merely as a helpful auxiliary for LLMs. We revisit the position\nof semantic graphs in syntactic simplification, the task of simplifying\nsentence structures while preserving their meaning, which requires semantic\nunderstanding, and evaluate it on a new complex and natural dataset. The\nAMR-based method that we propose, AMRS$^3$, demonstrates that state-of-the-art\nmeaning representations can lead to easy-to-implement simplification methods\nwith competitive performance and unique advantages in cost, interpretability,\nand generalization. With AMRS$^3$ as an anchor, we discover that syntactic\nsimplification is a task where semantic graphs are helpful in LLM prompting. We\npropose AMRCoC prompting that guides LLMs to emulate graph algorithms for\nexplicit symbolic reasoning on AMR graphs, and show its potential for improving\nLLM on semantic-centered tasks like syntactic simplification.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"b48i2dTjgQujTu2OnVQfzuQ-EUsb8nLFAv3yPZwh3iw","pdfSize":"380051"}
