The stable Andrews-Curtis\nconjecture is equivalent to the conjecture that every contractible fake surface\nis 3-deformable to a point. We prove that every contractible fake surface of\ncomplexity less than 6 is 3-deformable to a point by induction.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"p6fnxPuLOSw5iLvYy04FQ9SLTzP9tdlw_9Mebb2eZTA","pdfSize":"336122"}
