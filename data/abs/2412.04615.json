  "abstract": "  The paper addresses some basic questions in the theory of finite time\ndynamics and finite time predictions for non-uniformly hyperbolic dynamical\nsystems. It is concerned with transport in phase spaces of such systems, and\nanalyzes which subsets and when the orbits prefer to visit. An asymptotic\nexpansion of the decay of polynomial escape rates is obtained, which also\nallows finding asymptotics of the first hitting probabilities. Our approach is\nbased on the construction of operator renewal equations for open dynamical\nsystems and on their spectral analysis. In order to do this, we generalize the\nKeller-Liverani perturbation technique. Applications to a large class of\none-dimensional non-uniformly expanding systems are considered.\n",
