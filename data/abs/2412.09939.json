  "abstract": "  We consider a variant of the target defense problems where a group of\ndefenders are tasked to simultaneously capture an intruder. The intruder's\nobjective is to reach a target without being simultaneously captured by the\ndefender team. Some of the defenders are sensing-limited and do not have any\ninformation regarding the intruder's position or velocity at any time. The\ndefenders may communicate with each other using a connected communication\ngraph. We propose a decentralized feedback strategy for the defenders, which\ntransforms the simultaneous capture problem into a unique nonlinear consensus\nproblem. We derive a sufficient condition for simultaneous capture in terms of\nthe agents' speeds, sensing, and communication capabilities. The proposed\ndecentralized controller is evaluated through extensive numerical simulations.\n",
