In the present paper, we show that critical\ndimension of the complex particle in Minkowski spacetime is $D = 4$, while $D =\n2, 4$ or $6$ are permitted in Euclid spacetime. The origin of the restriction\nto the dimension is the existence of tertiary constraint in the canonical\ntheory, quantization of which leads to an eigenvalue equation having\nsingle-valued and bounded solutions only in particular dimension of spacetime.\nThe derivation is based on a detailed analysis of Laplace-Beltrami operator on\n$S^{1,D-2}$ or $S^{D-1}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4_FROiYyzlh_JNK9T7PCOkB9oYfo8-SjcFMSqWkXClI","pdfSize":"225986"}
