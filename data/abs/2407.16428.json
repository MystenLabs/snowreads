We investigate four isotopic\nchains (Se, Zr, Mo and Nd) in the framework of microscopic Skyrme-Hartree-Fock\n+ Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer calculations for 15 different parametrizations. The\nmicroscopic calculations show the typical behavior expected for first-order\nphase transitions. To find the best candidate for the critical point phase\ntransition we propose new microscopic position and occupation indices\ncalculated for positive-parity and negative-parity proton and neutron\nsingle-quasiparticle states around the Fermi level. The microscopic\ncalculations are completed by macroscopic calculations within the Algebraic\nCollective Model (ACM), and compared to the experimental data for $^{74}$Se,\n$^{102}$Mo and $^{150}$Nd, considered to be the best candidates for the\ncritical point nuclei.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uuRBSpI4MVaFuHCv0LrBD8ku0fnxawU7WHvUCgoZqWw","pdfSize":"3148016"}
