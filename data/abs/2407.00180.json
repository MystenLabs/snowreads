In this paper, we investigate the\naccretion process of a magnetized neutron star (NS) surrounded by a\nsuper-Eddington disk. By constructing self-similar solutions for the disk\nstructure, we study in detail an interaction between the NS magnetosphere and\nthe inner region of the disk, revealing that this interaction takes place\nwithin a thin boundary layer. The magnetosphere truncation radius is found to\nbe approximately proportional to the Alfv\\'en radius, with a coefficient\nranging between 0.34-0.71, influenced by the advection and twisting of a\nmagnetic field, NS rotation, and radiation emitted from an NS accretion column.\nUnder super-Eddington accretion, the NS can readily spin up to become a rapid\nrotator. The proposed model can be employed to explore the accretion and\nevolution of NSs in diverse astrophysical contexts, such as ultraluminous X-ray\nbinaries or active galactic nucleus disks.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"o7tBFGLHA74LDgeJfWsy0eudBGFYDsu4XP3v3PZoMxI","pdfSize":"1711332"}
