The proofs of these properties are mainly based on a basic\ntechnique of convolution, joined with a cutoff, with some care needed in order\nnot to exceed the original support.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"en-WZcgPf-RpELcgcXMfxeAWQ7slt6gn_zVYXNQ7Aok","pdfSize":"226479"}
