This can lead to significant reputational and\nprivacy harms, especially when sensitive, misleading, and outright false. This\npaper considers what legal tools currently exist to protect such individuals,\nwith a particular focus on defamation and data protection law. We explore the\npotential of libel law, arguing that it is a potential but not an ideal remedy,\ndue to lack of harmonization, and the focus on damages rather than systematic\nprevention of future libel. We then turn to data protection law, arguing that\nthe data subject rights to erasure and rectification may offer some more\nmeaningful protection, although the technical feasibility of compliance is a\nmatter of ongoing research. We conclude by noting the limitations of these\nindividualistic remedies and hint at the need for a more systemic,\nenvironmental approach to protecting the infosphere against generative AI.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wJnfOXpp0egZsOFP_P5QAD8jboRJ3bmtcuQzx4WzQHU","pdfSize":"309122"}
