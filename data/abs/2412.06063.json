In this paper, we study the question of socially fair low-rank\napproximation and socially fair column subset selection, where the goal is to\nminimize the loss over all sub-populations of the data. We show that\nsurprisingly, even constant-factor approximation to fair low-rank approximation\nrequires exponential time under certain standard complexity hypotheses. On the\npositive side, we give an algorithm for fair low-rank approximation that, for a\nconstant number of groups and constant-factor accuracy, runs in\n$2^{\\text{poly}(k)}$ time rather than the na\\\"{i}ve $n^{\\text{poly}(k)}$, which\nis a substantial improvement when the dataset has a large number $n$ of\nobservations. We then show that there exist bicriteria approximation algorithms\nfor fair low-rank approximation and fair column subset selection that run in\npolynomial time.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Data Structures and Algorithms","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8i_U8vygvZJ0Pmy_yj_9v8iqWSBQ1PfBvFmVreP9dbs","pdfSize":"771013"}
