  "abstract": "  We consider class of equilibrium models including the implicit Walras\nsupply-demand and competitive models. Such a model in this class, in general,\nis ill-posed. We formulate such a model in the form a variational inequality\nhaving certain monotonicity property which allow us to describe a\nregularization algorithm avoiding the ill-posedness based upon the bilevel\noptimization for fnding a point that is nearest to the given guessed or desired\nequilibrium price for the model. The obtained computational results with many\nrandomly generated data show that the proposed algorithm works well for this\nclass of the equilibrium models.\n",
