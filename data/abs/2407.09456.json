The\ndevice comprises an optomechanical photonic crystal nanobeam in GaAs with\nembedded In(Ga)As QDs. The flexural mechanical mode of the device can be\noptically driven exploiting the large optomechanical coupling rate of the\ncavity. The vibrations generate a time-modulated strain field that shifts the\nquantum dot transition energy. We observe that optical driving of the\nmechanical mode induces a shift in an excitonic line corresponding to an\nestimated vacuum strain coupling rate of 214 kHz. Our approach represents an\nimportant step towards the use of phonons to couple different on-chip quantum\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"00ThcKUc3QjK5TsoXztU7-yaC28ugiTsuNU2L6lBb-Q","pdfSize":"9202689"}
