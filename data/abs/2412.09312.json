  "abstract": "  The supramolecular assembly of lipids into bilayer membranes is essential for\ncellular structure and function. However, the impact of lipid structural\nvariations such as acyl chain length, degree of unsaturation, and headgroup\ntype on bilayer properties remains incompletely understood. This study employs\ncoarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations using the Martini force field to\ninvestigate seven distinct lipid species, aiming to compute critical bilayer\nparameters including area per lipid, bilayer thickness, and lateral diffusion\ncoefficients. Our simulations reveal that lipids with longer acyl chains\nexhibit increased bilayer thickness, while unsaturation introduces kinks in the\nacyl chains, generally reducing bilayer thickness and increasing the area per\nlipid. Lipids with unsaturated chains demonstrate higher lateral diffusion\ncoefficients, enhancing membrane fluidity. Variations in headgroup chemistry\nsignificantly influence lipid packing and membrane dynamics. This investigation\nadvances our understanding of membrane biophysics and has significant\nimplications for the design of lipid-based systems in biomedical applications.\n",
