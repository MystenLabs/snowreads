We build, following results by\nAngella and Kasuya, finite dimensional double subcomplexes\n$(C_\\Gamma^{\\bullet,\\bullet},\\partial,\\bar{\\partial})\\subseteq(\\wedge^{\\bullet,\\bullet}G/\\Gamma,\\partial,\\bar{\\partial})$\nfor which the inclusion is an isomorphism in cohomology. We decompose such\ndouble complexes into indecomposable ones. Lastly, we study some notions of\nformality for this class of manifolds, giving a characterization of the\n$\\partial\\bar{\\partial}$-Lemma property in general complex dimension, and we\ncompute triple ABC-Massey products on them.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"a2IoNyuzXmvFERUkTZ1sRkEf7qGuGM-D27mlwtl3PRA","pdfSize":"472727"}
