In this paper, we prove that in undirected networks, the\ngraph-normalized PageRank is always upper bounded by the degree. Furthermore,\nwe prove that the corresponding (asymptotic) lower bound holds true under\nreasonable assumptions on the local weak limit, but not in general, and we\nprovide a counterexample. Our result shows that PageRank always has a lighter\ntail than the degree, which contrasts the case of the directed preferential\nattachment model, where PageRank has a heavier tail instead. We end the paper\nwith a discussion, where we extend our results to directed networks with a\nbounded ratio of in- and out-degrees, and reflect on our methods by contrasting\nthe undirected and directed preferential attachment model.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"M02w9TQ1_WfsH-Ytvh0rI-UCTrI39ycrktvbtdt7IJc","pdfSize":"348634"}
