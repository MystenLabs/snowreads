  "abstract": "  Equidistant 1D arrays of thin film lithium niobate waveguides can exhibit\nnon-trivial topology due to a specific interplay between inter- and intra-modal\ncouplings of two families of guided modes. In this work we analyze two-colour\nspatial solitons, emerging due to $\\chi_2$ nonlinear interactions between the\nmodes of non-trivial topology in the fundamental harmonic field, and modes of\ntrivial topology in the second harmonic field. We discuss solitons localized in\nthe bulk of the array (bulk solitons), and at an edge of a finite-size array\n(edge solitons). The latter emerge due to the nonlinear interactions between a\ntopological edge mode in the fundamental harmonic and bulk modes in the second\nharmonic. We reveal that for each type of soliton, bulk or edge, there\ngenerally exist two families of solutions with different internal structures\nand ranges of propagation constants. All bulk solitons can only be excited\nabove a certain power threshold dictated by the coupling strength in the second\nharmonic field and the phase matching between the fundamental and second\nharmonics. The power threshold for edge solitons generally appears to be much\nlower, and, by tuning the phase matching, it can be reduced to zero.\n",
