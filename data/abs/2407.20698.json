The numerical method combines a linear\nbulk--surface finite element discretization in space and linearly implicit\nbackward difference formulae of order 1 to 5 in time. Optimal-order error\nestimates are proven. The error estimates are based on a consistency and\nstability analysis in an abstract framework, based on energy estimates\nexploiting the anti-symmetric structure of the second-order system.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"1YvSAcbbregyMTUjvhhMK-F2sczJDNPfgi9opLN5Vqc","pdfSize":"1112202"}
