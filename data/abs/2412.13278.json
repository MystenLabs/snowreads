Here we report a\nstrategic approach to determine the effect of lattice dynamics on spin\ncoherence lifetimes using oxygen deficient double perovskites as host\nmaterials. In addition to obtaining millisecond $T_1$ spin-lattice lifetimes at\nT ~ 10 K, measurable quantum superpositions were observed up to room\ntemperature. We determine that $T_2$ enhancement in $Sr_2CaWO_{6-\\delta}$ over\npreviously studied $Ba_2CaWO_{6-\\delta}$ is caused by a dynamically-driven\nincrease in effective site symmetry around the dominant paramagnetic site,\nassigned as $W^{5+}$ via electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Further,\na combination of experimental and computational techniques enabled\nquantification of the relative strength of spin-phonon coupling of each phonon\nmode. This analysis demonstrates the effect of thermodynamics and site symmetry\non the spin lifetimes of $W^{5+}$ paramagnetic defects, an important step in\nthe process of reducing decoherence to produce longer-lived qubits.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"u3KmffZcQdVWIiRUl-3TKRHchVeMDIu_TaeB0cqmhDo","pdfSize":"1151357"}
