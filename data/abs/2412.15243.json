A key distinction is that classical uncertainty\nquantification takes the form of precise probabilities and offers only limited\nlarge-sample validity guarantees, whereas the IM's uncertainty quantification\nis imprecise in such a way that exact, finite-sample valid inference is\npossible. But is the IM's imprecision and finite-sample validity compatible\nwith statistical efficiency? That is, can IMs be both finite-sample valid and\nasymptotically efficient? This paper gives an affirmative answer to this\nquestion via a new possibilistic Bernstein--von Mises theorem that parallels a\nfundamental Bayesian result. Among other things, our result shows that the IM\nsolution is efficient in the sense that, asymptotically, its credal set is the\nsmallest that contains the Gaussian distribution with variance equal to the\nCramer--Rao lower bound. Moreover, a corresponding version of this new\nBernstein--von Mises theorem is presented for problems that involve the\nelimination of nuisance parameters, which settles an open question concerning\nthe relative efficiency of profiling-based versus extension-based\nmarginalization strategies.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-fMTGJXsPptBTZjx0MzfGuQAUFg1wYcB0ELjGL2pq80","pdfSize":"817227"}
