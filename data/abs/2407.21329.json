It\nis shown that the so-called Goon and Penco (univeral) relation is also valid\nfor accelerating black holes. Furthermore, it is found that an appropriate\nmatching condition is necessary between the perturbation parameter of the\nrelation with the perturbative correction to such black holes, and the\nparameter with information about the conical deficits on the north and south\npoles with the cosmic string tensions in order to satisfy the extremality\nrelations. This result indicates that the extremality (univeral) relation of a\nclass of accelerating black holes holds exhibit behavior similar to the Weak\nGravity Conjecture.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"T0mk-UEFLYYzAj_IpPkHDufSxe9GX8O2pE3Kl3NsyvQ","pdfSize":"1040281","objectId":"0xd76bce56c0a1cfafe6b3872217c8907fb1b62edc5420780d3a82e17b3c719792","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
