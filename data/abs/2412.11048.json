In\n\\cite{EEHK09}, the authors studied a special case involving specific\none-parameter families of Jacobians of curves using analytic methods. We\ngeneralize their results, particularly Theorem B, to all families of abelian\nvarieties with big geometric monodromy, employing an arithmetic approach. Our\nmethod applies Heath-Brown-type bounds on certain covers with level structures\nand optimizes the covers to derive the desired results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LVjzaEPIt5-YmSs3c7r3s-tpAO47EA15sldfMz4IsCQ","pdfSize":"188321"}
