Instead of sidewise motion of\ndomains with opposite direction of polarization of ferroelectric crystals, in\nFNLCs the polarization vector that at zero field aligns parallel to the\nsubstrates, rotates toward the applied electric field. In spite of that\ndifference, the observed switching time per unit electric field values are\ncomparable. Although current FNLCs have much larger electric conductivity than\nof ferroelectric crystals, they have several advantages: they are organic,\nlightweight, can be prepared and operated at ambient temperature, the direction\nof the polarization can be set by simple surface alignment, and they require\nmuch less electric field for switching of the polarization. These properties\nmake FNLCs attractive to test them in in flexible organic electrochemical\ntransistor (OECT) devices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"F86DlRHg0lKrB6lMjc-js3DgyDfN1Mas_9cCNiMFZKM","pdfSize":"5119211"}
