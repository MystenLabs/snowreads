The unstable\nparticles are assumed to undergo a 2-body decay into a massless and massive\ndaughter. We assume, that a fraction $f$ of the total dark matter budget to be,\nunstable and quantify the decay using the life-time $\\Gamma^{-1}$ and the\nrelative mass splitting $\\epsilon$ between the parent and the massive daughter.\nThe redshift space anisotropic power spectrum of the post-reionization 21-cm\nsignal brightness temperature, as a tracer of the dark matter clustering,\nimprints the decaying dark matter model through its effect on background\nevolution and the suppression of power on small scales.We find that with an\nidealized futuristic intensity mapping experiment with a SKA-I Mid like\nradio-array, $\\epsilon$ and $\\Gamma$ can be measured at $3.1\\%$ and $4.64\\%$\naround their fiducial values of $\\epsilon = 0.01 $ and $\\Gamma = 0.074 {\\rm\nGyr}^{-1}$ respectively.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VOTflG0tLrOftx3TJidcwj9wao6k9Vp4bYN5_lA_YrM","pdfSize":"2276270"}
