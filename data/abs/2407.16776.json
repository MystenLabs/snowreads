We show vector valued estimates, in the sense of\nFefferman-Stein inequalities, for such operators. These are proven using an\nextrapolation result for convex body valued functions due to Bownik and\nCruz-Uribe. Finally, we show an $\\mathrm{H}^1$-$\\mathrm{BMO}$ duality for\nmatrix valued functions and we apply the previous vector valued estimates to\nshow upper bounds for biparameter paraproducts.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lJdN_ZzGalKoZTg_28Vxna2U6jxiPW0JDvwXyT4xtlo","pdfSize":"441767"}
