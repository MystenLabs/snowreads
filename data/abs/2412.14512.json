  "abstract": "  We study a non-exchangeable multi-agent system and rigorously derive a strong\nform of the mean-field limit. The convergence of the connection weights and the\ninitial data implies convergence of large-scale dynamics toward a deterministic\nlimit given by the corresponding extended Vlasov PDE, at any later time and any\nrealization of randomness. This is established on what we call a bi-coupling\ndistance defined through a convex optimization problem, which is an\ninterpolation of the optimal transport between measures and the fractional\noverlay between graphs. The proof relies on a quantitative stability estimate\nof the so-called observables, which are tensorizations of agent laws and graph\nhomomorphism densities. This reveals a profound relationship between mean-field\ntheory and graph limiting theory, intersecting in the study of non-exchangeable\nsystems.\n",
