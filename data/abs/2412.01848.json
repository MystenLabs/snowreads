These equations are exact and yield the exact\nthree-particle vertex, if we knew the three-particle vertex irreducible in one\nof the ten channels. However, as we do not have this three-particle irreducible\nvertex at hand, we approximate this building block for the ladder by the sum of\ntwo-particle irreducible vertices each connecting two fermionic lines. The\ncomparison to the exact solution shows that this approximation is only good for\nrather weak interactions and even than only qualitatively - at least for the\nnon-linear response function analyzed.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BsVxeusl1ehOgPtmz6SNmKg8bV6nicvV-QUJlhtVfPw","pdfSize":"2316915"}
