The phase equation, which is a Riccati-type non-linear differential\nequation, is coupled with the Variational Monte Carlo method. Comparisons\nbetween the resulting SPS for various $\\ell$ channels and experimental data are\nmade using mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) as a cost function. Model\nparameters are fine-tuned through an appropriate optimization technique to\nminimize MAPE. The results for $\\ell=0^+$, $2^+$, and $4^+$ partial waves are\ngenerated to align with experimental SPS with mean absolute error (MAE)\ncalculated with respect to experimental data is 3.19, 8.74, 13.06 respectively\ncorresponding to real part and 0.76, 0.76, 0.59 corresponding to imaginary\nparts of scattering phase shifts.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VHOyb-NNxGLjS2QNJSTE3PGQaaUkQ9VaF-NWLzCv-ys","pdfSize":"2566042"}
