  "abstract": "  The ubiquity of networking infrastructure in modern life necessitates\nscrutiny into networking fundamentals to ensure the safety and security of that\ninfrastructure. The formalization of concurrent algorithms, a cornerstone of\nnetworking, is a longstanding area of research in which models and frameworks\ndescribing distributed systems are established. Despite its long history of\nstudy, the challenge of concisely representing and verifying concurrent\nalgorithms remains unresolved. Existing formalisms, while powerful, often fail\nto capture the dynamic nature of real-world concurrency in a manner that is\nboth comprehensive and scalable. This paper explores the evolution of formal\nmodels of concurrency over time, investigating their generality and utility for\nreasoning about real-world networking programs. Four foundational papers on\nformal concurrency are considered: Hoare's Parallel programming: An axiomatic\napproach, Milner's A Calculus of Mobile Processes, O'Hearn's Resources,\nConcurrency and Local Reasoning, and the recent development of Coq's Iris\nframework.\n",
