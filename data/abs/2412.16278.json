  "abstract": "  The efficiency of planet formation is a fundamental question in planetary\nscience, gaining increasing significance as observational data from\nplanet-forming disks accumulates. Here we derive from first principles a\ncorrelation between the planet formation rate (PFR) and the gas surface\ndensity, i.e. $\\rm{PFR}\\propto \\Sigma_g^n$. This relation serves as an analog\nfor the well-established Kennicutt-Schmidt law for star-forming galaxies. We\nstudy the different planet formation mechanisms and the density dependence in\neach one of them, to finally formulate a simple relation. We find that the\npowerlaw ranges between $n\\approx 4/3-2$, depending on the type of the forming\nplanet, when we carry out different analyses for the formation rates of\nterrestrial planets, gas giants, and also planets formed by gravitational\ninstability. We then compare our results with the available observational data.\nThe relation we derive here aims to shed more light on the interpretation of\nobservational data as well as analytical models, and give a new perspective on\nthe properties of planet formation and its connection to gas.\n",
