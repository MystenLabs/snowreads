Nonetheless, it is often difficult to obtain such nonlinear features.\nTo address this difficulty, recent progress has been made in integrating\nmeta-learning with adaptive control to learn such nonlinear features from data.\nHowever, these meta-learning-based control methods rely on classical adaptation\nlaws using gradient descent, which is confined to the Euclidean geometry. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel method that combines meta-learning and\nadaptation laws based on mirror descent, a popular generalization of gradient\ndescent, which takes advantage of the potentially non-Euclidean geometry of the\nparameter space. In our approach, meta-learning not only learns the nonlinear\nfeatures but also searches for a suitable mirror-descent potential function\nthat optimizes control performance. Through numerical simulations, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in learning efficient\nrepresentations and real-time tracking control performance under uncertain\ndynamics.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EEFGUPE8wJtepBbuQomrlXiooRf-D5IUAKF7U-c0d7g","pdfSize":"874920"}
