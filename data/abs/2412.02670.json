  "abstract": "  The last decade has seen a number of advances in computationally efficient\nalgorithms for statistical methods subject to robustness constraints. An\nestimator may be robust in a number of different ways: to contamination of the\ndataset, to heavy-tailed data, or in the sense that it preserves privacy of the\ndataset. We survey recent results in these areas with a focus on the problem of\nmean estimation, drawing technical and conceptual connections between the\nvarious forms of robustness, showing that the same underlying algorithmic ideas\nlead to computationally efficient estimators in all these settings.\n",
