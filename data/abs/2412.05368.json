The underlying\nfunction space is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space with a Gaussian kernel of\ntensor product form. In the infinite-variate case, for both computational\nproblems, we establish matching upper and lower bounds for the polynomial\nconvergence rate of the $n$-th minimal error. In the multivariate case, we\nimprove several tractability results for the integration problem. For the\nproofs, we establish the following transference result together with an\nexplicit construction: Each of the computational problems on a space with a\nGaussian kernel is equivalent on the level of algorithms to the same problem on\na Hermite space with suitable parameters.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vmS-AEOs7-zdUfpF6Ux8HBp7C5cDfSBB_2iH31xCA0o","pdfSize":"380434"}
