Creating personalized, engaging, and effective learning\nexperiences are continuously evolving challenges in music education. Here we\npresent two case studies using such advances in music technology to address\nthese challenges. In our first case study we showcase an application that uses\nAutomatic Chord Recognition to generate personalized exercises from audio\ntracks, connecting traditional ear training with real-world musical contexts.\nIn the second case study we prototype adaptive piano method books that use\nAutomatic Music Transcription to generate exercises at different skill levels\nwhile retaining a close connection to musical interests. These applications\ndemonstrate how recent AI developments can democratize access to high-quality\nmusic education and promote rich interaction with music in the age of\ngenerative AI. We hope this work inspires other efforts in the community, aimed\nat removing barriers to access to high-quality music education and fostering\nhuman participation in musical expression.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Sound","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"BFqITwkAXtVIZAiSy_L7IkvbqRQ1qsRhLYl3fnzhu_M","pdfSize":"808360"}
