Contrary to common expectations that it\nis the most massive stars that produce the most massive BHs, we find that the\nmaximum $M_{\\rm BH}^{\\rm Max} \\simeq 30 \\pm 10\\,M_{\\odot}$ is found in the\ncanonical intermediate range between $M_{\\rm ZAMS} \\simeq 30$ and\n$50\\,M_{\\odot}$ instead. The prime reason for this seemingly counter-intuitive\nfinding is that very massive stars (VMS) have increasingly high mass-loss\nrates, leading to substantial mass evaporation before they expire as stars,\nending as lighter BHs than their canonical O-star counterparts.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NmOTP7QpkuXUVv3BuvEFghzqpDB2psOHureZrfDqyjY","pdfSize":"360404"}
