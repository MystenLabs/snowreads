Despite the recent surge\nin topology-aware methods addressing this challenge, their real-world\napplicability is hindered by flawed benchmarking practices. In this paper, we\nidentify critical pitfalls in model evaluation that include inadequate\nconnectivity choices, overlooked topological artifacts in ground truth\nannotations, and inappropriate use of evaluation metrics. Through detailed\nempirical analysis, we uncover these issues' profound impact on the evaluation\nand ranking of segmentation methods. Drawing from our findings, we propose a\nset of actionable recommendations to establish fair and robust evaluation\nstandards for topology-aware medical image segmentation methods.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Q0ILESVT9vk2byO0VzEj63wv675wMCJM1dIw_XMypPs","pdfSize":"4704707"}
