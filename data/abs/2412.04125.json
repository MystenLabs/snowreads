First, the distribution is obtained\nexperimentally in a 65-nm CMOS device. As this distribution cannot be\nreproduced by electrical simulation, we explore the use of an alternative\nparameter defined as the distance between the origin and the separatrix in the\nbit-cell state space to quantify the mismatch of the cell. The resulting\ndistribution of this parameter obtained from Monte Carlo simulations is then\nrelated to the start-up probability distribution using a two-component logistic\nfunction. The reported results show that the proposed imbalance factor is a\ngood predictor for PUF-related reliability estimation with the advantage that\ncan be applied at the early design stages.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4XL_99B81bAR9mjmAxZafxCGrnzs8gKj8wUhhO_WV9s","pdfSize":"1333926"}
