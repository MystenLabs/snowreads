This work presents a novel\nPotential-free Data-driven Molecular Dynamics (PDMD) framework for predicting\nsystem energy and atomic forces of variable-sized water clusters. Specifically,\nPDMD employs the smooth overlap of atomic positions descriptor to generate\nhigh-dimensional, equivariant features before leveraging ChemGNN, a graph\nneural network model that adaptively learns the atomic chemical environments\nwithout requiring a priori knowledge. Through an iterative self-consistent\ntraining approach, the converged PDMD achieves a mean absolute error of 7.1\nmeV/atom for energy and 59.8 meV/angstrom for forces, outperforming the\nstate-of-the-art DeepMD by ~80% in energy accuracy and ~200% in force\nprediction. As a result, PDMD can reproduce the ab initio MD properties of\nwater clusters at a tiny fraction of its computational cost. These results\ndemonstrate that the proposed PDMD offers multiple-phase predictive power,\nenabling ultra-fast, general-purpose MD simulations while retaining ab initio\naccuracy.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"l-mUhaEOS_kFoPczm_iwg5usBUrUX6fPOsH6jWqBiIs","pdfSize":"8299779"}
