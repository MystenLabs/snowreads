  "abstract": "  In this paper, we study the existence, uniqueness and comparison theorems for\nthe bounded solutions and unbounded solutions of reflected backward stochastic\ndifferential equations (RBSDEs) and backward stochastic differential equations\n(BSDEs), whose generators have a one-sided growth restriction on $y$ and a\ngeneral quadratic growth in $z$, and whose solutions $Y_t$ (and obstacles) take\nvalues in $(a,\\infty)$ with $a\\geq-\\infty$. The existence of solutions was\nobtained mainly by using the methods from Essaky and Hassani (2011) and Bahlali\net al. (2017), and some well-posedness results of ODEs. We provide a method for\nthe uniqueness of solutions of such RBSDEs and BSDEs, whose generators satisfy\na $\\theta$-domination condition. This condition contains the generators which\nare convex in $(y,z)$ or are (locally) Lipschitz in $y$ and convex in $z$, and\nsome generators which are not convex. Our method relies on the\n$\\theta$-difference technique borrowed from Briand and Hu (2008), and some\ncomparison arguments based on RBSDEs. We also provide a method to study the\ncomparison theorems for such RBSDEs and BSDEs.\n",
