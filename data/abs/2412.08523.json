The flavor bounds are derived for a\nsymmetry-conserving scenario, and the most powerful constraints are originating\nfrom the neutral meson mixing observable $C_{\\eps_K}$ pushing the scale\n$\\Lambda$ around $10^4$ TeV. The masses of ALPs $a_2$ and $a_6$ are excluded in\nthe ranges $12-10^7$ eV and $2 \\times 10^2 - 10^7$ eV, respectively in the\nsymmetry-conserving scenario. The collider phenomenology is conducted for the\nsoft-symmetry breaking scenario, where the pseudoscalar $a_3$ can account for\nthe 95.4 GeV di-photon excess reported by the LHC. The scalars $h_i$, in\nparticular, scalars $h_1, h_2, h_4,h_5$, and $h_6$ are within the reach of the\nhigh-luminosity LHC, high-energy LHC, and a 100 TeV collider such as FCC-hh.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gQZHvalE3MVMHIDFuMe3ftiAm5mv0NnJi2w7YdhochQ","pdfSize":"9108167"}
