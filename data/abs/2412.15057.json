The\napproximation is in the sense of Le Cam's deficiency distance $\\Delta $; the\nmodels are then asymptotically equivalent for all purposes of statistical\ndecision with bounded loss. Our result concerns a sequence of independent but\nnot identically distributed observations with each distribution in the same\nreal-indexed exponential family. The canonical parameter is a value $f(t_i)$ of\na regression function $f$ at a grid point $t_i$ (nonparametric GLM). When $f$\nis in a H\\\"{o}lder ball with exponent $\\beta >\\frac 12 ,$ we establish global\nasymptotic equivalence to observations of a signal $\\Gamma (f(t))$ in Gaussian\nwhite noise, where $\\Gamma $ is related to a variance stabilizing\ntransformation in the exponential family. The result is a regression analog of\nthe recently established Gaussian approximation for the i.i.d. model. The proof\nis based on a functional version of the Hungarian construction for the partial\nsum process.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"IAWDG0yVFsmfeuwkmxJJezLsG5eyc1em4vXFW6xyTv4","pdfSize":"335964"}
