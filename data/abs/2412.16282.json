Instead of focusing solely on\nfitting data with phenomenological parameters, we systematically delineate\nsimple, underlying dark sector (DS) models at the microscopic, Lagrangian level\nand uncover the conditions required to yield the GW spectrum observed by PTAs.\nWe also illustrate the possibilities of the DS cosmology, which may include a\ndark matter candidate with a $\\mathcal{O}$(MeV) mass.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"hxqHEwtlWEnbG793nqfUgGrTgg1BqwOs28rzALAg4UU","pdfSize":"1499295"}
