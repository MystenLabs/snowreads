The existing limits on higgsino mass are much\nweaker compared to its bino and wino counterparts. This leaves a large chunk of\nsub-TeV supersymmetric parameter space unexplored so far. In this work, we\nexplore the possibility of probing higgsino masses in the 400 - 1000 GeV range.\nWe consider a simplified supersymmetric scenario where R-Parity is violated\nthrough a baryon number violating trilinear coupling. We adopt a machine\nlearning-based top tagger to tag the boosted top jets originating from\nhiggsinos, and for our collider analysis, we use a BDT classifier to\ndiscriminate signal over SM backgrounds. We construct two signal regions\ncharacterized by at least one top jet and different multiplicities of $b$-jets\nand light jets. Combining the statistical significance obtained from the two\nsignal regions, we show that higgsino mass as high as 925 GeV can be probed at\nthe high luminosity LHC.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DPJjSfRKCDPyY0SDkMQFpqMRBGfXhZSTq7DeZCt4A4U","pdfSize":"3021405"}
