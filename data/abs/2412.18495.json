  "abstract": "  Simultaneous speech-to-text translation (SimulST) translates source-language\nspeech into target-language text concurrently with the speaker's speech,\nensuring low latency for better user comprehension. Despite its intended\napplication to unbounded speech, most research has focused on human\npre-segmented speech, simplifying the task and overlooking significant\nchallenges. This narrow focus, coupled with widespread terminological\ninconsistencies, is limiting the applicability of research outcomes to\nreal-world applications, ultimately hindering progress in the field. Our\nextensive literature review of 110 papers not only reveals these critical\nissues in current research but also serves as the foundation for our key\ncontributions. We 1) define the steps and core components of a SimulST system,\nproposing a standardized terminology and taxonomy; 2) conduct a thorough\nanalysis of community trends, and 3) offer concrete recommendations and future\ndirections to bridge the gaps in existing literature, from evaluation\nframeworks to system architectures, for advancing the field towards more\nrealistic and effective SimulST solutions.\n",
