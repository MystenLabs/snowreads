Here we introduce directed transit function as the directed\nanalogue on directed structures such as posets and directed graphs. We first\nshow that betweenness in posets can be expressed by means of a simple set of\nfirst order axioms. Similar characterizations can be obtained for graphs with\nnatural partial orders, in particular, forests, trees, and mangroves. Relaxing\nthe acyclicity conditions leads to a generalization of the well-known geometric\ntransit function to the directed structures. Moreover, we discuss some\nproperties of the directed analogues of prominent transit functions, including\nthe all-paths, induced paths, and shortest paths (or interval) transit\nfunctions. Finally we point out some open questions and directions for future\nwork.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"VbmAFT0q1d_Hgt3xcU-35jmoOgAfdTISUXORBj9fB60","pdfSize":"322532","objectId":"0x662ef96478c32aeaea36bb08804d80054d1dfd8b29ea1dadbfa2f2a54941673a","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
