  "abstract": "  Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance in textual\nunderstanding and tabular reasoning tasks. However, their ability to comprehend\nand analyze hybrid text, containing textual and tabular data, remains\nunexplored. The hybrid text often appears in the form of hybrid long documents\n(HLDs), which far exceed the token limit of LLMs. Consequently, we apply an\nAutomated Information Extraction framework (AIE) to enable LLMs to process the\nHLDs and carry out experiments to analyse four important aspects of information\nextraction from HLDs. Given the findings: 1) The effective way to select and\nsummarize the useful part of a HLD. 2) An easy table serialization way is\nenough for LLMs to understand tables. 3) The naive AIE has adaptability in many\ncomplex scenarios. 4) The useful prompt engineering to enhance LLMs on HLDs. To\naddress the issue of dataset scarcity in HLDs and support future work, we also\npropose the Financial Reports Numerical Extraction (FINE) dataset. The dataset\nand code are publicly available in the attachments.\n",
