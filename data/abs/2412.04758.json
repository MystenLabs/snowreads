Measuring goal-directedness is important, as it is\na critical element of many concerns about harm from AI. It is also of\nphilosophical interest, as goal-directedness is a key aspect of agency. MEG is\nbased on an adaptation of the maximum causal entropy framework used in inverse\nreinforcement learning. It can measure goal-directedness with respect to a\nknown utility function, a hypothesis class of utility functions, or a set of\nrandom variables. We prove that MEG satisfies several desiderata and\ndemonstrate our algorithms with small-scale experiments.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DKfSpiSod2vFeSIZ-CWdeYXsocHPIfl_WE3Lz6Hpa70","pdfSize":"599901"}
