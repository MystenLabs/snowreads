We show\nthat the natural projection of a measure with symbolic local dimension greater\nthan 1 at every point is absolutely continuous with H\\\"older continuous density\nalmost surely. In particular, if the similarity dimension is greater than 1\nthen the random self-similar set on the line contains an interior point almost\nsurely.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-T4sNV76M4DbjFigcV9wUICyRlOO4kdZy571dZo2sTU","pdfSize":"178229"}
