Adv. 6, eaay4929 (2020)). The shuttling\nschedule needed to implement this gate is only marginally more complex than is\nrequired for implementing the standard 2D surface code in this architecture. We\ncompare the resource cost of this operation with the cost of magic state\ndistillation and find that, at present, this comparison is heavily in favour of\ndistillation. The high cost of the non-Clifford gate is almost entirely due to\nthe relatively low performance of the just-in-time decoder used as part of this\nprocess, which necessitates very large code distances in order to achieve\nsuitably low logical error rates. We argue that, as very little attention has\npreviously been given to the study and optimisation of these decoders, there\nare potentially significant improvements to be made in this area.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"buVNSiVcoRzM1Gv9gPeYqXd4JKMCSvL9SRQeEVKLWyA","pdfSize":"5049778"}
