The assumption of within group\nhomogeneity is prevalent in this literature, implying that the formation of\ngroups alleviates cross-sectional heterogeneity, regardless of the prior\nknowledge of groups. While the latter hypothesis makes inference powerful, it\ncan be often restrictive. We allow for models with richer heterogeneity that\ncan be found both in the cross-section and within a group, without imposing the\nsimple assumption that all groups must be heterogeneous. We further contribute\nto the method proposed by \\cite{su2016identifying}, by showing that the model\nparameters can be consistently estimated and the groups, while unknown, can be\nidentifiable in the presence of different types of heterogeneity. Within the\nsame framework we consider the validity of assuming both cross-sectional and\nwithin group homogeneity, using testing procedures. Simulations demonstrate\ngood finite-sample performance of the approach in both classification and\nestimation, while empirical applications across several datasets provide\nevidence of multiple clusters, as well as reject the hypothesis of within group\nhomogeneity.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"2MBpp9ftqirayZ027oIm2KB2YbfwYSVcC0_vT8VkWbw","pdfSize":"507441"}
