  "abstract": "  We show theoretically that it is possible to coherently transfer vibrational\nexcitation between trapped neutral atoms over a micrometer apart. To this end\nwe consider three atoms, where two are in the electronic ground state and one\nis excited to a Rydberg state whose electronic orbital overlaps with the\npositional wave functions of the two ground-state atoms. The resulting\nscattering of the Rydberg electron with the ground-state atoms provides the\ninteraction required to transfer vibrational excitation from one trapped atom\nto the other. By numerically investigating the dependence of the transfer\ndynamics on the distance between traps and their relative frequencies we find\nthat there is a \"sweet spot\" where the transfer of a vibrational excitation is\nnearly perfect and fast compared to the Rydberg lifetime. We investigate the\nrobustness of this scenario with respect to changes of the parameters. In\naddition, we derive a intuitive effective Hamiltonian which explains the\nobserved dynamics.\n",
