The first\nsolution type aligns with irrelevant stress tensor flows, resembling $T\\bar{T}$\ndynamics, and the second involves a blend of irrelevant $T\\bar{T}$-like and\nmarginal root-$T\\bar{T}$-like deformations. Our approach facilitates the\ninvestigation of diverse duality-invariant nonlinear electrodynamics theories\nand their stress tensor flows and confirms the commutativity of flows initiated\nby irrelevant and marginal operators.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"AeIDXB5fHm3-NbAYGIbk6tk8oH-xeBzZwt3PGEnriig","pdfSize":"291122"}
