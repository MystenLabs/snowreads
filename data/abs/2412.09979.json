  "abstract": "  Quantum reservoirs have great potential as they utilize the complex real-time\ndissipative dynamics of quantum systems for information processing and target\ntime-series generation without precise control or fine-tuning of the\nHamiltonian parameters. Nonetheless, their realization is challenging as\nquantum hardware with appropriate dynamics, robustness to noise, and ability to\nproduce target steady states is required. To that end, we propose the\ndisordered quantum homogenizer as an alternative platform, and prove it\nsatisfies the necessary and sufficient conditions - stability and contractivity\n- of the reservoir dynamics, necessary for solving machine learning tasks with\ntime-series input data streams. The results indicate that the quantum\nhomogenization protocol, physically implementable as either nuclear magnetic\nresonance ensemble or a photonic system, can potentially function as a\nreservoir computer.\n",
