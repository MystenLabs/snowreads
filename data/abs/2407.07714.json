It is also used to understand the uncertainty\nintroduced into the measurement result when using different computational\nmodels. As measurement procedures are becoming increasingly complex with\ntechnological advancements, it is harder to establish sources of variability in\nmeasurements and understand if they stem from true differences in measurands or\nin the measurement pipelines themselves. The gamma index calculation is a\nwidely accepted metric used for the comparison of measured and predicted doses\nin radiotherapy. However, various steps in the measurement pipeline can\nintroduce variation in the measurement result. In this paper, we perform a\nsensitivity and correlation analysis to investigate the influence of various\ninput factors (i.e. setting) in gamma index calculations on the uncertainty\nintroduced in dosimetry audits. We identify a number of factors where\nstandardization will improve measurements by reducing variability in outputs.\nFurthermore, we also compare gamma index metrics and similarities across audit\nsites.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"061Ac_hDOKvuYmKngkW7uY4nJA2GoZUoONIb_efiyZc","pdfSize":"615320"}
