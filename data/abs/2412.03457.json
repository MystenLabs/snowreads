  "abstract": "  Formation of the intermediate phase patterns in the thin-film co-deposition\nprocess is simulated using the Stochastic Kinetic Mean-Field method and Monte\nCarlo. Three basic morphologies of the 2D sections are distinguished: (1) spots\n(rod-like in 3D), (2) layered structures-lamellae, zigzags, and labyrinths\n(plate-like in 3D), and (3) net-like structures (inverse to spot-like\nstructures, when spots become majority and the surrounding matrix becomes a\nminority). They are characterized and distinguished with the help of only one\nspecial topological parameter.\n",
