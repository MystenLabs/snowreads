Modern bots often become\nindistinguishable from real users, as they employ similar methods to browse the\nweb, including using real browsers. We address the challenge of bot detection\nin high-traffic scenarios by analyzing three distinct detection methods. The\nfirst method operates on heuristics, allowing for rapid detection. The second\nmethod utilizes, well known, technical features, such as IP address, window\nsize, and user agent. It serves primarily for comparison with the third method.\nIn the third method, we rely solely on browsing behavior, omitting all static\nfeatures and focusing exclusively on how clients behave on a website. In\ncontrast to related work, we evaluate our approaches using real-world\ne-commerce traffic data, comprising 40 million monthly page visits. We further\ncompare our methods against another bot detection approach, Botcha, on the same\ndataset. Our performance metrics, including precision, recall, and AUC, reach\n98 percent or higher, surpassing Botcha.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Agpxq_-VyC-QAoeMPmaasOgseDhm4mGh3ylUjBwtehA","pdfSize":"421133"}
