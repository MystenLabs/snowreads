Nominal unification is decidable and unitary,\nhowever, its extension with equational axioms such as Commutativity (which is\nfinitary) is no longer finitary unless permutation fixed-point constraints are\nused. In this paper, we extend the notion of nominal algebra by introducing\nfixed-point constraints and provide a sound semantics using strong nominal\nsets. We show, by providing a counter-example, that the class of nominal sets\nis not a sound denotation for this extended nominal algebra. To recover\nsoundness we propose two different formulations of nominal algebra, one\nobtained by restricting to a class of fixed-point contexts that are in direct\ncorrespondence with freshness contexts and another obtained by using a\ndifferent set of derivation rules.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nYcTLGtTKSGJE_jYTZxL6QCtRMpQWDXC-utUaQzMbv8","pdfSize":"325916","objectId":"0xf13ced98456331574e5fec7b1ab3ee7d55a454aec4055b60d360765a3655ae90","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
