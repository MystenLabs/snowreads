In this measurement quantum back action, which perturbs\nthe evolution of a mechanical oscillator, can be completely removed in a broad\ndetection frequency band after post-processing. The measurement is performed by\noptical pumping of the central optical mode and analyzing the light escaping\nthe two other optical modes, which have the frequency separation with the\ncentral mode equal to the mechanical frequency. To realize such a scheme in\npractice one either needs to use a very long optical interferometer or should\nutilize optical modes belonging to different mode families. In the second case\nthe modes have different geometries and their coupling with the mechanical mode\nis not identical. Here we analyze a general case of the non-symmetric\nmeasurement scheme, in which the coupling strengths with the light modes are\nnot equal to each other, and take into account optical losses. We found that\nthe back action can be completely excluded from the measurement result in the\ncase of the asymmetric lossless system. The nonzero loss limits the\nsensitivity. An experimental implementation of the proposed scheme is\ndiscussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"j5RL9-wi9YfLBDzmULTHRG1-oPdIniMwIpaCmVUhJKY","pdfSize":"699737"}
