However, this interconnected ecosystem faces significant\nvulnerabilities with the advent of quantum computing, which threatens to break\nexisting encryption standards protecting sensitive patient data in IoT-enabled\nmedical devices. This chapter examines the quantum threat to healthcare IoT\nsecurity, highlighting the potential impacts of compromised encryption,\nincluding privacy breaches, device failures, and manipulated medical records.\nIt introduces post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and quantum-resistant techniques\nlike quantum key distribution (QKD), addressing their application in\nresource-constrained healthcare IoT devices such as pacemakers, monitoring\ntools, and telemedicine systems. The chapter further explores the challenges of\nintegrating these solutions and reviews global efforts in mitigating quantum\nrisks, offering insights into suitable PQC primitives for various healthcare\nuse cases.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HY_41tQ2WQuBGJfnFgG8S-oTf7MCOMJh_gxudZDTT64","pdfSize":"809748"}
