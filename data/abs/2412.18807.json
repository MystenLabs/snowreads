This formulation is well-suited for scenarios\nwhere straightforward iterative diagonalization becomes challenging, especially\nwhen the Aufbau principle is not applicable. We present the theoretical\nfoundation and numerical implementation of the Riemannian conjugate gradient\n(RCG) within a localized non-orthogonal basis set. Riemannian\nBroyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (RBFGS) method is tentatively implemented.\nExtensive testing compares the performance of the proposed RCG method with the\ntraditional self-consistent field (SCF) algorithm and shows that it is less\nefficient. For molecular systems, the RBFGS method requires a computing time\ncomparable to that of SCF calculations. However, for extended systems these\nmethods require much more iterations compared to SCF. Preconditioning can\npotentially improve its efficiency, especially for metallic systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"csBaho8eiw7Ydz1IgT8GfWWs69IRcgNOsSs7SGCTzAs","pdfSize":"504572"}
