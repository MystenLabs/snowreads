  "abstract": "  Modern robotic perception is highly dependent on neural networks. It is well\nknown that neural network-based perception can be unreliable in real-world\ndeployment, especially in difficult imaging conditions. Out-of-distribution\ndetection is commonly proposed as a solution for ensuring reliability in\nreal-world deployment. Previous work has shown that normalizing flow models can\nbe used for out-of-distribution detection to improve reliability of robotic\nperception tasks. Specifically, camera parameters can be optimized with respect\nto the likelihood output from a normalizing flow, which allows a perception\nsystem to adapt to difficult vision scenarios. With this work we propose to use\nthe absolute gradient values from a normalizing flow, which allows the\nperception system to optimize local regions rather than the whole image. By\nsetting up a table top picking experiment with exceptionally difficult lighting\nconditions, we show that our method achieves a 60% higher success rate for an\nobject detection task compared to previous methods.\n",
