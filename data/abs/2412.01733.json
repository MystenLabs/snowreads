  "abstract": "  Modeling of collisionless galactic systems is based on the N-body model,\nwhich requires large computational resources due to the long-range nature of\ngravitational forces. The most common method for calculating gravity is the\nTreeCode algorithm, which provides a faster calculation of the force compared\nto the direct summation of contributions from all particles for N-body\nsimulation. An analysis of the computational efficiency is performed for models\nwith the number of particles up to $10^{8}$. We considered several processors\nwith different architectures in order to determine the performance of parallel\nsimulations based on the OpenMP standard. An analysis of the use of extra\nthreads in addition to physical cores shows an increase in simulation\nperformance only when all logical threads are loaded, which doubles the total\nnumber of threads. This gives an increase in the efficiency of parallel\ncomputing by 20 percent on average.\n",
