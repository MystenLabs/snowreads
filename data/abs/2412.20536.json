  "abstract": "  We use Brownian dynamics simulations and theory to study the over-damped\nspatiotemporal dynamics and pattern formation in a fluid-permeated array of\nequally spaced, active, elastic filaments that are pinned at one end and free\nat the other. The filaments are modeled as connected colloidal chains with\nactivity incorporated via compressive follower forces acting along the filament\nbackbone. The length of the chains is smaller than the thermal persistence\nlength. For a range of filament separation and activity values, we find that\nthe filament array eventually self-assembles into a series of regularly spaced,\nkinetically arrested, compact clusters. Filament activity, geometry,\nelasticity, and grafting density are each seen to crucially influence the size,\nshape, and spacing of emergent clusters. Furthermore, cluster shapes for\ndifferent grafting densities can be rescaled into self-similar forms with\nactivity-dependent scaling exponents. We derive theoretical expressions that\nrelate the number of filaments in a cluster and the spacing between clusters,\nto filament activity, filament elasticity, and grafting density. Our results\nprovide insight into the physical mechanisms involved in the initiation of\nclustering and suggest that steric contact forces and friction balance active\nforces and filament elasticity to stabilize the clusters. Our simulations\nsuggest design principles to realize filament-based clusters and similar\nself-assembling biomimetic materials using active colloids or synthetic\nmicrotubule-motor systems.\n",
