In this work, we address this\ntopic by computing the spin and longitudinal momentum entanglement of each\nparton inside the proton. The utilized wave functions are generated using Basis\nLight-front Quantization (BLFQ), incorporating both the valence quarks and one\ndynamical gluon Fock sectors, $\\left|qqq\\right\\rangle$ and\n$\\left|qqq\\right\\rangle +\\left|qqqg\\right\\rangle$. Our calculations indicate\nthat the dynamical gluon significantly enhances entanglement among the proton's\npartons. Additionally, we examine the spin entanglement of quarks and gluons at\nfixed values of longitudinal momentum fraction, revealing that the presence of\na gluon may amplify the informational exchanges between quarks. Finally, these\nfindings suggest the potential for experimental verification of the\nentanglement between partons by measuring parton helicity distributions in the\nproton.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qBSdJiuPGysZvgupSAV6vBta_BzUiWEzE7SdF7ffebM","pdfSize":"640772"}
