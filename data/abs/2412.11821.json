Performance using quantum\nsuperposition in clocks, information processors, communication networks, and\nsensors depends on careful state and external field selection to lower\nsensitivity to longitudinal noise. In many cases time varying external control\nfields--such as the Hahn echo sequence originally developed for nuclear\nmagnetic resonance applications--can passively correct for longitudinal errors.\nThere also exist continuous versions of passive correction called continuous\ndynamical decoupling (CDD), or spin-locking depending on context. However,\ntreating quantum systems under CDD as qubits has not been well explored. Here,\nwe develop universal single-qubit gates that are ``fast'' relative to\nperturbative Rabi gates and applicable to any CDD qubit architecture. We\ndemonstrate single-qubit gates with fidelity $\\mathcal{F}=0.9947(1)$ on a\nfrequency tunable CDD transmon superconducting circuit operated where it is\nstrongly sensitive to longitudinal noise, thus establishing this technique as a\npotentially useful tool for operating qubits in applications requiring high\nfidelity under non-ideal conditions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"85q0EW1TiSW9-rnFgE4ftSNGeriTD2uKduCdThb0-tE","pdfSize":"3301081"}
