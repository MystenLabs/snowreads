In the first\npart, we use complex interpolation theory to treat generators $L$ and $A$ of\ncontraction semigroups on Banach spaces, with $L$ relatively $A$-bounded. In\nthe second part, we study unitary dynamics on Hilbert spaces and develop a new\ntechnique based on the concept of energy constraints. Our results provide a\ncomplete picture of the convergence rates for the Trotter splitting for all\ncommon types of Schr\\\"odinger and Dirac operators, including singular,\nconfining and magnetic vector potentials, as well as molecular many-body\nHamiltonians in dimension $d=3$. Using the Brezis-Mironescu inequality, we\nderive convergence rates for the Schr\\\"odinger operator with $V(x)=\\pm\n|x|^{-a}$ potential. In each case, our conditions are fully explicit.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lJpFn7yGqZXXmWYHze14SL7CLBRIqV3aH5MvGMk3mWk","pdfSize":"1246949"}
