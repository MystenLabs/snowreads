  "abstract": "  This paper investigates the non-zero-sum linear-quadratic stochastic\nStackelberg differential games with affine constraints, which depend on both\nthe follower's response and the leader's strategy. With the help of the\nstochastic Riccati equations and the Lagrangian duality theory, the feedback\nexpressions of optimal strategies of the follower and the leader are obtained\nand the dual problem of the leader's problem is established. Under the Slater\ncondition, the equivalence is proved between the solutions to the dual problem\nand the leader's problem, and the KKT condition is also provided for solving\nthe dual problem. Then, the feedback Stackelberg equilibrium is provided for\nthe linear-quadratic stochastic Stackelberg differential games with affine\nconstraints, and a new positive definite condition is proposed for ensuring the\nuniqueness of solutions to the dual problem. Finally, two non-degenerate\nexamples with indefinite coefficients are provided to illustrate and to support\nour main results.\n",
