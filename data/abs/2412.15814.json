Despite their growing prominence, many\nstablecoins have struggled to consistently meet stability expectations, and\ntheir underlying mechanisms often remain opaque and challenging to analyze.\nThis paper focuses on the DAI stablecoin, which combines\ncrypto-collateralization and algorithmic mechanisms. We propose a formal\nlogic-based framework for representing the policies and operations of DAI,\nimplemented in Prolog and released as open-source software. Our framework\nenables detailed analysis and simulation of DAI's stability mechanisms,\nproviding a foundation for understanding its robustness and identifying\npotential vulnerabilities.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Cryptography and Security","Computer Science/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computer Science/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"keaYDV9R73kaVRc9AJi7cNbdSG3YFng8BmW6ZVQNw5s","pdfSize":"794930"}
