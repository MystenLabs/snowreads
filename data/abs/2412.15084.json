  "abstract": "  In this paper, we introduce AceMath, a suite of frontier math models that\nexcel in solving complex math problems, along with highly effective reward\nmodels capable of evaluating generated solutions and reliably identifying the\ncorrect ones. To develop the instruction-tuned math models, we propose a\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) process that first achieves competitive\nperformance across general domains, followed by targeted fine-tuning for the\nmath domain using a carefully curated set of prompts and synthetically\ngenerated responses. The resulting model, AceMath-72B-Instruct greatly\noutperforms Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct, GPT-4o and Claude-3.5 Sonnet. To develop\nmath-specialized reward model, we first construct AceMath-RewardBench, a\ncomprehensive and robust benchmark for evaluating math reward models across\ndiverse problems and difficulty levels. After that, we present a systematic\napproach to build our math reward models. The resulting model, AceMath-72B-RM,\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art reward models. Furthermore, when\ncombining AceMath-72B-Instruct with AceMath-72B-RM, we achieve the highest\naverage rm@8 score across the math reasoning benchmarks. We release model\nweights, training data, and evaluation benchmarks at:\nhttps://research.nvidia.com/labs/adlr/acemath\n",
