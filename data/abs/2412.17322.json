Nondiffractive beams, which keep their\nshapes invariant in the free space, feature self-splitting from the middle in\ntwo separating secondary beams, due to the light-matter interaction. The\nsplitting degree is controlled by means of a phase-pre-modulation method. We\npropose applications of the self-splitting to the creation of an effectively\nchiral waveguide and the generation of even-order vortices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"GxqOMvuvGPTFyHgK0-0Il87koPK67h9jzgTLTEMa5hc","pdfSize":"17383009"}
