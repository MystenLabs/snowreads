In this paper, we unveil a fresh\napproach that blends state-space modeling with Wasserstein geometry, paving the\nway for a more fluid and coherent representation of dynamic scenes. We\nintroduce a State Consistency Filter that merges prior predictions with the\ncurrent observations, enabling Gaussians to stay true to their way over time.\nWe also employ Wasserstein distance regularization to ensure smooth, consistent\nupdates of Gaussian parameters, reducing motion artifacts. Lastly, we leverage\nWasserstein geometry to capture both translational motion and shape\ndeformations, creating a more physically plausible model for dynamic scenes.\nOur approach guides Gaussians along their natural way in the Wasserstein space,\nachieving smoother, more realistic motion and stronger temporal coherence.\nExperimental results show significant improvements in rendering quality and\nefficiency, outperforming current state-of-the-art techniques.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"vINxANkY34MWF34vWgpu8uR72jfbhexbWmEewhmdPjY","pdfSize":"7911894"}
