  "abstract": "  Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) is critical for diagnosing retinal\nvascular diseases, but beginners often struggle with image interpretation. This\nstudy develops FFA Sora, a text-to-video model that converts FFA reports into\ndynamic videos via a Wavelet-Flow Variational Autoencoder (WF-VAE) and a\ndiffusion transformer (DiT). Trained on an anonymized dataset, FFA Sora\naccurately simulates disease features from the input text, as confirmed by\nobjective metrics: Frechet Video Distance (FVD) = 329.78, Learned Perceptual\nImage Patch Similarity (LPIPS) = 0.48, and Visual-question-answering Score\n(VQAScore) = 0.61. Specific evaluations showed acceptable alignment between the\ngenerated videos and textual prompts, with BERTScore of 0.35. Additionally, the\nmodel demonstrated strong privacy-preserving performance in retrieval\nevaluations, achieving an average Recall@K of 0.073. Human assessments\nindicated satisfactory visual quality, with an average score of 1.570(scale: 1\n= best, 5 = worst). This model addresses privacy concerns associated with\nsharing large-scale FFA data and enhances medical education.\n",
