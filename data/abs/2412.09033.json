  "abstract": "  We derive an integral identity for a class $p$-Laplace equation, and then\nclassify all positive finite energy cylindrically symmetric solutions of the\nequation (\\ref{1.2}) for $3\\leq k\\leq n-1,$ with the help of some a prior\nestimates. Combining this with the result of Secchi-Smets-Willem{\\cite{SSW03}},\nas a consequence, we obtain the best constant and extremal functions for the\nrelated Hardy-Sobolev-Maz'ya inequalities.\n",
