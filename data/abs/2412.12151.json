  "abstract": "  The tool-use ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) has a profound impact on\na wide range of industrial applications. However, LLMs' self-control and\ncalibration capability in appropriately using tools remains understudied. The\nproblem is consequential as it raises potential risks of degraded performance\nand poses a threat to the trustworthiness of the models. In this paper, we\nconduct a study on a family of state-of-the-art LLMs on three datasets with two\nmainstream tool-use frameworks. Our study reveals the tool-abuse behavior of\nLLMs, a tendency for models to misuse tools with overconfidence. We also find\nthat this is a common issue regardless of model capability. Accordingly, we\npropose a novel approach, \\textit{SMARTCAL}, to mitigate the observed issues,\nand our results show an average of 8.6 percent increase in the QA performance\nand a 21.6 percent decrease in Expected Calibration Error (ECE) compared to\nbaseline models.\n",
