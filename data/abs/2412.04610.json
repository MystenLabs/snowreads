  "abstract": "  This paper explores transformer-based models for music overpainting, focusing\non jazz piano variations. Music overpainting generates new variations while\npreserving the melodic and harmonic structure of the input. Existing approaches\nare limited by small datasets, restricting scalability and diversity. We\nintroduce VAR4000, a subset of a larger dataset for jazz piano performances,\nconsisting of 4,352 training pairs. Using a semi-automatic pipeline, we\nevaluate two transformer configurations on VAR4000, comparing their performance\nwith the smaller JAZZVAR dataset. Preliminary results show promising\nimprovements in generalisation and performance with the larger dataset\nconfiguration, highlighting the potential of transformer models to scale\neffectively for music overpainting on larger and more diverse datasets.\n",
