Specifically, precipitation nowcasting\naims to predict precipitation at a local level within a 6-hour time frame. This\ntask can be framed as a spatial-temporal sequence forecasting problem, where\ndeep learning methods have been particularly effective. However, despite\nadvancements in self-supervised learning, most successful methods for\nnowcasting remain fully supervised. Self-supervised learning is advantageous\nfor pretraining models to learn representations without requiring extensive\nlabeled data. In this work, we leverage the benefits of self-supervised\nlearning and integrate it with spatial-temporal learning to develop a novel\nmodel, SpaT-SparK. SpaT-SparK comprises a CNN-based encoder-decoder structure\npretrained with a masked image modeling (MIM) task and a translation network\nthat captures temporal relationships among past and future precipitation maps\nin downstream tasks. We conducted experiments on the NL-50 dataset to evaluate\nthe performance of SpaT-SparK. The results demonstrate that SpaT-SparK\noutperforms existing baseline supervised models, such as SmaAt-UNet, providing\nmore accurate nowcasting predictions.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KWbGlctBsLApCC5dSXMjh3q3o0hYqK5eNirhl83wm94","pdfSize":"2193198"}
