Through our\nanalysis, we demonstrate that the cross-attention map within cross-view\ncompletion models captures correspondence more effectively than other\ncorrelations derived from encoder or decoder features. We verify the\neffectiveness of the cross-attention map by evaluating on both zero-shot\nmatching and learning-based geometric matching and multi-frame depth\nestimation.
