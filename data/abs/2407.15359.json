This paper\npresents a hybrid solution for generating discharge summary sections as part of\nour participation in the \"Discharge Me!\" Challenge at the BioNLP 2024 Shared\nTask. We developed a two-stage generation method using both extractive and\nabstractive techniques, in which we first apply name entity recognition (NER)\nto extract key clinical concepts, which are then used as input for a\nprompt-tuning-based GatorTronGPT model to generate coherent text for two\nimportant sections including \"Brief Hospital Course\" and \"Discharge\nInstructions\". Our system was ranked 5th in this challenge, achieving an\noverall score of 0.284. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our hybrid\nsolution in improving the quality of automated discharge section generation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2sOc59FPGIv45Ef98baGTIM_LDqyAKqoWz0z1XtAneY","pdfSize":"621430"}
