It is known that\nthe mass of the $SU(2)_L$ quintuplet fermion dark matter is predicted to be\naround 14 TeV, based on the thermal production mechanism. In this work, we\nembed the quintuplet dark matter within non-supersymmetric $SU(5)$ grand\nunified theories. We find that two pairs of colored sextet fermions are\nrequired at the $\\mathcal{O}(1-10)~\\mathrm{TeV}$ scale to achieve gauge\ncoupling unification, with the unification scale near the reduced Planck scale.\nThese colored sextet fermions become metastable because their interactions are\nsuppressed by the unification scale. Our model can be tested through\ncomprehensive searches for colored sextet fermions in collider experiments, as\nwell as through indirect and direct detection methods for minimal dark matter.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nDleqiUT0HhvNR3x-F-2nMrgP2Lb40Ft44ccz0XRdwY","pdfSize":"430354"}
