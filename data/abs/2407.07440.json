More recently, matrix-analytic\ntechniques have been applied to general Markov additive models with a finite\nphase space. The basic assumption underlying these developments is that the\nprocess is skip-free (in the case of QBDs or fluid queues) or that it is\none-sided, that is it is jump-free in one direction.\n  From the Markov additive perspective, traditional matrix-analytic models can\nbe viewed as special cases: for M/G/1 and GI/M/1-type Markov chains, increments\nin the level are constrained to be lattice random variables and for fluid\nqueues, they have to be piecewise linear.\n  In this paper we discuss one-sided lattice and non-lattice Markov additive\nprocesses in parallel. Results that are standard in one tradition are\ninterpreted in the other, and new perspectives emerge. In particular, using\nthree fundamental matrices, we address hitting, two-sided exit, and creeping\nprobabilities.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Nc1oAsHMt0LU6R2YLq9-FfOtc6nvrDKSPjCjl6g02FE","pdfSize":"368710"}
