For $\\mu$ we assume only $\\sigma$-additivity in probability.\nThis class of equations include the Burgers equation and the heat equation. The\nexistence and uniqueness of the solution are proved, and the averaging\nprinciple for the equation is studied.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wEUy_TfIYTkjxeFcV3mhPydMrf9oKoay8PfTV2K-FC8","pdfSize":"219210"}
