We combine path planning techniques and an approach to\ndecentralization from prior work that yields theoretical performance\nguarantees. Experimentation with a team of AUVs provides empirical evidence\nthat the desirable performance guarantees can be preserved in practice even in\nthe presence of limitations that commonly arise in underwater robotics,\nincluding slow and intermittent acoustic communications and limited\ncomputational resources.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"hnBv3yaNl4CxR68xZ_nwdLl1Ec3-WxuX7oX5qZysF3E","pdfSize":"2605364"}
