  "abstract": "  We study a weakly asymmetric exclusion process with long jumps and with\ninfinitely many extended reservoirs. We prove that the stationary fluctuations\nof the process are governed by the generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process or\nthe stochastic Burgers equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions depending on\nthe strength of the asymmetry of the dynamics.\n",
