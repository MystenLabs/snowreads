This situation can be\naltered in two-field context. In this work we propose a two-field freeze-in\ndark matter model through Higgs portal. The observed dark matter relic\nabundance is obtained by a decay of scalar mediator thermalized in the early\nUniverse. While there is a lack of direct dark matter signals, the scalar\nmediator is in the reach of HL-LHC either through vector boson fusion or Mono-Z\nchannel. Within allowed scalar mass window of 10-50 GeV, we use improved cuts\nto derive both $2\\sigma$ exclusion and $5\\sigma$ discovery limits, depending on\nthe value of Higgs portal coupling. If verified, this scalar mediator signal\nallows us to infer the freeze-in dark matter.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"e9Mlrm3rDPXXRbcOMWpnopiPR62tteWSnn7Glu5qAIo","pdfSize":"587452"}
