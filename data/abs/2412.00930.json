This is because the momentum\nrouting is usually chosen to fulfill the desired Ward identity. In the case of\nthe chiral anomaly, the momentum routing is chosen in order to fulfill the\ngauge Ward identity and break the chiral Ward identity. Although the chiral\nanomaly is physical because it is associated with the pion decay into two\nphotons, this does not necessarily mean that the momentum routing invariance is\nbroken because the momentum routing was chosen in the computation of the\nanomaly. In this work, we show that if gauge invariance is assumed, the chiral\nand the scale anomalies are independent of the momentum routing chosen and as a\nresult they are momentum routing invariant. Thus, it turns out that momentum\nrouting invariance might be violated when there is a gauge anomaly.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GJD2D_a2Gf49xgAJhg3IOrzQme23e_po0nPlaJzTCxI","pdfSize":"612237"}
