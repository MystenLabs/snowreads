In our\nstudy on the approximation error of the proposed operator we prove direct and\nstrong converse theorems with respect to a related K-functional. This operator\nis linear but not positive. However it has the advantage of a higher order of\napproximation compared to the Goodman-Sharma variant of the Baskakov operator\ndefined in 2005 by Finta.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SlMi6CDXKZ2bn7IcDuxpHZBruySgZWCVDi12_qI-dKI","pdfSize":"180273"}
