This paper discusses the\nprobability of such configurations arising in two scenarios: (1) data sampled\nrandomly from a uniform distribution, and (2) data collected from physical\nsystems, such as reflective surfaces or structured environments. We present a\nprobabilistic framework, analyze the geometric and sampling constraints, and\nprovide some mathematical insights into how data acquisition processes\ninfluence the likelihood of degeneracies. Notably, our findings reveal that\ndegeneracies occur more frequently in physical systems than in purely random\nsimulations due to systematic biases introduced by instrumental setups and\nenvironmental structures, emphasizing the risks of drawing conclusions solely\nbased on assumptions derived from random data.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iJEdgi4bO0UhcGs3oEeZGPEeZ0pEBT5_Xz0xGwQFMZ0","pdfSize":"187966"}
