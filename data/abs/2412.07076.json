We characterized these knotted\nsubgroups in terms of one-parameter subgroups and provided examples in the case\nof SU(2) and SU(3). Infinitesimal elements that give rise to knotted subgroups\nof SU(n) and SO(n) are characterized as well. Canonical forms for their knotted\nsubgroups are presented and their properties are described in terms of the\nspectrum of the corresponding infinitesimal elements. Finally, knotted\nsubgroups of SL(2,R) are completely classified using direct computation while\nknotted subgroups of SL(3,R) are completely classified using Jordan canonical\nforms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/General Topology","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"3bn4LG8RWf0SPNIpOlhCkLyOLGr6Ls472ZysnC-2JxU","pdfSize":"2960922"}
