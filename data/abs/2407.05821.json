A matrix constructed from the Euler-Lagrange equations of\nmotion is utilized to analyze the states of the model. The model has two mass\nterms which determine the real or complex nature of the eigen values. A\nmismatch is found in the Lagrange equations of motion of the fields as the\nequations do not agree with the other after complex conjugation of the either.\nThis is resolved by exploiting a preferred similarity transformation of the\nLagrangian. The discrepancy even at the Hamiltonian level is found to have\nvanished once we consider the similarity transformed Hamiltonian.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cwvuGp-enyQBNlT-DfSD9Nq40q_2pprSxAY8QF7-FF0","pdfSize":"111203"}
