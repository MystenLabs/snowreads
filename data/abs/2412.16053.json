To this end, the underlying exact flow equation\nof the effective potential is reformulated as a set of nonlinear\nadvection-diffusion-type equations which can be solved using the\nKurganov-Tadmor central scheme, a modern finite-volume discretization from\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach by performing explicit benchmark tests using zero-dimensional models\nwith two discretized field space directions or two symmetry invariants. Our\ntechniques can be directly applied to flow equations of effective potentials of\ngeneral (fermion-)boson systems with multiple invariants or condensates, as we\nalso demonstrate for two concrete examples in three spacetime dimensions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hSyrGJ-kLwhO8dtiG3RrFSP_h6XdXDqgDePLtlWzK8U","pdfSize":"11506125"}
