  "abstract": "  We introduce a Wireless Signal based Efficient multi-Robot eXploration\n(WiSER-X) algorithm applicable to a decentralized team of robots exploring an\nunknown environment with communication bandwidth constraints. WiSER-X relies\nonly on local inter-robot relative position estimates, that can be obtained by\nexchanging signal pings from onboard sensors such as WiFi, Ultra-Wide Band,\namongst others, to inform the exploration decisions of individual robots to\nminimize redundant coverage overlaps. Furthermore, WiSER-X also enables\nasynchronous termination without requiring a shared map between the robots. It\nalso adapts to heterogeneous robot behaviors and even complete failures in\nunknown environment while ensuring complete coverage. Simulations show that\nWiSER-X leads to 58% lower overlap than a zero-information-sharing baseline\nalgorithm-1 and only 23% more overlap than a full-information-sharing algorithm\nbaseline algorithm-2.\n",
