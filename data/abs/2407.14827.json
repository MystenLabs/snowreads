Beyond a critical\nradius, $\\beta$ becomes more radial with the increase of $M_{200}$, reflecting\nmore prominent radial accretion around massive halos. The critical radius is\n$r\\sim r_s$, $0.3~r_s$ and $r_s$ for halo stars, dark matter and subhalos, with\n$r_s$ the scale radius of host halos. This dependence on $M_{200}$ is the\nstrongest for subhalos, and the weakest for halo stars. In central regions,\n$\\beta$ of halo stars and dark matter particles gets more isotropic with the\nincrease of $M_{200}$ in TNG300 due to baryons. By contrast, $\\beta$ of dark\nmatter from the dark matter only TNG300-Dark run shows much weaker dependence\non $M_{200}$ within $r_s$. Dark matter in TNG300 is slightly more isotropic\nthan in TNG300-Dark at $0.2~r_s<r<10~r_s$ and $\\log_{10}M_{200}/M_\\odot<13.8$.\nHalo stars and dark matter also become more radial with the increase in\n$c_{200}$, at fixed $M_{200}$. Halo stars are more radial than the $\\beta$\nprofile of dark matter by approximately a constant beyond $r_s$. Dark matter\nparticles are more radial than subhalos. The differences can be understood as\nsubhalos on more radial orbits are easier to get stripped, contributing more\nstars and dark matter to the diffuse components. We provide a fitting formula\nto the difference between the $\\beta$ of halo stars and of dark matter at\n$r>r_s$ as $\\beta_\\mathrm{star}-\\beta_\\mathrm{DM}=(-0.028 \\pm\n0.008)\\log_{10}M_{200}/M_\\odot + (0.690\\pm0.010)$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HqgcDbx_h9pbKgTu_NCjZUaTchDP5P_kOr7tkaoB7_Y","pdfSize":"1001730"}
