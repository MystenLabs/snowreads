Despite the\nprogress that has been made, rich and informative spectral information of HSI\nhas been largely underutilized by existing methods which employ convolutional\nkernels with limited size of receptive field in the spectral domain. To address\nthis issue, we propose a spectral graph reasoning network (SGR) learning\nframework comprising two crucial modules: 1) a spectral decoupling module which\nunpacks and casts multiple spectral embeddings into a unified graph whose node\ncorresponds to an individual spectral feature channel in the embedding space;\nthe graph performs interpretable reasoning to aggregate and align spectral\ninformation to guide learning spectral-specific graph embeddings at multiple\ncontextual levels 2) a spectral ensembling module explores the interactions and\ninterdependencies across graph embedding hierarchy via a novel recurrent graph\npropagation mechanism. Experiments on two HSI datasets demonstrate that the\nproposed architecture can significantly improve the classification accuracy\ncompared with the existing methods with a sizable margin.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YX3O40lVV9s4hc09fKDjVsYUESHB29gUQwQH8mCfZ4Y","pdfSize":"1958321"}
