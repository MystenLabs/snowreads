  "abstract": "  In an unbounded plane, straight lines are used extensively for mathematical\nanalysis. They are tools of convenience. However, those with high slope values\nbecome unbounded at a faster rate than the independent variable. So, straight\nlines, in this work, are made to be bounded by introducing a parametric\nnonlinear term that is positive. The straight lines are transformed into\nbounded nonlinear curves that become unbounded at a much slower rate than the\nindependent variable. This transforming equation can be expressed as a\ncontinued fraction of straight lines. The continued fraction is real-valued and\nconverges to the solutions of the transforming equation. Following Euler's\nmethod, the continued fraction has been reduced into an infinite series. The\nusefulness of the bounding nature of continued fraction is demonstrated by\nsolving the problem of image classification. Parameters estimated on the\nFashion-MNIST dataset of greyscale images using continued fraction of\nregression lines have less variance, converge quickly and are more accurate\nthan the linear counterpart. Moreover, this multi-dimensional parametric\nestimation problem can be expressed on $xy-$ plane using the parameters of the\ncontinued fraction and patterns emerge on planar plots.\n",
