  "abstract": "  The ability of $\\theta$-Milstein methods with $\\theta\\ge 1$ to capture the\nnon-negativity and the mean-reversion property of the exact solution of the CIR\nmodel is shown.\n  In addition, the order of convergence and the preservation of the long-term\nvariance is studied. These theoretical results are illustrated with numerical\nexamples.\n",
