  "abstract": "  This paper presents our submission to the COOOL competition, a novel\nbenchmark for detecting and classifying out-of-label hazards in autonomous\ndriving. Our approach integrates diverse methods across three core tasks: (i)\ndriver reaction detection, (ii) hazard object identification, and (iii) hazard\ncaptioning. We propose kernel-based change point detection on bounding boxes\nand optical flow dynamics for driver reaction detection to analyze motion\npatterns. For hazard identification, we combined a naive proximity-based\nstrategy with object classification using a pre-trained ViT model. At last, for\nhazard captioning, we used the MOLMO vision-language model with tailored\nprompts to generate precise and context-aware descriptions of rare and\nlow-resolution hazards. The proposed pipeline outperformed the baseline methods\nby a large margin, reducing the relative error by 33%, and scored 2nd on the\nfinal leaderboard consisting of 32 teams.\n",
