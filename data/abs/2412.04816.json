Traditional approaches obtain point identification by relying,\noften implicitly, on exclusion restrictions. We show that without such\nrestrictions, coefficients of interest can still be partially identified and we\nderive a constructive characterization of the sharp identified set. We then\nbuild on this characterization to develop computationally simple and\nasymptotically normal estimators of the corresponding bounds. We show that\nthese estimators exhibit good finite sample performances.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"6t6P5V4z-Xc6cgmcJpj3mK2tOnhtFdvLG0DQWLvfhcc","pdfSize":"901218"}
