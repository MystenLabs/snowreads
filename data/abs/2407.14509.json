In contrast, permutation based explanations\nfor tabular data classifiers measure feature importance by comparing model\nperformance on data before and after permuting a feature. We propose an\nexplanation method for image-based models that permutes interpretable concepts\nacross dataset images. Given a dataset of images labeled with specific concepts\nlike captions, we permute a concept across examples in the text space and then\ngenerate images via a text-conditioned diffusion model. Feature importance is\nthen reflected by the change in model performance relative to unpermuted data.\nWhen applied to a set of concepts, the method generates a ranking of feature\nimportance. We show this approach recovers underlying model feature importance\non synthetic and real-world image classification tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uTloBwUFGTnTYFeiUjQ7LwqQUnKrrGeF_nNnseOArK4","pdfSize":"30574764"}
