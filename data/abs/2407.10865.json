Addressing this pressing\nneed, our AirNeRF system presents an innovative pathway to the creation of a\nrealistic 3D human avatar. Our approach leverages Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)\nwith an automated drone-based video capturing method. The acquired data\nprovides a swift and precise way to create high-quality human body\nreconstructions following several stages of our system. The rigged mesh derived\nfrom our system proves to be an excellent foundation for free-view synthesis of\ndynamic humans, particularly well-suited for the immersive experiences within\ngaming and virtual reality.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Q7Ozg-JciQM6B5Du_s4rlo-mNcDZwiK-51UMsow8RbY","pdfSize":"6080071","objectId":"0xbbb3a922e4211df29d4a4ed4d04d99a1f862ba2374c887b3953f32dc6318dcbb","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
