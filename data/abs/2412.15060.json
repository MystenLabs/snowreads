  "abstract": "  Conflict scholars have used rule-based approaches to extract information\nabout political violence from news reports and texts. Recent Natural Language\nProcessing developments move beyond rigid rule-based approaches. We review our\nrecent ConfliBERT language model (Hu et al. 2022) to process political and\nviolence related texts. The model can be used to extract actor and action\nclassifications from texts about political conflict. When fine-tuned, results\nshow that ConfliBERT has superior performance in accuracy, precision and recall\nover other large language models (LLM) like Google's Gemma 2 (9B), Meta's Llama\n3.1 (7B), and Alibaba's Qwen 2.5 (14B) within its relevant domains. It is also\nhundreds of times faster than these more generalist LLMs. These results are\nillustrated using texts from the BBC, re3d, and the Global Terrorism Dataset\n(GTD).\n",
