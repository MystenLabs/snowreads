We\nfirst give a method for generating a triangular norm on an atomistic lattice by\nthe values of atoms. Then we prove that every triangular norm on a non-Boolean\natomistic lattice is not left-continuous and $T_M$ is the uniquely\nleft-continuous triangular norm on an atomistic Boolean lattice. Furthermore,\nwe show that each atomistic Boolean lattice can be represented by a family of\ntriangular norms on an atomistic lattice with the same number of atoms.\nFinally, we construct a triangular norm on a finite lattice by restricting a\ntriangular norm on an extended atomistic lattice of the finite lattice to the\nfinite lattice.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"SvIEynLftYaGDwMzi4X_QO6u_86a6gkQZqS-oyUZjq4","pdfSize":"208990"}
