This challenge, titled \"ROBOVOX: Far-Field\nSpeaker Recognition by a Mobile Robot,\" focuses on speaker recognition using a\nmobile robot in noisy and reverberant conditions. Our solution combines the\nresult of deep residual neural networks and time-delay neural network-based\nspeaker embedding models. These models were trained on a diverse dataset that\nincludes French speech. To account for the challenging evaluation environment\ncharacterized by high noise, reverberation, and short speech conditions, we\nfocused on data augmentation and training speech duration for the speaker\nembedding model. Our submission achieved second place on the SP Cup 2024 public\nleaderboard, with a detection cost function of 0.5245 and an equal error rate\nof 6.46%.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wfkcMpbtp76UlPPm6Rvc9h15E4Ve3Y93Pp0LGgcom2k","pdfSize":"418905"}
