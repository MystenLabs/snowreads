Our theory incorporates electrostatic and\nhydrodynamic frameworks to describe the electronic dynamics, demonstrating\nelectrically tunable linear and nonlinear modulations. The power threshold of\nachieving optical bistability shows unprecedented tunability over two orders of\nmagnitude, reaching values as low as 10 $\\mu$W through surface charge control.\nThese findings offer new insights into understanding and actively controlling\nKerr nonlinearities, paving the way for efficient refractive index engineering\nas well as the development of advanced linear and nonlinear electro-optical\nmodulators.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OXg_-_4Zm9gRDqXQLNxEQLDREuCuhciApDFIdtpjRXc","pdfSize":"5908343"}
