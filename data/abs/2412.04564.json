  "abstract": "  We investigate the spin-squeezing behavior under thermal effects in a\none-dimensional transverse field XY model with spin-1/2. The exact solution of\nthe model helps us to compute the spin-squeezing parameter as a function of\ntemperature and also in all excited states with higher energy than the ground\nstate. We find that below the thermal factorized field, h_f(T_{co}), there is\nno transition temperature. At the thermal factorized field, a transition from a\nthermal squeezed state to an unsqueezed state occurs at a specific temperature\ncalled the coherent temperature. Interestingly, we show that the finite\ntemperature can create squeezed states from a state which at zero temperature\nis a coherent state. To complete our study, we also analyze the variation of\nthe spin-squeezing parameter in the excited states and provide a behavioral\nanalysis of the thermal spin-squeezing parameter.\n",
