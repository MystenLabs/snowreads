  "abstract": "  Recent advances in data collection technology, accompanied by the ever-rising\nvolume and velocity of streaming data, underscore the vital need for time\nseries analytics. In this regard, time-series anomaly detection has been an\nimportant activity, entailing various applications in fields such as cyber\nsecurity, financial markets, law enforcement, and health care. While\ntraditional literature on anomaly detection is centered on statistical\nmeasures, the increasing number of machine learning algorithms in recent years\ncall for a structured, general characterization of the research methods for\ntime-series anomaly detection. This survey groups and summarizes anomaly\ndetection existing solutions under a process-centric taxonomy in the time\nseries context. In addition to giving an original categorization of anomaly\ndetection methods, we also perform a meta-analysis of the literature and\noutline general trends in time-series anomaly detection research.\n",
