However, it is still\nchallenging for ASVs to perform sensor-based autonomous navigation in\nobstacle-filled and congested waterways, where perception errors, closely\ngathered vehicles and limited maneuvering space near buoys may cause\ndifficulties in following the Convention on the International Regulations for\nPreventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs). To address these issues, we propose a\nnovel Distributional Reinforcement Learning based navigation system that can\nwork with onboard LiDAR and odometry sensors to generate arbitrary thrust\ncommands in continuous action space. Comprehensive evaluations of the proposed\nsystem in high-fidelity Gazebo simulations show its ability to decide whether\nto follow COLREGs or take other beneficial actions based on the scenarios\nencountered, offering superior performance in navigation safety and efficiency\ncompared to systems using state-of-the-art Distributional RL,\nnon-Distributional RL and classical methods.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"929oRc4Xpb9mrPELc3d8TyLlXXLb5jWm4fkcJO2uJls","pdfSize":"3425161"}
