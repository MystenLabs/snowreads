The mechanism of pumping high spin values for deformed\nfission fragments is explained. The idea is that the source of the generation\nof high relative orbital moments and spins of the fragments are the transverse\nwriggling and bending vibrations of the pre-fragments, while the nucleus\nremains \"cold\" until the moment of fission. To verify this hypothesis,\nexperimental distributions for the induced fission of $\\rm ^{232}Th$ and $\\rm\n^{238}U$ nuclei, as well as the spontaneous fission of $\\rm ^{252}Cf$, were\ncompared. The results show reasonable agreement both in the magnitude of the\nmean spin values and in the sawtooth shape of the sip distribution with respect\nto the fragment mass number. The results are also compared with other\napproaches to the description of these quantities, and possible reasons for\ntheir discrepancies are discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Rr_OQkDQ9fnTAfiSOju9i1DGyh4QhsbV6OPgBV42BJc","pdfSize":"1464955"}
