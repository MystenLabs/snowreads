  "abstract": "  The Core Accretion model is widely accepted as the primary mechanism for\nforming planets up to a few Jupiter masses. However, the formation of\nsuper-massive planets remains a subject of debate, as their formation via the\nCore Accretion model requires super-solar metallicities. Assuming stellar\natmospheric abundances reflect the composition of protoplanetary disks, and\nthat disk mass scales linearly with stellar mass, we calculated the total\namount of metals in planet-building materials that could contribute to the\nformation of massive planets. In this work, we studied a sample of 172\nJupiter-mass planets and 93 planets with masses exceeding 4 Mjup. Our results\nconsistently demonstrate that planets with masses above 4 Mjup form in disks\nwith at least as much metal content as those hosting planets with masses\nbetween 1 and 4 Mjup, often with slightly higher metallicity, typically\nexceeding that of the proto-solar disk. We interpret this as strong evidence\nthat the formation of very massive Jupiters is feasible through Core Accretion\nand encourage planet formation modelers to test our observational conclusions.\n",
