In this\npaper, we introduce a novel diffusion model that benefits from quantum\ncomputing techniques in order to mitigate computational challenges and enhance\ngenerative performance within high energy physics data. The fully quantum\ndiffusion model replaces Gaussian noise with random unitary matrices in the\nforward process and incorporates a variational quantum circuit within the U-Net\nin the denoising architecture. We run evaluations on the structurally complex\nquark and gluon jets dataset from the Large Hadron Collider. The results\ndemonstrate that the fully quantum and hybrid models are competitive with a\nsimilar classical model for jet generation, highlighting the potential of using\nquantum techniques for machine learning problems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computer Science/Machine Learning","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"90tvD4VizwWsQsWcw4rb_o9aKRVdF1HtAShXQi7YK78","pdfSize":"887747"}
