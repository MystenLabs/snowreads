Here, $\\ell^p_{a,b}(\\mathtt{A})$ and\n$c_{0,a.b}(\\mathtt{A})$, respectively, are the Banach spaces of analytic\nfunctions on a suitable annulus $\\mathtt{A}$ in the complex plane, having a\nnormalized Schauder basis of the form $\\{(a_n+b_nz)z^n, ~~n\\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$,\nwhich is equivalent to the standard basis in $\\ell^p(\\mathbb{Z})$ and\n$c_0(\\mathbb{Z})$. We first obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for\n$F_w$ to be bounded, and show that, under certain conditions on $\\{a_n\\}$ and\n$\\{b_n\\}$, the operator $F_w$ is similar to a compact perturbation of a\nbilateral weighted shift on $\\ell^p(\\mathbb{Z})$. This also allows us to obtain\nthe essential spectrum of $F_w$. Further, we study when $F_w$ and its adjoint\n$F_w^*$ are hypercyclic, supercyclic, and chaotic, and provide a class of\nchaotic operators that are compact perturbations of weighted shifts on\n$\\ell^p(\\mathbb{Z})$. Finally, it is proved that the adjoint of a shift on the\ndual of $\\ell^p_{a,b}(\\mathtt{A})$ can have non-trivial periodic vectors,\nwithout being even hypercyclic. Also, the zero-one law of orbital limit points\nfails for $F_w^*$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Jn4ZwB4HGO4jSnSymY3UkswCzcS0h3kIsgpwM-oZYNs","pdfSize":"391392"}
