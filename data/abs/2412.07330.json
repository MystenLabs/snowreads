In this theory, depending on the choice\nof the neutral element, the local multiplication law is given by the Buchstaber\npolynomial or the generalized Kontsevich polynomial. One of the most exciting\nresults of our studies is a simple construction of a two-valued algebraic group\non $\\mathbb C$ different from known coset-construction.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"-GYNuqZWPw9dF8Bvb2-TEhWahb5aavXKWe77Ntw2alo","pdfSize":"494688"}
