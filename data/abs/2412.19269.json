These decays result in three distinct channels\nwith observable final states: (i) four leptons, (ii) three leptons plus two\njets, both accompanied by missing transverse energy, and (iii) two leptons with\nmultiple jets. To enhance sensitivity to \\( Z' \\) and RHN signals over the\nstandard model background, we employ \\texttt{XGBOOST} based analyses to\noptimize the selection criteria. Our findings demonstrate that these channels\nprovide promising opportunities to probe new physics, offering critical\ninsights into the mechanisms of neutrino mass generation and baryon asymmetry\nin the universe.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"r8KY1AaPSMYv0httG4Gyy8rAWzLpiCM5cx7eF05o86g","pdfSize":"812200"}
