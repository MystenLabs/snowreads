Then the exact solution for the 3D Z2 lattice gauge theory is derived by\nthe duality between the two models. Several fundamental issues, such as\ndimensionality, duality, symmetry, manifold, degenerate states, are\ninvestigated for these many-body interacting spin systems. The connections with\nsuperfluid, superconductors, etc. are evaluated. Furthermore, physical\nsignificances and mathematical aspects of the 3D Z2 lattice gauge theory are\ndiscussed with respect to topology, geometry, and algebra.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DpURJAw9vlcyQToJsoal5tVJZm-JVABjPm7n3lMV7es","pdfSize":"954189"}
