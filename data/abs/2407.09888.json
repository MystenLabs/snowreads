With \\textit{FarFetched}, we address the need for automated claim\nvalidation based on the aggregated evidence derived from multiple online news\nsources. We introduce an entity-centric reasoning framework in which latent\nconnections between events, actions, or statements are revealed via entity\nmentions and represented in a graph database. Using entity linking and semantic\nsimilarity, we offer a way for collecting and combining information from\ndiverse sources in order to generate evidence relevant to the user's claim.\nThen, we leverage textual entailment recognition to quantitatively determine\nwhether this assertion is credible, based on the created evidence. Our approach\ntries to fill the gap in automated claim validation for less-resourced\nlanguages and is showcased on the Greek language, complemented by the training\nof relevant semantic textual similarity (STS) and natural language inference\n(NLI) models that are evaluated on translated versions of common benchmarks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Cu_2V6p6K1NAivTDenWggus0S4J2LiaRfseh_l8dsh4","pdfSize":"2187722"}
