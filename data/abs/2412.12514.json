We realize the ABCT variety $V(3,n)$ as the determinantal variety\nof a vector bundle morphism. We use this to give a recursive formula for the\nfundamental class of $V(3,n)$. As an application, we show that special Schubert\ncoefficients of this class are given by Eulerian numbers, matching a formula by\nCachazo-He-Yuan. On the way to this, we prove that the variety of configuration\nof points on a common divisor on a smooth variety is reduced and irreducible,\ngeneralizing a result of Caminata-Moon-Schaffler.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"VRZZy69BEEDeOY3dr2wbKpxKA-lNtdPz96JAGxF9aoc","pdfSize":"157859"}
