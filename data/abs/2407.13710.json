Compared to existing toolkits: (i) We support NLP and\nComputer Vision classification as well as standard tabular problems. (ii) We\nsupport enforcing fairness on validation data, making us robust to a wide range\nof overfitting challenges. (iii) Our approach can optimize any measure based on\nTrue Positives, False Positive, False Negatives, and True Negatives. This makes\nit easily extendable and much more expressive than existing toolkits. It\nsupports 9/9 and 10/10 of the decision-based group metrics of two popular\nreview papers. (iv) We jointly optimize a performance objective. This not only\nminimizes degradation while enforcing fairness, but can improve the performance\nof otherwise inadequately tuned unfair baselines. OxonFair is compatible with\nstandard ML toolkits including sklearn, Autogluon, and PyTorch and is available\nonline at https://github.com/oxfordinternetinstitute/oxonfair\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GHNFx76l7N1osvZvQq_f96Vjh19vsUqJ0m_dGvR8yAo","pdfSize":"879108"}
