  "abstract": "  The thermodynamics and microstructure of confined fluids with small particle\nnumber are best described using the canonical ensemble. However, practical\ncalculations can usually only be performed in the grand-canonical ensemble,\nwhich can introduce unphysical artifacts. We employ the method of asymptotics\nto transform grand-canonical observables to the canonical ensemble, where the\nformer can be conveniently obtained using the classical density functional\ntheory of inhomogeneous fluids. By formulating the ensemble transformation as a\ncontour integral in the complex fugacity plane we reveal the influence of the\nYang-Lee zeros in determining the form and convergence properties of the\nasymptotic series. The theory is employed to develop expansions for the\ncanonical partition function and the canonical one-body density. Numerical\ninvestigations are then performed using an exactly soluble one-dimensional\nmodel system of hard-rods.\n",
