A short description of its\ngeometry and Chow ring is given. Then we exhibit an exceptional sequence for\nthe derived category by understanding a $\\mathds{P}^1$-bundle over it and using\nTeleman Quantization. The fullness of the exceptional sequence is proved by\nusing a covering argument and computations of mutations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Xi-tWf0KCRLxfoe1XavRtvn_hAKzRQobwn9WghDqZY8","pdfSize":"580732"}
