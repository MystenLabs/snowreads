  "abstract": "  We study a model of colored multiwebs, which generalizes the dimer model to\nallow each vertex to be adjacent to $n_v$ edges. These objects can be\nformulated as a random tiling of a graph with partial dimer covers. We examine\nthe case of a cycle graph, and in particular we describe the local correlations\nof tiles in this setting.\n",
