This issue is\nconsidered to be the most important challenge for the next generation of\nagriculture due to the diminishing natural resources, the limited arable land,\nand unpredictable climatic conditions caused by climate change. In this paper,\nwe employ emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), machine\nlearning (ML), and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to improve\noperational efficiency and productivity in the agricultural sector.\nSpecifically, we propose an edge computing-based explainable crop\nrecommendation system, AgroXAI, which suggests suitable crops for a region\nbased on weather and soil conditions. In this system, we provide local and\nglobal explanations of ML model decisions with methods such as ELI5, LIME,\nSHAP, which we integrate into ML models. More importantly, we provide regional\nalternative crop recommendations with the counterfactual explainability method.\nIn this way, we envision that our proposed AgroXAI system will be a platform\nthat provides regional crop diversity in the next generation agriculture.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Duln-xPcstgSLFQhU_zANDGYap4S7GVav-KCQdJ5Wus","pdfSize":"8592970"}
