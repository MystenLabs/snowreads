This is particularly critical for object detection\ntasks, where domain shifts (caused by factors such as lighting conditions,\nviewing angles, and environmental variations) can lead to significant\nperformance degradation. This review delves into advanced methodologies for\ndomain adaptation, including adversarial learning, discrepancy-based,\nmulti-domain, teacher-student, ensemble, and Vision Language Models techniques,\nemphasizing their efficacy in reducing domain gaps and enhancing model\nrobustness. Feature-based methods have emerged as powerful tools for addressing\nthese challenges by harmonizing feature representations across domains. These\ntechniques, such as Feature Alignment, Feature Augmentation/Reconstruction, and\nFeature Transformation, are employed alongside or as integral parts of other\ndomain adaptation strategies to minimize domain gaps and improve model\nperformance. Special attention is given to strategies that minimize the\nreliance on extensive labeled data and using unlabeled data, particularly in\nscenarios involving synthetic-to-real domain shifts. Applications in fields\nsuch as autonomous driving and medical imaging are explored, showcasing the\npotential of these methods to ensure reliable object detection in diverse and\ncomplex settings. By providing a thorough analysis of state-of-the-art\ntechniques, challenges, and future directions, this work offers a valuable\nreference for researchers striving to develop resilient and adaptable object\ndetection frameworks, advancing the seamless deployment of artificial\nintelligence in dynamic environments.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"y56-PoayyQ-uVlPiB7P6dzCkGUkbsHMLOKFr09rBqpo","pdfSize":"991774"}
