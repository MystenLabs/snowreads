  "abstract": "  Open-set 3D segmentation represents a major point of interest for multiple\ndownstream robotics and augmented/virtual reality applications. Recent advances\nintroduce 3D Gaussian Splatting as a computationally efficient representation\nof the underlying scene. They enable the rendering of novel views while\nachieving real-time display rates and matching the quality of computationally\nfar more expensive methods. We present a decoupled 3D segmentation pipeline to\nensure modularity and adaptability to novel 3D representations and semantic\nsegmentation foundation models. The pipeline proposes class-agnostic masks\nbased on a 3D reconstruction of the scene. Given the resulting class-agnostic\nmasks, we use a class-aware 2D foundation model to add class annotations to the\n3D masks. We test this pipeline with 3D Gaussian Splatting and different 2D\nsegmentation models and achieve better performance than more tailored\napproaches while also significantly increasing the modularity.\n",
