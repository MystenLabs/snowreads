In fact, WRT invariant is defined at\nroots of unity, $\\mathbbm{q}\\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi\ni}{k+2}\\right),~k\\in\\mathbb{Z}_+,~\\text{for}~SU(2)\\right)$, and is generally a\ncomplex number, whereas $\\widehat{Z}$-invariant is a $q$-series with integer\ncoefficients such that $|q|<1$. Therefore, $\\widehat{Z}$-invariant can be\nobtained from WRT-invariant by performing a particular analytic continuation,\n$\\mathbbm{q}\\rightarrow q$. In this thesis, we first examine this conjecture\nfor $SO(3)$ and the ortho-symplectic supergroup $OSp(1|2)$. This is done by\nsetting up the WRT invariant for the respective groups and then performing the\nparticular analytic continuation to extract $\\widehat{Z}$. As a result of this\nexercise, we found that $\\widehat{Z}^{SU(2)}=\\widehat{Z}^{SO(3)}$ and\nidentified a relation between $\\widehat{Z}^{SU(2)}$ and\n$\\widehat{Z}^{OSp(1|2)}$. Motivated by the equality of $\\widehat{Z}$ for\n$SU(2)$ and $SO(3)$ groups, we study this conjecture for $SU(N)/\\mathbb{Z}_m$\ngroups, where $\\mathbb{Z}_m$ is a subgroup of $\\mathbb{Z}_N$, in our second\npaper. We subsequently found that\n$\\widehat{Z}^{SU(N)/\\mathbb{Z}_m}=\\widehat{Z}^{SU(N)}$.\n  Another theme of the thesis is to study a conjecture between knot theory and\nquiver representation theory. More precisely, this conjecture relates the\ngenerating function of the symmetric $r$-colored HOMFLY-PT polynomial with the\nmotivic generating series associated with a symmetric quiver. In particular, we\nobtain a quiver representation for a family of knots called double twist knots\n$K(p,-m)$. Primarily, we exploit the reverse engineering of\nMelvin-Morton-Rozansky (MMR) formalism to deduce the pattern of the matrix for\nthese quivers.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FtR6Vzu9-tt2D-p1vY_cjlHTK9l9pP-9QDsOSQI8XNE","pdfSize":"1126997"}
