In this paper for 14 of these 17 families we\nprovide a simple explanation as to why they are permutations. We also extend\nthese 14 families into three general classes of permutation pentanomials over\n$\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computer Science/Discrete Mathematics","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"yhD0004tqkx79kVMhbbDqITMjPf3EGPSN1B8AO6xmg4","pdfSize":"228045"}
