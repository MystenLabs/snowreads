  "abstract": "  The notion of Lie algebroids over a topological ringed space provides a\nunified framework to study various geometric structures. This geometric concept\nis intimately connected with well-known algebraic structures, including\nGerstenhaber algebras and Batalin--Vilkovisky algebras. We introduce more\ngeneral concepts such as $\\mathcal{L}$-Lie algebroids and\n$\\mathcal{A}$-Gerstenhaber algebras, associated with a given Lie algebroid\n$\\mathcal{L}$ and Gerstenhaber algebra $\\mathcal{A}$ over a topological ringed\nspace, respectively. Following this, we explore how several standard\ncorrespondences extend within this broader framework.\n",
