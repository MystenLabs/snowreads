Individuals navigate the\nbuilding, opening doors, and evacuate to the nearest exit. Zombies chase the\nuninfected individuals, and once caught there is a probability of a susceptible\nindividual being infected or killed, or for the zombie to be killed by the\nperson being attacked. We find that the speed of the zombies plays a crucial\nrole in the dynamics of the evacuation, the rate of infection, and the number\nof casualties during the outbreak. The model leads to insights that may be\nrelevant to other, less fictitious, emergency situations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Physics/Popular Physics","Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"Lkyyme0rgEKqOi1IBznjAwpYwL0TDLYCQ5-SQzdZCbo","pdfSize":"143214768"}
