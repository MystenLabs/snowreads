Objective: The aims of this study to determine\nand best recommendation to apply an approach which has several components with\nabilities to fulfil the critical needs Methods: A methodology starting with\nanalyzing both black-box and white-box models to get the pros and cons\nspecifically in phishing detection. The conclusion of the analysis will be\nvalidated by experiment using a set of well-known algorithms and public\nphishing datasets. Experimental metrics covers 3 measurements such as\npredictive accuracy and explainability metrics. Conclusion: Both models are\ncomparable in terms of interpretability and consistency, with room for\nimprovement in diverse datasets. EBM as an example of white-box model is\ngenerally better suited for applications requiring explainability and\nactionable insights. Finally, each model, white-box and black-box model has\npositive and negative aspects both for performance metric and for explainable\nmetric. It is important to consider the objective of model usage.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Cryptography and Security","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"HopwZ651d7NCsOjv0gvVT08LEZTZiuWMrVsXggnpy-w","pdfSize":"720236"}
