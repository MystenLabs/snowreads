We model the interactions with\nan effective field theory formulation where the flavon is heavier than the top\nquark. In addition, we assume that the flavon only couples to fermions of the\nStandard Model in a flavor-changing way. As the flavon couples strongly to top\nquarks, same-sign and opposite-sign top quark pair signals can be explored in\nthe search for those particles. Using parametrized neural networks, we show\nthat it is possible to probe flavons with masses in the 200-1600 GeV range\nthrough their interactions with a top quark plus up and charm quarks for\neffective couplings of order 10^-2 TeV^-1 at the 14 TeV High-Luminosity LHC.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cQiwYvw_4JuwPio1cOym01i_t99EI2P4OpA3O-ScXs0","pdfSize":"680582"}
