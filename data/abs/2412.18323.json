These subspaces are characterized by\nspecific Hermite degrees of freedom associated with only the vertices and edges\nof $\\mathcal{T}$, or even only the vertices of $\\mathcal{T}$. Each subspace\nstill contains cubic polynomials while saving a consistent number of degrees of\nfreedom compared with the full space. The dimension of the considered subspaces\ncan be as small as six times the number of vertices of $\\mathcal{T}$. The\nmethod fits in the setting of macro-elements: any function of such a subspace\ncan be constructed on each triangle of $\\mathcal{T}$ separately by specifying\nthe necessary Hermite degrees of freedom. The explicit local representation in\nterms of a local simplex spline basis is also provided. This simplex spline\nbasis intrinsically takes care of the complex geometry of the Wang-Shi split,\nmaking it transparent to the user.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"evJ2boWC7z93fA7ZqKeBHhVO0QWiFxCdSgQqwcpf6ec","pdfSize":"2363485"}
