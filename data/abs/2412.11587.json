{"id":"2412.11587","title":"Similar operator topologies on the space of positive contractions","authors":"Valentin Gillet","authorsParsed":[["Gillet","Valentin",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2024 09:19:39 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-17","timestamp":1734340779000,"abstract":"  In this article, we study the similarity of the Polish operator topologies\n$\\texttt{WOT}$, $\\texttt{SOT}$, $\\texttt{SOT}\\mbox{$_{*}$}$ and\n$\\texttt{SOT}\\mbox{$^{*}$}$ on the set of the positive contractions on $\\ell_p$\nwith $p > 1$. Using the notion of norming vector for a positive operator, we\nprove that these topologies are similar on $\\mathcal{P}_1(\\ell_2)$, that is\nthey have the same dense sets in $\\mathcal{P}_1(\\ell_2)$. In particular, these\ntopologies will share the same comeager sets in $\\mathcal{P}_1(\\ell_2)$. We\nthen apply these results to the study of typical properties of positive\ncontractions on $\\ell_p$-spaces in the Baire category sense. In particular, we\nprove that a typical positive contraction $T \\in (\\mathcal{P}_1(\\ell_2),\n\\texttt{SOT})$ has no eigenvalue. This stands in strong contrast to a result of\nEisner and M\\'atrai, stating that the point spectrum of a typical contraction\n$T \\in (\\mathcal{B}_1(\\ell_2), \\texttt{SOT})$ contains the whole unit disk. As\na consequence of our results, we obtain that a typical positive contraction $T\n\\in (\\mathcal{P}_1(\\ell_2), \\texttt{WOT})$ (resp. $T \\in\n(\\mathcal{P}_1(\\ell_2), \\texttt{SOT}\\mbox{$_{*}$})$) has no eigenvalue.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hLhz1Ymm8G70KLKy4agQlsnRGsAVcH2w72ubrogyTWw","pdfSize":"330919"}
