First, we will establish some fundamental properties of the mean\nHausdorff dimension. Furthermore, it is important to note that the metric mean\ndimension and mean Hausdorff dimension depend on the metric chosen for $M$. In\nthis work, we will prove that, for a fixed dynamical system $f:M\\rightarrow M$,\nthe functions $\\text{mdim}_{\\text{M}}(M, f):M(\\tau)\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\cup\n\\{\\infty\\}$ and $\\text{mdim}_{\\text{H}}(M, f):M(\\tau)\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\cup\n\\{\\infty\\}$ are not continuous. Here, $ \\text{mdim}_{\\text{M}}(M, f)(\\rho)=\n\\text{mdim}_{\\text{M}}(M,\\rho, f)$ and $ \\text{mdim}_{\\text{H}}(M, f)(\\rho)=\n\\text{mdim}_{\\text{H}}(M,\\rho, f)$ represent, respectively, the metric mean\ndimension and the mean Hausdorff dimension of $f$ with respect to $\\rho\\in\nM(\\tau)$ and $M(\\tau)$ is the set consisting of all equivalent metrics to $d$\non $M$. Furthermore, we will present examples of certain classes of metrics for\nwhich the metric mean dimension is a continuous function.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"331XvxUuRhU0pK0_Ba3u8j0V1d2absiQ70NtrU79kfM","pdfSize":"308618","objectId":"0x892226c5e931e74974e64d31dc11d20836b9fa7244577f9351525280a006cf8e","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
