Registration is an inherently ambiguous task often admitting many\nviable solutions. While neural network-based registration techniques enable\nfast and accurate registration, the majority of existing approaches are not\nable to estimate uncertainty. Here, we present PULPo, a method for\nprobabilistic deformable registration capable of uncertainty quantification.\nPULPo probabilistically models the distribution of deformation fields on\ndifferent hierarchical levels combining them using Laplacian pyramids. This\nallows our method to model global as well as local aspects of the deformation\nfield. We evaluate our method on two widely used neuroimaging datasets and find\nthat it achieves high registration performance as well as substantially better\ncalibrated uncertainty quantification compared to the current state-of-the-art.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6UAyWB5pl3I3b_x3B1yFmPD4UkuHLRQzIjD8xWpSds8","pdfSize":"5279337"}
