While the significance of each process is\nincreasingly recognized, their interplay remains unexplored. Using molecular\ndynamics simulation and theory we investigate this interplay. Our findings\nreveal that loop extrusion can enhance the dynamics of condensation and\npromotes coalescence and ripening of condensates. Further, the DNA loop enables\ncondensate formation under DNA tension and position condensates. The concurrent\npresence of loop extrusion and condensate formation results in the formation of\ndistinct domains similar to TADs, an outcome not achieved by either process\nalone.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"np2Uc9w66-ZL4IbOzmCDGUgpyH7lbAl-8vgXqD0puqM","pdfSize":"20558332"}
