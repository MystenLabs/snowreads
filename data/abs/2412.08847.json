  "abstract": "  The prevalence of unhealthy eating habits has become an increasingly\nconcerning issue in the United States. However, major food recommendation\nplatforms (e.g., Yelp) continue to prioritize users' dietary preferences over\nthe healthiness of their choices. Although efforts have been made to develop\nhealth-aware food recommendation systems, the personalization of such systems\nbased on users' specific health conditions remains under-explored. In addition,\nfew research focus on the interpretability of these systems, which hinders\nusers from assessing the reliability of recommendations and impedes the\npractical deployment of these systems. In response to this gap, we first\nestablish two large-scale personalized health-aware food recommendation\nbenchmarks at the first attempt. We then develop a novel framework,\nMulti-Objective Personalized Interpretable Health-aware Food Recommendation\nSystem (MOPI-HFRS), which provides food recommendations by jointly optimizing\nthe three objectives: user preference, personalized healthiness and nutritional\ndiversity, along with an large language model (LLM)-enhanced reasoning module\nto promote healthy dietary knowledge through the interpretation of recommended\nresults. Specifically, this holistic graph learning framework first utilizes\ntwo structure learning and a structure pooling modules to leverage both\ndescriptive features and health data. Then it employs Pareto optimization to\nachieve designed multi-facet objectives. Finally, to further promote the\nhealthy dietary knowledge and awareness, we exploit an LLM by utilizing\nknowledge-infusion, prompting the LLMs with knowledge obtained from the\nrecommendation model for interpretation.\n",
