The dataset used\ncomprises volumetric measurements from brain MRI and genetic data from healthy\nindividuals and patients with MCI/AD, obtained through the Alzheimer's Disease\nNeuroimaging Initiative. The existing class imbalance is addressed by an\nensemble learning approach, while various attribution-based and\ncounterfactual-based interpretability methods are leveraged towards producing\ndiverse explanations related to the pathophysiology of MCI/AD. A unification\nmethod combining SHAP with counterfactual explanations assesses the\ninterpretability techniques' robustness. The best performing model yielded\n87.5% balanced accuracy and 90.8% F1-score. The attribution-based\ninterpretability methods highlighted significant volumetric and genetic\nfeatures related to MCI/AD risk. The unification method provided useful\ninsights regarding those features' necessity and sufficiency, further\nshowcasing their significance in MCI/AD diagnosis.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Jz5iZLdakWw5-sR0I_PbbIFd8z3Ua5kHBcY3nvo-zHs","pdfSize":"2182744"}
