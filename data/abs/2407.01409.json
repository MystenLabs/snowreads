However, they are not inherently designed for\nquery generation. To bridge this gap, solutions have been proposed that rely on\nfine-tuning or ad-hoc architectures, achieving good results but limited\nout-of-domain distribution generalization. In this study, we introduce a novel\napproach called Dynamic Few-Shot Learning (DFSL). DFSL integrates the\nefficiency of in-context learning and semantic similarity and provides a\ngenerally applicable solution for KGQA with state-of-the-art performance. We\nrun an extensive evaluation across multiple benchmark datasets and architecture\nconfigurations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PXDQ82u9FLgfsmtyFokLkF-YvgbC6GuUAxF8aqhcQzk","pdfSize":"776584"}
