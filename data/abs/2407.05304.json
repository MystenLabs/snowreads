A violation of this inequality implies either the absence of\na realistic description of the system or the impracticality of noninvasive\nmeasurements. In this work, we investigate the violation of the LGI for the\nsystem of bosons in a double-well potential. Specifically, we explore the\nviolation of the LGI in the dynamics of bosons in a double-well potential in\nthe Bose-Einstein-Condensation (BEC) regime, where the system can be considered\nas two weakly coupled Bose condensates, and in the single-particle regime to\nestablish the conditions under which the violation of the LGI occurs. Our\nanalysis reveals that the LGI is violated due to Josephson oscillations, while\nit remains unviolated in the strong coupling regime, attributed to the\nself-trapping phenomena. Notably, we observe that the violation of the LGI\nbecomes increasingly significant as the particle number increases. These\nfindings provide valuable insights into the macrorealistic behavior of Bose\ncondensates and highlight the effect of measurements on the dynamics of a\nmacroscopic system.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2JAK3Jw-Pu4JLtMzda6z7kYBv1RV-ymjjkJAkGQqiX8","pdfSize":"975464"}
