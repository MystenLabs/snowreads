The noise could appear in as few as four directions and the intensity of\nthe noise depends on the solution. The case of additive Gaussian noise was\ntreated in Hairer and Mattingly [\\emph{Ann. of Math.}, 164(3):993--1032, 2006].\nTo obtain ergodic and mixing properties, we use Malliavin calculus to establish\nthe asymptotically strong Feller property. The main difficulty lies in the\nproof of the \"invertibility\" of Malliavin matrix which is totally different\nfrom the additive case.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"XEFeMkIRk8daBFpcxkIvDFJElKWMGvGnc_AvbSLcngU","pdfSize":"483733"}
