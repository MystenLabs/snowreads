Depth resolution was achieved by placing an ultra-thin layer of\n57Fe at both interfaces (Tb/57Fe/Fe/57FeTb). Intentionally, both 57Fe layers\nwere assumed to have different hyperfine fields and orientations. Based on\ntheoretical simulations, it is demonstrated that the antinode regions of XSWs\ngenerated through the W/Si multilayer structure allow one to independently\nmeasure the Fe-on-Tb and Tb-on-Fe interface at different incident angles. These\ntheoretical simulations of NRS patterns at different incident angles correspond\nto 57Fe layers independently in the Tb/Fe/Tb trilayer. The present work shows\nthe capability of combining XSW and GI-NRS to study buried magnetic interfaces\nin thin film structures.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EgiNF13a64x_yRN-5mGgQW-l1PGxz1OKQUmQes4ejsw","pdfSize":"169458"}
