  "abstract": "  Under consideration are mathematical models of heat and mass transfer. We\nstudy inverse problems of recovering lower-order coefficients in a second order\nparabolic equation. The coefficients are representable in the form of a finite\nsegments of the series whose coefficients depending on time are to be\ndetermined. The linear case is also considered.\n  The overdetermination conditions are the integrals over the boundary of the\ndomain of a solution with weights. The main attention is paid to existence,\nuniqueness, and stability estimates for solutions to inverse problems of this\ntype. The problem is reduced to an operator equation which is studied with the\nuse of the fixed point theorem and a priori estimates. A solution has all\ngeneralized derivatives occurring into the equation summable to some power. The\nmethod of the proof is constructive and it can be used for developing new\nnumerical algorithms of solving the problem.\n",
