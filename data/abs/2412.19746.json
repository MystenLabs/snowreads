Here, we extend the two-mode analysis to multiple\nmodes, particularly mode-locked pulsed lasers, and show that collective\nparticle states of multiple light modes feature a significantly larger number\nof dark than bright states. By linking interference in time-independent\nmulti-slit experiments (same-mode frequencies) to time-dependent multimode\nexperiments (different frequencies), we demonstrate that pulsed laser light\ncomprises a continuous photon beam, with photons forming bright states during\npulses and dark states between them. To confirm this, we analyzed mode-locked\nlasers, finding that the ratio of the number of bright to dark states aligns\nwith the pulse-to-interval duration ratio.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"forTdK5F9EHftvJ3ZMcJf06KDu8R4n9CoHUhA1rVvn8","pdfSize":"997718"}
