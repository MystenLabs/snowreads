The dual quasar phase represents\na distinctive stage during the interaction between two galaxies for\ninvestigating quasar fueling and feedback effects on the gas reservoir. The\ndual quasars were selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Subaru/Hyper\nSuprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program, with confirmatory spectroscopic\nvalidation. Based on the detection of the CO J=2--1 emission line with Band 4,\nwe derived key properties including CO luminosities, line widths, and molecular\ngas masses for these systems. Among the ten quasars of the five pairs, eight\nhave line detections exceeding $5\\sigma$. The detected sources prominently\nharbor substantial molecular gas reservoirs, with molecular gas masses\n($M_{\\text{molgas}}$) between $10^{9.6-10.5}~\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$, and molecular\ngas-to-stellar mass ratios ($\\mu_{\\text{molgas}}$) spanning $18-97\\%$. The\noverall $\\mu_{\\text{molgas}}$ of these dual quasars agrees with that of\ninactive star-forming main-sequence galaxies at comparable redshifts,\nindicating no clear evidence of quenching. However, intriguing features in each\nindividual system show possible evidence of AGN feedback, matter transfer, and\ncompaction processes.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hJkRovMFaL0tudSneLtXf9_EWLEeMRS6AZuWYl7B94M","pdfSize":"4807296"}
