To overcome these challenges, including the\ninability to observe and record in-context user interactions, increased task\nload, and difficulties with in-context data analysis and discussion, we\nintroduce PilotAR (https://github.com/Synteraction-Lab/PilotAR), a tool\ndesigned iteratively to enhance AR/MR pilot studies, allowing live first-person\nand third-person views, multi-modal annotations, flexible wizarding interfaces,\nand multi-experimenter support.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"twYuOIdTKIpsywvrWwc6gUM4YpUco_L96E3bjRQ8a8I","pdfSize":"3710490"}
