However, there is a lack of diversity in CS learning\napproaches. Traditional teaching methods and hands-on learning dominate this\nfield, with limited use of playful and interactive learning methods such as\neducational games. This gap is particularly evident in game development as a\nsubfield of CS. To address this problem, we present a game-based learning\napproach to teach foundational concepts for game development. The paper aims to\nexpand the educational landscape within CSE, offering a unique and engaging\nplatform for learners to explore the intricacies of game creation by\nintegrating gamified learning strategies. In this paper, we investigate the\nuser's learning experience and motivation, and the differences between\ntraditional learning and game-based learning methods for teaching game\ndevelopment concepts. The study involves 57 participants in an AB test to\nassess learners' motivation, user experience, and learning outcomes. The\nresults indicate a significantly increased learning outcome for the game-based\nlearning approach, as well as higher motivation in learning game development\nconcepts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"i2lsAKEnBbrYBw_7cm95rzEUGOzw8npyLU0eDWLzhkA","pdfSize":"1400928"}
