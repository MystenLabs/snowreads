  "abstract": "  This paper examines the late-time accelerating Universe and the formation of\nlarge-scale structures within the modified symmetric teleparallel gravity\nframework, specifically using the $f(Q)$-gravity model, in light of recent\ncosmological data. After reviewing the background history of the Universe, and\nthe linear cosmological perturbations, we consider the toy model $F(Q) =\n\\alpha\\sqrt{Q}+\\beta$ ( where $Q$ represents nonmetricity, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$\nare model parameters) for further analysis. To evaluate the cosmological\nviability of this model, we utilize 57 Observational Hubble Data (OHD) points,\n1048 supernovae distance modulus measurements (SNIa), their combined analysis\n(OHD+SNIa), 14 growth rate data points (f-data), and 30 redshift-space\ndistortions (f$\\sigma_8$) datasets. Through a detailed statistical analysis,\nthe comparison between our model and $\\Lambda$CDM has been conducted after we\ncompute the best-fit values through the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nsimulations. Based on the results, we obtain the Hubble parameter, $H_0 =\n69.20^{+4.40}_{{-}2.10}$ and the amplitude of the matter power spectrum\nnormalization $\\sigma_8 = 0.827^{+0.03}_{{-}0.01}$. These values suggest that\nour model holds significant promise in addressing the cosmological tensions.\n",
