  "abstract": "  Distillation in lattice QCD is a smearing method that uses the lowest\neigenvectors of the spatial Laplacian to construct a subspace in which the\nDirac operator can be fully inverted. However, local multiquark interpolators\nare expensive in this framework because the cost of the contractions scales\nwith a high power of the number of Laplacian eigenvectors. To address this, a\nposition-space sampling method within distillation is presented that avoids\nthis cost scaling. Our simulations show that this method works well for meson\noperators, but also for local tetraquark operators. In a preliminary study, we\ninvestigate the relevance of the latter for the ground state energy of the\n$T_{cc}(3875)^+$ tetraquark. There we find a downward shift in the lowest level\nwhen local tetraquark operators are added to a basis of bilocal scattering\noperators in the variational method. However, this shift is small compared to\nthe error of the energy.\n",
