Safe and accurate ship control algorithms\nare crucial to realize automated operation. Actuator drive constraints of a\ntarget ship may jeopardize the stability of the control law and require complex\ntheory. In this study, we include a penalty term to the control law gain\noptimization stage of dynamic positioning systems to account for the amounts by\nwhich the actuator input value and its rate of change exceed the constraint.\nThe parameters for generating a suitable reference path for the control law are\nidentified simultaneously with the control gains. The simulation results show\nthat the proposed method can realize control parameters and a reference design\nwith excellent tracking performance while determining the cost of the\ncontroller design by considering the effects of both the actuators and rate\nsaturation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"GwFUbbwAYanqAsJLtxs8xNNJ3S_Cg9N4tUBGpoVC16I","pdfSize":"1370633"}
