  "abstract": "  We analyze in detail the interactions between non-topological soliton\n(Q-ball) and its perturbations. We extend the previous literature by carefully\nidentifying the domain of applicability of linear analysis as well discussion\nof the FLS Q-balls. Applications to the early universe physics are briefly\ncommented.\n",
