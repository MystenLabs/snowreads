This complicates\nexperiments, as off-the-shelf regression estimators at least assume known\nnetwork topologies (if not fully independent observations) when Sybil network\ntopologies in practice are often unknown. The literature has exclusively\nfocused on techniques to detect Sybil networks, leading many experimenters to\nsubsequently exclude suspected networks entirely before estimating treatment\neffects. I present a more efficient solution in the presence of these suspected\nSybil networks: a weighted regression framework that applies weights based on\nthe probabilities that sets of observations are controlled by single actors. I\nshow in the paper that the MSE-minimizing solution is to set the weight matrix\nequal to the inverse of the expected network topology. I demonstrate the\nmethodology on simulated data, and then I apply the technique to a competition\nwith suspected Sybil networks run on the Sui blockchain and show reductions in\nthe standard error of the estimate by 6 - 24%.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"4NNe0V5ECIoMPrnwN_LMuO8mYA9FLhNlukU4zrrKmy8","pdfSize":"674859"}
