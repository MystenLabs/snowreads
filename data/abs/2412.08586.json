  "abstract": "  We give a new construction of binary quantum codes that enables the\ngeneration of a CSS-T code from any given CSS code. Using this construction, we\nprove the existence of asymptotically good binary CSS-T codes, resolving a\npreviously open problem in the literature. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the\nsame result holds for binary quantum low-density parity check CSS-T codes, and\nestablish the existence of asymptotically good CSS codes that support any given\n$Z$ rotation transversally. Finally, we analyze the structure of the logical\noperators corresponding to certain non-Clifford gates supported by the quantum\ncodes obtained from our construction.\n",
