This paper presents an innovative\nframework for KPI construction within performance evaluation systems,\nleveraging Random Forest algorithms and variable importance analysis. The\nproposed approach identifies key variables that significantly influence PA\nperformance, offering valuable insights into the critical factors driving\norganizational success. By integrating variable importance analysis with expert\nconsultation, relevant KPIs can be systematically developed, ensuring that\nimprovement strategies address performance-critical areas. The framework\nincorporates continuous monitoring mechanisms and adaptive phases to refine\nKPIs in response to evolving administrative needs. This study aims to enhance\nPA performance through the application of machine learning techniques,\nfostering a more agile and results-driven approach to public administration.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"efVeD-Pv6KDJD4Zyii88osSWBfcakNMXNcV4Osrb_no","pdfSize":"270503"}
