Additionally, a minimum satisfaction level is\nrequired for the customers in each region. This satisfaction is measured\nthrough continuous preference functions that reflect the satisfaction degree of\neach location in the region. We provide a mathematical optimization-based\nframework for the problem and derive suitable Mixed Integer Second Order Cone\noptimization models for some interesting situations: norm-based transportation\ncosts for the services to the entry points, and different families of\npreference functions. Among these preference functions, we highlight those\nderived from economic production models and distance-based preferences. We\nconduct an extensive computational study along two main lines: a computational\napproach, where we provide optimal solutions for up to 500 demand regions in\nthe single-facility case and up to $50$ for the p-facility case; and a\nqualitative approach, where we analyze whether the incorporation of preferences\nis statistically significant compared to the case without preferences.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"fu7jHEcXdfNj3hxTBR229OSKtPhqqUQgQZfUNPoez4Q","pdfSize":"5727559"}
