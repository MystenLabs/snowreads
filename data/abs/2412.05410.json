Given $f$ in the reduced C$^*$-algebra\n$C_r^*(\\Sigma;G)$ with open support $U \\subseteq G$ we ask when $f$ lies in the\nclosure of the compactly supported sections on $U$. Suppose $G$ satisfies the\nrapid decay property with respect to a length function $L$. We give a positive\nanswer to our question in two instances: when $L$ is conditionally\nnegative-definite, and when $L$ is the square-root of a locally negative type\nfunction on $G$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"W9KCqzz4QJ0MmhvMUpJAmOmsWLLlLmF3WR2_NvRll3U","pdfSize":"240397"}
