Here we demonstrate the spatial control and detection of single\nelectrons above the surface of liquid helium at temperatures above 1 K. A\nsuperconducting coplanar waveguide resonator is used to read out the charge\nstate of an electron trap defined by gate electrodes beneath the helium\nsurface. Dispersive frequency shifts are observed as the trap is loaded with\nelectrons, from several tens down to single electrons. These frequency shifts\nare in good agreement with our theoretical model that treats each electron as a\nclassical oscillator coupled to the cavity field. This sensitive charge readout\nscheme can aid efforts to develop large-scale quantum processors that require\nthe high cooling powers available in cryostats operating above 1 K.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PlO8D_2BHTd5IgLg4PNESGlMkwjUCyxbYVwky5-mp1k","pdfSize":"4117887"}
