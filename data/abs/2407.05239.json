This work studies\nthe question of how to guide the path selection choices made by those\nonline-arriving users and maximize the social welfare. Competitive analysis is\nthe main technical tool. Specifically, the impacts of path length bounds and\ntopology on the competitive ratio of the designed algorithm are analyzed\ntheoretically and explored experimentally. We observe intricate and interesting\nrelationships between the empirical performance and the studied network\nparameters, which shed some light on how to design the network. We also\ninvestigate the influence of system-level costs on the optimal algorithm\ndesign.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Aau43fqep3xGjsxtUdBo2N7wwsC6CM7i2FmN_NxI7Aw","pdfSize":"1387195"}
