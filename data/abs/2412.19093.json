  "abstract": "  Structural softness - often characterized by unstable phonon modes and large\nelectromechanical responses - is a hallmark of ferroelectric perovskites like\nBaTiO3 or Pb(Ti,Zr)O3. Whether HfO2 ferroelectrics present any such structural\nsoftness is still a matter of debate. Here, using first principles\ncalculations, we predict that it is possible to induce structural instabilities\nin hafnia. More specifically, our calculations show that in-plane epitaxial\ntensile strain causes a mechanical instability of the ferroelectric phase,\nwhich transforms discontinuously into an antipolar polymorph. Then, upon\nrelease of the tensile strain, the antipolar polymorph transforms back to the\nferroelectric state by a soft phonon instability. We show that the softening is\naccompanied by enhancements in the dielectric and piezoelectric responses.\nWhile these transitions occur at high epitaxial strains for pure ferroelectric\nHfO2, we show that the required deformations are considerably lowered in\nsuperlattices with other simple oxides, which may facilitate realizing these\neffects experimentally.\n",
