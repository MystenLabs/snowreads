The underlying cognitive control\ninvolved in the process of human motion is inherently complex, dynamic,\nmultidimensional, and highly non-linear. The dynamics produced by the internal\nand external forces and the body's ability to react to them is biomechanics.\nComplex and non-rigid bodies, needs a lot of computing power and systems to\nexecute however, in the absence of adequate resources, one may rely on new\ntechnology, machine learning tools and model order reduction approaches. It is\nalso believed that machine learning approaches can enable us to embrace this\ncomplexity, if we could use three arms of ML i.e. predictive modeling,\nclassification, and dimensionality reduction. Biomechanics, since it deals with\nmotion and mobility come with a huge set of data over time. Using computational\n(Computer Solvers), Numerical approaches (MOR) and technological advances\n(Wearable sensors), can let us develop computationally inexpensive frameworks\nfor biomechanics focused studies dealing with a huge amount of data. A lot of\nmisunderstanding arises because of extensive data, standardization of the tools\nto process this, database for the material property definitions, validation and\nverification of biomechanical models and analytical tools to model various\nphenomena using computational and modelling techniques. Study of biomechanics\nthrough computational simulations can improve the prevention and treatment of\ndiseases, predict the injury to reduce the risk and hence can strengthen\npivotal sectors like sports and lifestyle. This is why we choose to present all\nthose challenges and problems associated with biomechanical simulation with\ncomplex geometries fail so as to help improve, analysis, performance and design\nfor better lifestyle.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TuYUXwb2YsS887a1G-BPwG54hymbl_OkUCoN-Tsqqho","pdfSize":"390381"}
