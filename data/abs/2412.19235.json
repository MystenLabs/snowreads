A method for strictly deterministic initialization of a neural network\nwith one hidden layer for solving physical problems described by an ODE is\nproposed. Modifications to existing methods for weighting the loss function are\ngiven, as well as new methods developed for training strictly\ndeterministic-initialized neural networks to solve ODEs (detaching, additional\nweighting based on the second derivative, predicted solution-based weighting,\nrelative residuals). An algorithm for physics-informed data-driven\ninitialization of a neural network with one hidden layer is proposed. A neural\nnetwork with pronounced generalizing properties is presented, whose\ngeneralizing abilities of which can be precisely controlled by adjusting\nnetwork parameters. A metric for measuring the generalization of such neural\nnetwork has been introduced. A gradient-free neuron-by-neuron fitting method\nhas been developed for adjusting the parameters of a single-hidden-layer neural\nnetwork, which does not require the use of an optimizer or solver for its\nimplementation. The proposed methods have been extended to 2D problems using\nthe separable physics-informed neural networks approach. Numerous experiments\nhave been carried out to develop the above methods and approaches. Experiments\non physical problems, such as solving various ODEs and PDEs, have demonstrated\nthat these methods for initializing and training neural networks with one or\ntwo hidden layers (SPINN) achieve competitive accuracy and, in some cases,\nstate-of-the-art results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7Kdg6CjtZjznv0zKvXNtTW7oSm8eiejZEbvMUkME2X8","pdfSize":"10808080"}
