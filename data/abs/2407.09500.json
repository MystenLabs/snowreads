In particular, we examine the target\nmetrics and evaluation methods used in the existing ERS research, with a\nparticular focus on the pedagogical effect of recommendations. While conducting\nthis systematic literature review (SLR), we identified 1395 potentially\nrelevant papers, then filtered them through the inclusion and exclusion\ncriteria, and finally selected and analyzed 28 relevant papers. Rating-based\nrelevance is the most popular target metric, while less than a half of papers\noptimize learning-based metrics. Only a third of the papers used outcome-based\nassessment to measure the pedagogical effect of recommendations, mostly within\na formal university course. This indicates a gap in ERS research with respect\nto assessing the pedagogical effect of recommendations at scale and in informal\neducation settings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XR5t3deD2ObOGs7rjjVhVQP1DRi8KdL-2p-ZUBKQOvY","pdfSize":"878574","objectId":"0x4a1c6c4b9f86ed90ddfa693de29682f74d6ef6b913da710b8460e8459b108d32","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
