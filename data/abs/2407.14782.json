Many such platforms offer a limited set of calibrated\ngates and compile other gates, such as the Y gate, using combinations of X and\nvirtual Z gates. Here, we show that the method of compilation has important\nconsequences in an open quantum system setting. Specifically, we experimentally\ndemonstrate that it is crucial to choose a compilation that is symmetric with\nrespect to virtual Z rotations. This is particularly pronounced in dynamical\ndecoupling (DD) sequences, where improper gate decomposition can result in\nunintended effects such as the implementation of the wrong sequence. Our\nfindings indicate that in many cases the performance of DD is adversely\naffected by the incorrect use of virtual Z gates, compounding other coherent\npulse errors. In addition, we identify another source of coherent errors:\ninterference between consecutive pulses that follow each other too closely.\nThis work provides insights into improving general quantum gate performance and\noptimizing DD sequences in particular.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3PKpuE0dX2aks4nuYesr2VcFfV_rVJPWWy2hqTfwNok","pdfSize":"1858255","objectId":"0xae067d1f5f03e26e1ef8c063c0c056b35358ec1a2970a99e88c8c8dfff35b782","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
