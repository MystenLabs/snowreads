  "abstract": "  The main goal of Eco-Driving (ED) is to maximize energy efficiency. This\nstudy evaluates the energy gains of an ED system for an electric vehicle,\nobtained from a predictive optimal controller, in a real-world traffic\nscenario. To this end, a Visual driver Advisory System (VAS) in the form of a\npersonal tablet is used to advise the driver to follow a target eco-speed via a\nscreen. Two Renault Zoe electric cars, one equipped with the different modules\nfor ED and one without, are used to perform field tests on a route between\nRueil-Malmaison and Bougival in France. Overall, the ED consumed, on average,\n4.6~$\\%$ less energy than the non-eco-driven car with a maximum of 2~$\\%$\nchange in average speed.\n",
