Given the limited resources for space observations\nwhere the atmosphere is absent, we want to make these measurements from the\nground. However, it is difficult from the ground because it requires an\nadaptive optics system to provide an extremely well corrected wavefront to\nenable coronographic techniques. Currently only natural guide star AO systems\nhave demonstrated the necessary wavefront correction for direct imaging of\nexoplanets. However, using a stellar source as the guide star for wavefront\nsensing limits the number of exoplanet systems we can directly image because it\nrequires a relatively bright V~10 mag star. To increase the number of\nobservable targets, we need to push the limit of natural guide stars to fainter\nmagnitudes with high Strehl ratio correction. We propose to combine laser guide\nstar (LGS) and natural guide star (NGS) wavefront sensing to achieve the high\nStrehl correction with fainter natural guide stars. We call this approach\nHybrid Atmospheric Phase Analysis (HAPA); 'hapa' in Hawaiian means 'half' or\n'of mixed ethnic heritage'. The relatively bright LGS is used for higher order\ncorrection, whereas the NGS is used for high accuracy lower order correction.\nWe focus on demonstrating this approach using Robo-AO-2 at the UH 2.2m\ntelescope on Maunakea with a UV Rayleigh laser at 355 nm. The laser focuses at\n10 km altitude and has an equivalent magnitude of m_U~8. In this report\nspecifically, we present simulated results of HAPA employed at Robo-AO-2, with\nthe LGS system having a single configuration of 16x16 subaperture\nShack-Hartmann wavefront sensor and the NGS system having 6 different\nconfigurations -- 16x16, 8x8, 5x5, 4x4, 2x2 and 1x1. We also discuss the on-sky\nexperiments we plan to carry out with HAPA at the UH 2.2m telescope.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6clVfnrQg_rjCSVvhwFZMybX0AGCFbrJXOeD170H3Ns","pdfSize":"610352"}
