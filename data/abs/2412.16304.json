  "abstract": "  We present a sensing scheme for estimating the frequency difference of two\nnon-entangled photons. The technique consists of time-resolving sampling\nmeasurements at the output of a beam splitter. With this protocol, the\nfrequency shift between two photons can be estimated with the ultimate\nprecision achievable in nature, overcoming the limits in precision and the\nrange of detection of frequency-resolving detectors employed in standard direct\nmeasurements of the frequencies. The sensitivity can be increased by increasing\nthe coherence time of the photons. We show that, already with $\\sim 1000$\nsampling measurements, the Cram\\'{e}r-Rao bound is saturated independently of\nthe value of the difference in frequency.\n",
