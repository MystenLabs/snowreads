One application of fMRI is investigating potential\nneural features that distinguish people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)\nfrom healthy controls. The Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE)\nfacilitates this research through its extensive data-sharing initiative. While\nABIDE offers data preprocessed with various atlases, independent component\nanalysis (ICA) for dimensionality reduction remains underutilized. We address\nthis gap by presenting ICA-based resting-state networks (RSNs) from\npreprocessed scans from ABIDE, now publicly available:\nhttps://github.com/SjirSchielen/groupICAonABIDE. These RSNs unveil neural\nactivation clusters without atlas constraints, offering a perspective on ASD\nanalyses that complements the predominantly atlas-based literature. This\ncontribution provides a valuable resource for further research into ASD,\npotentially aiding in developing new analytical approaches.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"rlWJ0QK_Va9LlHLYWtcCPjxeh3E9oSNbZQW8zo9KCdE","pdfSize":"3432438"}
