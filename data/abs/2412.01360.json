However, the highly\nscattering nature of near-infrared light in human tissue makes it challenging\nto collect photons emerging from more than 4 cm below the scalp, or with\nsource-detector separation larger than several centimeters. We explore the\nphysical limits of photon transport in the head and show that despite an\nextreme attenuation of ~10^(18), we can experimentally detect light that is\ntransmitted diametrically through the entire adult human head. Analysis of\nvarious photon migration pathways through the head also indicates how the\nsource-detector configuration can be used to isolate photons interacting with\ndeep regions of the brain that are inaccessible with current optical\ntechniques.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EoOHW-hra8FuO5t6uTscLt60tN3eKRwRCp76Al47B5Y","pdfSize":"3543176"}
