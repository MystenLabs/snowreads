Instead, well-established\nregistration-specific designs offer fair improvements, enhancing results by a\nmarginal 1.5\\% over the baseline. Our findings emphasize the importance of\nrigorous, unbiased evaluation and contribution disentanglement of all low- and\nhigh-level registration components, rather than simply following the computer\nvision trends with \"more advanced\" computational blocks. We advocate for\nsimpler yet effective solutions and novel evaluation metrics that go beyond\nconventional registration accuracy, warranting further research across diverse\norgans and modalities.
