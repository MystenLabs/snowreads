  "abstract": "  We present the first formal correctness proof of Edmonds' blossom shrinking\nalgorithm for maximum cardinality matching in general graphs. We focus on\nformalising the mathematical structures and properties that allow the algorithm\nto run in worst-case polynomial running time. We formalise Berge's lemma,\nblossoms and their properties, and a mathematical model of the algorithm,\nshowing that it is totally correct. We provide the first detailed proofs of\nmany of the facts underlying the algorithm's correctness.\n",
