These active worms spread in\ncrowded environments, with a dynamics dependent on both the concentration and\narrangement of obstacles. In contrast to passive polymers, our results reveal\nthat in disordered configurations, increasing the pillar density enhances the\nlong-time diffusion of our active polymer-like worms, while we observe the\nopposite trend in ordered pillar arrays. We found that in disordered media,\nliving worms reptate through available curvilinear tubes, whereas they become\ntrapped within pores of ordered media. Intriguingly, we show that reducing the\nworm's activity significantly boosts its spread, enabling passive sorting of\nworms by activity level. Our experimental observations are corroborated through\nsimulations of the tangentially-driven polymer model.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"k8QBn2cZWf2aZkxNoFQdaKPcfjA_bsGbg4jm09GdwIo","pdfSize":"12196523"}
