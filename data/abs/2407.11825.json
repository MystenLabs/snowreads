Using\ntechniques from large deviations and extreme-value theory, we show how the\noptimal value scales as the prescribed bound on the violation probability\nbecomes small and how convex programs emerge in the limit. We also use our\nresults to show that the popular CVaR approximation is asymptotically optimal\nunder light-tail assumptions, but it is sub-optimal in a heavy-tailed setting.\nThen, we apply point process techniques and random set theory to study the\nsuboptimality gap in the Monte Carlo based scenario approach.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Kqn9aigMrPsIuDGSosx0-8xL1UjOykRXj1KBh4_pp0c","pdfSize":"288340"}
