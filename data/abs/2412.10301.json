As an\napplication we characterize the distinguished $U^*(2n)$ connection studied in\n\\cite{Bat} and \\cite{Hit3} in this setting.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"peZrLIf5UUhMKDHfJeYtNMT8R83uZyAyNGrmUl2fhzM","pdfSize":"177207"}
