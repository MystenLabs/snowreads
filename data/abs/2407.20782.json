Here we study the boundedness problem for Unions of Conjunctive\nRegular Path Queries (UCRPQs), a navigational query language extensively used\nin ontology and graph database querying. The boundedness problem for UCRPQs is\nExpSpace-complete. Here we focus our analysis on UCRPQs using simple regular\nexpressions, which are of high practical relevance and enjoy a lower reasoning\ncomplexity. We show that the complexity for the boundedness problem for this\nUCRPQs fragment is $\\Pi^P_2$-complete, and that an equivalent bounded query can\nbe produced in polynomial time whenever possible. When the query turns out to\nbe unbounded, we also study the task of finding an equivalent maximally bounded\nquery, which we show to be feasible in $\\Pi^P_2$. As a side result of\nindependent interest stemming from our developments, we study a notion of\nsuccinct finite automata and prove that its membership problem is in NP.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6k5WrrnT7t1aZFHXZ3ycdii_a68e0UQOzhkW0DehFyE","pdfSize":"2978998"}
