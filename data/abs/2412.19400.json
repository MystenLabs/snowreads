In the first\norder, we obtain $\\rho_{00}=1/3$, meaning that the contributions from thermal\nvorticity and shear stress tensor are vanishing. The non-vanishing\ncontributions to $\\rho_{00}-1/3$ appear in the second order of gradients in the\nBelinfante and canonical cases. We also discuss the properties of the spin\ndensity matrix under the time reversal transformation. The effective transport\ncoefficient for the spin alignment induced by the thermal shear stress tensor\nis T-odd in the first order, implying that the first order effect is\ndissipative.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aoEsaX-T7BNTvD7-53vhRtEmtbKqRljEZkZEkSSj0Z4","pdfSize":"321378"}
