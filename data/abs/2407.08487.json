We show that for generic\n$\\operatorname{PSL}_{2k-1}(\\mathbb{R})$-Hitchin representations $\\rho$, the\nmiddle eigenvalue of $\\rho(x)$ is not equal to 1 for all non-trivial elements\n$x\\in \\pi_1(S)$. Using the same technique, we prove that the set of strongly\ndense $G$-Hitchin representations is generic. This generalizes the result of\nLong, Reid and Wolff for the $G=\\operatorname{PSL}_n(\\mathbb{R})$ case.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"s4KfBZWLVlS4mdfS5U67kgC8YXHAoCoUvM04SDKCHZQ","pdfSize":"494597"}
