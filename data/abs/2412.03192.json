The first stage\ndoes not use backpropagation. Rather, it exploits the bio-inspired Hebbian\nprinciple \"fire together, wire together\" as a local learning rule for updating\nthe weights of both convolutional and transpose-convolutional layers, allowing\nunsupervised discovery of data features. In the second stage, the model is\nfine-tuned with standard backpropagation on a small subset of labeled data. We\nevaluate our methodology through experiments conducted on several widely used\nbiomedical datasets, deeming that this domain is paramount in computer vision\nand is notably impacted by data scarcity. Results show that our proposed method\noutperforms SOTA approaches across different levels of label availability.\nFurthermore, we show that using our unsupervised stage to initialize the SOTA\napproaches leads to performance improvements.
