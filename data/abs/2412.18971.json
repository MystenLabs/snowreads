Effective\nsleep disorder prediction from lifestyle and physiological data can provide\nessential details for early intervention. This research utilizes three deep\ntime series models and facilitates them with explainability approaches for\nsleep disorder prediction. Specifically, our approach adopts Temporal\nConvolutional Networks (TCN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for time series\ndata analysis, and Temporal Fusion Transformer model (TFT). Meanwhile, the\ntemporal attention mechanism and counterfactual explanation with SHapley\nAdditive exPlanations (SHAP) approach are employed to ensure dependable,\naccurate, and interpretable predictions. Finally, using a large dataset of\nsleep health measures, our evaluation demonstrates the effect of our method in\npredicting sleep disorders.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NtLISTyrRK-_n3TD2ciPzT9HU-BH_VD7k2gmPxYzM5U","pdfSize":"472875"}
