In the\npolarized case, we work in the Larin scheme and refer to parton distribution\nfunctions in this scheme. Furthermore, results on the three-loop variable\nflavor number scheme are presented\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"S1MvMvVJtZybY0G1SebnCBETNgc_qWWJyCuvmpY3phQ","pdfSize":"497805"}
