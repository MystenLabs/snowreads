  "abstract": "  We present our calculation of the isospin-violating part of the hadronic\nvacuum polarisation (HVP) contribution to muon $(g-2)$ in lattice QCD at the\n$SU(3)_{\\mathrm{f}}$ symmetric point. The computation of the contributing fully\nconnected diagrams with one internal photon as well as the computation of the\nonly (mass) counterterm are shown. The latter is determined from the\ncharged-neutral kaon mass splitting. We employ coordinate-space methods and a\nphoton propagator which is regulated \\`a la Pauli-Villars with a cutoff scale\n$\\Lambda$ well below the lattice cutoff. This regularization makes it possible\nfor us to do crosschecks of individual contributions with calculations in the\ncontinuum. Our continuum extrapolated results show little to no dependence on\n$\\Lambda$. This makes our final limit $\\Lambda \\rightarrow \\infty$\nstraightforward.\n",
