In this model, revising agents have\na higher probability of comparing their current strategy with other strategies\nthat they deem similar, and they switch to the observed strategy with\nprobability proportional to its payoff excess. Because of this implicit bias\ntoward similar strategies, the resulting dynamics - which we call the nested\nreplicator dynamics - do not satisfy any of the standard monotonicity\npostulates for imitative game dynamics; nonetheless, we show that they retain\nthe main long-run rationality properties of the replicator dynamics, albeit at\nquantitatively different rates. We also show that the induced dynamics can be\nviewed as a stimulus-response model in the spirit of Erev & Roth (1998), with\nchoice probabilities given by the nested logit choice rule of Ben-Akiva (1973)\nand McFadden (1978). This result generalizes an existing relation between the\nreplicator dynamics and the exponential weights algorithm in online learning,\nand provides an additional layer of interpretation to our analysis and results.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zwKydl_--VQ1PTAmqWkwxZ4Ea8CdgtZ7adpfn5iZXwQ","pdfSize":"2279836"}
