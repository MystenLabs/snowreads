Formalized: space (state of the object, control\nactions, goals, observed values, analytical estimates). Analytical estimates of\nthe state of a dynamic system are formed through the autocorrelation function.\nThe autocorrelation function is calculated with the regulator setting the\nlength of the analyzed time series (analysis depth). A digital copy of the\nproduction system is created, characterized by 1.2 million parameters. Modeling\nthe activities of the production system is performed in the author's complex of\nprograms. In total, twenty-eight controller states are calculated to analyze\nthe effect of repeating parameters affecting the activity of the production\nsystem. The simulation shows the cyclical dynamics of changes in the\nautocorrelation function. Formalization of the production system is carried\nout, which allows you to move on to other methods of analysis of the production\nsystem: Kalman filter, neural network forecast, recurrence equation, balances.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GdY3KYZFlaVUmJCeHGKwC-o6hK-c_2d4R64yc_W3BVU","pdfSize":"707056"}
