However, unlike the\nacclaimed entropy-regularized optimal transport, the effect of quadratic\nregularization on the transport problem is not well understood from a\nmathematical standpoint. In this work, we take a first step towards its\nunderstanding. We prove that the difference between the cost of optimal\ntransport and its regularized version multiplied by the ratio\n$\\varepsilon^{-\\frac{2}{d+2}}$ converges to a nontrivial limit as the\nregularization parameter $\\varepsilon$ tends to 0. The proof confirms a\nconjecture from Zhang et al. (2023) where it is claimed that a modification of\nthe self-similar solution of the porous medium equation, the Barenblatt--Pattle\nsolution, can be used as an approximate solution of the regularized transport\ncost for small values of $\\varepsilon$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bh3VJ0_XlqbotRh8ut6hgS_EwYceZLV8cS91jE9cZMU","pdfSize":"748015","objectId":"0x8d233b09a6eae5674103a66828fc73d9cabbf84cec9f2bd43ac954aebb5e3d35","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
