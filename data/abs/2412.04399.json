  "abstract": "  We present an approach for augmenting Gaussian atomic orbitals with correct\nnuclear cusps. Like the atomic orbital basis set itself, and unlike previous\ncusp corrections, this approach is independent of the many-body method used to\nprepare wave functions for quantum Monte Carlo. Once the basis set and\nmolecular geometry are specified, the cusp-corrected atomic orbitals are\nuniquely specified, regardless of which density functionals, quantum chemistry\nmethods, or subsequent variational Monte Carlo optimizations are employed. We\nanalyze the statistical improvement offered by these cusps in a number of\nmolecules and find them to offer similar advantages as molecular-orbital-based\napproaches while maintaining independence from the choice of many-body method.\n",
