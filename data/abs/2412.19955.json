MACS J0138.0-2155 lenses a source galaxy at z=1.95 which\nhosts two strongly lensed supernovae, Requiem and Encore. We find MACS\nJ0138.0-2155 to have an X-ray temperature of 6.7 +/- 0.4 keV and a velocity\ndispersion of cluster member galaxies of 718^{+132}_{-182} km/s, which indicate\na cluster mass of ~5 x 10^{14} solar masses. The round morphology of the X-ray\nemission indicates that this cluster is relaxed with an ellipticity within the\nlensing region of e=0.12 +/- 0.03. Using 18 of the brightest, non-blended,\nquiescent galaxies, we fit the cluster specific Faber-Jackson relation,\nincluding a set of 81 variations in the analysis choices to estimate the\nsystematic uncertainties in our results. We find a slope of alpha = 0.26 +/-\n0.06 (stat.) +/- 0.03 (sys.) with an intrinsic scatter of 31^{+8}_{-6} (stat.)\n+/- 4 (sys.) km/s at a reference velocity dispersion of ~220 km/s. We also\nreport on significant galaxies along the line-of-sight potentially impacting\nthe lens modeling, including a massive galaxy with stellar velocity dispersion\nof 291 +/- 3 km/s$ which lies close in projection to the central cluster\ngalaxy. This galaxy is part of a small group at a slightly higher redshift than\nthe cluster.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"igeJee7Gjj3AZSvW3yAlKKgNjAtAv4WOoOsU0OOK5TM","pdfSize":"1581851"}
