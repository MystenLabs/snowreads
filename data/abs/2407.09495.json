Through this list, we can observe\nthe dearth of datasets in different languages: only 23 different languages are\nrepresented. With the addition of the Crossmodal-3600 dataset (Thapliyal et\nal., 2022, 36 languages) this number increases somewhat, but still this number\nis tiny compared to the thousands of spoken languages that exist. This paper\ncloses with some open questions for the field of Vision & Language.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QLvK3x-kIgfTx5oh09N5h7zed_gNtUdaQWu_e_ONJpY","pdfSize":"200983"}
