The proposed validity index exploits inter-cluster\nproximity between fuzzy clusters. Inter-cluster proximity is used to measure\nthe degree of overlap between clusters. A low proximity value refers to\nwell-partitioned clusters. The best fuzzy c-partition is obtained by minimizing\ninter-cluster proximity with respect to c. Well-known data sets are tested to\nshow the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed index.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"KPr9rXAgnk3kNZ4OmlLJXDW-qliY5blAyoptI_qPaYQ","pdfSize":"155737"}
