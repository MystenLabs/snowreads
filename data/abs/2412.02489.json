In numerical analysis points and weights\nresulting from maximal determinants turned out to be useful for quadrature and\ninterpolation. Also recently, two of the present authors and coauthors\ninvestigated a connection to the discretization problem for the uniform norm.\nHere we use this approach of maximizing the determinant of a certain Gramian\nmatrix with respect to points and weights for the construction of tight frames\nand exact Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund inequalities in $L_2$. We present a direct and\nconstructive approach resulting in a discrete measure with at most $N \\leq\nn^2+1$ atoms, which discretely and accurately subsamples the $L_2$-norm of\ncomplex-valued functions contained in a given $n$-dimensional subspace. This\napproach can as well be used for the reconstruction of functions from general\nRKHS in $L_2$ where one only has access to the most important eigenfunctions.\nWe verifiably and deterministically construct points and weights for a weighted\nleast squares recovery procedure and pay in the rate of convergence compared to\nearlier optimal, however probabilistic approaches. The general results apply to\nthe $d$-sphere or multivariate trigonometric polynomials on $\\mathbb{T}^d$\nspectrally supported on arbitrary finite index sets~$I \\subset \\mathbb{Z}^d$.\nThey can be discretized using at most $|I|^2-|I|+1$ points and weights.\nNumerical experiments indicate the sharpness of this result. As a negative\nresult we prove that, in general, it is not possible to control the number of\npoints in a reconstructing lattice rule only in the cardinality $|I|$ without\nadditional condition on the structure of $I$. We support our findings with\nnumerical experiments.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hXmjCk28MCstXJJl3CLOzpRe7fU3gSKSVP80fl4SgZ8","pdfSize":"906729"}
