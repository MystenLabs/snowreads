We distinguish three\nscattering modes, determined by the magnitude of the momentum transfer, in\nwhich particles behave as point-like, structureless extended, and structured\ncomposite objects. The results are compared in the potential and QFT approaches\nof the eikonal model.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AzJllrmel4QRA5SBsQBYhshuxmxCDeKXX2bLYr9905A","pdfSize":"320828"}
