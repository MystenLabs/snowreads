Traditional models\noften fall short in such contexts, particularly due to the complexity and\nnuanced nature of the data. This issue is especially prominent in the education\nsector, where cognitive engagement levels among students show significant\nvariation in their open responses. To test our hypothesis, we utilized an\nexisting technology for assertion-based prompt engineering through an\n'Iterative - ICL PE Design Process' comparing traditional Machine Learning (ML)\nmodels against LLMs augmented with assertions (N=135). Further, we conduct a\nsensitivity analysis on a subset (n=27), examining the variance in model\nperformance concerning classification metrics and cognitive engagement levels\nin each iteration. Our findings reveal that LLMs with assertions significantly\noutperform traditional ML models, particularly in cognitive engagement levels\nwith minority representation, registering up to a 32% increase in F1-score.\nAdditionally, our sensitivity study indicates that incorporating targeted\nassertions into the LLM tested on the subset enhances its performance by\n11.94%. This improvement primarily addresses errors stemming from the model's\nlimitations in understanding context and resolving lexical ambiguities in\nstudent responses.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"PERciJk7rbkhxJhnUPUuMPhE6CGYrUM6q8cGTec9dGg","pdfSize":"633673","objectId":"0xf29e089e396509bf429815b64e28ea7cbbb1922cef2e7c172a29cdef10acc833","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
