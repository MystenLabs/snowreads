Because the\nlanguage of claims is different from language used elsewhere in the patent\napplication or in non-patent text, this has been challenging for computer based\nnatural language processing. We test two new LLM-based approaches and find that\nboth provide substantially better performance than previously published values.\nThe ability to match dense information from one domain against much more\ndistributed information expressed in a different vocabulary may also be useful\nbeyond the intellectual property space.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pZctUoYkjSOAMLmIae2JMlnZ9vBWk-mIjAczyY_MmXM","pdfSize":"830575"}
