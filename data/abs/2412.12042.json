While artificial\nintelligence (AI) based automated radiology report generation shows promise for\nreporting workflow optimization, evidence of its real-world impact on clinical\naccuracy and efficiency remains limited. This study evaluated the effect of\ndraft reports on radiology reporting workflows by conducting a three reader\nmulti-case study comparing standard versus AI-assisted reporting workflows. In\nboth workflows, radiologists reviewed the cases and modified either a standard\ntemplate (standard workflow) or an AI-generated draft report (AI-assisted\nworkflow) to create the final report. For controlled evaluation, we used GPT-4\nto generate simulated AI drafts and deliberately introduced 1-3 errors in half\nthe cases to mimic real AI system performance. The AI-assisted workflow\nsignificantly reduced average reporting time from 573 to 435 seconds (p=0.003),\nwithout a statistically significant difference in clinically significant errors\nbetween workflows. These findings suggest that AI-generated drafts can\nmeaningfully accelerate radiology reporting while maintaining diagnostic\naccuracy, offering a practical solution to address mounting workload challenges\nin clinical practice.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aFJ-hsk2EYXcUjCSuWDb3hwRWnk9h95945jJ3TA9LNw","pdfSize":"3005125"}
