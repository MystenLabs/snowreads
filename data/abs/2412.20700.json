  "abstract": "  In 1976, Knuth and Yao presented an algorithm for sampling from a finite\ndistribution using flips of a fair coin that on average used the optimal number\nof flips. Here we show how to easily run their algorithm for the special case\nof rolling a fair die that uses memory linear in the input. Analysis of this\nalgorithm yields a bound on the average number of coin flips needed that is\nslightly better than the original Knuth-Yao bound. This can then be extended to\ndiscrete distributions in a near optimal number of flips again using memory\nlinear in the input.\n",
