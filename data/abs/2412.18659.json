  "abstract": "  In relativistic mechanics, the 4-velocity and the 4-momentum need not be\nparallel. This allows their norm to have a different sign. This possibility\noccurs in nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) models minimally coupled to\nEinstein's theory. Surprisingly, for a large class of NED models with a Maxwell\nlimit, for weak fields, the causal (acausal) photons, as determined by their\n4-velocity, have a spacelike (timelike) 4-momentum, leading to good tachyons\nand bad bradyons. Departing from weak fields, this possibility is determined\nsolely by the concavity of the NED Lagrangian, which is consistent with the\nDominant Energy Condition analysis. As a corollary, some popular regular black\nhole solutions sourced by NED, such as the Bardeen and Hayward solutions, are\nacausal.\n",
