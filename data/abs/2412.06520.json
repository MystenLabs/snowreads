The interplay between impurity\nphysics and the formation of composite objects remains a relevant problem to\nunderstand how few- and many-body states are robust towards complex\nenvironments and polaron physics. In most cases, impurities are point-like\nobjects. The question we address here is how quasiparticle properties are\naffected when impurities possess an internal structure. The simplest yet\nfundamental structure for the impurity is a dimer state. Here, we investigate\nthe polaronic properties of a dimer dressed by the elementary excitations of a\nbosonic bath. We solve the two-body impurity-impurity problem to determine the\nposition and broadening of the bound state and consider the polaron dressing\nusing a field-theory approach. We demonstrate the emergence of different\ndressed dimer regimes, where polaron dressing drives a dimer from a\nwell-defined to an ill-defined bound state.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"Vn6PxL0h3-WZdOSzrzNbH1n4SnJ8_Hm-r1vykrdkT24","pdfSize":"2053128"}
