Commonly, the formation of such structures\narises from the connection of a homogeneous steady state with either another\nhomogeneous solution or a pattern. Both scenarios, typically found in cavities\nwith normal and anomalous dispersion, respectively, exhibit unique fingerprints\nand particular features that characterise their behaviour. However, we show\nthat the introduction of a periodic non-Hermitian modulation in Kerr cavities\nhybridises the two established soliton formation mechanisms, embodying the\nparticular fingerprints of both. In the resulting novel scenario, the\nstationary states acquire a dual behaviour, playing the role that was\nunambiguously attributed to either homogeneous states or patterns. These\nfundamental findings have profound practical implications for frequency comb\ngeneration, introducing unprecedented reversible mechanisms for real-time\nmanipulation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ECm5A1JpVhgNdk5RUfdp-5KtpxTq6CNfpVZmAip4i-Y","pdfSize":"13603832"}
