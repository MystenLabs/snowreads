In this paper, we understand transfer\nlearning from the perspectives of knowledge transferability and\ntrustworthiness. This involves two research questions: How is knowledge\ntransferability quantitatively measured and enhanced across domains? Can we\ntrust the transferred knowledge in the transfer learning process? To answer\nthese questions, this paper provides a comprehensive review of trustworthy\ntransfer learning from various aspects, including problem definitions,\ntheoretical analysis, empirical algorithms, and real-world applications.\nSpecifically, we summarize recent theories and algorithms for understanding\nknowledge transferability under (within-domain) IID and non-IID assumptions. In\naddition to knowledge transferability, we review the impact of trustworthiness\non transfer learning, e.g., whether the transferred knowledge is adversarially\nrobust or algorithmically fair, how to transfer the knowledge under\nprivacy-preserving constraints, etc. Beyond discussing the current\nadvancements, we highlight the open questions and future directions for\nunderstanding transfer learning in a reliable and trustworthy manner.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"o-_OPUT2eBAlW5l_CCEK-JHWcYeZOQZIii8gDxDCb9E","pdfSize":"1784371"}
