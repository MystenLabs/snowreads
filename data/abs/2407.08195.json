This paper introduces a new framework for a text-to-game engine that\nutilizes foundation models to convert simple textual inputs into complex,\ninteractive RPG experiences. The engine dynamically renders the game story in a\nmulti-modal format and adjusts the game character, environment, and mechanics\nin real-time in response to player actions. Using this framework, we developed\nthe \"Zagii\" game engine, which has successfully supported hundreds of RPG games\nacross a diverse range of genres and facilitated tens of thousands of online\nuser gameplay instances. This validates the effectiveness of our frame-work.\nOur work showcases the potential for a more open and democratized gaming\nparadigm, highlighting the transformative impact of generative AI on the game\nlife cycle.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UqZrr8VXLJ5F0BU-OGS0yw4t-BYaGBBqjj9OYdATSL4","pdfSize":"1635423"}
