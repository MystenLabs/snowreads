  "abstract": "  In recent years, complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) sensors have\nbeen demonstrated to have significant potential in X-ray astronomy, where\nlong-term reliability is crucial for space X-ray telescopes. This study\nexamines the long-term stability of a scientific CMOS sensor, focusing on its\nbias, dark current, readout noise, and X-ray spectral performance. The sensor\nwas initially tested at -30 $^\\circ$C for 16 months, followed by accelerated\naging at 20 $^\\circ$C. After a total aging period of 610 days, the bias map,\ndark current, readout noise, gain, and energy resolution exhibited no\nobservable degradation. There are less than 50 pixels within the 4 k $\\times$ 4\nk array which show a decrease of the bias under 50 ms integration time by over\n10 digital numbers (DNs). First-order kinetic fitting of the gain evolution\npredicts a gain degeneration of 0.73% over 3 years and 2.41% over 10 years.\nThese results underscore the long-term reliability of CMOS sensors for\napplication in space missions.\n",
