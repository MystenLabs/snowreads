No existing dataset provides the\nnecessary mixture of complex, dynamic, and multi-view data. To facilitate the\ndevelopment of 3D and 4D reconstruction methods in the autonomous driving\ncontext, we propose a Synthetic Ego--Exo Dynamic 4D (SEED4D) data generator and\ndataset. We present a customizable, easy-to-use data generator for\nspatio-temporal multi-view data creation. Our open-source data generator allows\nthe creation of synthetic data for camera setups commonly used in the NuScenes,\nKITTI360, and Waymo datasets. Additionally, SEED4D encompasses two large-scale\nmulti-view synthetic urban scene datasets. Our static (3D) dataset encompasses\n212k inward- and outward-facing vehicle images from 2k scenes, while our\ndynamic (4D) dataset contains 16.8M images from 10k trajectories, each sampled\nat 100 points in time with egocentric images, exocentric images, and LiDAR\ndata. The datasets and the data generator can be found at\nhttps://seed4d.github.io/.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xW34pQ3oFvxsuB_UH35kGwxm93OiYilAuVQFi-d2LPQ","pdfSize":"24331326"}
