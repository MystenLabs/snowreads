The dual graviton theory has two\ngauge invariances giving rise to two conserved charges, while the ADM charges\nof the graviton theory become magnetic charges for the dual graviton theory.\nThese charges can be ill-defined in topologically non-trivial settings and we\nfind improvement terms that can be added to these to give gauge-invariant\nconserved charges. These gauge-invariant charges, which have local expressions\nin both the graviton and dual graviton formulation, give topological operators\nof the theory that should be considered as the generators of the genuine\nsymmetries of the theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6rOo2s0znsze5mvAQIaFyOnUv2TrIQ2BXy0zGecUCJY","pdfSize":"375654"}
