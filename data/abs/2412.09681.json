Our analysis focuses on dark photons and $ L_{\\mu} - L_{\\tau} $ gauge\nbosons. We consider both visible and invisible decay channels. We demonstrate\nthat both high energy $\\mu$ colliders and future $ e^+e^- $ colliders, using\nthe FCC-ee $Z$-pole and $ZH$ operation modes as a benchmark, offer significant\nimprovements in sensitivity. We find that both colliders can enhance the\nsensitivity to $ L_{\\mu} - L_{\\tau} $ bosons (for both visible and invisible\ndecays) and to invisibly decaying dark photons by 1--2 orders of magnitude\nacross the relevant mass range. Furthermore, we study the impact of forward $\n\\mu $ detectors at the $ \\mu $-collider on the sensitivity to both models.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FuhSwCws6QClIuvBFQoms_qcibE6bEPQDYbmujO5K58","pdfSize":"1218049"}
