In this paper we will\nrestrict ourselves to finite point sets and consider a fractional Jung-type\nproblem. Let $\\mathcal{P}_n$ be the family of all finite sets of $n$ points of\ndiameter $1$. Let the function value $N_n(r)$ ($0 < r \\leq 1$) be the largest\ninteger $k$ so that for every point set $P \\in \\mathcal{P}_n$ there is a circle\nof radius $r$ which covers at least $k$ points of $P$. We give many lower and\nupper bounds for $N_n(r)$ and determine intervals of $(0,1]$ where exact values\nof $N_n(r)$ can be determined. Among others we show the $n\\leq\nN_{3n}(\\frac{1}{2}) \\leq n+1$ and $N_n(\\frac{1}{4}) = \\lceil \\frac{n}{7}\n\\rceil$ for all $n\\neq 7$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"onMYqWJqveMfBC17o_u70Kqb77hc4a-3DFh0jqTRac8","pdfSize":"820037"}
