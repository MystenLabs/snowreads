  "abstract": "  As humanoid service robots are becoming more and more perceptible in public\nservice settings for instance as a guide to welcome visitors or to explain a\nprocedure to follow, it is desirable to improve the comprehensibility of\ncomplex issues for human customers and to adapt the level of difficulty of the\ninformation provided as well as the language used to individual requirements.\nThis work examines a case study using a humanoid social robot Pepper performing\nsupport for customers in a public service environment offering advice and\ninformation. An application architecture is proposed that improves the\nintelligibility of the information received by providing the possibility to\ntranslate this information into easy language and/or into another spoken\nlanguage.\n",
