This form of the deceleration parameter has been discussed by\nauthors in several papers, but none of them have applied observations to\nconstrain the variables of the model. We carry this out with the cosmic\nchronometer, supernovae and the baryon acoustic oscillation datasets. The\noptimum values for the relevant parameters are found and used to plot the\nkinematical and physical parameters of the model. Although the model tends to\nthe standard Lambda cold dark matter model at late times, there are several\nissues with the model concerning the values of some of the parameters and the\nenergy conditions. The transition redshift of the model does not match with\nPlanck data. The equation of state parameter indicates that the model falls\ninto the category of phantom dark energy, which is not well supported by\nobservations. Thus, the model does not seem viable.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ugdanqyPzkS6_ucsRuQIcettgym-rHFeoQ-3HC8Jcuw","pdfSize":"1075573"}
