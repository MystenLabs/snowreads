We combine the\nhomogenization of a molecular dynamics fracture model with a phase-field\napproach to track and quantify the various energy contributions. We clearly\nseparate free surface energy localized as potential energy on the surface and\ndamage diffusion over a ca. 20 \\r{A} range around the crack path. The plastic\ncontribution is negligible. These findings, which clarify brittle fracture\nmechanisms in amorphous materials, align with toughness measurements in silica.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GeGIve2nBHBhFp94HT0arl4_cnXqJcYWS2Ex7LQy4VE","pdfSize":"2877312"}
