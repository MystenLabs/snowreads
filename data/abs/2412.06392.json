  "abstract": "  Experiments on rotating annuli that are differentially heated in the radial\ndirection have been largely contributing to a better understanding of\nbaroclinic instabilities. This configuration creates waves at a laboratory\nscale that are related to atmospheric circulations. Pioneer studies in\nbaroclinic tanks have shown that experiments with low aspect ratios are more\nsuitable to reproduce small-scale inertia gravity waves, but these tanks have a\nlarger free surface, which leads to higher interactions with its surrounding\nenvironment. Considering the heat transferred through the free surface, the\npresent work investigates its impacts on the baroclinic instability using\ndirect numerical simulations (DNS).\n",
