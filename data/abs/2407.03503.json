A complete\nset of $E2$ matrix elements for the quintuplet of states in $^{49}$Ti, centered\non the $2^+$ core excitation, was measured for the first time. A total of nine\n$E2$ matrix elements are reported, four of which were previously unknown.\n$^{49}_{22}$Ti$_{27}$ shows a $20\\%$ quenching in electric quadrupole\ntransition strength as compared to its semi-magic $^{50}_{22}$Ti$_{28}$\nneighbour. This $20\\%$ quenching, while empirically unprecedented, can be\nexplained with a remarkably simple two-state mixing model, which is also\nconsistent with other ground-state properties such as the magnetic dipole\nmoment and electric quadrupole moment. A connection to nucleon transfer data\nand the quenching of single-particle strength is also demonstrated. The\nsimplicity of the $^{49}$Ti-$^{50}$Ti pair (i.e., approximate single-$j$\n$0f_{7/2}$ valence space and isolation of yrast states from non-yrast states)\nprovides a unique opportunity to disentangle otherwise competing effects in the\nground-state properties of atomic nuclei, the emergence of collectivity, and\nthe role of proton-neutron interactions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"X9w5-SHVFu5Whw0JaruOBmh3603dt_stvGIOZ2iqWrw","pdfSize":"878875"}
