Optimality of the inequality is obtained for any $p$.\nThe extra logarithmic correction term appears in usual fashion. We also provide\na concrete (workable) example of a sequence of smooth functions that converges\nto constant function in $W^{s,p}((0,1))$ for $sp=1$ and $p=2$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iEz8FVNHIbiK0nkg3tFaz8FmsJbe_9UXVg-eI0cuD_w","pdfSize":"149052"}
