Although experiments and numerical\nsimulations have solidly confirmed confinement, its physical origin remains\nmysterious today, and finding a theoretical explanation for it is a\nlong-standing and challenging problem in physics and mathematics. Inspired by\nthe recent progress in quantum Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, we compute the Wilson\nloop correlators of the large-$N$ limit of $\\mathscr{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills\ntheory holographically in an extremal AdS$_5$ Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black brane\nbackground. The quantum gravity fluctuations of the near-horizon region are\nconsidered, which consequently affect the holographic Wilson loop correlators.\nWithin this framework, the results suggest that the confinement of the\nsuper-Yang-Mills theory is induced by the near-horizon quantum gravity\nfluctuations of the bulk extremal AdS$_5$ black brane.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"I-IhSQkag8vXPPvjmgSmUFpMIRjTaQezk9pKd-pnjUA","pdfSize":"831443"}
