  "abstract": "  Recently, a new magnetic phase, termed altermagnetism, has caught the\nattention of the magnetism and spintronics community. This newly discovered\nmagnetic phenomenon differs from traditional ferromagnetism and\nantiferromagnetic. It generally lacks net magnetization and is characterized by\nunusual non-relativistic spin-splitting and broken time-reversal symmetry. This\nleads to novel transport properties such as the anomalous Hall effect, the\ncrystal Nernst effect, and spin-dependent phenomena that cannot be fully\nexplained by traditional magnetic theories. Spin-dependent phenomena such as\nspin currents, spin-splitter torques, and high-frequency dynamics emerge as key\ncharacteristics in altermagnets. This paper reviews the main aspects pertaining\nto altermagnets by providing an overview of theoretical investigations and\nexperimental realizations. We discuss the most recent developments in\naltermagnetism, its comparison to other magnetic orders, and future prospects\nfor exploiting its unique properties in next-generation devices.\n",
