  "abstract": "  Creating engaging and immersive data visualization tools has become\nincreasingly significant for a wide range of users who want to display their\ndata in a meaningful way. However, this can be limiting for individuals with\nvarying levels of coding expertise. There are specific needs, such as\nvisualizing complex data in easily understandable ways, highlighting real-world\nproblems, or telling a story with data. The Makawalu Visualization Environment\n(VE) package aims to address these needs through three distinct modular tools:\nAuthor, Presenter, and Editor. These tools work together to facilitate\ndifferent use cases based on the user's requirements. This paper discusses the\nlatest version of the ProjecTable and focuses on the design and usage of the\nMakawalu VE Author and Presenter tools.\n",
