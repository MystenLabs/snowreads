  "abstract": "  This work explores the YOLOv6 object detection model in depth, concentrating\non its design framework, optimization techniques, and detection capabilities.\nYOLOv6's core elements consist of the EfficientRep Backbone for robust feature\nextraction and the Rep-PAN Neck for seamless feature aggregation, ensuring\nhigh-performance object detection. Evaluated on the COCO dataset, YOLOv6-N\nachieves 37.5\\% AP at 1187 FPS on an NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPU. YOLOv6-S reaches\n45.0\\% AP at 484 FPS, outperforming models like PPYOLOE-S, YOLOv5-S, YOLOX-S,\nand YOLOv8-S in the same class. Moreover, YOLOv6-M and YOLOv6-L also show\nbetter accuracy (50.0\\% and 52.8\\%) while maintaining comparable inference\nspeeds to other detectors. With an upgraded backbone and neck structure,\nYOLOv6-L6 delivers cutting-edge accuracy in real-time.\n",
