In this work we explore\nthe use of data visualizations to foster researcher agency and make\ncomputational thematic analysis more accessible to domain experts. We used a\ndesign science research approach to develop a datavis prototype over four\nphases: (1) problem comprehension, (2) specifying needs and requirements, (3)\nprototype development, and (4) feedback on the prototype. We show that\nqualitative researchers have a wide range of cognitive needs when conducting\ndata analysis and place high importance upon choices and freedom, wanting to\nfeel autonomy over their own research and not be replaced or hindered by AI.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"h_7WX5j2yCRjbtdQw_mH3zPE1TpP166TwLsMFVpp4Z8","pdfSize":"1450075"}
