  "abstract": "  Perturbing transition rates in a steady nonequilibrium system, e.g. modelled\nby a Markov jump process, causes a change in the local currents. Their\nsusceptibility is usually expressed via Green-Kubo relations or their\nnonequilibrium extensions. However, we may also wish to directly express the\nmutual relation between currents. Such a nonperturbative interrelation was\ndiscovered by P.E. Harunari et al. in [1] by applying algebraic graph theory\nshowing the mutual linearity of currents over different edges in a graph. We\ngive a novel and shorter derivation of that current relationship where we\nexpress the current-current susceptibility as a difference in mean\nfirst-passage times. It allows an extension to multiple currents, which remains\naffine but the relation is not additive.\n",
