However, these frequencies require precise alignment of\nnarrow communication beams between transmitters and receivers, typically\nresulting in significant beam training overhead. This paper introduces a novel\nend-to-end vision-aided beamforming framework that utilizes images to predict\noptimal beams while considering geometric adjustments to reduce overhead. Our\nmodel demonstrates robust adaptability to dynamic environments without relying\non additional training data where the experimental results indicate a top-5\nbeam prediction accuracy of 98.96%, significantly surpassing current\nstate-of-the-art solutions in vision-aided beamforming.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Qm_JMGOJjgjs5deqDsQY3fGTVDSTRiPowp6Xk_J9n5Q","pdfSize":"8178864"}
