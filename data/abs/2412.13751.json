  "abstract": "  In the last twenty years, Lewis Bowen's sofic entropy and its annealed\nversion (originally called the `f-invariant') have taken a central place in the\nergodic theory of actions of non-amenable groups. In this work we pursue these\nnotions of entropy across the analogy between ergodic theory and representation\ntheory. We arrive at new quantities associated to unitary representations of\ngroups and representations of other C*-algebras. We find connections to both\nclassical constructs in operator theory and the study of tuples of independent\nrandom unitary matrices.\n",
