Carrollian amplitudes behave as\ncorrelation functions of Carrollian CFT that holographically describes\nasymptotically flat spacetime. We derive linear differential equations\nsatisfied by Carrollian MHV gluon and graviton amplitudes. We obtain\nnon-distributional solutions for both the gluon and graviton cases. We perform\nvarious consistency checks for these differential equations, including\ncompatibility with conformal Carrollian symmetries.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mfit8VnI-OTPIU3eIY-xdJnb5D_Zb7v8kZ9rsUw6Fjg","pdfSize":"360871"}
