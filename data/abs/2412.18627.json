Recent efforts have focused on estimating human\nerror probability (HEP), but existing methods often rely heavily on expert\nknowledge,which can be subjective and time-consuming. Inspired by the success\nof large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing, this paper\nintroduces a novel two-stage framework for knowledge-driven reliability\nanalysis, integrating IDHEAS and LLMs (KRAIL). This innovative framework\nenables the semi-automated computation of base HEP values. Additionally,\nknowledge graphs are utilized as a form of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)\nfor enhancing the framework' s capability to retrieve and process relevant data\nefficiently. Experiments are systematically conducted and evaluated on\nauthoritative datasets of human reliability. The experimental results of the\nproposed methodology demonstrate its superior performance on base HEP\nestimation under partial information for reliability assessment.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fSc-PVW7ZoYQ24akklXgJ3tDV566ueQ2pF4lcQTy_eA","pdfSize":"2274917"}
