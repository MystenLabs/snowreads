  "abstract": "  Consider a conformally covariant four-point function of identical scalar\noperators with a discrete spectrum, a twist gap, and compatible with the\nunitarity conditions. We give a mathematical proof confirming that the spectrum\nand OPE coefficients at large spin and fixed twist always become that of a\ngeneralized free field theory.\n",
