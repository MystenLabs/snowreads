  "abstract": "  We consider an interacting particle system on star graphs. As in the case of\nthe Kdv equation, we have infinitely many invariants ( here, martingale\ninvariants). It enables us to obtain the limiting distribution of the Markov\nchain. Each of the martingale invariants is a homogeneous polynomial with\ncoefficients of Narayana numbers.The identity for the enumeration of plane\nunlabeled trees, which gives Narayana numbers, becomes the key identity to\nobtain the probability of death states by a change of variables.\n",
