Most traditional multi-target multi-camera (MTMC) detection and\ntracking methods rely on 2D object detection, single-view multi-object tracking\n(MOT), and cross-view re-identification (ReID) techniques, without properly\nhandling important 3D information by multi-view image aggregation. In this\npaper, we propose a 3D object detection and tracking framework, named\nBEV-SUSHI, which first aggregates multi-view images with necessary camera\ncalibration parameters to obtain 3D object detections in bird's-eye view (BEV).\nThen, we introduce hierarchical graph neural networks (GNNs) to track these 3D\ndetections in BEV for MTMC tracking results. Unlike existing methods, BEV-SUSHI\nhas impressive generalizability across different scenes and diverse camera\nsettings, with exceptional capability for long-term association handling. As a\nresult, our proposed BEV-SUSHI establishes the new state-of-the-art on the\nAICity'24 dataset with 81.22 HOTA, and 95.6 IDF1 on the WildTrack dataset.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YLbgK2vUmxDxTNkasfNnAoefA1jU7HWWhHM_m5nYYc0","pdfSize":"32125871"}
