Consequently, the\n$\\mathfrak{b}$-Hurwitz generating function analytically continues to a rational\ncurve. In particular, our results cover the cases of $\\mathfrak{b}$-monotone\nHurwitz numbers, and the enumeration of maps and bipartite maps (with internal\nfaces) on non-oriented surfaces. As an application, we prove that the\ncorrelators of the Gaussian, Jacobi and Laguerre $\\beta$-ensembles are computed\nby refined topological recursion.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OVUnwCHpZD9hOlakB0uD-79HogvNIFclczAFy8irOBA","pdfSize":"990352"}
