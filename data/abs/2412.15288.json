We solve the Einstein equation with\nquantum improved coupling perturbatively including the case with non-vanishing\nclassical cosmological constant (CC) which was overlooked in the literatures.\nWe discuss what is the suitable identification of the momentum cutoff $k$ with\ntime scale, and find that the choice of the Hubble parameter is suitable for\nvanishing CC but not so for non-vanishing CC. We suggest suitable\nidentification in this case. The energy-scale dependent running coupling breaks\nthe time translation symmetry and then introduces a new physical scale.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"S2qMRCUmG290VLa3jyih1Y326iEis-E2AJ_2aE_bvXA","pdfSize":"264597"}
