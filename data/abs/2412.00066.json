We illustrate the superior footing of axioms\nby Vinod's (2014) asymmetric matrix of generalized correlation coefficients R*.\nWe list five limitations explaining the poorer footing of axiom-failing\nHellinger correlation proposed in 2022. We also describe a new implementation\nof a one-sided test with Taraldsen's (2021) exact density. This paper provides\na new table for more powerful one-sided tests using the exact Taraldsen density\nand includes a published example where using Taraldsen's method makes a\npractical difference. The code to implement all our proposals is in R packages.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"kOPGA_FapIo0Qr628X2arDFxBSxHOXQdM7vzoNXhRD8","pdfSize":"392591"}
