In thermally stratified disks, surface\nmodes bifurcate into two branches. The branch associated with the strongest\nshear at mid-height exhibits a higher growth rate compared to the branch near\nthe surfaces. Surface modes generally grow rapidly and require a high radial\nwave number $k_R$, whereas body mode growth rates increase as $k_R$ decreases.\nThermal stratification enhances the growth rates of both surface and body modes\nand boosts VSI-driven radial kinetic energy relative to vertical energy. Our\nresults suggest that simulations will initially favor surface modes with large\n$k_R$, followed by an increase in body modes with smaller $k_R$, with faster\nprogression in more thermal stratified disks.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gbyfgdSu3FZMsl6Q-iq6eu3sYMy5hYSOIh7WrkTvdnY","pdfSize":"869944"}
