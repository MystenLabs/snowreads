A desirable adaptive design feature in\nthese studies may be the incorporation of new baskets to an ongoing study.\nLimited basket sample sizes can cause issues in power and precision of\ntreatment effect estimates which could be amplified in added baskets due to the\nshortened recruitment time. While various Bayesian information borrowing\ntechniques have been introduced to tackle the issue of small sample sizes, the\nimpact of including new baskets in the trial and into the borrowing model has\nyet to be investigated. We explore approaches for adding baskets to an ongoing\ntrial under information borrowing and highlight when it is beneficial to add a\nbasket compared to running a separate investigation for new baskets. We also\npropose a novel calibration approach for the decision criteria that is more\nrobust to false decision making. Simulation studies are conducted to assess the\nperformance of approaches which is monitored primarily through type I error\ncontrol and precision of estimates. Results display a substantial improvement\nin power for a new basket when information borrowing is utilized, however, this\ncomes with potential inflation of error rates which can be shown to be reduced\nunder the proposed calibration procedure.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ysyh-vATbWa8dmnE6oVNKPcStjVoUnGhBxVBMD7ox7A","pdfSize":"2665426"}
