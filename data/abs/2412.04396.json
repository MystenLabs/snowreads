Here $n$ is the scaling parameter and\n$\\beta>0$ is fixed. As shown in \\cite{fgn1}, when $\\beta>1$, such a limit is\ngiven by the heat equation with Neumann boundary conditions. In this work, we\nfind more non-trivial super-diffusive scaling limits for this dynamics. Assume\nthat there are $k$ equally spaced slow bonds in the system.\n  If $k$ is fixed and the time scale is $k^2n^\\theta$, with $\\theta\\in\n(2,1+\\beta)$, the density is asymptotically constant in each of the $k$ boxes,\nand equal to the initial expected mass in that box, i.e., there is no time\nevolution. If $k$ is fixed and the time scale is $k^2n^{1+\\beta}$, then the\ndensity is also spatially constant in each box, but evolves in time according\nto the discrete heat equation. Finally, if the time scale is $k^2n^{1+\\beta}$\nand, additionally, the number of boxes $k$ increases to infinity, then the\nsystem converges to the continuous heat equation on the torus, with no boundary\nconditions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"P6nuTL5d-w3bM5p8eJ_dCKhtRK3ZN4xutod05S8g1WI","pdfSize":"269543"}
