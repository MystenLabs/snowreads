  "abstract": "  This paper focuses on semilattices with adjunctions (SLatas), which are\nsemilattices with a greatest element enriched with a pair of adjoint maps. We\ndevelop a spectral-style duality for SLatas, building on prior topological\ndualities for monotone semilattices. As an application of this duality, we\ncharacterize SLata congruences through an adaptation of lower-Vietoris-type\nfamilies. Furthermore, we investigate tense operators on semilattices with a\ngreatest element, deriving a duality for this case by extending the results\nobtained for SLatas.\n",
