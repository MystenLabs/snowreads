We present a novel methodology that combines multiple\nneural networks to create an unsupervised and unmoderated stream of unique\narchitectural images. Our approach is grounded in the conceptual framework\ncalled machine apophenia. We hypothesize that neural networks, trained on\ndiverse human-generated data, internalize aesthetic preferences and tend to\nproduce coherent designs even from random inputs. The methodology involves an\niterative process of image generation, description, and refinement, resulting\nin captioned architectural postcards automatically shared on several social\nmedia platforms. Evaluation and ablation studies show the improvement both in\ntechnical and aesthetic metrics of resulting images on each step.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Ht3HtZWrXuK7sdAzmQA51LKJlglPVxDjoFnB-DQpa0g","pdfSize":"10061076"}
