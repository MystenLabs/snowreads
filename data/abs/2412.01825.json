To address this\nissue, new methods for detecting and mitigating fake news are required. In this\nwork, we propose to incorporate contextual and network-aware features into the\ndetection process. This involves analyzing not only the content of a news\narticle but also the context in which it was shared and the network of users\nwho shared it, i.e., the information diffusion. Thus, we propose GETAE,\n\\underline{G}raph Information \\underline{E}nhanced Deep Neural\nNe\\underline{t}work Ensemble \\underline{A}rchitectur\\underline{E} for Fake News\nDetection, a novel ensemble architecture that uses textual content together\nwith the social interactions to improve fake news detection. GETAE contains two\nBranches: the Text Branch and the Propagation Branch. The Text Branch uses Word\nand Transformer Embeddings and a Deep Neural Network based on feed-forward and\nbidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks (\\textsc{[Bi]RNN}) for learning novel\ncontextual features and creating a novel Text Content Embedding. The\nPropagation Branch considers the information propagation within the graph\nnetwork and proposes a Deep Learning architecture that employs Node Embeddings\nto create novel Propagation Embedding. GETAE Ensemble combines the two novel\nembeddings, i.e., Text Content Embedding and Propagation Embedding, to create a\nnovel \\textit{Propagation-Enhanced Content Embedding} which is afterward used\nfor classification. The experimental results obtained on two real-world\npublicly available datasets, i.e., Twitter15 and Twitter16, prove that using\nthis approach improves fake news detection and outperforms state-of-the-art\nmodels.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"gsYP9LqDuhfGbdrTbEgng_RrMAN-lkVgWPXiAIEsg8o","pdfSize":"907088"}
