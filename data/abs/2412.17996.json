  "abstract": "  We study nondipole effects in multiphoton ionization of a two-dimensional\nhydrogen-like atom by a flat-top laser pulse of varied intensity. For this\npurpose, we solve numerically a two-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger equation treating\na propagating laser pulse exactly. The resulting distributions are then\ncompared to those calculated in the dipole approximation. A directional\ndependence of the energy-angular photoelectron distributions is demonstrated\nnumerically in the case of a propagating laser pulse of a moderate and a high\nintensity. It is analytically interpreted based on the leading order\nrelativistic expansion of the electron Volkov state, showing a significant\ncontribution of the electron recoil to that behavior. In contrast, the\nretardation correction originating from the space- and time-dependence of the\nlaser field leads to a tiny redshift of the photoelectron energy spectra. Other\nfeatures of ionization distributions are also analyzed, including the sidelobes\nand the double-hump structures of multiphoton peaks, or their disappearance for\nintense propagating laser pulses.\n",
