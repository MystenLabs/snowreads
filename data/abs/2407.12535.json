We\nmeasured the field-linear thermal Hall effect in all three samples. The\ntemperature dependence of thermal Hall conductivities shows a peak around 15 K,\nwhich coincides with the peak positions of the longitudinal thermal\nconductivities. The temperature-dependent longitudinal thermal conductivities\nindicates that phonons dominate thermal transport in all three samples.\nHowever, the presence of Dy$^{3+}$ magnetic ions introduces significant effects\non the field dependence of longitudinal thermal conductivities. The thermal\nHall ratio is sizeable in all three samples and consistent with the values\nreported for other insulating materials exhibiting a phononic thermal Hall\neffect, though their exact underlying mechanism remains yet to be identified.\nThe thermal Hall ratio is nearly the same for $\\rm Y_2Ti_2O_7$ and\nDyYTi$_2$O$_7$, and slightly larger for Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, suggesting that\nmagnetic impurities are less significant in generating the phononic thermal\nHall effect. Our observations of the phononic thermal Hall effect support an\nintrinsic origin in Y$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, but suggest a combination of intrinsic\nand extrinsic effects in Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ and DyYTi$_2$O$_7$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"idMMidrh9tZe7G92t39u9vAdK3kSDxY-HvdDnr4k9OY","pdfSize":"726860"}
