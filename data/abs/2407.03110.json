To this end,\ndifferent specific tasks of Speech to Text (S2T), Acoustic Scene Classification\n(ASC), Acoustic Event Detection (AED), Visual Object Detection (VOD), Image\nCaptioning (IC), and Video Captioning (VC) are conducted and integrated into\nthe toolchain. By combining individual tasks and analyzing both audio \\& visual\ndata extracted from input video, the toolchain offers various audio/video-based\napplications: Two general applications of audio/video clustering, comprehensive\naudio/video summary and a specific application of riot or violent context\ndetection. Furthermore, the toolchain presents a flexible and adaptable\narchitecture that is effective to integrate new models for further\naudio/video-based applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"tiD7MJmgnRb3pjkAGsbWCzfu_djfV8VNIjmjoB6pD_E","pdfSize":"7765996"}
