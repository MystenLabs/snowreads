{"id":"2412.19478","title":"An Overview of Machine Learning-Driven Resource Allocation in IoT\n  Networks","authors":"Zhengdong Li","authorsParsed":[["Li","Zhengdong",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 2024 06:11:28 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-30","timestamp":1735279888000,"abstract":"  In the wake of disruptive IoT technologies generating massive amounts of\ndiverse data, Machine Learning (ML) will play a crucial role in bringing\nintelligence to Internet of Things (IoT) networks. This paper provides a\ncomprehensive analysis of the current state of resource allocation within IoT\nnetworks, focusing specifically on two key categories: Low-Power IoT Networks\nand Mobile IoT Networks. We delve into the resource allocation strategies that\nare crucial for optimizing network performance and energy efficiency in these\nenvironments. Furthermore, the paper explores the transformative role of\nMachine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) in\nenhancing IoT functionalities. We highlight a range of applications and use\ncases where these advanced technologies can significantly improve\ndecision-making and optimization processes. In addition to the opportunities\npresented by ML, DL, and RL, we also address the potential challenges that\norganizations may face when implementing these technologies in IoT settings.\nThese challenges include crucial accuracy, low flexibility and adaptability,\nand high computational cost, etc. Finally, the paper identifies promising\navenues for future research, emphasizing the need for innovative solutions to\novercome existing hurdles and improve the integration of ML, DL, and RL into\nIoT networks. By providing this holistic perspective, we aim to contribute to\nthe ongoing discourse on resource allocation strategies and the application of\nintelligent technologies in the IoT landscape.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Networking and Internet Architecture","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"O_nNYbvxTveuC1t-LapT_kcEOPREGltOJSHSqROQnlI","pdfSize":"272187"}
