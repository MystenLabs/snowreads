For instance, paper recommendation suggests literature\nsimilar to some selected paper. Their implementation is often cost-intensive,\nespecially if neural methods are applied. Additionally, it is hard for users to\nunderstand or guess why a recommendation should be relevant for them. That is\nwhy we tackled the problem from a different perspective. We propose XGPRec, a\ngraph-based and thus explainable method which we integrate into our existing\ngraph-based biomedical discovery system. Moreover, we show that XGPRec (1) can,\nin terms of computational costs, manage a real digital library collection with\n37M documents from the biomedical domain, (2) performs well on established test\ncollections and concept-centric information needs, and (3) generates\nexplanations that proved to be beneficial in a preliminary user study. We share\nour code so that user libraries can build upon XGPRec.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JK2co8zjbSbnzW_YZksrL9qQ8yAwIrcpYDdAyfeT6xw","pdfSize":"1715904"}
