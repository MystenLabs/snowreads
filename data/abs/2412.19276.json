We call $a$ \\textit{left dual\n$(b,c)$-core invertible} if there exists $x\\in Rc$ such that $bxab=b$ and\n$(xab)^*=xab$. Such an $x$ is called a left dual $(b,c)$-core inverse of $a$.\nIn this paper, characteriztions of left dual $(b,c)$-core invertible element\nare introduced. We characterize left dual $(b,c)$-core inverses in terms of\nproperties of the left annihilators and ideals. Moreover, we prove that $a$ is\nleft dual $(b,c)$-core invertible if and only if $a$ is left $(b,c)$ invertible\nand $b$ is \\{1,4\\} invertible. Also, properties of left dual $(b,c)$-core\ninvertible elements are examined. We present the matrix representations of left\ndual $(b,c)$-core inverses by the Pierce decomposition. Furthermore, reletions\nbetween left dual $(b,c)$-core inverses and the other generalized inverses are\ngiven.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"7WBUUDqdHQjMA72YjQxw4qrhkjX53zZjkHCfvyz5EDc","pdfSize":"194729"}
