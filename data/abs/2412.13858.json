  "abstract": "  We investigate diffusion models to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem.\nBuilding on the recent DIFUSCO and T2TCO approaches, we propose IDEQ. IDEQ\nimproves the quality of the solutions by leveraging the constrained structure\nof the state space of the TSP. Another key component of IDEQ consists in\nreplacing the last stages of DIFUSCO curriculum learning by considering a\nuniform distribution over the Hamiltonian tours whose orbits by the 2-opt\noperator converge to the optimal solution as the training objective. Our\nexperiments show that IDEQ improves the state of the art for such neural\nnetwork based techniques on synthetic instances. More importantly, our\nexperiments show that IDEQ performs very well on the instances of the TSPlib, a\nreference benchmark in the TSP community: it closely matches the performance of\nthe best heuristics, LKH3, being even able to obtain better solutions than LKH3\non 2 instances of the TSPlib defined on 1577 and 3795 cities. IDEQ obtains 0.3%\noptimality gap on TSP instances made of 500 cities, and 0.5% on TSP instances\nwith 1000 cities. This sets a new SOTA for neural based methods solving the\nTSP. Moreover, IDEQ exhibits a lower variance and better scales-up with the\nnumber of cities with regards to DIFUSCO and T2TCO.\n",
