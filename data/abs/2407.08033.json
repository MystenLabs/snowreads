An electromagnetic calorimeter based on\nscintillating crystals, designed to separately record Cherenkov and\nscintillation light, can achieve precision measurements of electrons and\nphotons without sacrificing jet energy resolution, given adequate light\ncollection efficiency and separation. This paper presents initial measurements\nfrom a program aimed at developing such a calorimeter system for future\ncolliders. We focus on using PbF2 crystals to enhance the understanding of\nCherenkov light collection, marking the first step in this endeavor.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"IYZHYo5AZd4Z7CPCUV4-SsT7l0-pxszHdBnQi5g7vxc","pdfSize":"11655374"}
