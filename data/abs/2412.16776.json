We introduce a new differentiable mesh processing\nmethod in 2D and 3D that addresses this challenge and efficiently handles\nmeshes with intricate structures. Additionally, we present an algorithm that\nadapts the mesh resolution to local geometry in 2D for efficient\nrepresentation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on 2D point\ncloud and 3D multi-view reconstruction tasks.
