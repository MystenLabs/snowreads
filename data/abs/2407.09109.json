However, scalability to\nlarger systems with many qubits is challenging. One solution is to develop a\nquantum network consisting of small-scale quantum registers containing\ncomputation qubits that are reversibly interfaced to communication qubits. Here\nwe report on a register that uses both optical tweezers and optical lattices to\ndeterministically assemble a two-dimensional array of atoms in an optical\ncavity. Harnessing a single-atom addressing beam, we stimulate the emission of\na photon from each atom and demonstrate multiplexed atom-photon entanglement\nwith a generation-to-detection efficiency approaching 90$\\%$. Combined with\ncavity-mediated quantum logic, our approach provides a possible route to\ndistributed quantum information processing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-eG-rI60Z23eENXu2j_oWauPou8FENHhPFADS2ixhnk","pdfSize":"1898845"}
