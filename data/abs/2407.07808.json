We examine interest formation through the lens\nof Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) by exploring four key SCCT constructs:\nlearning experiences, self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and proximal\nenvironmental influences. We conducted 27 interviews with physics majors across\nvarious years of study between 2020 and 2022. Our first research question\nanalyzes SCCT constructs to provide detailed insights into the interest\nformation of various subfields of physics. Examining these constructs, we\nbetter understand the factors influencing students' preferences toward specific\nsubfields. Our findings indicate that positive class experiences and\nexperimental opportunities significantly impacted students' interest in\ndifferent subfields of physics. This understanding helped us explore\nsignificant variations in interest formation between astrophysics and\nbiomedical physics in Research Question 2. By understanding how students decide\nabout their interests, we can provide valuable insights for physics departments\nand career guidance professionals.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8__yVKEqtCP3eEtCGjZrTn-TxQd8hS2Wjog_vZVkX_E","pdfSize":"399739"}
