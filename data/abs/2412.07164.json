  "abstract": "  The order polytopes arising from the finite poset were first introduced and\nstudied by Stanley. For any positive integer $d\\geq 14$, Liu and Tsuchiya\nproved that there exists a non-Ehrhart positive order polytope of dimension\n$d$. They also proved that any order polytope of dimension $d\\leq 11$ is\nEhrhart positive. We confirm that any order polytope of dimension $12$ or $13$\nis Ehrhart positive. This solves an open problem proposed by Liu and Tsuchiya.\nBesides, we also verify that any $h^{*}$-polynomial of order polytope of\ndimension $d\\leq 13$ is real-rooted.\n",
