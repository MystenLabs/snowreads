Compliance with strict privacy and security policies, such as those\nrequired by laws like HIPAA, is critical to protect PHI. Blockchain technology,\nwhich offers a decentralized and tamper-evident ledger system, hold promise in\npolicy compliance. This system ensures the authenticity and integrity of PHI\nwhile facilitating patient consent management. In this work, we propose a\nblockchain technology that integrates smart contracts to partially automate\nconsent-related processes and ensuring that PHI access and sharing follow\npatient preferences and legal requirements.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zHO0WFFMtH2HSac9FCr4AO99fkhlGpTwIEkVlPkMOg0","pdfSize":"2150620","objectId":"0xb0afaa88e15b0a1ae08ef8ecb2da0a535fce3e9a665a14276bc1c9cd27f10aae","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
