Manual\nclinical coding is labour-intensive and error-prone, which has motivated\nresearch towards full automation of the process. However, our analysis, based\non US English electronic health records and automated coding research using\nthese records, shows that widely used evaluation methods are not aligned with\nreal clinical contexts. For example, evaluations that focus on the top 50 most\ncommon codes are an oversimplification, as there are thousands of codes used in\npractice. This position paper aims to align AI coding research more closely\nwith practical challenges of clinical coding. Based on our analysis, we offer\neight specific recommendations, suggesting ways to improve current evaluation\nmethods. Additionally, we propose new AI-based methods beyond automated coding,\nsuggesting alternative approaches to assist clinical coders in their workflows.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"31G1quZn8qd7hPJEhWP-EDnmrq5rQsa89kB1OBaMvaQ","pdfSize":"2114833"}
