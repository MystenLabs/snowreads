  "abstract": "  This paper presents PolyIPA, a novel multilingual phoneme-to-grapheme\nconversion model designed for multilingual name transliteration, onomastic\nresearch, and information retrieval. The model leverages two helper models\ndeveloped for data augmentation: IPA2vec for finding soundalikes across\nlanguages, and similarIPA for handling phonetic notation variations. Evaluated\non a test set that spans multiple languages and writing systems, the model\nachieves a mean Character Error Rate of 0.055 and a character-level BLEU score\nof 0.914, with particularly strong performance on languages with shallow\northographies. The implementation of beam search further improves practical\nutility, with top-3 candidates reducing the effective error rate by 52.7\\% (to\nCER: 0.026), demonstrating the model's effectiveness for cross-linguistic\napplications.\n",
