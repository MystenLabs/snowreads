While these systems are\neffective, their complexity can make it difficult to understand their behavior,\nraising safety concerns. This paper presents a new solution a Behavior Selector\nthat uses multiple smaller artificial neural networks (ANNs) to manage\ndifferent driving tasks, such as lane following and turning. Rather than\nrelying on a single large network, which can be burdensome, require extensive\ntraining data, and is hard to understand, the developed approach allows the\nsystem to dynamically select the appropriate neural network for each specific\nbehavior (e.g., turns) in real time. We focus on ensuring smooth transitions\nbetween behaviors while considering the vehicles current speed and orientation\nto improve stability and safety. The proposed system has been tested using the\nAirSim simulation environment, demonstrating its effectiveness.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Robotics","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"83c70S4ctOynNWcBXXGmhCE4m8Egv8e6OgSHRN01GdI","pdfSize":"1906134"}
