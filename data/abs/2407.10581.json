We use Bayesian\ninference to constrain the model parameters against the precise combined\nreduced cross section data from HERA, and obtain probability distributions for\nthe free parameters. Our results show the data's preference for the anomalous\ndimension to be $\\gamma \\sim 1$. The distributions provide a rigorous method\nfor propagating uncertainties of the BK initial condition for other CGC\ncalculations. We demonstrate this for inclusive quark production in\nproton-proton collisions and nuclear modification factor for the total deep\ninelastic scattering cross section to be measured at the EIC.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"BsxZyT1mRtbBTeFkj7x51in-TXCX_yR1chcKvGE5h1E","pdfSize":"715856","objectId":"0xc6f5be79b3b21b12d45e4ec5dc3f50e5138f62b3df4c3ae9859e298a46e45296","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
