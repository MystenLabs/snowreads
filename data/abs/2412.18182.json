Building upon insights from previous\nstablecoin generations, JANUS leverages a dual-token system (Alpha and Omega),\nintegrates crypto-assets and real-world assets (RWAs), employs a soft-peg\nmechanism, and utilizes AI-driven stabilization.\n  We provide a comprehensive theoretical framework, including formal\ndefinitions of D, E, and S, along with equilibrium existence proofs and\nanalogies drawn from international trade and open-economy macroeconomics. By\nintroducing a second token backed by external yield, JANUS breaks from\nponzinomic dynamics and creates a more robust foundation.\nMulti-collateralization and a soft peg enable controlled price oscillations,\nwhile AI-driven parameter adjustments maintain equilibrium.\n  Through these innovations, JANUS aims to approach the center of the\nstablecoin trilemma, offering a globally resilient, inflation-adjusted, and\ndecentralized stablecoin ecosystem bridging DeFi and TradFi. The main body\npresents a high-level overview of the trilemma and JANUS's key features, while\nthe Appendix provides more formal mathematical treatments, including rigorous\nmetrics for decentralization, capital efficiency, and stability, as well as the\noptimization challenges inherent in the trilemma.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZNYP3qBawgqf75-n6kJIkWd9i39RqkBjrSgR4ox8cvE","pdfSize":"287208"}
