The method raises interest due to its\nexplicit evolution equation, with applicability to both separable and\nnon-separable Hamiltonian systems, and an easy-to-implement, easily\ngeneralizable algorithm. In order to compare the method with other, more\nwell-known methods, namely St\\\"{o}rmer-Verlet and Runge-Kutta, we conducted a\nseries of benchmark tests comparing their performance in terms of CPU time,\nsystem invariants functions conservation, and numerical symplectic area\nconservation. Overall, it was found that despite being slower than the more\noptimized Runge-Kutta-Cash-Karp, Tao's method presents a similar performance to\nSt\\\"{o}rmer-Verlet, with the extra perk of being more generic and not requiring\nthe use of implicit equations for the evolution of the equations of motion.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SvTKI-CIiuVuvubtMR6CimDl8tctqvg_tJmJiVhSFHI","pdfSize":"996319"}
