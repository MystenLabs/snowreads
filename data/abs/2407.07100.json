The method is exemplified by\nseveral problems from optimally tracking benchmarks, hedging the Log contract,\nto maximizing utility from terminal wealth. Strategies are also approximated by\npractically executable, discrete trades. We identify the necessary trade-off\nbetween trading frequency and trade sizes to have satisfactory agreement with\nthe theoretically optimal, continuous strategies of infinite activity.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Portfolio Management","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NYL2CXGQ0G1EV8d2AZSANH3n5T0-NUR8NWxGgEzcFfY","pdfSize":"792153"}
