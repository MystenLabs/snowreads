The QCD\ncorrections are applied in both the production and the decay stages of the four\ntop quarks by employing the narrow-width approximation. The spin correlations\nare therefore preserved at NLO accuracy in QCD without any approximation. We\nsummarize the impact of higher-order QCD effects by highlighting the\nsensitivity of the results on the cut applied on the invariant mass of the two\nhardest light jets in the process.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8aLE2HGY9MzC9qYvPmhJs5-AFeuFzztnH7ZuW-MHgsw","pdfSize":"407589"}
