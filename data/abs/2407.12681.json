The findings demonstrate the\nefficacy of this approach in determining the relation between the fractal\ndimension of the city, the allometric exponent and $q$, and elucidating the\nstationary phase of urban evolution. The dynamic methodology facilitates the\ncorrelation of the fractal dimension with both the entropic index and the urban\nscaling exponent identified in data analyses. The results reveal that the\nscaling behaviour observed in cities aligns with the fractal dimension measured\nthrough independent methods. Moreover, the interpretation of these findings\nunderscores the intimate connection between the fractal dimension and social\ninteractions within the urban context. This research contributes to a deeper\ncomprehension of the intricate interplay between human behaviour, urban\ndynamics, and the underlying fractal nature of cities.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DMAxFqAU1CDefbG6yXuzcF3iqcuax8Oln7Ybk-h79aw","pdfSize":"1588717"}
