  "abstract": "  The time-dependent Schrodinger equation is solved for two model problems for\na non-Hermitian quantum system.A simple matrix model system is used to examine\ntwo critical problems for these systems: complex and non-observable energies\nand situations where the matrix is defective. In addition the stationary states\nfor infinite dimensional model system, which is confined in space , is examined\nand it is shown that the pattern of eigenvalue energies differs from when the\nsystem is unconfined.\n",
