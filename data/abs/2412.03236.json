  "abstract": "  In this paper, we present new objects, quilts of alternating sign matrices\nwith respect to two given posets. Quilts generalize several commonly used\nconcepts in mathematics. For example, the rank function on submatrices of a\nmatrix gives rise to a quilt with respect to two Boolean lattices. When the two\nposets are chains, a quilt is equivalent to an alternating sign matrix and its\ncorresponding corner sum matrix. Quilts also generalize the monotone Boolean\nfunctions counted by the Dedekind numbers. Quilts form a distributive lattice\nwith many beautiful properties and contain many classical and well-known\nsublattices, such as the lattice of matroids of a given rank and ground set.\nWhile enumerating quilts is hard in general, we prove two major enumerative\nresults, when one of the posets is an antichain and when one of them is a\nchain. We also give some bounds for the number of quilts when one poset is the\nBoolean lattice.\n",
