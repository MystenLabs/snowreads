  "abstract": "  Understanding the $g$-factor physics of Si/SiGe quantum dots is crucial for\nrealizing high-quality spin qubits. While previous work has explained some\naspects of $g$-factor physics in idealized geometries, the results do not\nextend to general cases and they miss several important features. Here, we\nconstruct a theory that gives $g$ in terms of readily computable matrix\nelements, and can be applied to all Si/SiGe heterostructures of current\ninterest. As a concrete example, which currently has no $g$-factor\nunderstanding, we study the so-called Wiggle Well structure, containing Ge\nconcentration oscillations inside the quantum well. Here we find a significant\nrenormalization of the $g$-factor compared to conventional Si/SiGe quantum\nwells. We also uncover a giant $g$-factor suppression of order\n$\\mathcal{O}(1)$, which arises due to spin-valley coupling, and occurs at\nlocations of low valley splitting. Our work therefore opens up new avenues for\n$g$-factor engineering in Si/SiGe quantum dots.\n",
