  "abstract": "  We report on the ongoing study of symmetry of $N_f=2$ QCD around the critical\ntemperature. Our simulations of $N_f = 2$ QCD employ the M\\\"obius domain-wall\nfermion action with residual mass $\\sim 1\\mbox{MeV}$ or less, maintaining a\ngood chiral symmetry. Using the screening masses from the two point spatial\ncorrelators we compare the mass difference between channels connected through\nvarious symmetry transformations. Our analysis focuses on restoration of the\n$SU(2)_L\\times SU(2)_R$ as well as anomalously broken axial $U(1)_A$. We also\npresent additional study of a potential $SU(2)_{CS}$ symmetry which may emerge\nat sufficiently high temperatures.\n",
