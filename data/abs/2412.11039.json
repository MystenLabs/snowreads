A compact representation, AirwaySign, is generated based on diverse\nfeatures of airway branches. Experiments on multi-center datasets validated the\neffectiveness of AirwayAtlas. We also demonstrated that AirwaySign is a\npowerful tool for correlation analysis on pulmonary diseases.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DH9lvxIwiD8gngF52wim2X--8Veerz_XwERhAujD7pU","pdfSize":"6698274"}
