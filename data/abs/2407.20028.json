This paper introduces Aircraft Trajectory\nSegmentation-based Contrastive Coding (ATSCC), a novel self-supervised time\nseries representation learning framework designed to capture semantic\ninformation in air traffic trajectory data. The framework leverages the\nsegmentable characteristic of trajectories and ensures consistency within the\nself-assigned segments. Intensive experiments were conducted on datasets from\nthree different airports, totaling four datasets, comparing the learned\nrepresentation's performance of downstream classification and clustering with\nother state-of-the-art representation learning techniques. The results show\nthat ATSCC outperforms these methods by aligning with the labels defined by\naeronautical procedures. ATSCC is adaptable to various airport configurations\nand scalable to incomplete trajectories. This research has expanded upon\nexisting capabilities, achieving these improvements independently without\npredefined inputs such as airport configurations, maneuvering procedures, or\nlabeled data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aj0oaavcOmlzaqkTsuO7AQ1ZXys82zrDQMfRFstDeKs","pdfSize":"12539581"}
