  "abstract": "  A novel approach for the measurement of the Nitrogen active species generated\nby a plasma source in the molecular beam epitaxy environment is here presented.\nThe method is based on the analysis of the variations in the optical signal\nmeasured by a pyrometer during a two step, Gallium rich and Nitrogen\ncontrolled, growth modes. The method permits a precise, quantitative and direct\nmeasurement of the flux of active species as a function of the plasma\ngeneration parameters of the cell: nitrogen gas flux and RF-power.\n",
