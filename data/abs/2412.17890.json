This raises the question how large the number\ncan be, depending on the number of players and the numbers of their pure\nstrategies. Here we present a lower bound for the maximal possible number in\nthe case of m-player games where each player has two pure strategies. It is\nsurprisingly close to a known upper bound.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computer Science/Computer Science and Game Theory","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"EL2LHmOsDG3c0QjTyfrUrRMLi9SZgOI27JGMhKx-P1A","pdfSize":"553451"}
