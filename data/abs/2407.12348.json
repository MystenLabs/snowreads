This article constructs and tests MM algorithms, which are simple to\ncode and have been suggested superior to some other prominent quantile\nregression methods in nonregularized problems, in an array of quantile\nregression settings including linear (modeling different quantile coefficients\nboth separately and simultaneously), nonparametric, regularized, and monotone\nquantile regression. Applications to various real data sets and two simulation\nstudies comparing MM to existing tested methods have corroborated our\nalgorithms' effectiveness. We have made one key advance by generalizing our MM\nalgorithm to efficiently fit easy-to-predict-and-interpret parametric quantile\nregression models for data sets exhibiting manifest complicated nonlinear\ncorrelation patterns, which has not yet been covered by current literature to\nthe best of our knowledge.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"j4JksSgty-3riVZ927tbu2R9BkCiXm3nhHvDEOPbXOw","pdfSize":"27706479"}
