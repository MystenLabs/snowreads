However, these methods still face many challenges, such\nas maintaining temporal consistency and the time-consuming issue. This paper\nproposes an advanced video inpainting framework using optical Flow-guided\nEfficient Diffusion, called FloED. Specifically, FloED employs a dual-branch\narchitecture, where a flow branch first restores corrupted flow and a\nmulti-scale flow adapter provides motion guidance to the main inpainting\nbranch. Additionally, a training-free latent interpolation method is proposed\nto accelerate the multi-step denoising process using flow warping. Further\nintroducing a flow attention cache mechanism, FLoED efficiently reduces the\ncomputational cost brought by incorporating optical flow. Comprehensive\nexperiments in both background restoration and object removal tasks demonstrate\nthat FloED outperforms state-of-the-art methods from the perspective of both\nperformance and efficiency.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3UjxMQjLVq0Yij3dOsla6g6q6wVfnhf1cmT6p4SSTZ8","pdfSize":"46302688"}
