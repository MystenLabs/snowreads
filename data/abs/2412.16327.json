In the Minimum Sum of Radii clustering problem (MSR), we aim\nto select $k$ balls in a metric space to cover all points while minimizing the\nsum of the radii. In the Minimum Sum of Diameters clustering problem (MSD), we\nare to pick $k$ clusters to cover all the points such that sum of diameters of\nall the clusters is minimized. At last, in the Minimum Sum of Squared Radii\nproblem (MSSR), the goal is to choose $k$ balls, similar to MSR. However in\nMSSR, the goal is to minimize the sum of squares of radii of the balls. We\npresent a 3.389-approximation for MSR and a 6.546-approximation for MSD,\nimproving over respective 3.504 and 7.008 developed by Charikar and Panigrahy\n(2001). In particular, our guarantee for MSD is better than twice our guarantee\nfor MSR. In the case of MSSR, the best known approximation guarantee is\n$4\\cdot(540)^{2}$ based on the work of Bhowmick, Inamdar, and Varadarajan in\ntheir general analysis of the $t$-Metric Multicover Problem. At last with our\nanalysis, we get a 11.078-approximation algorithm for Minimum Sum of Squared\nRadii.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SicWMT99AfjQQwmqyqGcO-7fGfvij00X2g6vqMT9srY","pdfSize":"547730"}
