These metrics include the Kobayashi-Hilbert\nmetric near strongly convex points, the minimal metric near convex and strongly\nminimally convex points, and the $k$-quasi hyperbolic metric in $k$-strongly\nconvex domains.\n  Finally, we prove a characterization result in convex geometry for the\n$k$-quasi hyperbolic metric.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DK-R66Am0qWX2euqIlxojrB7vLAQqLjVEipkpKADrB0","pdfSize":"247770"}
