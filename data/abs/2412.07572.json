The Faddeev equations are written out explicitly\nwithout the requirement for symmetry or antisymmetry of two-body t matrices,\ntaking into account the difference in the masses of three interacting\nparticles. An algorithm for the algebraic search for non-relativistic wave\nfunctions of a system of three bodies of different masses is described. A\nsignificant change in the domain of logarithmic singularities of the integral\nkernels of the Faddeev equations from the choice of masses of interacting\nparticles is demonstrated.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"10HuKlf0LOhXXoonBfQ-ocuPDdlgRncemOfPXziYgrg","pdfSize":"876631"}
