In addition to the\nbulk velocity discussed previously, we also find a significant infall that we\nattribute to the presence of an overdensity out to a radius of $R\\simeq\n120h^{-1}$Mpc.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3E8JVJzUNoTj4tvPkoXodWzMrD660kpTnShfp0lyHRU","pdfSize":"3646734"}
