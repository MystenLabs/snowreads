However, it is still not well understood how\ncomplex patterns of tissue growth emerge. Here, we propose a framework for the\nchemomechanical regulation of growth based on thermodynamics of continua and\ngrowth-elasticity to predict growth patterns. Combining the elastic and\nchemical energies, we use an energy variational approach to derive a novel\nformulation that incorporates an energy-dissipating stress relaxation and\nbiochemomechanical regulation of the volumetric growth rate. We validate the\nmodel using experimental data from growth of tumor spheroids in confined\nenvironments. We also investigate the influence of model parameters, including\ntissue rearrangement rate, tissue compressibility, strength of mechanical\nfeedback and external mechanical stimuli, on the growth patterns of tumor\nspheroids.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RV1Gmqv8m-upnQDSaoda_G8Zz4HsutcEUDlY8n0YN3M","pdfSize":"11268378"}
