This\nalgorithm simultaneously uses two cryptographic procedures: encryption using a\ngeneralization of the Markovski algorithm [2] and encryption using a system of\northogonal operations. In this paper, we present an implementation of this\nalgorithm based on T-quasigroups, more precisely, based on medial quasigroups.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"rhlQOQKCPXyfZ6SzGcJYYcfRCPcg3ZHZv5B-W5l2HuE","pdfSize":"138102"}
