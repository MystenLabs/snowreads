Previous works typically\ntrain a planner to imitate expert trajectories, treating this as a supervised\ntask. While these methods achieve competitive performance, they often lack\nsufficient robustness. When a suboptimal action is taken, the planner may\nencounter an out-of-distribution state, which can lead to task failure. In\ncontrast, we frame the task as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process\n(POMDP) and aim to develop a robust planner under a few-shot assumption. Thus,\nwe propose a closed-loop planner with an adaptation module and a novel\nhindsight method, aiming to use as much information as possible to assist the\nplanner. Our experiments on the ALFRED dataset indicate that our planner\nachieves competitive performance under a few-shot assumption. For the first\ntime, our few-shot agent's performance approaches and even surpasses that of\nthe full-shot supervised agent.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RZYTalHjpSV8cezd-PwpXrEC6K2f8Dt-HfiiYtYCebk","pdfSize":"1166387"}
