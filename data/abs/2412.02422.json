We use representation theoretic reduction methods to\ninterpret some of the entries of the frieze coming from the partial resolutions\nof the corresponding curve singularity. Finally, we translate the notion of\nmutation, coming from cluster combinatorics, to resolutions of plane complex\ncurves.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RGMxNqOoRpwvAOYqZUco6mAXaQ_RIkjqV4t93EXIRPo","pdfSize":"610752"}
