  "abstract": "  Systems thinking provides us with a way to model the algorithmic fairness\nproblem by allowing us to encode prior knowledge and assumptions about where we\nbelieve bias might exist in the data generating process. We can then encode\nthese beliefs as a series of causal graphs, enabling us to link AI/ML systems\nto politics and the law. This allows us to combine techniques from machine\nlearning, causal inference, and system dynamics in order to capture different\nemergent aspects of the fairness problem. We can use systems thinking to help\npolicymakers on both sides of the political aisle to understand the complex\ntrade-offs that exist from different types of fairness policies, providing a\nsociotechnical foundation for designing AI policy that is aligned to their\npolitical agendas and with society's values.\n",
