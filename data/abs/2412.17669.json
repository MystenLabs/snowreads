Since\ntraditional aphasia treatment methods are often time-consuming,\nlabour-intensive, and do not reflect real-world conversations, applying natural\nlanguage processing based approaches such as Large Language Models (LLMs) could\npotentially contribute to improving existing treatment approaches. To address\nthis issue, we explore the use of sequence-to-sequence LLMs for completing\nfragmented Broca's aphasic sentences. We first generate synthetic Broca's\naphasic data using a rule-based system designed to mirror the linguistic\ncharacteristics of Broca's aphasic speech. Using this synthetic data, we then\nfine-tune four pre-trained LLMs on the task of completing fragmented sentences.\nWe evaluate our fine-tuned models on both synthetic and authentic Broca's\naphasic data. We demonstrate LLMs' capability for reconstructing fragmented\nsentences, with the models showing improved performance with longer input\nutterances. Our result highlights the LLMs' potential in advancing\ncommunication aids for individuals with Broca's aphasia and possibly other\nclinical populations.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"nPqC8bnOqIIJKbyn0owzMQqMTM_hzusysA0UsLisQxs","pdfSize":"193569"}
