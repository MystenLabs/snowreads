  "abstract": "  We introduce a constraint qualification condition (GPMFCQ) for smooth\ninfinite programming problems, where the nonlinear operator defining the\nequality constraints has nonsurjective derivative at the local minimum. The\ncondition is a generalization of PMFCQ introduced by Morduhovich and Nghia. We\nprove the existence of Lagrange multipliers by using either Hurwicz set or\nNonlinear Farkas Minkowski condition.\n",
