In this survey, we consider extremal\nproblems for transversal structures in graph systems. More precisely, we\nsummarize some sufficient conditions that ensure the existence of transversal\nstructures in graph/digraph/hypergraph systems, which generalize several\nclassical theorems in extremal graph theory to transversal version. We also\ninclude a number of conjectures and open problems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6y1Kva2JeUdYKcBQNvVXW7ANQ8GBlPf7VT4fIRD2K7E","pdfSize":"804780"}
