The segmentation is based\non the similarity of the normal vector field to a given set of label vectors.\nWe propose a variational approach and compare two different regularizers, both\nbased on a total variation measure. The first regularizer penalizes the total\nvariation of the assignment function directly, while the second regularizer\npenalizes the total variation in the label space. In order to solve the\nresulting optimization problems, we use variations of the split Bregman (ADMM)\niteration adapted to the problem at hand. While computationally more expensive,\nthe second regularizer yields better results in our experiments, in particular\nit removes noise more reliably in regions of constant curvature.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"EWhHOuyvuXtpxGq5rmzYJD_DKFh9q3pBEIws_QKi92E","pdfSize":"16075441"}
