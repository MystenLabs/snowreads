  "abstract": "  The prevailing educational methods predominantly rely on traditional\nclassroom instruction or online delivery, often limiting the teachers' ability\nto engage effectively with all the students simultaneously. A more intrinsic\nmethod of evaluating student attentiveness during lectures can enable the\neducators to tailor the course materials and their teaching styles in order to\nbetter meet the students' needs. The aim of this paper is to enhance teaching\nquality in real time, thereby fostering a higher student engagement in the\nclassroom activities. By monitoring the students' electroencephalography (EEG)\nsignals and employing machine learning algorithms, this study proposes a\ncomprehensive solution for addressing this challenge. Machine learning has\nemerged as a powerful tool for simplifying the analysis of complex variables,\nenabling the effective assessment of the students' concentration levels based\non specific parameters. However, the real-time impact of machine learning\nmodels necessitates a careful consideration as their deployment is concerned.\nThis study proposes a machine learning-based approach for predicting the level\nof students' comprehension with regard to a certain topic. A browser interface\nwas introduced that accesses the values of the system's parameters to determine\na student's level of concentration on a chosen topic. The deployment of the\nproposed system made it necessary to address the real-time challenges faced by\nthe students, consider the system's cost, and establish trust in its efficacy.\nThis paper presents the efforts made for approaching this pertinent issue\nthrough the implementation of innovative technologies and provides a framework\nfor addressing key considerations for future research directions.\n",
