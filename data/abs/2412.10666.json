  "abstract": "  If a cosmological first-order phase transition occurs sufficiently slowly,\ndelayed vacuum decay may lead to the formation of primordial black holes. Here\nwe consider a simple model as a case study of how the abundance of the produced\nblack holes depends on the model's input parameters. We demonstrate, both\nnumerically and analytically, that the black hole abundance is controlled by a\ndouble, ``super''-exponential dependence on the three-dimensional Euclidean\naction over temperature at peak nucleation. We show that a modified expansion\nrate during the phase transition, such as one driven by an additional energy\ndensity component, leads to a weaker dependence on the underlying model\nparameters, but maintains the same super-exponential structure. We argue that\nour findings generalize to any framework of black hole production via delayed\nvacuum decay.\n",
