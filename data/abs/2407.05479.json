Four\nexoplanets were found within $\\simeq 2\\rlap.{''}0$ from the star. Here we\nreport the VLA detection of a faint (19.1$\\pm$2.7 $\\mu$Jy) radio continuum (3.0\nGHz) source projected at $\\simeq 2\\rlap.{''}2$ from the star. The \\sl a priori\n\\rm probability of finding a background source with this flux density within a\nradius of $2\\rlap.{''}2$ is only 0.0046. However, the astrometry made with the\nVLA and ALMA images, separated by 5.5 years, indicates no significant proper\nmotions and rules out the association of the radio source with the HR 8799\nsystem and suggests it is a background millimeter galaxy with dust emission in\nthe millimeter and partially thick synchrotron emission in the centimeter.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"u0TA6wXBNNbKDSylnIxb0kPLXwc1pFW6YJZdtYmBRoE","pdfSize":"306035"}
