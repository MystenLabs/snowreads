Our construction extends the\nuniversal globalization for partial category actions given by P. Nystedt\n(Lundstr\\\"om) and the tensor product globalization for strong partial semigroup\nactions given by G. Kudryavtseva and V. Laan, thereby unifying the theory of\npartial actions for both categories and semigroups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"vNfyDo68UO3FqZPogIkFzgOjP9-hZgABNmRUEPxcPZ0","pdfSize":"342572"}
