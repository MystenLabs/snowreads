We introduce 'LLM Ethics Whitepaper',\nwhich we provide as an open and living resource for NLP practitioners, and\nthose tasked with evaluating the ethical implications of others' work. Our goal\nis to translate ethics literature into concrete recommendations and\nprovocations for thinking with clear first steps, aimed at computer scientists.\n'LLM Ethics Whitepaper' distils a thorough literature review into clear Do's\nand Don'ts, which we present also in this paper. We likewise identify useful\ntoolkits to support ethical work. We refer the interested reader to the full\nLLM Ethics Whitepaper, which provides a succinct discussion of ethical\nconsiderations at each stage in a project lifecycle, as well as citations for\nthe hundreds of papers from which we drew our recommendations. The present\npaper can be thought of as a pocket guide to conducting ethical research with\nLLMs.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ca2p763rDP_C17hOVUoGp0rh-HRqAYBxgq186IKX98E","pdfSize":"391641"}
