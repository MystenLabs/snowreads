SMEFT extends the SM by\nintroducing higher-dimensional operators parametrized by Wilson coefficients,\noffering a framework to probe beyond the SM (BSM) effects. This contribution\nhighlights three recent analyses using the ATLAS Run-2 dataset at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV with an integrated luminosity of\n140 $\\text{fb}^{-1}$. Combined measurements improve the sensitivity to Wilson\ncoefficients by reducing degeneracies and tightening constraints, exploring the\npotential of SMEFT in the top quark sector.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uPrJXSDA7ehILNi9Ed77SRSNDVor5OGLUbi_UUvrONo","pdfSize":"589025"}
