This work\nis an extension of the Onlabs simulator which has been developed by the\nHellenic Open University as a distance teaching enabler for similar subjects,\nhelping to alleviate the need for access to the physical laboratory\ninfrastructure; thus, shortening training periods of students in the laboratory\nand making their training during the periods of physical presence more\nproductive and secure. The extensions of the Onlabs to deliver an enhanced and\nmodular framework that can be extended to multiple educational scenarios is the\nwork performed within the context of the European project XR2Learn (Leveraging\nthe European XR industry technologies to empower immersive learning and\ntraining).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"vXpWPd4zStuoLMfelnUoFoo-W9x78T1GTWB7rPu8EZk","pdfSize":"578018"}
