We\nsubsequently apply this characterization to the study of surjective additive\nmaps between atomic JBW$^*$-triples preserving truncations in both directions.\nLet $A: E\\to F$ be a surjective additive mapping between atomic\nJBW$^*$-triples, where $E$ contains no one-dimensional Cartan factors as direct\nsummands. We show that $A$ preserves truncations in both directions if, and\nonly if, there exists a bijection $\\sigma: \\Gamma_1\\to \\Gamma_2$, a bounded\nfamily $(\\gamma_k)_{k\\in \\Gamma_1}\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^+$, and a family\n$(\\Phi_k)_{k\\in \\Gamma_1},$ where each $\\Phi_k$ is a (complex) linear or a\nconjugate-linear (isometric) triple isomorphism from $C_k$ onto\n$\\widetilde{C}_{\\sigma(k)}$ satisfying $\\inf_{k} \\{\\gamma_k \\} >0,$ and $$A(x)\n= \\Big( \\gamma_{k} \\Phi_k \\left(\\pi_k(x)\\right) \\Big)_{k\\in\\Gamma_1},\\ \\hbox{\nfor all } x\\in E,$$ where $\\pi_k$ denotes the canonical projection of $E$ onto\n$C_k.$\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"unnUJ5HmN0TtzHlOc2UhyBCAa4FoTtUAfv0-nAhTaPI","pdfSize":"450856"}
