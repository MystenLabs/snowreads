This approach yields an infinite\nfamily of identities, where the original Cauchy identity stands as a particular\ncase. To illustrate the versatility and depth of this approach, we provide a\nrange of compelling examples, showcasing the connections and applications of\nthese novel identities.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uI--v-mOkZo2kzxQ00kp9HwZyxyIpe4D2K8Fmk_OgI8","pdfSize":"106107"}
