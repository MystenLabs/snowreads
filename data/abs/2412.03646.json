  "abstract": "  We revisit certain aspects of a problem concerning the influence of carrier\nscattering induced by magnetic impurities in metals on their superconducting\nproperties. Superconductivity is assumed to be driven by strong electron-phonon\ninteraction. We use the self-consistent solution of the Nagaoka equations for\nthe scattering matrix together with the Migdal-Eliashberg theory of\nsuperconductivity to compute the energy of the in-gap bound states,\nsuperconducting critical temperature and tunneling density of states for a wide\nrange of values of the Kondo temperature and impurity concentrations. It is\nfound that similar to the case of the weak coupling (BCS) superconductors there\nis only one pair of the bound states inside the gap as well as re-entrant\nsuperconductivity for the case of antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between\nthe conduction electrons and magnetic impurities. In agreement with the earlier\nstudies we find that the gapless superconductivity can be realized which in the\ncase of antiferromagnetic exchange requires much smaller impurity\nconcentration. Surprisingly, in contrast with the weakly coupled\nsuperconductors we find that superconducting transition exhibits two critical\ntemperatures for the ferromagnetic exchange coupling.\n",
