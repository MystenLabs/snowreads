  "abstract": "  This paper introduces a robust and scalable framework for implementing nested\naffine transformations in quantum circuits. Utilizing Hadamard-supported\nconditional initialization and block encoding, the proposed method\nsystematically applies sequential affine transformations while preserving state\nnormalization. This approach provides an effective method for generating\ncombinatorial amplitude patterns within quantum states with demonstrated\napplications in combinatorics and signal processing. The utility of the\nframework is exemplified through two key applications: financial risk\nassessment, where it efficiently computes portfolio returns using combinatorial\nsum of amplitudes, and discrete signal processing, where it enables precise\nmanipulation of Fourier coefficients for enhanced signal reconstruction.\n",
