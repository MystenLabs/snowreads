Our method\noffers a reliable alternative to existing probabilistic protocols for W state\nentanglement swapping, which is crucial for various quantum information\nprocessing tasks. We present a detailed quantum circuit design, implemented\nusing the Qiskit simulator, that outlines the preparation of W states and the\nexecution of joint measurements required for the entanglement swapping process.\nFurthermore, we analyze the effects of imperfect operations and noisy\ncommunication channels on the fidelity of the resulting shared W state. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce a weak measurement-based purification\nmethod that enhances fidelity in the presence of amplitude damping. Through\nmathematical analysis and Qiskit simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our proposed protocol, offering a practical solution for high-fidelity W\nstate generation in real-world quantum communication scenarios.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7b5FIx2-uMGAn9N0vZa5miVZxxKcl0az_Xu4qsI6O9g","pdfSize":"1276540"}
