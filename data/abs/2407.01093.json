Current language model agents\nmainly focus on reasonable behaviors from the level of individuals, and their\nbehaviors might be hard to constraint on the level of the whole storyline. In\nthis paper we introduce IBSEN, a director-actor coordinate agent framework that\ngenerates drama scripts and makes the plot played by agents more controllable.\nThe director agent writes plot outlines that the user desires to see, instructs\nthe actor agents to role-play their characters, and reschedules the plot when\nhuman players participate in the scenario to ensure the plot is progressing\ntowards the objective. To evaluate the framework, we create a novel drama plot\nthat involves several actor agents and check the interactions between them\nunder the instruction of the director agent. Evaluation results show that our\nframework could generate complete, diverse drama scripts from only a rough\noutline of plot objectives, meanwhile maintaining the characteristics of\ncharacters in the drama.
