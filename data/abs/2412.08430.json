We evaluated the performance of GPT-4, LLaMA 3, and Palm 2\nusing a zero-shot learning approach without human intervention. A quantitative\nevaluation was conducted through a custom natural language processing analytics\npipeline to highlight the uniqueness of the responses and to identify words\nreflecting each student's profile, including race, gender, or professional\nlevel. The analysis of frequently used words in the responses indicates that\nGPT-4 offers more personalized mentoring compared to the other two LLMs.\nAdditionally, a qualitative evaluation was performed to see if human experts\nreached similar conclusions. The analysis of survey responses shows that GPT-4\noutperformed the other two LLMs in delivering more accurate and useful\nmentoring while addressing specific challenges with encouragement languages.\nOur work establishes a foundation for developing personalized mentoring tools\nbased on LLMs, incorporating human mentors in the process to deliver a more\nimpactful and tailored mentoring experience.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"GFTg_ViaBQLGCuXB91m2u_r1lBtS290C_M46eDIqpWw","pdfSize":"1629386"}
