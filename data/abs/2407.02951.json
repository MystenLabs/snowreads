While some find it easy to play, the challenge lies in\nsustaining the oscillation, particularly in maintaining both \"up and down\ncollisions.\" Through a Newtonian dynamics numerical analysis using Python (code\nby ChatGPT), this study identifies two equilibrium phases - phase 1,\ncharacterized by normal pendulum motion, and phase 2, the double collision mode\n- by using the driven oscillation model. In addition, further analysis and\ndiscussion are done using the obtained numeric data. The difficulty in\nremaining in phase 2 highlights the intricate hand-eye coordination required,\nshedding light on the toy's appeal and the skill it demands.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WRgOcE21OpQfbbHGzZ8mgp-jRllVDxyDQ9ln4h12IPs","pdfSize":"3211444","objectId":"0x76e487ef610b68ef60304f043f73aee23ae6184ad4f664a8584618ea729b3254","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
