This time\ncadence will provide yet-unobserved detail about fast-changing features of the\nSun. The instrument is comprised of a Gregorian-style reflecting telescope\ncombined with a spectrograph via a specialized mirrorlet array that focuses the\nlight from each spatial location in the image so that it may be spectrally\ndispersed without overlap from neighboring locations. This paper discusses the\ndriving science, detailed instrument and subsystem design, and pre-integration\ntesting of the SNIFS instrument.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SmNNPf9M4vVBh_k8Jx20do8flVcRfIaTneFSLtcVDn8","pdfSize":"8392204","objectId":"0x1165b6d30be9615f35fe8116751c4277d8845218dcd9e0e0d46241309806c2ae","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
