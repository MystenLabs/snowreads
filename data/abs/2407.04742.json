The shadow profiles for these\nmetrics were calculated. Applying the limitations from the Event Horizon\nTelescope we find the opportunity to constrain model parameters from considered\nextended gravity theories. We show that for three considered models two of them\n(Horndesky theory and Gauss-Bonnet scalar gravity) weaken the effect of\nrotation and bumblebee model enhances it. This conclusion matches the\npreviously obtained one that extended gravity theories by themselves correct\nthe effect of rotation in both directions.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dOIEAoZawpWIJ3wga3Uw02hh8QTZOrjwEci1MRGdplo","pdfSize":"790804"}
