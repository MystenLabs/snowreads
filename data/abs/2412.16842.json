By monitoring,\nanalysing, and evaluating rainfall data at a local level, it is not only\npossible to take effective actions to prevent any severe climate variation but\nalso to improve the planning of surface and underground hydrological resources.\nHowever, developing countries often lack the weather stations to collect data\ncontinuously due to the high cost of installation and maintenance. In light of\nthis, the contribution of the present paper is twofold: first, we propose a\nlow-cost IoT system for automatic recording, monitoring, and prediction of\nrainfall in rural regions. Second, we propose a novel approach to regional\nheavy rainfall prediction by implementing graph neural networks (GNNs), which\nare particularly well-suited for capturing the complex spatial dependencies\ninherent in rainfall patterns. The proposed approach was tested using a\nhistorical dataset spanning 72 months, with daily measurements, and\nexperimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in\npredicting heavy rainfall events, making this approach particularly attractive\nfor regions with limited resources or where traditional weather radar or\nstation coverage is sparse.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"q4xP5Q0un2Vi-EKpEz3hc-Z7drwzcXv0XaEusyzX3qU","pdfSize":"3242188"}
