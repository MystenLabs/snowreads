The UHE source 1LHAASO\nJ1857+0203u is suggested to be associated with HESS J1858+020, which may be\nattributed to the possible PeVatron candidate supernova remnant (SNR)\nG35.6$-$0.4 or HII region G35.6$-$0.5. We perform detailed analysis on the\nvery-high-energy and UHE $\\gamma$-ray emissions towards this region with data\nfrom the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). 1LHAASO\nJ1857+0203u is detected with a significance of 11.6$\\sigma$ above 100 TeV,\nindicating the presence of a PeVatron. It has an extension of $\\sim 0.18^\\circ$\nwith a power-law (PL) spectral index of $\\sim$2.5 in 1-25 TeV and a point-like\nemission with a PL spectral index of $\\sim$3.2 above 25 TeV. Using the archival\nCO and HI data, we identify some molecular and atomic clouds that may be\nassociated with the TeV $\\gamma$-ray emissions. Our modelling indicates that\nthe TeV $\\gamma$-ray emissions are unlikely to arise from the clouds\nilluminated by the protons that escaped from SNR G35.6$-$0.4. In the scenario\nthat HII region G35.6$-$0.5 could accelerate particles to the UHE band, the\nobserved GeV-TeV $\\gamma$-ray emission could be well explained by a hadronic\nmodel with a PL spectral index of $\\sim$2.0 and cutoff energy of $\\sim$450 TeV.\nHowever, an evolved pulsar wind nebula origin cannot be ruled out.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"a7OwTQ-x3-xV4zFBW-oEIV55g__-XX1loKDq7q6Uoxs","pdfSize":"2902935"}
