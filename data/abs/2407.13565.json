We experimented with various models and feature configurations, including\ntraditional machine learning methods like LinearSVC with TF-IDF, as well as\ndeep learning models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Additionally, we\nexplored the use of transformer-based models for this task. Our experiments\nshow promising results, with our best model achieving a micro F1-score of\n93.02% and 67.21% on the ArBanking77 dataset, in the development and test sets,\nrespectively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"a_0eCUbmfKb84-6z8Hj1XBacmJcdFangVfPiHkHU1WA","pdfSize":"121889","objectId":"0xa73d91cb016555d0b7932ebbf6e4cba9965f51f7ff231b6adc54d9b78ec277a2","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
