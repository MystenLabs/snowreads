The first and third forms of representation\nare generalized to the case of non-periodic functions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"q85oiCXBPpPNurSxsKKXEkUQC6-mxKp4ofey49gWsa0","pdfSize":"256148","objectId":"0x7b66bcf7595c36fcd41e419385b7462503e553f27b9d337fa4a2c3e54f7671ae","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
