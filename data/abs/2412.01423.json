This\napproach has been widely used to represent similarity and entailment\nrelationships in cross-linguistic concept comparisons. However, most SMMs are\nmanually built by human experts using bottom-up procedures, which are often\nlabor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel\ngraph-based algorithm that automatically generates conceptual spaces and SMMs\nin a top-down manner. The algorithm begins by creating a dense graph, which is\nsubsequently pruned into maximum spanning trees, selected according to metrics\nwe propose. These evaluation metrics include both intrinsic and extrinsic\nmeasures, considering factors such as network structure and the trade-off\nbetween precision and coverage. A case study on cross-linguistic supplementary\nadverbs demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our model compared to\nhuman annotations and other automated methods.
