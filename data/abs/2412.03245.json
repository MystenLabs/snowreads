It is well-known that every (algebra) automorphism of $H^\\infty$ is\na composition operator induced by disc automorphism. Maurya et al., (J. Math.\nAnal. Appl. 530 : Paper No: 127698, 2024) proved that every automorphism of the\nsubalgebras $\\{f\\in H^\\infty : f(0) = 0\\}$ or $\\{f\\in H^\\infty : f'(0) = 0\\}$\nis a composition operator induced by a rotation. In this article, we give very\nsimple proof of their results. As an interesting generalization, for any\n$\\psi\\in H^\\infty$, we show that every automorphism of $\\psi H^\\infty$ must be\na composition operator and characterize all such composition operators. Using\nthis characterization, we find all automorphism of $\\psi H^\\infty$ for few\nchoices of $\\psi$ with various nature depending on its zeros.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kLtAj1lmLfJX0RS6dIR_nlSPKvwr8Y85rBSvX8X3yb4","pdfSize":"233733"}
