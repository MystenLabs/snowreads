Focusing on Mexico, a pioneer in adopting such legislation, the paper\nleverages variations in the enactment of femicide laws and associated prison\nsentences across states. Using the difference-in-difference estimator, the\nanalysis reveals that these laws have not significantly affected the incidence\nof femicides, homicides of women, or reports of women who have disappeared.\nThese findings remain robust even when accounting for differences in prison\nsentencing, whether states also implemented unilateral divorce laws, or\ndecriminalized abortion alongside femicide legislation. The results suggest\nthat legislative measures are insufficient to address violence against women in\nsettings where impunity prevails.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"rCkwa1Sf3iZtdOhSuWWMNiOfPiSvCA26Zzer-ORycBk","pdfSize":"1719723"}
