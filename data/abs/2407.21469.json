We show that the\nnilpotent pieces ${\\rm LX}(\\Delta)$ introduced by Lusztig coincide with the\ncorresponding Hesselink strata $\\mathcal{H}(\\Delta)$ and hence form a partition\nof the nilpotent cone of $\\mathfrak{g}$. Similar results are obtained for the\nunipotent pieces of $G$. Here $\\Delta$ runs through the set of all weighted\nDynkin diagrams of $G$. Thanks to the results obtained by Lusztig, Xue and\nVoggesberger this boils down to establishing the partition property of the\npieces ${\\rm LX}(\\Delta)$ for groups of type ${\\rm E_7}$ in characteristic $2$\nand for groups of type ${\\rm E_8}$ in characteristic $2$ and $3$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"31kohFd3OSYpmcC_-p8gaXuph4xfVc1hanna6FZW7As","pdfSize":"226078","objectId":"0x74f95df44ccee4110a856e53a3ddea411eae888e15a1c2f0a538a49e00070c64","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
