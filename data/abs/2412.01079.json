Federated learning (FL) is a promising\nsolution to this challenge. This paper proposes Federated classification with\nlocal Batch-specific batch normalization and Sharpness-aware minimization\n(FedBS) for privacy protection in EEG-based motor imagery (MI) classification.\nFedBS utilizes local batch-specific batch normalization to reduce data\ndiscrepancies among different clients, and sharpness-aware minimization\noptimizer in local training to improve model generalization. Experiments on\nthree public MI datasets using three popular deep learning models demonstrated\nthat FedBS outperformed six state-of-the-art FL approaches. Remarkably, it also\noutperformed centralized training, which does not consider privacy protection\nat all. In summary, FedBS protects user EEG data privacy, enabling multiple BCI\nusers to participate in large-scale machine learning model training, which in\nturn improves the BCI decoding accuracy.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aSkHvdV8tSpQj9d6aNzt0wNevczyqxcjxAGkM4DyZkk","pdfSize":"2359395"}
