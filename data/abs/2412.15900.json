  "abstract": "  Natural Language Processing (NLP) is widely used in fields like machine\ntranslation and sentiment analysis. However, traditional NLP models struggle\nwith accuracy and efficiency. This paper introduces Deep Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (DCNN) into NLP to address these issues. By integrating DCNN, machine\nlearning (ML) algorithms, and generative adversarial networks (GAN), the study\nimproves language understanding, reduces ambiguity, and enhances task\nperformance. The high-performance NLP model shows a 10% improvement in\nsegmentation accuracy and a 4% increase in recall rate compared to traditional\nmodels. This integrated approach excels in tasks such as word segmentation,\npart-of-speech tagging, machine translation, and text classification, offering\nbetter recognition accuracy and processing efficiency.\n",
