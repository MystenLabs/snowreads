The last section presents a complete axiomatisation for\nguarded processes without infinite sequences of unobservable actions.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"h5xGguFzrDxFTxWXheF6bVjVH0g7Plsi6A47nhKSL8Q","pdfSize":"1161713"}
