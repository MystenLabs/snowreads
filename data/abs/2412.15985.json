  "abstract": "  In a variety of applications, the problem comes up of describing the\nprincipal part of the inverse of a holomorphic operator at an eigenvalue in\nterms of left and right root functions associated to the eigenvalue. Such a\ndescription was given by Keldysh in 1951. His theorem, the proof of which was\npublished only in 1971, is a fundamental result in the local spectral theory of\noperator-valued functions. Here we present a streamlined derivation in the\nmatrix case, and we extend Keldysh's theorem by means of a new principal part\nformula. Special attention is given to the semisimple case (first-order poles).\n",
