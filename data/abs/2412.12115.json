Our\nresearch follows the way machine learning algorithms are employed in\nEducational Data Mining, focusing on highlighting the so-called Rashomon\neffect. The study uses the Rashomon set of simple-yet-accurate models trained\nusing decision trees, random forests, light GBM, and XGBoost algorithms with\nthe Open University Learning Analytics Dataset. We found that the Rashomon set\nimproves the predictive accuracy by 2-6%. Variable importance analysis revealed\nmore consistent and reliable results for binary classification than multiclass\nclassification, highlighting the complexity of predicting multiple outcomes.\nKey demographic variables imd_band and highest_education were identified as\nvital, but their importance varied across courses, especially in course DDD.\nThese findings underscore the importance of model choice and the need for\ncaution in generalizing results, as different models can lead to different\nvariable importance rankings.
