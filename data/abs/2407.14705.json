This paper presents Marge\n(https://fm-dcc.github.io/MARGe), a web-based tool to visualise and analyse\nreactive graphs enriched with labels. Marge animates the operational semantics\nof reactive graphs and offers different graphical views to provide insights\nover concrete systems. We motivate the applicability of reactive graphs for\nadaptive systems and for featured transition systems, using Marge to tighten\nthe gap between the existing theoretical models and their usage to analyse\nconcrete systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages","Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eRhKWZKJmw9Ye1cTx5feW5xRXp51SF5c4HvCvLPDdYA","pdfSize":"933241","objectId":"0x3a608f951c26dec72e1a41a7d4aa8d2754a6bf97837c6d686db8e0695cbec16e","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
