These\nthree dimensional interactions are extremely complicated and subtle, so it is\nunsurprising that practitioners find their rapid, robust, and accurate\nnumerical simulation to be of paramount interest. Among the wide array of\npossible numerical approaches, the High--Order Spectral algorithms are often\npreferred due to their surpassing fidelity with a moderate number of unknowns,\nand here we describe an algorithm that fits into this class. In addition, we\ntake a perturbative approach to the problem which views the deviation of the\npermittivity from a reference value as the deformation and we conduct a regular\nperturbation theory. This work concludes a line of research on these methods\nwhich began with two-dimensional problems governed by the Helmholtz equation\nand moved to small perturbations in the fully three-dimensional vector Maxwell\nequations. We now extend these latter results to large (real) perturbations\nconstituting a rigorous analytic continuation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"htAqRQTgzEXDqh9MYxE9-8P17x8bYIDrpuf10OW99II","pdfSize":"646299"}
