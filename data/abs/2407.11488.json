This\npaper aims to address this gap by introducing an auto-tuner for AMD's HIP. We\ndo so by extending Kernel Tuner, an open-source Python library for auto-tuning\nGPU programs. We analyze the performance impact and tuning difficulty for four\nhighly-tunable benchmark kernels on four different GPUs: two from Nvidia and\ntwo from AMD. Our results demonstrate that auto-tuning has a significantly\nhigher impact on performance on AMD compared to Nvidia (10x vs 2x).\nAdditionally, we show that applications tuned for Nvidia do not perform\noptimally on AMD, underscoring the importance of auto-tuning specifically for\nAMD to achieve high performance on these GPUs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Performance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"afn4jY4N5T3xfdlgstHMKKeBwzOF74pMlZdemUuTzrQ","pdfSize":"784255"}
