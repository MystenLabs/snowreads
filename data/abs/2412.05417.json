The interpretation as\nmatrix-valued orthogonal polynomials allows us to introduce shift operators for\nthe non-symmetric Jacobi polynomials. The shift operators are\ndifferential-reflection operators and we present four of these operators that\nare fundamental in the sense that they generate all shift operators. Moreover,\nthe symmetrizations of these fundamental shift operators are the fundamental\nshift operators for the symmetric Jacobi polynomials of type $BC_1$.\n  For the realization of non-symmetric Jacobi polynomials of type $BC_1$ as\ninvariant $\\mathbb{C}^2$-valued Laurent polynomials, we introduce a\nhomomorphism that is analogous to the Harish-Chandra homomorphism for the\nsymmetric Jacobi polynomials of type $BC_1$. For geometric root multiplicities,\nthe non-symmetric Jacobi polynomials of type $BC_1$ can be interpreted as\nspherical functions and we show that our Harish-Chandra homomorphism in this\ncontext is related to the Lepowsky homomorphism via the radial part map.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"nVHbc7GIS0PFecVAAuSSGzGZ0ytvTnYSsR0ZowdvMWg","pdfSize":"444454"}
