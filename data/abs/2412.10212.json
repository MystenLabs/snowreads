We study\n$(\\text{\\textbaro},\\mathfrak{d}, \\gamma)$-constacyclic codes over the ring\n$\\mathfrak{R}=\\mathbb{Z}_4+\\omega\\mathbb{Z}_4, \\omega^2=\\omega,$ with an\n$\\mathfrak{R}$-automorphism $\\text{\\textbaro}$ and a\n$\\text{\\textbaro}$-derivation $\\mathfrak{d}$ over $\\mathfrak{R}.$ Further, we\ndetermine the generators of the $(\\text{\\textbaro},\\mathfrak{d},\n\\gamma)$-constacyclic codes over the ring $\\mathfrak{R}$ of any arbitrary\nlength and establish the reverse constraint for these codes. Besides the\nnecessary and sufficient criterion to derive reverse-complement codes, we\npresent a construction to obtain DNA codes from these reversible codes.\nMoreover, we use another construction on the\n$(\\text{\\textbaro},\\mathfrak{d},\\gamma)$-constacyclic codes to generate\nadditional optimal and new classical codes. Finally, we provide several\nexamples of $(\\text{\\textbaro},\\mathfrak{d}, \\gamma)$ constacyclic codes and\nconstruct DNA codes from established results. The parameters of these linear\ncodes over $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ are better and optimal according to the codes\navailable at \\cite{z4codes}.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AH8Buoa4tBhxWYKC40Xq-Id_NQwyMElGGCYf7bRHxdI","pdfSize":"183267"}
