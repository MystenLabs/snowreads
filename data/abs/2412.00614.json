  "abstract": "  According to perturbative quantum chromodynamic calculations, in $pp$\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s} = $~200 and 510 GeV studied at RHIC, jet production in\nmid-pseudorapidity, $|\\eta| <$ 1, is dominated by quark-gluon and gluon-gluon\nscattering processes. Therefore jets at RHIC are direct probes of the gluon\nparton distribution functions (PDFs) for momentum fractions 0.01 $<x<$ 0.5.\nMoreover, $W$ boson cross section ratio, $\\sigma(W^+)/\\sigma(W^-)$, in $pp$\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 510$~GeV, is an effective tool to explore anti-quark\nPDFs, $\\bar{d}/\\bar{u}$. Last but not least, di-$\\pi^{0}$ correlation in\nforward pseudorapidity, $2.6 < \\eta <4.0$, is an important indication of the\nnon-linear gluon dynamics at low $x$ where the gluon density is high in protons\nand nuclei. In this proceeding, we present recent STAR results of\nmid-pseudorapidity inclusive jet cross-sections at $\\sqrt{s} =$~200 and 510 GeV\nin $pp$ collisions, $W$ boson cross-section ratios at $\\sqrt{s} = 510$~GeV in\n$pp$ collisions, and forward di-$\\pi^0$ correlations in $pp$, $p\\textrm{Al}$\nand $p\\textrm{Au}$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\textrm{\\tiny NN}}} = 200$~GeV.\n",
