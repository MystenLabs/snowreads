Contemporary and classical magnetorquer\ndetumbling methods do not adequately consider this underactuation, and suffer\nfrom poor performance as a result. These controllers can get stuck on an\nuncontrollable manifold, resulting in long detumbling times and high power\nconsumption. This work presents a novel detumble controller based on a\nnon-monotonic Lyapunov function that predicts the future magnetic field along\nthe satellite's orbit and avoids uncontrollable configurations. In comparison\nto other controllers in the literature, our controller detumbles a satellite in\nsignificantly less time while also converging to lower overall angular\nmomentum. We provide a derivation and proof of convergence for our controller\nas well as Monte-Carlo simulation results demonstrating its performance in\nrepresentative use cases.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zeHUCC-O39VIcBNZKVyhTGHPwp4PK0K1wc_9G0_9FxI","pdfSize":"1481478"}
