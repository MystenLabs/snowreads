  "abstract": "  The classical WKB method (also known as the WKBJ method, the LG method, or\nthe phase integral method) for solving singularly perturbed linear differential\nequations has never, as far as we know, been looked at from the structured\nbackward error (BEA) point of view. This is somewhat surprising, because a\nsimple computation shows that for some important problems, the WKB method gives\nthe exact solution of a problem of the same structure that can be expressed in\nfinitely many terms. This kind of analysis can be extremely useful in assessing\nthe validity of a solution provided by the WKB method. In this paper we show\nhow to do this and explore some of the consequences, which include a new\niterative algorithm to improve the quality of the WKB solution. We also explore\na new hybrid method where the potential is approximated by Chebyshev\npolynomials, which can be implemented in a few lines of Chebfun.\n",
