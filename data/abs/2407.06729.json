Here we\ndemonstrate experimentally, for first time, that the solid boron hydride,\noctadecaborane - \\textit{anti}-B${}_{18}$H${}_{22}$, produces a relatively high\nyield of alpha particles of about $10^9$ per steradian using a sub-nanosecond,\nlow-contrast laser pulse (PALS) with a typical intensity of $10^{16}$\nWcm${}^{-2}$. In contrast to previously published proton-boron studies, the\nboron hydrides, due to their composition containing only atoms of boron and\nhydrogen, represent a natural choice for future proton-boron nuclear fusion\nschemes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"870SQnuyWuF2FufzEcvW6e7pSSjtTQq4wjm0llQ9BcM","pdfSize":"7836663"}
