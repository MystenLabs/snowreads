  "abstract": "  Accurate extraction of multicomponent linear frequency modulation (LFM)\nsignal parameters, such as onset frequency, linear modulation frequency,\namplitude, and initial phase, is of great importance in the fields of ISAR,\ncognitive radio, electronic countermeasures, and star-ground communications.\nHowever, the task of accurately extracting the characteristic parameters of a\nsignal is challenging when it has an extraordinarily large bandwidth as well as\ncross or neighboring components in the time-frequency domain. In this paper, we\nfirst review the main current methods used for multicomponent LFM signal\ndecomposition and their challenges, and then propose a novel multi-parameter\nfeature parameter extraction algorithm. The algorithmrealizes the direct and\naccurate extraction of thefeature parameters of multicomponent LFM signals at\nultra-low sub-Nyquist sampling rate for the first time. Moreover, the algorithm\nis optimized for the computational complexity and anti-noise problems in\npractical applications, so that it has high accuracy, high efficiency and good\nnoise robustness. We also compare the algorithm with innovative and existing\nmethods, and the results show that the algorithm has excellent performance in\nfeature parameter extraction accuracy, noise immunity and computational speed.\n",
