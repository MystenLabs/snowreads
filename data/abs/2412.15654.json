Given that\nGeneral Relativity is intrinsically nonlinear, it is important to look beyond\nfirst-order contributions in cosmological perturbations. In this work, we\npresent a non-perturbative approach for the computation of CGWB anisotropies at\nlarge scales, providing the extension of the initial conditions and the\nSachs-Wolfe effect for the CGWB, which encodes the full non-linearity of the\nscalar metric perturbations. We also derive the non-perturbative expression for\nthree-point correlation of the gravitational wave energy density perturbation\nin the case of an inflationary CGWB with a scale-invariant power spectrum and\nnegligible primordial non-Gaussianity. We show that, under such conditions, the\ngravitational wave energy density perturbations are lognormally distributed,\nleading to an interesting effect such as intermittency.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AkiIcAOBT6n159-O5v2VNvCWFVcLk5-S7-zGB4SFvQo","pdfSize":"426551"}
