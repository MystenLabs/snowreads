  "abstract": "  Event-based sensors detect only changes in brightness across a scene, each\npixel producing an asynchronous stream of spatial-temporal data, rather than\nrecording frames of overall illumination like a traditional frame-based sensor.\nThis is advantageous for implementing into a wavefront sensor, which benefits\nfrom high temporal resolution and high dynamic range. The determination of\ntip-tilt in particular is still a problem in laser guide star adaptive optics\nas there is no current technological capabilities to measure it. This study\ncharacterised the behaviour of an event-based sensor in the context of tip-tilt\nsensing,investigating if the high temporal resolution of the event streams\ncould address these challenges. Different conditions of tip-tilt and background\nillumination levels are explored and found to be a strong contender for\ntip-tilt sensing with laser guide stars.\n",
