State-of-the-art methods currently find\ntrajectories that balance between nominal and contingency behavior, or plan for\na singular contingency plan; however, this does not guarantee that the\nresulting plan is safe for all time. To address this research gap, this paper\npresents Contingency-MPPI, a data-driven optimization-based strategy that\nembeds contingency planning inside a nominal planner. By learning to\napproximate the optimal contingency-constrained control sequence with adaptive\nimportance sampling, the proposed method's sampling efficiency is further\nimproved with initializations from a lightweight path planner and trajectory\noptimizer. Finally, we present simulated and hardware experiments demonstrating\nour algorithm generating nominal and contingency plans in real time on a mobile\nrobot.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Vwd0RS6GOPSLAD5aVfuwFbGwUgjF8Ddjcd00uQk17Uk","pdfSize":"10787197"}
