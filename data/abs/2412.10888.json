  "abstract": "  Realizing novel topological states in magnonics systems opens new\nopportunities for developing robust low-power spin-wave-based devices.\nIntroducing non-equilibrium antimagnon can bring additional effects to the\ntopology and chirality. In this report, we revisit the ferromagnetic\nmultilayers with a non-equilibrium state and generalize it to\nantiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic multilayers. We found that non-equilibrium\nstates with the perturbative coupling of magnon and antimagnon can turn an\noriginally trivial state into a non-trivial one, characterized by Chern number.\nBoth coherent coupling and dissipative coupling are found in the band\nstructures and can be controlled by the external magnetic field and torques.\nFurther, in the bilayer unit cell, all four possible chirality combinations are\nachieved at a few GHz. Our work presents an accessible platform for realizing\ntopological magnonic surface states, paving the way for controlling magnon\nchirality and facilitating various types of coupling.\n",
