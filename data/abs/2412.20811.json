  "abstract": "  An AT-orientation of a graph $G$ is an orientation $D$ of $G$ such that the\nnumber of even Eulerian sub-digraphs and the number of odd Eulerian\nsub-digraphs of $D$ are distinct. Given a mapping $f: V(G) \\to \\mathbb{N}$, we\nsay $G$ is $f$-AT if $G$ has an AT-orientation $D$ with $ < f(v)$ for each\nvertex $v$. For a positive integer $k$, we say $G$ is $k$-truncated degree-AT\nif $G$ is $f$-AT for the mapping $f$ defined as $f(v) = \\min #{k, d_G(v)#} $.\nThis paper proves that 2-connected outerplanar graphs other than odd cycles are\n$5$-truncated degree-AT, and 2-connected bipartite outerplanar graphs are\n$4$-truncated degree-AT. As a consequence, 2-connected outerplanar graphs other\nthan odd cycles are $5$-truncated degree paintable, and 2-connected bipartite\nouterplanar graphs are $4$-truncated degree paintable.\n  This improves the result of Hutchinson in [On list-coloring outerplanar\ngraphs], where it was proved that maximal 2-connected outerplanar graphs other\nthan are 5-truncated degree-choosable, and 2-connected bipartite outerplanar\ngraphs are 4-truncated degree-choosable.\n",
