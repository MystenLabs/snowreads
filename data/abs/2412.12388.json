  "abstract": "  We prove a theorem on the relationships between the lengths of sides of a\nspherical quadrilateral with three right angles. They are analogous to the\nrelationships in the Lambert quadrilateral in the hyperbolic plane. We apply\nthis theorem in the proof of our second theorem that if $C$ is a\ntwo-dimensional spherical convex body of diameter $\\delta \\in\n(\\frac{1}{2}\\pi,\\pi)$, then the diameter of the set of extreme points of $C$ is\nat least $2 \\arccos \\big(\\frac{1}{4}(\\cos \\delta + \\sqrt {\\cos^2 \\delta\n+8})\\big)$. This estimate cannot be improved.\n",
