We have explored the structural, mechanical,\nelectronic, optical, and some thermophysical properties of XB$_2$ (X = Cr, Mo\nand W) binary metallic diborides in detail employing density functional theory\nbased first-principles method. Many of the physical properties, including\ndirection-dependent mechanical properties, optical properties, and\nthermo-mechanical properties are being investigated for the first time.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HpbFC-usQXkWE3nJ4U1AFm0uo4BDFqSA6AoqXqTbEQo","pdfSize":"2590112"}
