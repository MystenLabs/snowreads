The normal state data were\nanalyzed using a Drude-Lorentz model with two Drude components: narrow and\nbroad ones. In the superconducting state, two gaps with $2\\Delta\n_{0}^{(1)}/k_{B}T_{c}=1.57$ and $2\\Delta _{0}^{(2)}/k_{B}T_{c}=3.48$ are formed\nfor the Ba(Fe$_{0.965}$Ni$_{0.035}$)$_2$As$_2$ films, while for the\nBa(Fe$_{0.95}$Ni$_{0.05}$)$_2$As$_2$ films these characteristic ratios are\n1.88--2.08 and 3.66--4.13. Both gaps are formed from the narrow Drude\ncomponent, whereas the broad Drude component remains ungapped. The calculated\nfrom infrared data total dc resistivity of the films with Ni contents $x=0.05$\nand $x=0.08$ as well as the low-temperature scattering rate for the narrow\nDrude component show a hidden Fermi-liquid behavior. On the contrary, the films\nwith $x=0.035$ manifest a hidden non-Fermi-liquid behavior. The Allen theory\ngeneralized to a multiband systems was applied to the analysis of the\ntemperature dependences of a resistivity of the Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$)$_2$As$_2$\nfilms. The change of total electron-boson coupling and representative energy in\nthe normal state versus the superconducting state for this system was shown to\nbe typical of other iron-based superconducting materials as well as\nhigh-temperature superconducting cuprates.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"_7CVLk5HZLsaWfngJy0IyOB8kU71w_zvy-theyEMgoA","pdfSize":"5057479"}
