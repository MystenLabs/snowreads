A sample of 915 objects was selected at\n$2.7<z<5.3$ within an effective area of $\\sim 36$ deg$^2$ observed in 40\nnarrow-band filters (NB; FWHM $\\sim 120$ \\r{A}). We cover the\nintermediate-bright luminosity regime of the LF $(10^{43.5}<(L_{{\\rm\nLy}\\alpha}/{\\rm erg\\,s}^{-1})<10^{45.5}$; $-29<M_{\\rm UV}<-24)$. The continuous\nwavelength coverage of the PAUS NB set allows a very efficient target\nidentification and precise redshift measurements. We show that our method is\nable to retrieve a fairly complete ($C\\sim 85\\%$) and pure ($P\\sim 90\\%$)\nsample of Ly$\\alpha$ emitting quasars for $L_{{\\rm Ly}\\alpha}>10^{44}$ ${\\rm\nerg\\,s}$$^{-1}$. In order to obtain corrections for the LF estimation, and\nassess the accuracy of our selection method, we produced mock catalogs of\n$0<z<4.3$ quasars and galaxies that mimic our target population and their main\ncontaminants. Our results show a clear evolution of the Ly$\\alpha$ and UV LFs,\nwith a declining tendency in the number density of quasars towards increasing\nredshifts. In addition, the faint-end power-law slope of the Ly$\\alpha$ LF\nbecomes steeper with redshift, suggesting that the number density of\nLy$\\alpha$-bright quasars declines faster than that of fainter emitters. By\nintegrating the Ly$\\alpha$ LF we find that the total Ly$\\alpha$ emitted by\nbright quasars per unit volume rapidly declines with increasing redshift, being\nsub-dominant to that of star-forming galaxies by several orders of magnitude by\n$z\\sim 4$. Finally, we stack the NB pseudo-spectra of a visually selected\n\"golden sample\" of 591 quasars to obtain photometric composite SEDs in bins of\nredshift, enabling to measure the mean IGM absorption by the Lyman-$\\alpha$\nforest as a function of redshift.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Hq5dB1sJmj6u0dMrVOiupeDIy1AXgPNTmbS_8OB1aZ4","pdfSize":"1982723"}
