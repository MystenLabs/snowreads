However, these methods\noften impose restrictions, such as constant eigenvectors over time. To\ngeneralize the factor structure, we construct a cubic (order-3 tensor) form of\nan integrated volatility matrix process, which can be decomposed into low-rank\ntensor and idiosyncratic tensor components. To predict conditional expected\nlarge volatility matrices, we introduce the Projected Tensor Principal\nOrthogonal componEnt Thresholding (PT-POET) procedure and establish its\nasymptotic properties. Finally, the advantages of PT-POET are also verified by\na simulation study and illustrated by applying minimum variance portfolio\nallocation using high-frequency trading data.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fwKos9M2pllIbt4g6MduFP7mtqBbJz9UBq4qa8GLAH4","pdfSize":"414108"}
