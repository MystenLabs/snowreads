  "abstract": "  Pressure-solution is a chemo-mechanical process, involving dissolution at\ngrain/asperity contacts and precipitation away from them. It induces a\ncompaction in time of rocks and sediments. The present study investigates\nnumerically the impact of precipitation on the slowdown of creep behavior\ninduced by pressure-solution. A recently published framework, called the\nPhase-Field Discrete Element Model, is carefully calibrated against existing\nindentation experiments and validated for other rate-limiting scenarios. It is\nshown that when precipitation is relatively slow, the slowdown of\npressure-solution is due to a chemical mechanism (accumulation of solute\nconcentration within the pore space), whereas, at fast precipitation, the\nslowdown is due to a mechanical mechanism (stress reduction at the contact).\n",
