  "abstract": "  Exploratory search of large text corpora is essential in domains like\nbiomedical research, where large amounts of research literature are\ncontinuously generated. This paper presents ClusterTalk (The demo video and\nsource code are available at: https://github.com/achouhan93/ClusterTalk), a\nframework for corpus exploration using multi-dimensional exploratory search.\nOur system integrates document clustering with faceted search, allowing users\nto interactively refine their exploration and ask corpus and document-level\nqueries. Compared to traditional one-dimensional search approaches like keyword\nsearch or clustering, this system improves the discoverability of information\nby encouraging a deeper interaction with the corpus. We demonstrate the\nfunctionality of the ClusterTalk framework based on four million PubMed\nabstracts for the four-year time frame.\n",
