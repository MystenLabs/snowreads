Namely, keeping the Hausdorff\nlocally convex topological vector spaces setting, we clarify the relationships\nbetween the upper estimates and lower estimates for the subdifferential and the\nsingular subdifferential of the optimal value function. As shown by an example,\nthe lower estimates can be strict. But, surprisingly, each upper estimate is an\nequality. Thus, exact formulas for the subdifferential and the singular\nsubdifferential under consideration are obtained. In addition, it is proved\nthat each subdifferential upper estimate coincides with the corresponding lower\nestimate if either the objective function or the constraint set-valued map is\npolyhedral convex.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oPvQTwOTzFbDsH-Oit_fjNoDDiJLJ8sGEIS41OqywUA","pdfSize":"215916"}
