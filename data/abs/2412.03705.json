Here, we report the\ndiscovery of a photo-induced state with a lifetime of 17 ps in the van der\nWaals antiferromagnet NiPS$_3$, which appears exclusively with resonant pumping\nat 1.476 eV in the antiferromagnetic state. The long-lived state comes with a\nnegative photoconductivity, a characteristic optical response of population\ninversion. Our findings demonstrate a promising pathway to potentially achieve\nlong-lived lasing at terahertz frequencies in reduced dimensions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NkaFqQ8JNGvBjgvSj9ZRL6Vdyqr-skqhti_Z7cEV81I","pdfSize":"1115852"}
