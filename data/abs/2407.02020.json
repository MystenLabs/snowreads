We assume\nthat the functions $f_i$, matrices $\\mathbf{A}_i$, and vectors $b_i$ are stored\nlocally by the nodes of a computational network, and that the functions $f_i$\nare smooth and strongly convex.\n  This problem has significant applications in resource allocation and systems\ncontrol and can also arise in distributed machine learning. We propose lower\ncomplexity bounds for decentralized optimization problems with coupled\nconstraints and a first-order algorithm achieving the lower bounds. To the best\nof our knowledge, our method is also the first linearly convergent first-order\ndecentralized algorithm for problems with general affine coupled constraints.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rLDzN4eSNhgkm4BOoAHdUqJSMS9qq_G8cVMcRjOMWsM","pdfSize":"693569"}
