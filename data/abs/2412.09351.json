We introduce a new DOCT\nalgorithm that provides more direct interpretation of DOCT in the contexts of\ndynamic scatterer ratio and scatterer speed in the tissue.The detailed\nproperties of the new and conventional DOCT methods are investigated by\nnumerical simulations, and the experimental validation with in vitro and ex\nvivo samples demonstrates the feasibility of the new method.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Biological Physics","Physics/Medical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"5Wj51tdyRhM5Dtn5pIBvVSuj5iFQEN9xn0PhVR0JtPI","pdfSize":"1889390"}
