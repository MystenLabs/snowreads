With the advancement of\ngenerative AI, conversational agent technology, and Large Language Models,\nthese tools can be a great support for parents to guide and assist their\nchildren. Recognizing the challenges faced by parents in navigating the\ncomplexities of child-rearing, this study seeks to explore the applications of\nAI, particularly leveraging the capabilities of ChatGPT, to provide valuable\nassistance and guidance. For this purpose, we perform a comprehensive\nexamination of the existing 27 literature studies to investigate the potential\nof AI-driven platforms for offering advice tailored to the individual needs of\nthe parents. We break down these research works into three domains based on\ntheir research criteria, and categorize each domain into two subgroups:\npre-chatGPT era, and post-chatGPT era. At last, we investigate the significant\ndimensions of these literatures and present some valuable findings and future\nresearch directions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wKefcuNTcohc_xBAgtC5sXum51JGjj8J1TJtj0vBSns","pdfSize":"525090"}
