We solve the Einstein field\nequations incorporating an anisotropic energy-momentum tensor and obtain\ndifferent physical quantities associated with the matter content. A crucial\naspect of this study is the non-exotic matter distribution, examined through\nthe evaluation of energy conditions, and exploring how different shape\nfunctions impact these conditions. Additionally, the anisotropy parameter is\ncalculated to quantify the extent of attractive or repulsive behavior. Our\nstudy demonstrates that for different types of shape function forms, the energy\nconditions are influenced by the global monopole parameter. Our findings\nprovide valuable insights for further theoretical explorations of these\nfascinating hypothetical structures in the realm of general relativity and\nbeyond\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KpZqxjHMiL2wbC7fWhvYfrsLznPhV5DgoWMvmwte1oQ","pdfSize":"3586662"}
