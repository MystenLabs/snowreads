  "abstract": "  In this paper, we consider the existence of concentrated helical vortices of\n3D incompressible Euler equations with swirl. First, without the assumption of\nthe orthogonality condition, we derive a 2D vorticity-stream formulation of 3D\nincompressible Euler equations under helical symmetry. Then based on this\nsystem, we deduce a non-autonomous second order semilinear elliptic equations\nin divergence form, whose solutions correspond to traveling-rotating invariant\nhelical vortices with non-zero helical swirl. Finally, by using Arnold's\nvariational method, that is, finding maximizers of a properly defined energy\nfunctional over a certain function space and proving the asymptotic behavior of\nmaximizers, we construct families of concentrated traveling-rotating helical\nvortices of 3D incompressible Euler equations with non-zero helical swirl in\ninfinite cylinders. As parameter $ \\varepsilon\\to0 $, the associated vorticity\nfields tend asymptotically to a singular helical vortex filament evolved by the\nbinormal curvature flow.\n",
