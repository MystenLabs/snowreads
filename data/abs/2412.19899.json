By considering the pipe\nsubjected to an arbitrary harmonic force, either distributed or concentrated,\nan analytical solution is found using the Green's function method. The\nclosed-form solution obtained satisfies the differential equations governing\nthe vibrating tube conveying fluid. The proposed method, which provides exact\nsolutions, is more accurate than the classical eigenfunction expansion or\nGalerkin's method and eliminates the need for eigenfunctions, eigenvalues, or\ninfinite series.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Yt9_P-KWELlGL79ap7p7TLkn1ni642Jo2TGm2xysc-M","pdfSize":"385906"}
