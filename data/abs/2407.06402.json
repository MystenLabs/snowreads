The\npossibility of observing polariton blockade in a dimer and triple micropillar\nconfiguration is discussed. We identify the resonance conditions corresponding\nto the onset of the photon blockade. The discovered quantum effects allow using\nthese systems as versatile sources of individual polaritons. Various\nmanifestations of the quantum blockade can be tuned with the use of the pumping\nlaser frequency. We demonstrate that the presence of the cascade coupling\nbetween pillars enhances manifestations of sub-Poissonian statistics.\nApplication of the effective gauge field in the triangle configuration allows\nfor manifestation of a collective antibunching effect. In particular, we\nidentify conditions of a multimode blockade -- a phenomenon consisting in\nblocking of excitation of the state with $n$ particles distributed over\nmultiple coupled modes. A new effect of quantum entanglement of a non-Hermitian\ndimer with a micropillar in an artificial magnetic field has been discovered,\nassociated with the simultaneous manifestation of antibunching on the dimer,\nthe micropillar associated with it, and the triple-micropillar.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XUH54iZXu3ocdjD2EqvqI2YgOXkP_jh12n-qbQvmxnM","pdfSize":"6722246"}
