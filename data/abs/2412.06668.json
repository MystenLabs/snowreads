The burst had a duration\nof about 0.2 s, a fluence of $8 \\times 10^{-7}$ erg cm-2 in the 20 keV-10 MeV\nrange and a hard spectrum, characterized by a peak energy of 680 keV. The\nposition of GRB 241107A has been precisely determined because it fell inside\nthe imaging field of view of the IBIS coded mask instrument. The presence of\nthe nearby galaxy PGC 86046 in the 3 arcmin radius error region, suggests that\nGRB 241107A might be a giant flare from a magnetar rather than a canonical\nshort GRB. For the 4.1 Mpc distance of PGC 86046, the isotropic energy of $1.6\n\\times 10^{45}$ erg is in agreement with this hypothesis, that is also\nsupported by the time resolved spectral properties similar to those of the few\nother extragalactic magnetars giant flares detected so far.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wMno9ehwaXJclXrse0OT4Dy5eo4ODt05hLYToS5944I","pdfSize":"3265477"}
