  "abstract": "  We introduce the concept of resonant optical torque that allows enhancing\nsubstantially a transfer of optical angular momentum (AM) of light to a\nsubwavelength particle. We consider high-index cylindrical dielectric\nnanoparticles supporting Mie resonances, and explore a transfer of AM and how\nit is affected by absorption and particle shape. We analyse a simple trapping\ngeometry of standing wave patterns created by opposite helical light waves. We\nuncover stable rotation of particles in both nodes and anti-nodes, and also\nstudy how specific particle properties influence the resonant optical torque.\nWe demonstrate that adjusting particle losses can maximize spinning torque, and\nwe predict \"super-torque\" originating from the superabsorption effect at\nresonances. Our study offers a deeper understanding of the physics of resonant\noptical torque and its importance in manipulating AM transfer in optical\nsystems, with promising implications for various fields and inspiring further\nresearch in resonant light-matter interactions.\n",
