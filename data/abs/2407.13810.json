Finite fermion masses are taken into account throughout this\ncalculation, and in performing the collinear limit for the final quark states\nand all light fermions taking part in this process, the importance of mass\neffects is demonstrated. This gives hints for the deviation of the total decay\nrate and the branching ratios into massive fermions between experimental\nmeasurements and theoretical predictions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"C4aC8m28Ex0Pzej5H0L9f9cy7ZcglTMdUGwVsqMyJpg","pdfSize":"386419"}
