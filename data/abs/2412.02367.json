Where he sees diversity, I see an opportunity for unity. In this\narticle, I argue that classical statistics, model selection, and machine\nlearning share a foundation that is reliabilist in an unconventional sense that\naligns with internalism. Hence a unification under internalist reliabilism.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Other Statistics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"qQjDCcNLANKu99Nm1skhtc-_F_ZwM6GJLfPI97IItjY","pdfSize":"150284"}
