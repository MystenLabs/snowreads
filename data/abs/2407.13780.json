To address this, we propose a novel generative latent-variable\ntransformer model for small molecules that leverages a recently proposed\nmolecular string representation called SAFE. We introduce a modification to\nSAFE to reduce the number of invalid fragmented molecules generated during\ntraining and use this to train our model. Our experiments show that our model\ncan generate novel molecules with a validity rate > 90% and a fragmentation\nrate < 1% by sampling from a latent space. By fine-tuning the model using\nreinforcement learning to improve molecular docking, we significantly increase\nthe number of hit candidates for five specific protein targets compared to the\npre-trained model, nearly doubling this number for certain targets.\nAdditionally, our top 5% mean docking scores are comparable to the current\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA), and we marginally outperform SOTA on three of the five\ntargets.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GCc_8PaJbFDNNh1FcGHRjqZTmnT47G2JHvMMqovsBtI","pdfSize":"1013267"}
