Most of them use self-attention along the channel\ndimension or within spatially fixed-range blocks to reduce computational load.\nHowever, such a compromise results in limitations in capturing long-range\nspatial features. Inspired by the observation that the weather-induced\ndegradation factors mainly cause similar occlusion and brightness, in this\nwork, we propose an efficient Histogram Transformer (Histoformer) for restoring\nimages affected by adverse weather. It is powered by a mechanism dubbed\nhistogram self-attention, which sorts and segments spatial features into\nintensity-based bins. Self-attention is then applied across bins or within each\nbin to selectively focus on spatial features of dynamic range and process\nsimilar degraded pixels of the long range together. To boost histogram\nself-attention, we present a dynamic-range convolution enabling conventional\nconvolution to conduct operation over similar pixels rather than neighbor\npixels. We also observe that the common pixel-wise losses neglect linear\nassociation and correlation between output and ground-truth. Thus, we propose\nto leverage the Pearson correlation coefficient as a loss function to enforce\nthe recovered pixels following the identical order as ground-truth. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of our proposed method. We\nhave released the codes in Github.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fVkKQHKQFrRLYvLj8VtnJJ5W1ULwDoNrAxw52hYctNk","pdfSize":"9889325"}
