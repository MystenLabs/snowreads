This paper presents a novel\nLLM-driven system that provides targeted feedback for conceptual designs in a\nDatabase Systems course. The system converts student-created\nentity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) into JSON format, allows the student to\nprune the diagram by isolating a relationship, extracts relevant requirements\nfor the selected relationship, and utilizes a large language model (LLM) to\ngenerate detailed feedback. Additionally, the system creates a tailored set of\nquestions and answers to further aid student understanding. Our pilot\nimplementation in a Database System course demonstrates effective feedback\ngeneration that helped the students improve their design skills.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Databases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BAWf1Kk9XTBRPkbo6aZsJHCGBr7v-zTI73-pc4mHAFM","pdfSize":"946586"}
