  "abstract": "  This position paper investigates the potential of integrating insights from\nlanguage impairment research and its clinical treatment to develop\nhuman-inspired learning strategies and evaluation frameworks for language\nmodels (LMs). We inspect the theoretical underpinnings underlying some\ninfluential linguistically motivated training approaches derived from\nneurolinguistics and, particularly, aphasiology, aimed at enhancing the\nrecovery and generalization of linguistic skills in aphasia treatment, with a\nprimary focus on those targeting the syntactic domain. We highlight how these\ninsights can inform the design of rigorous assessments for LMs, specifically in\ntheir handling of complex syntactic phenomena, as well as their implications\nfor developing human-like learning strategies, aligning with efforts to create\nmore sustainable and cognitively plausible natural language processing (NLP)\nmodels.\n",
