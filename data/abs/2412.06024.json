Starting from a microscopic\nquantum theory, we employ a quasiparticle approximation to describe the\nevolution of hydrodynamic degrees of freedom and establish its connection to\nthe Wigner formalism. Using methods from relativistic kinetic theory, we\nperform a second-order expansion to derive a closed set of equations for the\ncomponents of the stress-energy tensor and the baryon current. The resulting\ntransport coefficients, which depend on the equation of state, are obtained\nthrough a unified prescription that ensures thermodynamic consistency.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"umIPdmiT50790_X6Pil1jEiavRg39cTck-jniMJ-fps","pdfSize":"495765"}
