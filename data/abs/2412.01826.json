To eliminate the\nneed for task-specific training and efficiently handle long videos, RELOCATE\nleverages a region-based representation derived from pretrained vision models.\nAt a high level, it follows the classic object localization approach: (1)\nidentify all objects in each video frame, (2) compare the objects with the\ngiven query and select the most similar ones, and (3) perform bidirectional\ntracking to get a spatio-temporal response. However, we propose some key\nenhancements to handle small objects, cluttered scenes, partial visibility, and\nvarying appearances. Notably, we refine the selected objects for accurate\nlocalization and generate additional visual queries to capture visual\nvariations. We evaluate RELOCATE on the challenging Ego4D Visual Query 2D\nLocalization dataset, establishing a new baseline that outperforms prior\ntask-specific methods by 49% (relative improvement) in spatio-temporal average\nprecision.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sZt6iwe-f3L9iZNkX-FYA87iDiO7S7SFkQjOXobgdFA","pdfSize":"8856759"}
