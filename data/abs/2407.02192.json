Recently, there has been a growing interest in the unknown space due to\nthe necessity of better understanding the situation. Although Occupancy Grids\nhave received numerous extensions over the years to address emerging needs,\ncurrently, few works go beyond the delimitation of the unknown space area and\nseek to incorporate additional information. This work builds upon the already\nwell-established LiDAR-based Dynamic Occupancy Grid to introduce a\ncomplementary Categorized Grid that conveys its estimation using semantic\nlabels while adding new insights into the possible causes of unknown space. The\nproposed categorization first divides the space by occupancy and then further\ncategorizes the occupied and unknown space. Occupied space is labeled based on\nits dynamic state and reliability, while the unknown space is labeled according\nto its possible causes, whether they stem from the perception system's inherent\nconstraints, limitations induced by the environment, or other causes. The\nproposed Categorized Grid is showcased in real-world scenarios demonstrating\nits usefulness for better situation understanding.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IAHzzjfpNk_VNZY2sFnrNDingfQe74Hz2ms_U073kJQ","pdfSize":"23415051"}
