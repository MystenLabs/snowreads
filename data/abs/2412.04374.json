  "abstract": "  The next generation of force fields for molecular dynamics will be developed\nusing a wealth of data. Training systematically with experimental data remains\na challenge, however, especially for machine learning potentials.\nDifferentiable molecular simulation calculates gradients of observables with\nrespect to parameters through molecular dynamics trajectories. Here we improve\nthis approach by explicitly calculating gradients using a reverse-time\nsimulation with effectively constant memory cost and a computation count\nsimilar to the forward simulation. The method is applied to learn all-atom\nwater and gas diffusion models with different functional forms, and to train a\nmachine learning potential for diamond from scratch. Comparison to ensemble\nreweighting indicates that reversible simulation can provide more accurate\ngradients and train to match time-dependent observables.\n",
