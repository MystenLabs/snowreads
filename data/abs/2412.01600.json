Such methods are promising for a range of\nmeasurements, including at the Large Hadron Collider, where no single\nobservable may be optimal to scan over the entire theoretical phase space under\nconsideration, or where binning data into histograms could result in a loss of\nsensitivity. This work develops a neural simulation-based inference framework\nfor statistical inference, using neural networks to estimate probability\ndensity ratios, which enables the application to a full-scale analysis. It\nincorporates a large number of systematic uncertainties, quantifies the\nuncertainty due to the finite number of events in training samples, develops a\nmethod to construct confidence intervals, and demonstrates a series of\nintermediate diagnostic checks that can be performed to validate the robustness\nof the method. As an example, the power and feasibility of the method are\nassessed on simulated data for a simplified version of an off-shell Higgs boson\ncouplings measurement in the four-lepton final states. This approach represents\nan extension to the standard statistical methodology used by the experiments at\nthe Large Hadron Collider, and can benefit many physics analyses.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MQUYzyvKmD7_MpBTJdGCKbKraZ5ZsbQFNZpJzvTXWpU","pdfSize":"1846443"}
