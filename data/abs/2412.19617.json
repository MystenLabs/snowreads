  "abstract": "  Superconductivity in nickelates apparently takes place in two different Ni\noxidation regimes, namely either for infinite-layer-type compounds close to\nNi$^{+}$, or for Ruddlesden-Popper materials close to Ni$^{2+}$. The reduced\nLa$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$ bilayer with a nominal Ni$^{1.5+}$ oxidation state may\ntherefore serve as a normal-state mediator between the two known families of\n$3d^8$-like and $3d^9$-like superconducting nickelates. Using first-principles\nmany-body theory, we explain its experimental 50\\,meV charge gap as originating\nfrom a new type of correlated (quasi-)insulator. Flat-band electrons of\nNi-$d_{z^2}$ character become localized from scattering with orbital-selective\nMott-localized Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons, by trading in residual hopping\nenergy for a gain in local exchange energy in a ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice\nscenario. Most importantly, the flat-band electrons offer another route to\nunconventional superconductivity in nickelates at ambient pressure.\n",
