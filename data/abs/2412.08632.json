In this letter, we show how\nthese edge states can host a variety of phases driven by electron interaction\neffects, including multi-channel helical Luttinger liquid, spin density wave,\nsuperconducting phases, and a new type of $\\pi$-junction analog of the latter\ntwo, where the transitions between the phases can be controlled. The\nsuperconducting phase in the interacting system is shown to be adiabatically\nconnected to a time-reversal-symmetric topological superconductor in the\nnon-interacting DIII class. This connection stabilizes Majorana Kramers pairs\nas domain wall states at the interface between the superconducting and\n$\\pi$-spin-density wave phases, with the latter exhibiting a\ntime-reversal-symmetric spin-density wave phase. We discuss the possibility of\nrealizing our proposed scheme for generating Majorana Kramers pairs in a\ncold-atom based platform with existing techniques, and how it could offer\npotential advantages over other approaches.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Atomic and Molecular Clusters"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"VQ1QiY_yLO_IErPWiTYs4Ba61mtcM9GoEFX3gmpeL-0","pdfSize":"2135190"}
