Reasoning under various\nforms of uncertainty is both a key feature and a challenging barrier for\nautomated argumentative reasoning. It was shown that argumentative reasoning\nusing probabilities faces in general high computational complexity, in\nparticular for the so-called constellation approach. In this paper, we develop\nan algorithmic approach to overcome this obstacle. We refine existing\ncomplexity results and show that two main reasoning tasks, that of computing\nthe probability of a given set being an extension and an argument being\nacceptable, diverge in their complexity: the former is #P-complete and the\nlatter is #-dot-NP-complete when considering their underlying counting\nproblems. We present an algorithm for the complex task of computing the\nprobability of a set of arguments being a complete extension by using dynamic\nprogramming operating on tree-decompositions. An experimental evaluation shows\npromise of our approach.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"s8ARTDOeCdfZeQwDeJCaMD9Vwq3rwDWsI1W3BeQ4Mw4","pdfSize":"249616"}
