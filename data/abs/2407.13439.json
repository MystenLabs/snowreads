This creates barriers to\ngenerating music beyond the genres represented in dominant datasets such as\nWestern Classical music or pop music. We undertook a 4 month international\nresearch project summarised in this paper to explore the eXplainable AI (XAI)\nchallenges and opportunities associated with reducing barriers to using\nmarginalised genres of music with AI models. XAI opportunities identified\nincluded topics of improving transparency and control of AI models, explaining\nthe ethics and bias of AI models, fine tuning large models with small datasets\nto reduce bias, and explaining style-transfer opportunities with AI models.\nParticipants in the research emphasised that whilst it is hard to work with\nsmall datasets such as marginalised music and AI, such approaches strengthen\ncultural representation of underrepresented cultures and contribute to\naddressing issues of bias of deep learning models. We are now building on this\nproject to bring together a global International Responsible AI Music community\nand invite people to join our network.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DBfQ03qEImue_PF3jiwJF0nEougFXs0QgM_Qt_7B5_M","pdfSize":"1779189","objectId":"0x8fd9a8e9038a5d3bd6896bb4fc228c0983a0465d8e28c4754402bb10d4332251","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
