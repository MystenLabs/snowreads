The latter includes a potential infrared enhancement of the vertex\nstrength of the classical tensor structure that accommodates for the physical\nstrength of chiral symmetry breaking. We find a critical vertex strength, below\nwhich the quark has a K\\\"all\\'en-Lehmann representation. While the nature of\nthe first singularity does not change above the critical strength, we find that\nthe quark propagator features at least two additional pairs of complex\nconjugate poles that are located approximately at the sum of quark pole mass\nand peak position of the quark-gluon coupling. These additional poles lead to\nviolations of causality, if they persist in $S$-matrix elements. While the\nvertex strength of the classical tensor structure in full QCD is below the\ncritical one, that of commonly used vertex models, which rely solely on the\nclassical vertex structure, is typically above it. Finally, we discuss how\nthese additional poles could be avoided in full QCD, where part of chiral\nsymmetry breaking is generated by the other tensor structures in the\nquark-gluon vertex.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sMEBNJHK48e206vBtg0-pS_DeatYPq7o4xF2kKQ9gpU","pdfSize":"668431"}
