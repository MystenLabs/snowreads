This hybrid\nsetup can be brought to the quantum critical regime by varying gate voltages\nand contact resistances. We explore the nature of quantum criticality, Kondo\neffect, charge fractionalization and transport in such a hybrid setup, and\nverify their robust non-Fermi liquid behaviors. Our work opens a promising\nroute for quantum simulating exotic zero temperature quantum critical phenomena\nassociated with Luttinger liquid physics in a nanoengineered electronic circuit\nwith well-defined quantum Hall channels.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XdsRsIjTc-g91Qv0tH8RZY-Y1-PbELEWaJU5eE_lVR0","pdfSize":"391018"}
