Orientational data appear as sets of\nangles, unit vectors, rotation matrices or quaternions. In the field of\ndirectional statistics, a lot of advances have been made in modelling such\ntypes of data. However, only a few of these tools are used in engineering and\ncomputer science applications. Hence, this paper aims to serve as a cheat sheet\nfor those probability distributions of orientations. Models for 1-DOF, 2-DOF\nand 3-DOF orientations are discussed. For each of them, expressions for the\ndensity function, fitting to data, and sampling are presented. The paper is\nwritten with a compromise between engineering and statistics in terms of\nnotation and terminology. A Python library with functions for some of these\nmodels is provided. Using this library, two examples of applications to real\ndata are presented.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SeOGmrUMkpmzTH7cBoga-YEZ_LSbA8AnP_tu7ENlh-o","pdfSize":"6059136"}
