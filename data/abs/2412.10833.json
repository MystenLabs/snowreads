  "abstract": "  The development of technologies for creating various types of solid-state\ndetectors for optical astronomy is reviewed. The principles of designing\nastronomical photodetecting systems with large-format sensors based on\ncharge-coupled device (CCD) and complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)\nstructures are analyzed. Examples of the most advanced projects to which they\nhave been applied are given. The history of the creation of optical detectors\nfor telescopes operated in Russia is described, and a brief description and\ncharacteristics of the developed systems are provided. The results of testing\nin real research are displayed. The prospects for creating large-format systems\nbased on CCD and CMOS detectors manufactured in Russia and abroad are\ndiscussed.\n",
