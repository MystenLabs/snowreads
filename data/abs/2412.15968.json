Not only does this give a unified\napproach to classifying stably finite and purely infinite $C^\\ast$-algebras, in\ncontrast to the other proofs of the Kirchberg--Phillips theorem, our proof does\nnot rely on Kirchberg's Geneva Theorems, but instead implies them as\ncorollaries (for nuclear $C^\\ast$-algebras).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qR_wQKow4r8jBfXiyw13Q9yZLfBvjUXcmYLyb4_FkzY","pdfSize":"594668"}
