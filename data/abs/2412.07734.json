  "abstract": "  Multi-photon processes deteriorate the quantum non-demolition (QND) character\nof the dispersive readout in circuit QED, causing readout to lag behind single\nand two-qubit gates, in both speed and fidelity. Alternative methods such as\nthe longitudinal readout have been proposed, however, it is unknown to what\nextent multi-photon processes hinder this approach. Here we investigate the QND\ncharacter of the longitudinal readout of the transmon qubit. We show that the\ndeleterious effects that arise due to multi-photon transitions can be heavily\nsuppressed with detuning, owing to the fact that the longitudinal interaction\nstrength is independent of the transmon-resonator detuning. We consider the\neffect of circuit disorder, the selection rules that act on the transmon, as\nwell as the description of longitudinal readout in the classical limit of the\ntransmon to show qualitatively that longitudinal readout is robust. We show\nthat fast, high-fidelity QND readout of transmon qubits is possible with\nlongitudinal coupling.\n",
