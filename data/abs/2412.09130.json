  "abstract": "  We investigate the signal of the chiral magnetic effect (CME) in Au+Au\ncollisions and isobar collisions of $_{44}^{96}\\text{Ru}+\\rm{} _{44}^{96}Ru$\nand $_{40}^{96}\\text{Zr}+\\rm{}_{40}^{96}Zr$ in the newly developed chiral\nanomaly transport (CAT) module based on the state-of-the-art model a multiphase\ntransport (AMPT). Our numerical simulation results for the ratio charge\ncorrelation $\\Delta\\gamma$ in Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions are close to the\nlatest experimental data. The simulation shows that the CME signal is larger in\nRu+Ru collisions than that in Zr+Zr collisions, while the background is\nsmaller, and the upper limit of the CME signal is $15\\%$ in the isobar\ncollisions.\n",
