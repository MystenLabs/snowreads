  "abstract": "  As there is a long-standing controversy over the time delay between the two\nimages of the gravitationally lensed quasar FBQ 0951+2635, we combined early\nand new optical light curves to robustly measure a delay of 13.5 +/- 1.6 d\n(1sigma interval). The new optical records covering the last 17 yr were also\nused to trace the long-timescale evolution of the microlensing variability.\nAdditionally, the new time delay interval and a relatively rich set of further\nobservational constraints allowed us to discuss the mass structure of the main\nlensing galaxy at redshift 0.26. This lens system is of particular interest\nbecause the external shear from secondary gravitational deflectors is\nrelatively low, but the external convergence is one of the highest known. When\nmodelling the galaxy as a singular power-law ellipsoid without\nhypotheses/priors on the power-law index, ellipticity and position angle, we\ndemonstrated that its mass profile is close to isothermal, and there is good\nalignment between mass and near-IR light. We also recovered the true mass scale\nof the galaxy. Finally, it is worth mentioning that a constant mass-to-light\nratio model also worked acceptably well.\n",
