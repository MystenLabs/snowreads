  "abstract": "  Simultaneously considering multiple objectives in machine learning has been a\npopular approach for several decades, with various benefits for multi-task\nlearning, the consideration of secondary goals such as sparsity, or\nmulticriteria hyperparameter tuning. However - as multi-objective optimization\nis significantly more costly than single-objective optimization - the recent\nfocus on deep learning architectures poses considerable additional challenges\ndue to the very large number of parameters, strong nonlinearities and\nstochasticity. This survey covers recent advancements in the area of\nmulti-objective deep learning. We introduce a taxonomy of existing methods -\nbased on the type of training algorithm as well as the decision maker's needs -\nbefore listing recent advancements, and also successful applications. All three\nmain learning paradigms supervised learning, unsupervised learning and\nreinforcement learning are covered, and we also address the recently very\npopular area of generative modeling.\n",
