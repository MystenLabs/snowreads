  "abstract": "  Two-player graph games are a fundamental model for reasoning about the\ninteraction of agents. These games are played between two players who move a\ntoken along a graph. In bidding games, the players have some monetary budget,\nand at each step they bid for the privilege of moving the token. Typically, the\nwinner of the bid either pays the loser or the bank, or a combination thereof.\nWe introduce Robin Hood bidding games, where at the beginning of every step the\nricher player pays the poorer a fixed fraction of the difference of their\nwealth. After the bid, the winner pays the loser. Intuitively, this captures\nthe setting where a regulating entity prevents the accumulation of wealth to\nsome degree.\n  We show that the central property of bidding games, namely the existence of a\nthreshold function, is retained in Robin Hood bidding games. We show that\nfinding the threshold can be formulated as a Mixed-Integer Linear Program.\nSurprisingly, we show that the games are not always determined exactly at the\nthreshold, unlike their standard counterpart.\n",
