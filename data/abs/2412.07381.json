At low external field strength single colloidal particles and\ndumbbells move everywhere on the pattern: At stronger external field strengths\ncolloidal singlets and dumbbells are localized in generic locations. There are\nhowever nongeneric locations of flat channels that cross the moir\\'e Wigner\nSeitz cell. In the flat channels we find gravitational driven translational and\nnon-translational dynamic phase behavior of the colloidal singlets and\ndumbbells depending on the external field strength and the precession angle of\nthe external homogeneous magnetic field.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"e8aBzuwNbYIz61gZzRrMzeiDXG7VdQJGNBNqGG0V_6w","pdfSize":"1816795"}
