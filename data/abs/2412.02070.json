The distractive\nCoulomb potential is a quantum mechanical description of distractive Coulomb\nforce between two particles with the same charge. The spectrum of the operator\n$-\\Delta +1/|x|$ is well known and there are also a few results on the\nStrichartz estimates, local and global well-posedness and scattering result\nabout the nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation with a distractive Coulomb\npotential. In the contrast, much less is known for the global and asymptotic\nbehaviour of solutions to the corresponding wave equations with a Coulomb\npotential.\n  In this work we consider the wave equation with a distractive Coulomb\npotential in dimensions $d\\geq 3$. We first describe the asymptotic behaviour\nof the solutions to the linear homogeneous Coulomb wave equation, especially\ntheir energy distribution property and scattering profiles, then show that the\nradial finite-energy solutions to suitable defocusing Coulomb wave equation are\ndefined for all time and scatter in both two time directions, by establishing a\nfamily of radial Strichartz estimates and combining them with the decay of the\npotential energy.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"NBH4Hub1ov2cYrn-F8NX9ChGVQQeqOPCmQnEuHx4W1Q","pdfSize":"971008"}
