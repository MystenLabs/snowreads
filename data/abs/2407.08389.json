For the periodic\nproblem, we couple a system having twist condition with another one whose\nnonlinearity lies between the gradients of two positive and positively\n2-homogeneous Hamiltonain functions. Concerning the Neumann-type problem, we\ntreat the same system without any twist assumption. We examine the cases of\nnonresonance, simple resonance, and double resonance by imposing some kind of\nLandesman--Lazer conditions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NZHqkOqLaEDvS8euYvXJOdztS66Atso3odIjRiYwTTI","pdfSize":"260275"}
