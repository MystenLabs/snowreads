A key to understanding this\nhigh-energy radiation in thunderstorms is to combine such measurements with\nmeasurements of lightning processes in their earliest stages. With eleven\nmodified Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) stations we can build an\ninterferometric lightning detection array working in the bandwidth between 30 -\n80 MHz inside the Surface Detector array to precisely measure lightning stepped\nleaders in 3D. These measurements allow us to decipher the cause of TGFs and\nclarify the reason for the observed high-energy particles in thunderstorms. We\nwill present the current status of the detection plans including the\nconfiguration of the interferometric lightning detection array and the steps to\ntake as well as the reconstruction characteristics obtained with AERA.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"tjk_B0ildY2zmvjKuOTBTA4PQWgugTTMpuWPi2oJbks","pdfSize":"1420128"}
