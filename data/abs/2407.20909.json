Such mechanisms impact the market\ndynamics of competitive SPs. Prior market models of spectrum sharing largely\nfocus on scenarios where competing SPs had identical coverage areas. We depart\nfrom this and consider a scenario in which two competing SPs have overlapping\nbut distinct coverage areas. We study the resulting competition using a Cournot\nmodel. Our findings reveal that with limited shared bandwidth, SPs might avoid\noverlapping areas to prevent potential losses due to interference. Sometimes\nSPs can strategically cooperate by agreeing not to provide service in the\noverlapping areas and, surprisingly, customers might also benefit from such\ncooperation under certain circumstances. Overall, market outcomes exhibit\ncomplex behaviors that are influenced by the sizes of coverage areas and the\nbandwidth of the shared spectrum.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VlirXQ3XNaUTXYVzaH7dcFVUeeAOU8nQG1ebYZFz02M","pdfSize":"1089847"}
