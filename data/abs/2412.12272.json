  "abstract": "  Binary neutron star mergers and collapsing massive stars can both create\nmillisecond magnetars. Such magnetars are candidate engines to power gamma-ray\nbursts (GRBs). The non-thermal light curve of the resulting transients can\nexhibit multiple components, including: the GRB afterglow, pulsar wind nebula\n(PWN), and ejecta afterglow. We derive the timescales for the peak of each\ncomponent and show that the PWN is detectable at radio frequencies, dominating\nthe emission for $\\sim$ 6 years for supernova/long GRBs (SN/LGRBs) and $\\sim$\n100 days for kilonova/short GRBs (KN/SGRBs) at 1 GHz, and $\\sim$ 1 year for\nSN/LGRBs and $\\sim$ 15 days for KN/SGRBs at 100 GHz. The PWN emission has an\nexponential, frequency-dependent rise to peak that cannot be replicated by an\nejecta afterglow. We show that PWNe in SN/LGRBs can be detected out to $z \\sim\n0.06$ with current instruments and $z \\sim 0.3$ with next-generation\ninstruments and PWNe in KN/SGRBs can be detected out to $z \\sim 0.3$ with\ncurrent instruments and $z \\sim 1.5$ with next-generation instruments. We find\nthat the optimal strategy for detecting PWNe in these systems is a multi-band,\nhigh cadence radio follow-up of nearby KN/SGRBs with an x-ray plateau or\nextended prompt emission from 10 - 100 days post-burst.\n",
