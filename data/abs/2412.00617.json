  "abstract": "  This paper addresses the problem of steering an initial probability\ndistribution to a target probability distribution through a deterministic or\nstochastic linear control system. Our proposed approach is inspired by the flow\nmatching methodology, with the difference that we can only affect the flow\nthrough the given control channels. The motivation comes from applications such\nas robotic swarms and stochastic thermodynamics, where agents or particles can\nonly be manipulated through control actions. The feedback control law that\nachieves the task is characterized as the conditional expectation of the\ncontrol inputs for the stochastic bridges that respect the given control system\ndynamics. Explicit forms are derived for special cases, and a numerical\nprocedure is presented to approximate the control law, illustrated with\nexamples.\n",
