This scheme allows, for the first\ntime in Eikonal-based modeling, to capture all possible signal reentries\nbetween the Purkinje network and the cardiac muscle that may occur under\npathological conditions. As part of the proposed scheme, we introduce a new\npseudo-time method for the Eikonal-diffusion problem in the myocardium, to\ncorrectly enforce electrical stimuli coming from the Purkinje network. We test\nour approach by performing numerical simulations of cardiac electrophysiology\nin a real biventricular geometry, under both pathological and therapeutic\nconditions, to demonstrate its flexibility, robustness, and accuracy.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"b8JE7DV4I8uj9SUG0HOoChYTg6Cuzy1WvVl1XgO3Om4","pdfSize":"19271768"}
