Additionally, they undergo a ferroelectric\ntransition when subjected to a few percent of tensile strain. The ferroelectric\ntransitions of these materials are found to have a universal origin in the\nstrong cross-bandgap hybridization of the cation $p$ orbitals, enabled by the\ncation 6s$^2$ lone-pair electrons and the litharge-type structure of the\n[Pb$_2$F$_2$] and [Bi$_2$O$_2$] layers, as demonstrated by the strain-induced\nferroelectric transition in the archetypal litharge $\\alpha$-PbO. These results\nestablish materials with a litharge-type structural unit as a large and\nversatile family of highly polarizable layered semiconductors in proximity to\nferroelectricity, offering vast opportunities for multifunctional materials\ndesign.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"2_BVUFU8hFvWblXozjYvdM2PXkoi5FZf74NZyDC8Uwc","pdfSize":"2640925"}
