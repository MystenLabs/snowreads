  "abstract": "  We prove Kim's Assumtion A for the split classical groups in positive\ncharacteristic. Actually, we work in the slightly more general setting of\ngroups of classical kind, which includes quasi-split classical groups and\ngeneralized spinor groups. We establish our results whenever a local Ramanujan\nbound holds; a bound that is known for the split classical groups in\ncharacteristic $p$, and we prove it for groups of classical kind under a\nlocal-global restriction.\n",
