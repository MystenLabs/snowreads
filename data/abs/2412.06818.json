  "abstract": "  The working environment in healthcare analytics is transforming with the\nemergence of healthcare 5.0 and the advancements in quantum neural networks. In\naddition to analyzing a comprehensive set of case studies, we also review\nrelevant literature from the fields of quantum computing applications and smart\nhealthcare analytics, focusing on the implications of quantum deep neural\nnetworks. This study aims to shed light on the existing research gaps regarding\nthe implications of quantum neural networks in healthcare analytics. We argue\nthat the healthcare industry is currently transitioning from automation towards\ngenuine collaboration with quantum networks, which presents new avenues for\nresearch and exploration. Specifically, this study focuses on evaluating the\nperformance of Healthcare 5.0, which involves the integration of diverse\nquantum machine learning and quantum neural network systems. This study also\nexplores a range of potential challenges and future directions for Healthcare\n5.0, particularly focusing on the integration of quantum neural networks.\n",
