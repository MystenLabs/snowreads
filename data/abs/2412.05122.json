  "abstract": "  This paper is concerned with lattice field models in dimension at least 2.\nThe action is a uniformly convex function of the gradient of the field. The\nmain result Theorem 1.4 proves that charge-charge correlations in the Coulomb\ndipole gas are close to Gaussian. These results go beyond previous results of\nDimock-Hurd and Conlon-Spencer. The approach in the paper is based on the\nobservation that the sine-Gordon probability measure corresponding to the\ndipole gas is the invariant measure for a certain stochastic dynamics. The\nstochastic dynamics here differs from the stochastic dynamics in previous work\nused to study the problem.\n",
