Using density matrix renormalization group\ncalculations and finite-size scaling analysis, we characterize the critical\nproperties of transitions between disordered and ordered phases. Both\nquantities exhibit characteristic scaling near transition points, with the\ndisorder to $Z_2$ ordered phase transition showing behavior consistent with the\nIsing universality class, while the disorder to $Z_3$ phase transition displays\ndistinct critical properties. We demonstrate that GP and GE serve as sensitive\nprobes of quantum criticality, providing consistent critical parameters and\nscaling behavior. A unifying description of these geometric quantities from a\nquantum geometry perspective is explored, and an interferometric setup for\ntheir potential measurement is discussed. Our results provide insights into the\ninterplay between geometric phase and multipartite entanglement near quantum\nphase transitions in Rydberg atom systems, revealing how these quantities\nreflect the underlying critical behavior in these complex quantum many-body\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"KXNrAwQYwovZgz09c1BIsgZytXro1LEYWU4_adJszgE","pdfSize":"803720"}
