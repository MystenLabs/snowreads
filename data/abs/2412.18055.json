  "abstract": "  The interactions of low-energy neutrinos with nuclei provide a unique window\nto explore various Standard Model (SM) and Beyond the Standard Model (BSM)\nprocesses. In particular, the recent observation of coherent elastic\nneutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS), predicted over five decades ago, has\ngenerated significant interest across disciplines. With its high cross section\nand suitability for compact detectors, particularly with stopped pion\nneutrinos, CEvNS offers a powerful probe for light, weakly coupled new physics.\nOngoing global experimental efforts now aim to leverage CEvNS to test SM\npredictions and search for BSM signals, where deviations in event rates or\nspectra could reveal new physics. We present here an estimate of the number of\nrecoil events obtained from CEvNS using the current and upcoming liquid argon\nbased experiments. Furthermore, the event rate due to the inclusion of neutrino\nmagnetic moment is also discussed.\n",
