These statistics are\nused to estimate carbon emissions and provided to policymakers to inform their\ndecisions on transportation policy and infrastructure. Due to the inherent\nsensitivity of this type of user data, it is crucial that the statistics\nderived and released from it are computed with appropriate privacy protections.\nIn this work, we use a combination of federated analytics and differential\nprivacy to release these required statistics, while operating under strict\nerror constraints to ensure utility for downstream stakeholders. In this work,\nwe propose a new mechanism that achieves $ \\epsilon \\approx 2 $-DP while\nsatisfying these strict utility constraints, greatly improving over natural\nbaselines. We believe this mechanism may be of more general interest for the\nbroad class of group-by-sum workloads.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"01WD92NZ-Pt7SHlwglBNi8w8ow63VaAd6qyMlvS_jrw","pdfSize":"373769"}
