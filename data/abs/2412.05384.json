In this\npaper, we initiate the study of detector operators and their correlation\nfunctions in perturbative quantum gravity. Inspired by recent progress in field\ntheory, we introduce a broad class of new asymptotic observables in gravity. We\noutline how correlation functions of detector operators can be efficiently\ncomputed from squared, state-summed amplitudes, allowing us to harness the\nwealth of perturbative scattering amplitude data to explore these observables.\nWe then compute the two-point correlator of energy detectors in the\nannihilation of two scalars into gravitons, in Einstein gravity minimally\ncoupled to a massive scalar field. We study the kinematic limits of this\ncorrelator, finding that it is finite in the collinear limit, and exhibits a\nsoft divergence in the back-to-back limit, as expected from the understanding\nof the factorization of gravitational amplitudes in the soft and collinear\nlimits. Our results offer a first exploration into the structure of detector\noperators and their correlators in perturbative quantum gravity, and we outline\nnumerous directions for future study.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"bZNUw64dtQiIEQGpRi1CPmJLXr1soZSvx5CcXffuyiQ","pdfSize":"1723728"}
