In the present work we report a detailed set of\ncalculations of the solubility of helium in lead and lead-lithium alloys. A\nseries of molecular dynamics simulations have been combined with a classical\nperturbative procedure able to compute the free energy of insertion of a helium\natom inside a liquid metal bath, directly related to the solubility of helium.\nAs the most important case, the concentration of the eutectic solution has been\nexplored in full detail. We have found that solubility of helium in pure\nlithium is lower than in pure lead, predicting a value at the eutectic state\n(16% Li-84% Pb at 508 K) of about $5 \\times 10^{-16}$ Pa$^{-1}$. The observed\ntrend indicates that solubilties rise with increasing temperatures.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"pKjT3iBXVPA9TWynkJJMWGrysdqpluj3gFrCxww76W8","pdfSize":"493643"}
