We show that they span a Hilbert space with a\ndimension equal to the exponential of the horizon area of the intermediate\nblack hole. This is consistent with the idea that, in a non-equilibrium\nsetting, entropy is the logarithm of the number of microscopic configurations\nconsistent with the dynamical macroscopic state. In our case, therefore, the\nentropy should measure the number of microstates consistent with a large and\natypical macroscopic black hole fluctuation due to which part of the early time\nstate becomes fully known to an external observer.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0G0ztuc07qT9DIH4Jngba9aSDb9M7rnj1ZoaC2TktoA","pdfSize":"1065186"}
