  "abstract": "  The increasing complexity and energy demands of deep learning models have\nhighlighted the limitations of traditional computing architectures, especially\nfor edge devices with constrained resources. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)\noffer a promising alternative by mimicking biological neural networks, enabling\nenergy-efficient computation through event-driven processing and temporal\nencoding. Concurrently, emerging hardware technologies like Resistive Random\nAccess Memory (ReRAM) and Compute-in-Memory (CIM) architectures aim to overcome\nthe Von Neumann bottleneck by integrating storage and computation. This survey\nexplores the intersection of SNNs and ReRAM-based CIM architectures, focusing\non the reliability challenges that arise from device-level variations and\noperational errors. We review the fundamental principles of SNNs and ReRAM\ncrossbar arrays, discuss the inherent reliability issues in both technologies,\nand summarize existing solutions to mitigate these challenges.\n",
