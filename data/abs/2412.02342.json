Using a rule-based approach, the method leverages a corpus of texts from\ndigitized French press articles to extract company names related to the\ndownstream space segment. This approach allowed the detection of 88 new\ndownstream space companies, enriching the existing database of the sector by\n33\\%. The paper details the identification process and provides guidelines for\nfuture replications, applying the method to other geographic areas, or adapting\nit to other industries where new entrants are challenging to identify using\ntraditional activity classifications.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1lNP5lmzWtSg9C4I4EikhtwUKE07wpyfvnWFRJrMULw","pdfSize":"2993125"}
