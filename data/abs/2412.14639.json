  "abstract": "  This work focuses on developing efficient post-hoc explanations for quantum\nAI algorithms. In classical contexts, the cooperative game theory concept of\nthe Shapley value adapts naturally to post-hoc explanations, where it can be\nused to identify which factors are important in an AI's decision-making\nprocess. An interesting question is how to translate Shapley values to the\nquantum setting and whether quantum effects could be used to accelerate their\ncalculation. We propose quantum algorithms that can extract Shapley values\nwithin some confidence interval. Our method is capable of quadratically\noutperforming classical Monte Carlo approaches to approximating Shapley values\nup to polylogarithmic factors in various circumstances. We demonstrate the\nvalidity of our approach empirically with specific voting games and provide\nrigorous proofs of performance for general cooperative games.\n",
