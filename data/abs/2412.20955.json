Here we suggest and realize a universal strategy for\ncontrolling the chiral response of resonant metasurfaces via the interplay of\nmeta-atom geometry and lattice arrangements within all five possible planar\nBravais symmetries. By introducing chiral gradient metasurfaces, we illustrate\nhow our approach allows producing a predictable chiral response tunable by\nsimple parameter variations. We highlight that symmetry-controlled chiral\nresponse provides an additional degree of freedom in optical signal processing,\nand showcase this with simultaneous mid-IR image encoding in two fundamental\nquantities, transmission and circular dichroism. Our proposed concept\nrepresents a universal toolkit for on-demand design and control of chiral\nmetastructures that has potential for numerous applications in life sciences,\nquantum optics and more.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"p2jeMyHmzVKf0yZew_aThEl12WrVbFICVN-mdmDSo_o","pdfSize":"8977250"}
