However, most of the\nspectral response functions and spatial downsampling functions used to create\nthe simulated datasets are not entirely accurate, resulting in deviations in\nspatial and spectral features between the generated images for fusion and the\nreal images for fusion. This reduces the credibility of the fusion algorithm,\ncausing unfairness in the comparison between different algorithms and hindering\nthe development of the field of hyperspectral image fusion. Therefore, we\nrelease a real HSI/MSI/PAN image dataset to promote the development of the\nfield of hyperspectral image fusion. These three images are spatially\nregistered, meaning fusion can be performed between HSI and MSI, HSI and PAN\nimage, MSI and PAN image, as well as among HSI, MSI, and PAN image.
