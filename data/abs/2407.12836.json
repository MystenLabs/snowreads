While memes are a\npopular and straightforward form of expression, they can also be used to spread\nmisinformation and hate due to their anonymity and ease of use. In response to\nthese challenges, this paper introduces a solution developed by team 'Baseline'\nfor the AI Singapore Online Safety Prize Challenge. Focusing on computational\nefficiency and feature engineering, the solution achieved an AUROC of 0.76 and\nan accuracy of 0.69 on the test dataset. As key features, the solution\nleverages the inherent probabilistic capabilities of large Vision-Language\nModels (VLMs) to generate task-adapted feature encodings from text, and applies\na distilled quantization tailored to the specific cultural nuances present in\nSingapore. This type of processing and fine-tuning can be adapted to various\nvisual and textual understanding and classification tasks, and even applied on\nprivate VLMs such as OpenAI's GPT. Finally it can eliminate the need for\nextensive model training on large GPUs for resource constrained applications,\nalso offering a solution when little or no data is available.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WuWH7dJOgtkhBvI6PFRtDHM0adlPnAKoKdm0Xl7y1WE","pdfSize":"610968"}
