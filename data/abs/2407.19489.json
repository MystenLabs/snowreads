By calculating the squared width of the wavepackets, our findings\ndemonstrate the emergence of various anomalous transport phenomenons when the\nsystem remains unchanged within the heavy-tailed regime, including\nsuperdiffusive, subdiffusive, and standard diffusive motion. Only subdiffusion\noccurs when the system has evolved during the waiting process. All these\ntransport behaviors are accompanied by a breakdown of ergodicity, highlighting\nthe complex dynamics induced by the stochastic driving mechanism.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dzMKUGE8tz8JpcHrkWPu5bR7NVYXRdna8Z3ejraK5-w","pdfSize":"1050206"}
