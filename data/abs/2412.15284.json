It has been shown that taking advantage of\npre-known information the calculations can proceed in an orderly and\nwell-planned manner. Furthermore, in the case of the sR1 calculation, computer\ntime can also be greatly reduced. Because the pR1 calculation is more\ntime-consuming than the sR1 calculation, when there is a choice between the pR1\nand the sR1, the former should be avoided. So, the usual strategy of assembling\na light-atom-only structure should start with the normal sR1 method to\ndetermine a basic framework of the structure, and then uses the\nconnectivity-guided sR1 method to complete the model. However, when the data\nresolution is low, the first step is necessary to use the pR1 method to\nassemble the known fragments. For a heavy-atom-containing structure, the\ncorrect strategy starts with the normal sR1 method to determine the heavy-atom\nsubstructure, and then uses the connectivity-guided sR1 to complete the model.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wgK33x73QFavH04oBGkIQDTQ5bIJvOlbj_VOl4oahGA","pdfSize":"1548483"}
