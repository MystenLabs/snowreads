The cross\nsection $\\sigma(E_e)$ is found to be of the order of $10^{-39}$~cm$^{2}$ for\nthe electron/positron energies in the few GeV range. The availability of\nelectron/positron beams having well defined energy and direction with very high\nluminosity of the order of $10^{38}-10^{39}$~cm$^{-2}$~sec$^{-1}$, makes it\npossible to observe the weak charged current production of $\\Delta(1232)$ and\ndetermine the axial vector form factors $C_{i}^{A} (Q^2);~(i=3-5)$. The\nsensitivity of the differential cross section $\\frac{d\\sigma}{dQ^2}$ to the\nsubdominant form factors $C_{3}^{A}(Q^2)$ and $C_{4}^{A} (Q^2)$ is found to be\nstrong enough, especially in the low $Q^2$ region, which can be used to\ndetermine them phenomenologically and to test the various theoretical models\nproposed to calculate them.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2F0PLoKGKrebMDAOOcs5AIVNYShOI33DfJCNWcEuLo8","pdfSize":"808859"}
