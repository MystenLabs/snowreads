In\nthe absence of decoherence the system exhibits both bound states in the\ncontinuum and Fano resonances. We found that the Fano resonances in\ntransmittance are robust against decoherence, at the same time decoherence\nprevents collapse of resonances induced by bound states in the continuum.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"m3YeyoQEeYrRFr1XGIUGbD-CeigpJfqLYP6_88lN9s8","pdfSize":"2882956"}
