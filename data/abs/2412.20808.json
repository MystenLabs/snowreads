The accurate knowledge of its collisional properties allows a better\ninterpretation of the corresponding observations in interstellar clouds and\ntherefore a better estimation of its abundance in these environments. While the\nro-vibrational spectroscopy of H$_2$Cl$^+$ is well known, the studies of its\ncollisional excitation are rather limited and these are available for the\ninteraction with helium atoms only. We provide a new 5-dimensional rigid-rotor\npotential energy surface for the interaction of H$_2$Cl$^+$ with H$_2$,\ncalculated from explicitly correlated coupled cluster ab initio theory, which\nwas fitted then with a set of analytical functions, allowing to perform\nscattering calculations using accurate quantum theories. We analyze the\ncollision-energy-dependence of the rotational state-to-state cross sections and\nthe temperature dependence of the corresponding thermal rate coefficients, with\na particular attention on the collisional propensity rules. When comparing our\nresults for collisions with H$_2$ with those obtained with He as a colliding\npartner, we found very significant differences with non-linear scaling trends,\nwhich proves again that He is not a suitable proxy for collisions between\nhydride molecules and molecular hydrogen, the most abundant gas particle in the\ninterstellar medium.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"rF1yEwxtENNmVc2zTNVa50ck3QTpdJ1dvg8SZXWHfPo","pdfSize":"1615871"}
