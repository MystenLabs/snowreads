Due to their intrinsic physical\nmechanisms, PALs hold promising potential for spatial audio applications such\nas virtual reality (VR). However, the feasibility of using an array of PALs for\nsound zone control (SZC) has remained unexplored, mainly due to the complexity\nof the nonlinear demodulation process inherent in PALs. Leveraging recent\nadvancements in PAL modeling, this work proposes an optimization algorithm to\nachieve the acoustic contrast control (ACC) between two target areas using a\nPAL array. The performance and robustness of the proposed ACC-based SZC using\nPAL arrays are investigated through simulations, and the results are compared\nwith those obtained using EDL arrays. The results show that the PAL array\noutperforms the EDL array in SZC performance and robustness at higher\nfrequencies and lower signal-to-noise ratio, while being comparable under other\nconditions. This work paves the way for high-contrast acoustic control using\nPAL arrays.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PpJykrTI64q-aqZlyV5XirJDJv4gt8_GGZLce2DUEUA","pdfSize":"2921001"}
