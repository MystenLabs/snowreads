When $V$ and $B$ are smooth, we show that, for $B\n\\sim_{\\mathbb{Q}} 2L$, the K-semistability and K-polystability of the blow-up\nis equivalent to the K-semistability and K-polystability of the log Fano pair\n$(V,aB)$ for some coefficient $a$ explicitly computed. We also show that, for\n$B \\sim_{\\mathbb{Q}} l L$, $l \\neq 2$, the blow-up is K-unstable.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yck0bJqph1gfAjaki7Blz_9j3QmeAqkzakU6ZqCl3Gk","pdfSize":"342388"}
