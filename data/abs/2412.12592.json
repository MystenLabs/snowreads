We\ninvestigate the production of true para-muonium in the radiative decay of\n$J/\\psi$ meson,and analyze the prospects for detecting true muonium in current\nand future high-energy $e^+e^-$ experiments, particularly focusing on the\nBESIII experiment and the proposed Super Tau-Charm Facility. Although the\nevents are rare at the super tau-charm facility, the detection of true\npara-muonium via $J/\\psi$ radiative decays could become feasible at its future\nupdates.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lCXQukaazN-gMwDDIrsFPgTVRbREBEtW6BvKEjYXzjs","pdfSize":"185025"}
