This design is\nespecially suited for the turbulent, dynamic, non-uniform flow conditions found\nclose to the ground, and has enabled applications from entomology to flight on\nMars. However, due to the high dimensionality of fan-array actuation and the\ncomplexity of unsteady fluid flow, the physics of fan arrays are not fully\ncharacterized, making it difficult to prescribe arbitrary flow fields.\nAccessing the full capability of fan arrays requires resolving the map from\ntime-varying grids of fan speeds to three-dimensional unsteady flow fields,\nwhich remains an open problem. This map is unfeasible to span in a single\nstudy, but it can be partitioned and studied in subsets. In this paper, we\nstudy the special case of constant fan-speeds and time-averaged streamwise\nvelocities with one homogeneous spanwise axis. We produce a proof-of-concept\nsurrogate model by fitting a regularized linear map to a dataset of fan-array\nmeasurements. We use this model as the basis for an open-loop control scheme to\ndesign flow profiles subject to constraints on fan speeds. In experimental\nvalidation, our model scored a mean prediction error of 1.02 m/s and our\ncontrol scheme a mean tracking error of 1.05 m/s in a fan array with velocities\nup to 12 m/s. We empirically conclude that the physics relating constant fan\nspeeds to time-averaged streamwise velocities are dominated by linear dynamics,\nand present our method as a foundational step to fully resolve fan-array wind\ntunnel control.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vI9D6-jJ8CsoZa6udnQOSbr7bcYte03PyTDFdW3D6LE","pdfSize":"5724897"}
