  "abstract": "  This work introduces finite element methods for a class of elliptic fully\nnonlinear partial differential equations. They are based on a minimal residual\nprinciple that builds upon the Alexandrov--Bakelman--Pucci estimate. Under\nrather general structural assumptions on the operator, convergence of $C^1$\nconforming and discontinuous Galerkin methods is proven in the $L^\\infty$ norm.\nNumerical experiments on the performance of adaptive mesh refinement driven by\nlocal information of the residual in two and three space dimensions are\nprovided.\n",
