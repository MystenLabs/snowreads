We explore this property to compare Geometric\nScaling present at the ISR with the recently proposed scaling law at the LHC.\nWe argue that at the LHC, within present experimental uncertainties, there is\nfact a family of scaling laws.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eBrWfELMmCn-1tAGNDqMkoQkWVZS3xhfMmLakiEihAM","pdfSize":"361387","objectId":"0x5dd8ebee122cdbb7953940f97fd6e6edb8825aa5709f9f92805fc073ee484c14","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
