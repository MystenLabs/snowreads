  "abstract": "  This article introduces a methodology for inducing wavenumber bandgaps via\nalternating signs of Willis coupling. A non-reciprocal wave equation of\nWillis-type is considered, and the wave dispersion analyses are carried out via\nthe transfer matrix method. Further, reversing Willis-coupling signs is proven\nto yield reciprocal band structures with wavenumber bandgaps, and their width\nand limits are analytically quantified. Similarities between materials with\nreversed-sign Willis coupling and bi-layered phononic crystals are noted,\nfollowed by concluding remarks.\n",
