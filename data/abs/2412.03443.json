In this context, we\nexplore the critical role of shuttling operations within these systems,\nespecially their influence on the fidelity loss and elongated execution times.\nTo address these challenges, we have developed BOSS, an efficient blocking\nalgorithm tailored to enhance shuttling efficiency. This optimization not only\nbolsters the shuttling process but also elevates the overall efficacy of ion\ntrap devices. We experimented on multiple applications using two qubit gates up\nto 4000+ and qubits ranging from 64 to 78. Our method significantly reduces the\nnumber of shuttles on most applications, with a maximum reduction of 96.1%.\nAdditionally, our investigation includes simulations of realistic experimental\nparameters that incorporate sympathetic cooling, offering a higher fidelity and\na refined estimate of execution times that align more closely with practical\nscenarios.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computer Science/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"K6HgWF2FEsqjkunnhDRHkCXrWnSpKnAxRC48EhpvUdY","pdfSize":"1787102"}
