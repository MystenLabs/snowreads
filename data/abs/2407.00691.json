Teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR) is a\nspecial case from this class of theories, and its dynamics is governed by\nequations which are equivalent to Einstein field equations of general\nrelativity. In 2009 Lucas and Pereira presented the idea of a new operator that\nwould allow us to express the action of TEGR in a form reminiscent of the\nYang-Mills action for a gauge theory, for which torsion is the field strength.\nThe authors constructed the operator as a duality operator acting on torsion\n2-forms and curvature 2-forms, taking into account all the contractions of\nthese forms with the volume form of the spacetime manifold. The definition of\nthis operator for other forms, however, remained unclear. In this thesis, we\nseek to give a mathematically consistent definition of the operator, and we\nfollow the results published by Lucas and Pereira. We show that the approach\ntaken by Lucas and Pereira does not lead to a consistent definition of this\noperator, because it results in the operator with the desired properties either\nbeing non-unique or non-existent.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rUDDZUEuNt-xFdQ04yNj0APb6EMQ8vkq4Rn2hV8U55U","pdfSize":"760794"}
