Simulation models that\ncan capture simultaneous heat and mass transfer phenomena associated with\nfrost/defrost behaviors and their impact on the overall heat pump system\nperformance are of critical importance to improved controls of heat delivery\nand frost mitigation. This paper presents a novel frost formulation using an\nenthalpy method to systematically capture all phase-change behaviors including\nfrost formation and melting, retained water refreezing and melting, and water\ndrainage during cyclic frosting and defrosting operations. A Fuzzy modeling\napproach is proposed to smoothly switch source terms when evaluating the\ndynamics of frost and water mediums for numerical robustness. The proposed\nfrost/defrost model is incorporated into a flat-tube outdoor heat exchanger\nmodel of an automotive heat pump system model to investigate system responses\nunder cyclic operations of frosting and reverse-cycle defrosting.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computer Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kiWdtdAfkiysg_so39gKE6msGG-8q05JKLtdkMKfNfk","pdfSize":"1537559"}
