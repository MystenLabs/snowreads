The THz source is based on\noptical rectification of near infra-red laser pulses at a central wavelength of\n1036 nm from a commercial, high-power Yb-based laser system and reaches a high\nTHz average power of 11 mW at a repetition rate of 100 kHz and a broad and\nsmooth bandwidth of more than 9 THz. The conversion efficiency is high (0.13%)\nin spite of the high excitation average power of 8 W. We validate the high\ndynamic range and reliability of the source for applications in linear\nspectroscopy by measuring the broadband THz properties of chi(2) nonlinear\ncrystals up to 8 THz. This new high-repetition rate source is very promising\nfor ultra-broadband THz spectroscopy at high dynamic range and/or reduced\nmeasurement times.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zx-RR681jp1RRUy1wOYiPd6bvta0jLvz2mBzVLEd34E","pdfSize":"931910"}
