It has the disadvantage, however,\nthat it requires knowledge of an appropriate scaling factor {\\tau}n and that\nthe coverage probability for finite n depends on the choice of m. This article\npresents an R package moonboot which implements the computation of m-out-of-n\nbootstrap confidence intervals and provides functions for estimating the\nparameters {\\tau}n and m. By means of Monte Carlo simulations, we evaluate the\ndifferent methods and compare them for different estimators\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yKvkRKDM_klLCTqb5y3rOhJUM-xBsqMpzlizEQEqDaA","pdfSize":"426299"}
