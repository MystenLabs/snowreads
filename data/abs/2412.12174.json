Such Ulrich bundles\narise as deformations of ``iterative\" extensions by means of \"sporadic\" Ulrich\nline bundles. We moreover explicitely describe irreducible components of the\ncorresponding \"sporadic\" moduli spaces of rank $r \\geqslant 1$ vector bundles\nwhich are Ulrich with respect to the tautological polarization on $X$. In some\ncases such irreducible components turn out to be a singleton, in some other\ncases such components are generically smooth, whose positive dimension has been\ncomputed and whose general point turns out to be a slope-stable vector bundle.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NaDccIOITi3l0H3_3e6U0oDc_At6VoaYeox_Itc_VQI","pdfSize":"384842"}
