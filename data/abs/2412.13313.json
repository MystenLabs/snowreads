We give an elementary\naccount of $p$-adic methods in de Rham cohomology of algebraic hypersurfaces\nwith explicit examples and applications in number theory and combinatorics.\nThese lectures are based on the series of our joint papers with Frits Beukers\nentitled \\emph{Dwork crystals} (\\cite{DCI,DCII,DCIII}). These methods also have\napplications in mathematical physics and arithmetic geometry\n(\\cite{IN,Cartier0}), which we overview here towards the end. I am grateful to\nthe organisers of both schools and to the participants of my courses whose\nquestions stimulated writing these notes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GWSEwn3K3sJAf-kr0U6tfN0dzuyR_rHoJ5kzNE3rv_k","pdfSize":"813777"}
