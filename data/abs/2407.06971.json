Despite its recent experimental validation,\ncritical questions remain regarding the physical limitations of the concept. In\nparticular, it is not known whether the ultra-low friction state would persist\nat high sliding speeds relevant for practical, small-scale mechanical systems.\nHere, we perform sliding experiments via atomic force microscopy on gold\nnanoislands on graphite at increasing speeds, extracting interfacial friction\nforces under ambient conditions. A heterodyne detection methodology enables the\nextraction of extremely weak friction signals buried deep in the noise,\nrevealing that the structurally superlubric regime extends over 100,000 nm/s\nwith minimal changes in friction force, spanning three orders of magnitude in\nsliding speed. Our results contribute significantly to the pursuit of\nfunctional, superlubric mechanical devices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nOMakJ364d-Z0w2d1HbymOPQazwuPf_P4aUxSAbTBAE","pdfSize":"4419863"}
