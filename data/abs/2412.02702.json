Since the parameterized swimming motion is copied from observed\nlarvae, it is not necessarily the most efficient locomotion for the model of\nthe swimmer. In this project, we further optimize this copied solution for the\nswimmer model. We utilize Reinforcement Learning to guide local parameter\nupdates. Since the majority of the computation cost arises from the CFD model,\nwe additionally train a deep learning model to replicate the forces acting on\nthe swimmer model. We find that this method is effective at performing local\nsearch to improve the parameterized swimming locomotion.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LM_rIPCIlsrdhswWT-XcBVHbNZPbmZsZqDCyDVTFZto","pdfSize":"496535"}
