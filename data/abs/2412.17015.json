However, there is still no standard benchmark that\nincludes large-scale datasets and supports comprehensive evaluation\nenvironments. In this paper, we introduce RCAEval, an open-source benchmark\nthat provides datasets and an evaluation environment for RCA in microservice\nsystems. First, we introduce three comprehensive datasets comprising 735\nfailure cases collected from three microservice systems, covering various fault\ntypes observed in real-world failures. Second, we present a comprehensive\nevaluation framework that includes fifteen reproducible baselines covering a\nwide range of RCA approaches, with the ability to evaluate both coarse-grained\nand fine-grained RCA. We hope that this ready-to-use benchmark will enable\nresearchers and practitioners to conduct extensive analysis and pave the way\nfor robust new solutions for RCA of microservice systems.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bYWKbIFLI2k_Fh5UwOnjAAmOF9_OAhZLRaJv68n2naI","pdfSize":"785720"}
