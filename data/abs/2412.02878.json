The framework enables us to define and identify\nfeatures that directly cause the predictions, which has broad implications for\ndata collection and model evaluation. We show two assumptions under which the\ndirect causes can be discovered from data, one of which further simplifies the\ndiscovery process. In addition to providing sound and complete algorithms, we\npropose an optimization technique based on an independence rule that can be\nintegrated with the algorithms to speed up the discovery process both\ntheoretically and empirically.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wcPqgS9LbMK7hcn2pCdfjbV9Hq-EsPK0zzUhb4bUSD4","pdfSize":"425256"}
