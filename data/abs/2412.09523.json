However, this theory\nhas only been studied in the univariate case. We give a generalization of\nMultiple Orthogonal Polynomials for two variables. Moreover, an extended\nversion of some of the main properties are given. Additionally, some examples\nare given along the paper.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"jfkSl99_KbxEZIJIAqsu80fPYwfsPG8HbaZAWsUfLFM","pdfSize":"712291"}
