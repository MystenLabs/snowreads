In recent years, a variety of deep learning models based on\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers have been designed to\ntackle diverse problems in CV. These algorithms have found practical\napplications in areas such as robotics and facial recognition. Despite the\nincreasing power of current CV models, several fundamental questions remain\nunresolved: Why do CNNs require deep layers? What ensures the generalization\nability of CNNs? Why do residual-based networks outperform fully convolutional\nnetworks like VGG? What is the fundamental difference between residual-based\nCNNs and Transformer-based networks? Why can CNNs utilize LoRA and pruning\ntechniques? The root cause of these questions lies in the lack of a robust\ntheoretical foundation for deep learning models in CV. To address these\ncritical issues and techniques, we employ the Universal Approximation Theorem\n(UAT) to provide a theoretical basis for convolution- and Transformer-based\nmodels in CV. By doing so, we aim to elucidate these questions from a\ntheoretical perspective.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"L9gnw1hWDOaIpvPhynM_ePN0dMhch7wZPPv8erOF6Ms","pdfSize":"2063906"}
