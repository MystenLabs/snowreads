We\ncharacterize their smallest eigenvalues and prove that, in the case of\nEuclidean domains, their spectra on forms coincide with the spectra of the\ncorresponding problems. We obtain various estimates involving the first\neigenvalues of the mentioned problems and the ones of the Hodge Laplacian with\nrespect to Dirichlet and absolute boundary conditions on forms. These estimates\ngeneralize previous ones in the case of functions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NcIlIRYK1sOlwDkBU3zqnwCF3KOltV7aCq_2Wkmrf8k","pdfSize":"261368"}
