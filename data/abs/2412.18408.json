Ensuring the safety\nof CPS is of great importance, requiring extensive testing across diverse and\ncomplex scenarios. To generate as many testing scenarios as possible, previous\nefforts have focused on describing scenarios using formal languages to generate\nscenes. In this paper, we introduce an alternative approach: reconstructing\nscenes inside the open-source game engine, Godot. We have developed a pipeline\nthat enables the reconstruction of testing scenes directly from provided images\nof scenarios. These reconstructed scenes can then be deployed within simulated\nenvironments to assess a CPS. This approach offers a scalable and flexible\nsolution for testing CPS in realistic environments.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"sLXaZ28WfbfZZX3RNuAy7BhT_z-6OqaZECc2JYrGgNI","pdfSize":"5131860"}
