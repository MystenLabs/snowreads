We report\nspectroscopic confirmation of eight groups at $1.65\\leq z\\leq3.61$ in COSMOS.\nHomogeneously selected as significant overdensities of red IRAC sources with\nred Herschel colors, four groups are confirmed by CO and [CI] with NOEMA 3mm\nobservations, three are confirmed with ALMA, and one is confirmed by H$\\alpha$\nfrom Subaru/FMOS. We constructed the integrated FIR SEDs for the eight groups,\nobtaining total IR SFR $=260-1300~{\\rm M_\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$. We adopted six\nmethods to estimate the dark matter masses, including stellar mass to halo mass\nrelations, overdensity with galaxy bias, and NFW profile fitting to radial\nstellar mass density. We found the radial stellar mass density are consistent\nwith a NFW profile, supporting that they are collapsed structures hosted by a\nsingle dark matter halo. The best halo mass estimates are $\\log(M_{\\rm h}/{\\rm\nM_\\odot})=12.8-13.7$ with uncertainty of 0.3 dex. From halo mass estimates, we\nderive baryonic accretion rate ${\\rm BAR}=(1-8)\\times10^{3}\\,{\\rm\nM_{\\odot}/yr}$ for this sample. We find a quasi-linear correlation between the\nintegrated SFR/BAR and the theoretical halo mass limit for cold streams,\n$M_{\\rm stream}/M_{\\rm h}$, with ${\\rm SFR/BAR}=10^{-0.46\\pm0.22}\\left({M_{\\rm\nstream}/M_{\\rm h}}\\right)^{0.71\\pm0.16}$ with a scatter of $0.40\\,{\\rm dex}$.\nFurther, we compare halo masses and stellar masses with simulations, and find\nall structures are consistent with being progenitors of $M_{\\rm\nh}(z=0)>10^{14}\\,{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ galaxy clusters, and the most massive central\ngalaxies have stellar masses consistent with brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs)\nprogenitors in the TNG300 simulation. The results strongly suggest these\nstructures are forming massive galaxy clusters via baryonic and dark matter\naccretion.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sfFajGtCtRaxETjybjpdfLjTRsujiUKZ__3XZkF_rgw","pdfSize":"28857257"}
