It integrates model selection and fitting features and employs\nmachine intelligence to suggest a model to describe a given dataset. The\npackage fits the suggested model or one chosen by the user. An advantage of\nusing pyRheo is that it addresses challenges associated with sensitivity to\ninitial guesses in parameter optimization. It allows the user to iteratively\nsearch for the best initial guesses, avoiding convergence to local minima. We\ndiscuss the capabilities of pyRheo and compare them to other tools for\nrheological modeling of biological matter. We demonstrate that pyRheo\nsignificantly reduces the computation time required to fit high-performance\nviscoelastic models.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"N_-BtVZ3FOAsKKJaFl-bWAr3qbH57DeEtwZ-N-5qXBM","pdfSize":"3393478"}
