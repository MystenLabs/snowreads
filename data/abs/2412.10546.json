  "abstract": "  The emerging discipline of Computational Science is concerned with using\ncomputers to simulate or solve scientific problems. These problems span the\nnatural, political, and social sciences. The discipline has exploded over the\npast decade due to the emergence of larger amounts of observational data and\nlarge-scale simulations that were previously unavailable or unfeasible.\nHowever, there are still significant challenges with managing the large amounts\nof data and simulations.\n  The database management systems community has always been at the forefront of\nthe development of the theory and practice of techniques for formalizing and\nactualizing systems that access or query large datasets. In this paper, we\npresent EmpireDB, a vision for a data management system to accelerate\ncomputational sciences. In addition, we identify challenges and opportunities\nfor the database community to further the fledgling field of computational\nsciences. Finally, we present preliminary evidence showing that the optimized\ncomponents in EmpireDB could lead to improvements in performance compared to\ncontemporary implementations.\n",
