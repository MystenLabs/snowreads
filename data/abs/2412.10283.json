  "abstract": "  Middleware, third-party software intermediaries between users and platforms,\nhas been broached as a means to decentralize the power of social media\nplatforms and enhance user agency. Middleware may enable a more user-centric\nand democratic approach to shaping digital experiences, offering a flexible\narchitecture as an alternative to both centrally controlled, opaque platforms\nand an unmoderated, uncurated internet. The widespread adoption of open\nmiddleware has long hinged on the cooperation of established major platforms;\nhowever, the recent growth of federated platforms, such as Mastodon and\nBluesky, has led to increased offerings and user awareness. In this report we\nconsider the potential of middleware as a means of enabling greater user\ncontrol over curation and moderation - two aspects of the social media\nexperience that are often mired in controversy. We evaluate the trade-offs and\nnegative externalities it might create, and discuss the technological,\nregulatory, and market dynamics that could either support or hinder its\nimplementation.\n",
