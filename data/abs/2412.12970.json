  "abstract": "  Graph burning models the spread of information or contagion in a graph. At\neach time step, two events occur: neighbours of already burned vertices become\nburned, and a new vertex is chosen to be burned. The big conjecture is known as\nthe {\\it burning number conjecture}: for any connected graph on $n$ vertices,\nall $n$ vertices can be burned after at most $\\lceil \\sqrt{n}\\ \\rceil$ time\nsteps. It is well-known that to prove the conjecture, it suffices to prove it\nfor trees. We prove the conjecture for sufficiently large $p$-caterpillars.\n",
