The\nresults related to the weak convergence of these quantile processes are applied\nto find asymptotic distributions of the smooth $L$-estimators and the\nestimators of smooth functions of finite population quantiles. Based on these\nasymptotic distributions, confidence intervals are constructed for several\nfinite population parameters like the median, the $\\alpha$-trimmed means, the\ninterquartile range and the quantile based measure of skewness. Comparisons of\nvarious estimators are carried out based on their asymptotic distributions. We\nshow that the use of the auxiliary information in the construction of the\nestimators sometimes has an adverse effect on the performances of the smooth\n$L$-estimators and the estimators of smooth functions of finite population\nquantiles under several sampling designs. Further, the performance of each of\nthe above-mentioned estimators sometimes becomes worse under sampling designs,\nwhich use the auxiliary information, than their performances under simple\nrandom sampling without replacement (SRSWOR).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1QOo7Ks6AHuM2Hs9eAH0zHtRH7u1W-szyhDjKTui1DQ","pdfSize":"815971"}
