Their\nability to synthesize new viewpoints with photo-realistic quality, as well as\ncapture complex volumetric and specular scenes, makes them an ideal\nvisualization for robotic teleoperation setups. Direct camera teleoperation\nprovides high-fidelity operation at the cost of maneuverability, while\nreconstruction-based approaches offer controllable scenes with lower fidelity.\nWith this in mind, we propose replacing the traditional\nreconstruction-visualization components of the robotic teleoperation pipeline\nwith online Radiance Fields, offering highly maneuverable scenes with\nphotorealistic quality. As such, there are three main contributions to state of\nthe art: (1) online training of Radiance Fields using live data from multiple\ncameras, (2) support for a variety of radiance methods including NeRF and 3DGS,\n(3) visualization suite for these methods including a virtual reality scene. To\nenable seamless integration with existing setups, these components were tested\nwith multiple robots in multiple configurations and were displayed using\ntraditional tools as well as the VR headset. The results across methods and\nrobots were compared quantitatively to a baseline of mesh reconstruction, and a\nuser study was conducted to compare the different visualization methods.
