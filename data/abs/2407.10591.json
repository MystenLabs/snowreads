With the appropriate transformation of the anchor, we\nshow that all Courant algebroid relations are a priori satisfied. We analyze a\ncouple of Courant algebroids relevant for string theory and their respective\nDirac structures, obtaining constraints they impose on fluxes. In the end, we\nshow that the Courant algebroid that is simultaneously twisted by both $B$ and\n$\\theta$ is characterized by Dirac structures with no restrictions imposed on\nfluxes.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"f0nYyMbrq8-gPeieDGHZplgEu0aKm0drUtTtlSQsnsk","pdfSize":"315936"}
