It states that for a compact d dimensional\nmanifold M (without boundary), the eigenvalue counting function has an\nasymptotic growth, whose leading term is of the order of d and the error term\nis no worse than order d-1.\n  A natural question is: when is the error term sharp and when can it be\nimproved? It has been known for a long time that the error term is sharp for\nthe round sphere (since 1968). In contrast, it has only recently been shown (in\n2019) by Iosevich and Wyman that for the product of spheres, the error term can\nbe polynomially improved. They conjecture that a polynomial improvement should\nbe true for products in general. In this paper we extend both these results to\nCompact Rank One Symmetric Spaces (CROSSes). We show that for CROSSes, the\nerror term is sharp. Furthermore, we show that for a product of CROSSes, the\nerror term can be polynomially improved. This gives further evidence to the\nconjecture made by Iosevich and Wyman.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5RWLRuEpiLYigQT_Co124Ckz_9o11p-PmqJl8BFySR0","pdfSize":"222923"}
