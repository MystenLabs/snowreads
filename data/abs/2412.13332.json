The\nframework is based on collision quantum optics, where a localized quantum\nsystem interacts sequentially with individual time-bin modes. This approach\nprovides a physically intuitive model that allows researchers familiar with\ntools such as QuTiP in Python, Quantum Optics Toolbox for Matlab, or\nQuantumOptics.jl in Julia to efficiently set up and execute WQED simulations.\nDespite its conceptual simplicity, we demonstrate the framework's robust\nability to handle complex WQED scenarios. These applications include the\nscattering of single- or two-photon pulses by quantum emitters or cavities, as\nwell as the exploration of non-Markovian dynamics, where emitted photons are\nreflected back, thereby introducing feedback mechanisms.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jxf0pXoO1mZbvZWxUaZzyxUJaJpJcHf-YE30mdsKRAw","pdfSize":"2034221"}
