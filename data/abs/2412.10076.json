  "abstract": "  Angular momentum and torque are important principles for basic and applied\nphysics on any spatial scales, for example, in elementary particles, cold\ngases, optical tweezers, quantum information technology, metamaterials,\ngyroscopes or astrophysical entities. Investigating or controlling angular\nmomentum in atoms or sub-atomic structures requires torque on femtosecond and\npicometer scales, far below the capabilities of laser light. Here we shape the\nelectrons in an electron microscope into wave packets with a time-dependent\nchirality and internal torque. We intersect the electron beam with chiral laser\nlight to create discrete energy sidebands by multiple helical photon\nabsorptions that create a correlation between orbital angular momentum and\nkinetic energy. Dispersion of these partial waves due to the electron rest mass\nthen converts each single electron into a wave function with internal torque.\nUnder our control, a left-handed matter wave becomes right-handed in\nfemtosecond times. Such quantum objects will facilitate research on angular\nmomentum and chirality on atomic and sub-atomic scales.\n",
