The dry phantom\nis supposed to represent an equivalent current dipole (ECD) generated by brain\nactivity, emulating an encephalomagnetic field. The spatial resolution of the\nmagnetometer is evaluated to be sufficiently higher than the length of the\nvariation in the encephalomagnetic field distribution. The minimum detectable\nECD moment is evaluated to be 0.2 nA m by averaging about 8000 measurements for\na standoff distance of 2.4 mm from the ECD. We also discuss the feasibility of\ndetecting an ECD in the measurement of an encephalomagnetic field in humans. We\nconclude that it is feasible to detect an encephalomagnetic field from a\nshallow cortex area such as the primary somatosensory cortex.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"TBQanp_Osv2MWFh0AxDEBu7xUby54lpd5AnA6mzA6Ps","pdfSize":"869717"}
