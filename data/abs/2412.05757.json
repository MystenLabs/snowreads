The thermodynamic consistency of\nthis system, as well as its modeling background and physical motivation, has\nbeen established in [3,5,7]. Using a Galerkin approximation scheme, we prove\nthe existence of global weak solutions in both two and three dimensions\n$(d=2,3)$. A crucial element in extending the existence of approximate\nsolutions from local to global lies in the application of Bihari's inequality\nand a fixed-point argument.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HE1UsasBnK3mHrz_EVg5KVG10VLsOHrXYn8qGDMnf4g","pdfSize":"272748"}
