The sequence $S$ is called a preorder sequence.\n  For Splay trees (candidate for dynamic optimality conjecture), the preorder\ntraversal holds only when the initial tree is empty (Levy and Tarjan, WADS\n2019). The preorder traversal conjecture for GREEDY (candidate for dynamic\noptimality conjecture) was known to be $n2^{\\alpha(n)^{O(1)}}$ (Chalermsook et\nal., FOCS 2015), which was recently improved to $O(n2^{\\alpha(n)})$\n(Chalermsook et al., SODA 2023), here $\\alpha(n)$ is the inverse Ackermann\nfunction of $n$. For a special case when the initial tree is flat, GREEDY is\nknown to satisfy the traversal conjecture, i.e., $O(n)$ (Chalermsook et al.,\nFOCS 2015).\n  In this paper, we show that for every preorder sequence $S$, there exists an\ninitial tree called the preorder initial tree for which GREEDY satisfies the\npreorder traversal conjecture.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"b1LjTG2rbeNcDj2piC2M8SRfRTUgd4oTijdPHzkNvqY","pdfSize":"150010"}
