The device can be\nprogrammed owing to controlled growth of nanowires, a method developed in our\nlaboratory. The response (output signal) of the network depends on the\nactivated input line, but also on the amplitude of the input signals. The\nsystem is able to analyze multiple input signals in parallel and in real time.\nThis is still considered as a challenge.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eEwaQQGnpmfKx3ukd8JAIePFyjJo4E8CTnDGEAUhp88","pdfSize":"353985"}
