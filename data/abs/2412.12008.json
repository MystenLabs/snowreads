So, a general perspective is provided\nfor two and three-dimensional imaging studies on digital curves and digital\nsurfaces. Throughout the study, the features present in topological manifolds\nbut that are not satisfied in the discrete version are specifically underlined.\nIn addition, other concepts closely related to manifolds such as submanifold,\norientation, and partition of unity are also discussed in digital images.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"yIvfsgbz8f9l5WUHbBuVP2vTIjAbbIGywPK8gOmiEsc","pdfSize":"507881"}
