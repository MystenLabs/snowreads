The\nmultiple-scattering method is used to calculate the reaction amplitude. Four\nreaction mechanisms are taken into account: one-nucleon-exchange,\nsingle-scattering, and double-scattering with a nucleon and a delta-isobar in\nthe intermediate state. The method allows calculating both unpolarized\ndifferential cross section and any polarization observables.\n  All the results obtained are compared to the experimental data.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"QEoNU0BGR5xFDUZJMBAU1Dcs8Ure_xcByoHIOyEewW8","pdfSize":"238791","objectId":"0x09af9994cff7b9832fa1776a55323c924f0dfab569a82c9e3549145ac76d7055","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
