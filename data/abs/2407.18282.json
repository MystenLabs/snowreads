Here we demonstrate that\nfirst-order DPTs can occur even in the large deviations of a single Brownian\nparticle without drift, but only when the system's dimensionality exceeds four.\nThese DPTs are accompanied by temporal phase separations in the trajectories\nand exhibit dimension-dependent order due to the threshold behavior for bound\nstate formation in Schr\\\"{o}dinger operators. We also discover second-order\nDPTs in one-dimensional Brownian motion, characterized by universal exponents\nin the rate function of dynamical observables. Our results establish a novel\nframework linking classical DPTs to quantum phase transitions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4gLlSvTHVSDq0clvB1B3eZslZ1mERc17Kr2LyqmDNm0","pdfSize":"912369","objectId":"0x616062bbf9ca9f153f16b9432aca917445ce9a0bcc6ffd79e4d28ede9b083192","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
