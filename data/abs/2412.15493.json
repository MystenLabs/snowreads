  "abstract": "  Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) occurs when a many-body system governed\nby a symmetric Hamiltonian, and prepared in a symmetry-broken state by the\napplication of a field coupling to its order parameter $O$, retains a finite\n$O$ value even after the field is switched off. SSB is generally thought to\noccur only in the thermodynamic limit $N\\to \\infty$ (for $N$ degrees of\nfreedom). In this limit, the time to restore the symmetry once the field is\nturned off, either via thermal or quantum fluctuations, is expected to diverge.\nHere we show that SSB can also be observed in \\emph{finite-size} quantum spin\nsystems, provided that three conditions are met: 1) the ground state of the\nsystem has long-range correlations; 2) the Hamiltonian conserves the (spin)\nparity of the order parameter; and 3) $N$ is odd. Using a combination of\nanalytical arguments and numerical results (based on time-dependent variational\nMonte Carlo and rotor+spin-wave theory), we show that SSB on finite-size\nsystems can be achieved via a quasi-adiabatic preparation of the ground state\n-- which, in U(1)-symmetric systems, is shown to require a symmetry breaking\nfield vanishing over time scales $\\tau \\sim O(N)$. In these systems, the\nsymmetry-broken state exhibits spin squeezing with Heisenberg scaling.\n",
