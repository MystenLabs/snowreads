We propose a multi-layer knowledge pyramid approach within the RAG\nframework to achieve a better balance between precision and recall. The\nknowledge pyramid consists of three layers: Ontologies, Knowledge Graphs (KGs),\nand chunk-based raw text. We employ cross-layer augmentation techniques for\ncomprehensive knowledge coverage and dynamic updates of the Ontology schema and\ninstances. To ensure compactness, we utilize cross-layer filtering methods for\nknowledge condensation in KGs. Our approach, named PolyRAG, follows a waterfall\nmodel for retrieval, starting from the top of the pyramid and progressing down\nuntil a confident answer is obtained. We introduce two benchmarks for\ndomain-specific knowledge retrieval, one in the academic domain and the other\nin the financial domain. The effectiveness of the methods has been validated\nthrough comprehensive experiments by outperforming 19 SOTA methods. An\nencouraging observation is that the proposed method has augmented the GPT-4,\nproviding 395\\% F1 gain by improving its performance from 0.1636 to 0.8109.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nqP67D-x8EjSNfnExebbhokbx7D9qYx08gpLn1nFgqY","pdfSize":"37868342"}
