We investigate\nthis problem to the extent that it has not yet been fully resolved and\ndemonstrate exact novel results. They mainly concern the mean first-passage\ntime for a particle diffusing downward and upward the harmonic potential. We\nverify the obtained results using a number of analytical techniques.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"NJ30HU1TnR9FAqQBXXIvXO2ZId5nUhAdMHqviQMZ1gU","pdfSize":"280504"}
