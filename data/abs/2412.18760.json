Traditional\ntechniques, such as partitional and hierarchical clustering, are analyzed\nalongside advanced approaches such as data stream, density-based, graph-based,\nand model-based clustering for handling complex structured datasets. The paper\nhighlights key principles underpinning clustering, outlines widely used tools\nand frameworks, introduces the workflow of clustering in data science,\ndiscusses challenges in practical implementation, and examines various\napplications of clustering. By focusing on these foundations and applications,\nthe discussion underscores clustering's transformative potential. The paper\nconcludes with insights into future research directions, emphasizing\nclustering's role in driving innovation and enabling data-driven\ndecision-making.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FDqT6ZAhg2Bq7s7yMGJDkRpigwIRibzyr2WviKATQWA","pdfSize":"2511689"}
