In this paper, we reexamine a specific dynamical dark energy model,\nwhich is indistinguishable from the $\\Lambda$CDM model at present time and\nexhibits a special event in the future, within $F(Q)$ gravity. To constrain the\nfree parameters of the model, we perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nanalysis, using the last data from Pantheon$^{+}$ and the latest measurements\nof the H(z) parameter combined. On the basis of this analysis, we have find\nthat our dynamical dark energy model, in the context of F(Q) gravity, lies in\nthe quintessence regime rather than in the phantom regime as in the case of\ngeneral relativity. Furthermore, this behaviour affects the future expansion of\nthe Universe as it becomes decelerating at $1\\sigma$ confidence level for\n$z<-0.5$ and showing a bounce at $z_{\\text{B}}\\approx -0.835$. Finally, we have\nsupport our conclusion with a cosmographic analysis.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qid0Ym0v3AjslO_8w4v0HyVMBwAwRikAI8hPFcYJs_0","pdfSize":"1146401"}
