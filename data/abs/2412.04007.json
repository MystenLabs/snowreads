Utilizing a density-dependent relativistic mean-field model that\nincorporates hyperons and baryons for describing hadronic matter, and a\ndensity-dependent quark model for quark matter, we analyze the ten lowest\neigenfrequencies and their corresponding oscillation functions. Our focus lies\non neutron stars with equations-of-state involving N, N + $\\Delta$, N + H, and\nN + H + $\\Delta$, featuring a phase transition to quark matter. Emphasizing the\neffects of a slow phase transition at the hadron-quark interface, we observe\nthat the maximum mass is attained before the fundamental mode's frequency\ndecreases for slow phase transitions. This observation implies the stability of\nstellar configurations with higher central densities than the maximum mass,\ncalled Slow Stable Hybrid Stars (SSHSs), even under small radial perturbations.\nThe length of these SSHS branch depends upon the energy density jump between\ntwo phases and the stiffness of the quark EoS.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0hr8HhVLTfq-atNuTpuuDSMZ_KttY2sjHBW1hSeJVQM","pdfSize":"383109"}
