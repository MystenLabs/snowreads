  "abstract": "  We study controllability and observability concepts of tempered fractional\nlinear systems in the Caputo sense. First, we formulate a solution for the\nclass of tempered systems under investigation by means of the Laplace transform\nmethod. Then, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the\ncontrollability, as well as for the observability, in terms of the Gramian\ncontrollability matrix and the Gramian observability matrix, respectively.\nMoreover, we establish the Kalman criteria that allows one to check easily the\ncontrollability and the observability for tempered fractional systems.\nApplications to the fractional Chua's circuit and Chua--Hartley's oscillator\nmodels are provided to illustrate the theoretical results developed in this\nmanuscript.\n",
