  "abstract": "  Text classification with hierarchical labels is a prevalent and challenging\ntask in natural language processing. Examples include assigning ICD codes to\npatient records, tagging patents into IPC classes, assigning EUROVOC\ndescriptors to European legal texts, and more. Despite its widespread\napplications, a comprehensive understanding of state-of-the-art methods across\ndifferent domains has been lacking. In this paper, we provide the first\ncomprehensive cross-domain overview with empirical analysis of state-of-the-art\nmethods. We propose a unified framework that positions each method within a\ncommon structure to facilitate research. Our empirical analysis yields key\ninsights and guidelines, confirming the necessity of learning across different\nresearch areas to design effective methods. Notably, under our unified\nevaluation pipeline, we achieved new state-of-the-art results by applying\ntechniques beyond their original domains.\n",
