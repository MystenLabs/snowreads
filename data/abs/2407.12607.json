It is a modification of multivariate statistical process\ncontrol (MSPC) of which is designed for the process that variables operated on\nnormal operational condition which independence of time. However, in some\nprocesses, such as solar photovoltaic system, the process variables, i.e.,\ntemperature, voltage and current, are time-varying. Therefore, TMSPC has been\nproposed as monitoring and diagnosing tool for time-varying process.
