This cryogenic\nmicrowave source demonstrates significant scalability potential for large-scale\nqubit readout systems due to its compact design and low power consumption of\nonly 1 uW, making it suitable for integration on the 10 mK stage of a dilution\nrefrigerator. The tunnel diode oscillator exhibits superior amplitude stability\ncompared to commercial microwave sources. The output frequency is centered\naround 140 MHz, commonly used for qubit readout of electrons in semiconductors,\nwith a frequency tunability of 20 MHz achieved using a varactor diode.\nFurthermore, the phase noise was significantly improved by replacing the\ncommercially available voltage source with a lead-acid battery, achieving a\nmeasured phase noise of -115 dBc/Hz at a 1 MHz offset.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"u2ZJkuz0hvR3tPdepbSHfl384pOXJgkBIEGrhkbANEU","pdfSize":"2523185"}
