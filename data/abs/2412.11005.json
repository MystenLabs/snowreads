  "abstract": "  Rotation significantly influences the stability characteristics of both\nlaminar and turbulent shear flows. This study examines the stability threshold\nof the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with rotation, in the vicinity\nof the Couette flow at high Reynolds numbers ($\\mathbf{Re}$) in the periodical\ndomain $\\mathbb{T} \\times \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{T}$, where the rotational\nstrength is equivalent to the Couette flow. Compared to the classical\nNavier-Stokes equations, rotation term brings us more two primary difficulties:\nthe linear coupling term involving in the equation of $u^2$ and the lift-up\neffect in two directions. To address these difficulties, we introduce two new\ngood unknowns that effectively capture the phenomena of enhanced dissipation\nand inviscid damping to suppress the lift-up effect. Moreover, we establish the\nstability threshold for initial perturbation\n$\\left\\|u_{\\mathrm{in}}\\right\\|_{H^{\\sigma}} < \\delta \\mathbf{Re}^{-2}$ for any\n$\\sigma > \\frac{9}{2}$ and some $\\delta=\\delta(\\sigma)>0$ depending only on\n$\\sigma$.\n",
