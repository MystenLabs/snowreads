The\nobtained experimental flux-averaged cross-sections\n$\\langle{\\sigma(E_{\\rm{\\gamma max}})}\\rangle$ agree with the data found in\nliterature.

The experimental results for ${^{56,57}}$Co agree\nwith the cumulative $\\langle{\\sigma(E_{\\rm{\\gamma max}})}\\rangle_{\\rm{th}}$.\nHowever theoretical prediction fails to reproduce the measured cross-sections\nfor the production of ${^{55}}$Co.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"adNvbkqGdJo_Wh7yv-j2Vhc8aZzxSNhyfCq03sA4KQA","pdfSize":"11969178"}
