The measurement difference method\n(MDM) is generalized to time-varying dimensions of the measurement and control.\nThree MDM identification techniques that differ in weighting used in the\nunderlying least squares method are proposed. The techniques differ in estimate\nquality and computational complexity. In addition, recursive forms are designed\nfor two techniques. The performance of the proposed techniques is analyzed\nusing two numerical examples. The implementation of techniques is enclosed with\nthe paper.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"a6oo9iqIxAv44sY82kgQfkpVO38LmJOVG_OUla-TIus","pdfSize":"662556"}
