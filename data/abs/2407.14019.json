This is accomplished by\ndirectly dealing with the equivalence classes in the corresponding\nabelianizations, in contrast with the work of I. K. Babenko and S. A. Bogatyy,\nwho give an explicit abelianization morphism for the case $k=2$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TDpuNqBjroHxe7ZWd6wWS0H8KItzUNHLh1771PwPVDY","pdfSize":"292043"}
