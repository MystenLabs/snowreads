  "abstract": "  Proposed for rapid document similarity estimation in web search engines, the\ncelebrated property of minwise independence imposes highly symmetric\nconstraints on a family $\\mathcal{F}$ of permutations of $\\{1,\\ldots, n\\}$: The\nproperty is fulfilled by $\\mathcal{F}$ if for each $j\\in \\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$, any\ncardinality-$j$ subset $X\\subseteq \\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$, and any fixed element\n$x^\\ast\\in X$, it occurs with probability $1/j$ that a randomly drawn\npermutation $\\pi$ from $\\mathcal{F}$ satisfies $\\pi(x^\\ast)=\\min \\{\\pi(x) :\nx\\in X\\}$. The central interest is to find a family with fewest possible\nmembers meeting the stated constraints. We provide a framework that, firstly,\nis realized as a pure SAT model and, secondly, generalizes a heuristic of\nMathon and van Trung to the search of these families. Originally, the latter\nenforces an underlying group-theoretic decomposition to achieve a significant\nspeed-up for the computer-aided search of structures which can be identified\nwith so-called rankwise independent families. We observe that this approach is\nsuitable to find provenly optimal new representatives of minwise independent\nfamilies while yielding a decisive speed-up, too. As the problem has a naive\nsearch space of size at least $(n!)^n$, we also carefully address symmetry\nbreaking. Finally, we add a bijective proof for a problem encountered by\nBargachev when deriving a lower bound on the number of members in a minimal\nrankwise independent family.\n",
