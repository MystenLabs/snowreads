Most importantly,\nwe implement a consistent treatment of the nucleon self-energy in the $W^\\pm\nN\\to N'\\pi$ amplitude entering the definition of the two-particle two-hole\n(2p2h) cross-section, and estimate the source of uncertainty of our model due\nto a simplified treatment of the $\\Delta$ self-energy. Our new predictions are\naround $20-40\\%$ higher than previously. We show comparisons for the inclusive\nlepton double-differential cross sections, with no pions in the final state,\nmeasured by MiniBooNE on carbon and by T2K on carbon and oxygen. In all cases,\nwe find an excellent reproduction of the experiments, and in particular, the\nneutrino MiniBooNE data is now well described without requiring a global $90\\%$\nre-scaling of the flux. In addition, we take the opportunity of this revision\nto discuss in detail several important issues of the calculation of the 2p2h\ncross section, delving into the microscopic dynamics of the multi-nucleon\nmechanisms. The improved treatment presented in this work provides realistic\nfirst-step emitted two-nucleon final state momentum configurations, beyond the\napproximation of phase-space distributions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fbrIa63f4Gmz31luvHyeb-BaR9a2vABwbrqyroeus_M","pdfSize":"992494"}
