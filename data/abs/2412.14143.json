  "abstract": "  I show comparisons of the pseudoscalar meson vector form factor from\nsimulations of QCD with $N_c = 3$, 4 and 5 colors and $N_f = 2$ flavors of\ndegenerate mass fermions at a common (matched) fermion mass, lattice spacing,\nand simulation volume. The dependence of the form factor on the momentum\ntransfer is nearly independent of the number of colors, and is consistent with\nthe expectations of vector meson dominance.\n",
