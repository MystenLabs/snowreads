The mechanisms\nof spin formation, including the influence of transverse vibrations, are\nconsidered and the relationship between the anisotropy of the angular\ndistribution and the correlation coefficient is revealed. The theoretical\npredictions are compared with experimental data and various models developed by\nother research groups.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SjFCsT06vq1iZdIfRFpqZqpj7l-x_Z7L7Kh563TfM18","pdfSize":"1667061"}
