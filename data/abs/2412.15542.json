  "abstract": "  We investigate the correlations between net baryon number and electric charge\nup to sixth order related to the interactions of nuclear matter at low\ntemperature, and explore their relationship with the nuclear liquid-gas phase\ntransition (LGPT) within the framework of the nonlinear Walecka model. The\ncalculation shows that strong correlations between the baryon number and\nelectric charge exist in the vicinity of LGPT, and the higher order\ncorrelations are more sensitive than the lower order ones near the phase\ntransition. However, in the high-temperature region away from the LGPT the\nrescaled lower order correlations are relatively larger than most of the higher\norder ones. Besides, some of the fifth- and sixth-order correlations possibly\nchange the sign from negative to positive along the chemical freeze-out line\nwith the decrease of temperature. In combination with the future experimental\nprojects at lower collision energies, the derived results can be referred to\nstudy the phase structure of strongly interacting matter and analyze the\nrelated experimental signals.\n",
