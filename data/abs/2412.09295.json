In this work, we develop HT techniques to\nanalyse a specific Renormalization Group (RG) flow recently proposed in Refs.\n[1, 3]. These studies put forward Ginzburg-Landau descriptions for the\nconformal minimal models $M(3,10)$ and $M(3,8)$, as well as the RG flow\nconnecting them. Specifically, the RG-flow is defined by deforming the\n$M(3,10)$ with the relevant primary operator $\\phi_{1,7}$ (whose indices denote\nits position in the Kac table), yielding $M(3,10)+ \\phi_{1,7}$. From the\nperspective of HT, realising such an RG-flow presents significant challenges,\nas the $\\phi_{1,7}$ deformation requires renormalizing the UV theory up to\nthird order in the coupling constant of the deformation. In this study, we\ncarry out the necessary calculations to formulate HT for this theory and\nnumerically investigate the spectrum of $M(3,10)+ \\phi_{1,7}$ in the large\ncoupling regime, finding strong evidence in favour of the proposed flow.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bTFkrN_raF09Ucjvu76HhvZ54qnC8aViKWOYGOncPXc","pdfSize":"2211057"}
