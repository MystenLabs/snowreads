  "abstract": "  Given a simple graph $G$, the artinian monomial algebra associated to $G$,\ndenoted by $A(G)$, is defined by the edge ideal of $G$ and the squares of the\nvariables. In this article, we classify some tadpole graphs $G$ for which\n$A(G)$ has or fails the weak Lefschetz property.\n",
