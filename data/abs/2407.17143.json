In previous work we constructed a\nmodel for this process, obtaining an expression for the temperature\ndistribution inside the shell, and it was shown that the temperature increase\ncan be astrophysically significant. In this paper we extend the analysis to GW\nheating and damping following a binary neutron star merger, GW heating during a\ncore-collapse supernova, and primordial gravitational waves.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"k6m1xpIUAcKyVay1CChb2eeK_VdFAdZAe932UoAPTFc","pdfSize":"580210"}
