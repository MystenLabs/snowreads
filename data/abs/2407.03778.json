It can enhance the explainability of\nAI models by enabling them to provide intuitive and human-like explanations for\ntheir decisions. This is necessary in many areas especially in question\nanswering (QA), which is one of the most important tasks of natural language\nprocessing (NLP). Over time, a multitude of methods have emerged for solving\ncommonsense reasoning problems such as knowledge-based approaches using formal\nlogic or linguistic analysis. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness\nof large language models (LLMs) on different QA tasks with a focus on their\nabilities in reasoning and explainability. We study three LLMs: GPT-3.5, Gemma\nand Llama 3. We further evaluate the LLM results by means of a questionnaire.\nWe demonstrate the ability of LLMs to reason with commonsense as the models\noutperform humans on different datasets. While GPT-3.5's accuracy ranges from\n56% to 93% on various QA benchmarks, Llama 3 achieved a mean accuracy of 90% on\nall eleven datasets. Thereby Llama 3 is outperforming humans on all datasets\nwith an average 21% higher accuracy over ten datasets. Furthermore, we can\nappraise that, in the sense of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI),\nGPT-3.5 provides good explanations for its decisions. Our questionnaire\nrevealed that 66% of participants rated GPT-3.5's explanations as either \"good\"\nor \"excellent\". Taken together, these findings enrich our understanding of\ncurrent LLMs and pave the way for future investigations of reasoning and\nexplainability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Xbcsz48z8Drd7Qv0dGMAqwD2Ps3SVNGMroO99i6zcm4","pdfSize":"724173"}
