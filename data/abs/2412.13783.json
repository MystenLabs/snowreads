  "abstract": "  Pattern formation is ubiquitous in nature and the mechanism widely-accepted\nto underlay them is based on the Turing instability, predicted by Alan Turing\ndecades ago. This is a non-trivial mechanism that involves nonlinear\ninteraction terms between the different species involved and transport\nmechanisms. We present here a mathematical analysis aiming to explore the\nmathematical constraints that a reaction-diffusion dynamical model should\ncomply in order to exhibit a Turing instability. The main conclusion limits the\nexistence of this instability to nonlinearity degrees larger or equal to three.\n",
