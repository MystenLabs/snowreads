  "abstract": "  We prove that for every $n\\geq 2$, the reduced group $C^*$-algebras of the\ncountable free groups $C^*_r(\\mathbb{F}_n)$ have strict comparison. Our method\nworks in a general setting: for $G$ in a large family of non-amenable groups,\nincluding hyperbolic groups, free products, mapping class groups, right-angled\nArtin groups etc., we have $C^*_r(G)$ have strict comparison. This work also\nhas several applications in the theory of $C^*$-algebras including: resolving\nLeonel Robert's selflessness problem for $C^*_r(G)$; uniqueness of embeddings\nof the Jiang-Su algebra $\\mathcal{Z}$ up to approximate unitary equivalence\ninto $C^*_r(G)$; full computations of the Cuntz semigroup of $C^*_r(G)$ and\nfuture directions in the $C^*$-classification program.\n",
