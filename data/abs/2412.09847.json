The model introduces\nheavy and light fermionic dark matter components, where the heavy dark matter\nannihilation in the Galactic center boosts the light dark matter. Directional\ndirect detection experiments, such as NEWSdm, are suitable for testing the\nboosted scenario by focusing on signals from the Galactic center. We found that\nthe expected event rate could reach up to O(10) events per year per 5 kg of the\ndetector material.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jf2rCBZ_j6ln7lSlflM99QNLHl9i4rv8ZD2HRxscnKU","pdfSize":"1376935"}
