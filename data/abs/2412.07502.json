In this\ncontext, reporting next generation genome sequencing methods used in precision\nmedicine spurred the development of the IEEE 2791-2020 standard for\nBioinformatics Analyses Generated by High Throughput Sequencing (HTS), known as\nthe BioCompute Object (BCO). Championed by the USA's Food and Drug\nAdministration, the BCO is a pragmatic framework for documenting pipelines;\nhowever, it has not been systematically assessed for its reproducibility\nclaims.\n  This study uses the PRIMAD model, a conceptual framework for describing\ncomputational experiments for reproducibility purposes, to systematically\nreview the BCO for depth and coverage. A meticulous mapping of BCO and PRIMAD\nelements onto a published BCO use case reveals potential omissions and\nnecessary extensions within both frameworks. This underscores the significance\nof systematically validating claims of reproducibility for published digital\nobjects, thereby enhancing the reliability of scientific research in bioscience\nand related disciplines.\n  This study, along with its artifacts, is reported as a RO-Crate, providing a\nstructured reporting approach, which is available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14317922.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wsg6emj9Mmvvwr6n7OUjFasYT9EAi6rKaE6CDK7y9rU","pdfSize":"539969"}
