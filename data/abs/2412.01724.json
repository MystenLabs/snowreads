Using this operator, we can perform efficient optimization of many\nobjectives to improve stellarator performance, such as the\n$\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{3/2}$ proxy for the neoclassical transport\ncoefficient in the $1/\\nu$ regime. By employing this differentiable\napproximation, for the first time, we directly optimize a finite-$\\beta$\nstellarator to reduce neoclassical transport using reverse-mode\ndifferentiation, ensuring that the computational cost of determining the\ngradients is independent of the number of input parameters.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ded46EG6BpPB_Ay39T7TCoBvRD2DgCtVqZc_5RU2u7M","pdfSize":"7597116"}
