As an\nupper bound, we show that for some planar point sets in general position the\nlargest matching whose segments form a connected set has $\\lceil\n\\frac{n-1}{3}\\rceil$ edges. We also consider a colored version, where each edge\nof the matching should connect points with different colors.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"gj3OG-VNjN9nIVU8KNYk292tsj98gzcdq5voWuAiisM","pdfSize":"2208869"}
