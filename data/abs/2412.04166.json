To better anticipate and\nprepare for such losses, the algorithm user seeks an estimate for the\nprobability that the algorithm miss-classifies a sample. We refer to this task\nas the risk-assessment. For a variety of models and datasets, we numerically\nanalyze the performance of different methods in solving the risk-assessment\nproblem. We consider two solution strategies: a) calibration techniques that\ncalibrate the output probabilities of classification models to provide accurate\nprobability outputs; and b) a novel approach based upon the prediction interval\ngeneration technique of conformal prediction. Our conformal prediction based\napproach is model and data-distribution agnostic, simple to implement, and\nprovides reasonable results for a variety of use-cases. We compare the\ndifferent methods on a broad variety of models and datasets.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_dLTLC3bpAilB4erCyOVZT3WiGj4Y-ONoQTocbPs4Kw","pdfSize":"646226"}
