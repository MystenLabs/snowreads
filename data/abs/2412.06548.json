  "abstract": "  This work explores the geometry of the Hilbert space bundle of a quantum\nsystem, focusing on properties related to the parameter-induced dimension.\nInstead of relying on hints from the Hamiltonian eigenvalues, the behavior of\nthe fiber metric and the evolution of quantum states are analyzed directly. The\nresults reveal that the Hilbert space bundle around an exceptional point is\nnon-orientable. Beyond demonstrating a direct method for determining the\ngeometry of the Hilbert space bundle, this study also offers a potential\nframework for constructing qubits.\n",
