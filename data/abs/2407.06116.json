H&E is\nwidely available, however, cell subtyping often requires expert knowledge and\nthe use of specialized stains. To reduce the annotation burden, AI has been\nproposed for the classification of cells on H&E. For example, the recent Colon\nNucleus Identification and Classification (CoNIC) Challenge focused on labeling\n6 cell types on H&E of the colon. However, the CoNIC Challenge was unable to\nclassify epithelial subtypes (progenitor, enteroendocrine, goblet), lymphocyte\nsubtypes (B, helper T, cytotoxic T), and connective subtypes (fibroblasts). We\nuse inter-modality learning to label previously un-labelable cell types on H&E.\nWe take advantage of multiplexed immunofluorescence (MxIF) histology to label\n14 cell subclasses. We performed style transfer on the same MxIF tissues to\nsynthesize realistic virtual H&E which we paired with the MxIF-derived cell\nsubclassification labels. We evaluated the efficacy of using a supervised\nlearning scheme where the input was realistic-quality virtual H&E and the\nlabels were MxIF-derived cell subclasses. We assessed our model on private\nvirtual H&E and public real H&E. On virtual H&E, we were able to classify\nhelper T cells and epithelial progenitors with positive predictive values of\n$0.34 \\pm 0.15$ (prevalence $0.03 \\pm 0.01$) and $0.47 \\pm 0.1$ (prevalence\n$0.07 \\pm 0.02$) respectively, when using ground truth centroid information. On\nreal H&E we could classify helper T cells and epithelial progenitors with upper\nbound positive predictive values of $0.43 \\pm 0.03$ (parent class prevalence\n0.21) and $0.94 \\pm 0.02$ (parent class prevalence 0.49) when using ground\ntruth centroid information. This is the first work to provide cell type\nclassification for helper T and epithelial progenitor nuclei on H&E.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uVWzMoeAeQAGCukRl22gKe0fVAM2AVGblw3sqRH38Nc","pdfSize":"4781036"}
