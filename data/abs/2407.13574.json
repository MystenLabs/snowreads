We perform a Carroll (speed of light\n$c\\to0$) expansion of the relativistic Chern-Simons action coupled to a\nmassless scalar and obtain Carrollian CSM theories, which we show are invariant\nunder the infinite dimensional 3d conformal Carroll or 4d Bondi-van der\nBurg-Metzner-Sachs (BMS$_4$) symmetries, thus making them putative duals for 4d\nAFS. Concentrating on the leading-order electric Carroll CSM theory, we perform\na null reduction of the 3d theory. Null reduction is a procedure to obtain\nnon-relativistic theories from a higher dimensional relativistic theory.\nCuriously, null reduction of a Carrollian theory yields a relativistic\nlower-dimensional theory. We work with $SU(N) \\times SU(M)$ CS theory coupled\nto bi-fundamental matter and show that when $N=M$, we obtain (rather\nsurprisingly) a 2d Euclidean Yang-Mills theory after null reduction. We also\ncomment on the reduction when $N \\neq M$ and possible connections of the\nnull-reduced Carroll theory to a candidate 2d Celestial CFT.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"S7Ouna1wZsOif3ZrCbY_-1Cduk8yq21nsIO3J8BXm0U","pdfSize":"785596"}
