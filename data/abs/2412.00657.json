  "abstract": "  In the field of legal information retrieval, effective embedding-based models\nare essential for accurate question-answering systems. However, the scarcity of\nlarge annotated datasets poses a significant challenge, particularly for\nVietnamese legal texts. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach that\nleverages large language models to generate high-quality, diverse synthetic\nqueries for Vietnamese legal passages. This synthetic data is then used to\npre-train retrieval models, specifically bi-encoder and ColBERT, which are\nfurther fine-tuned using contrastive loss with mined hard negatives. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that these enhancements lead to strong improvement in\nretrieval accuracy, validating the effectiveness of synthetic data and\npre-training techniques in overcoming the limitations posed by the lack of\nlarge labeled datasets in the Vietnamese legal domain.\n",
