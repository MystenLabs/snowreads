However, although this result reduces our work to define a\nmeasure by only needing to define a pre-measure, it is not always easy to\ndefine the latter. The problem occurs when taking the smallest algebra that\ncontains a family of targeted sets, it can be very complicated to consistently\ndefine the value of the pre-measure over its finite union of these sets - a\nunion that is an element of the algebra. Thus, our objective in this article is\nto reproduce an extension theorem, just like the Carath\\'eodory's Extension\nTheorem, but in the context of probability measures and replacing the need for\na probability pre-measure defined over an algebra for now a quasi-measure\ndefined over a refinement. The gain, then, is that the \\textit{manual\nelaboration} of a quasi-measure is simpler than the elaboration of a\npre-measure, since a refinement is a simpler structure than an algebra.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"kQ1EAZfxOrr2TDDq8W4a6GgmzmjfE7TFDtMpXFz-Azo","pdfSize":"281221"}
