Instead of using linear functions to establish lower and\nupper bounds for multivariate functions as in prior work, we apply sigmoid\nfunctions to achieve these bounds with any specified error threshold based on\nthe multivariate function approximation method proposed by Cybenko. This\napproach allows us to derive fundamental inequalities for multivariate\nhypercomplex functions, leading to new inequalities based on ratio and\ndifference kinds. For applications about these new derived inequalities for\nmultivariate hypercomplex functions, we first introduce a new concept called\nW-boundedness for hypercomplex functions by applying ratio kind multivariate\nhypercomplex inequalities. W-boundedness generalizes R-boundedness for norm\nmappings with input from Banach space. Additionally, we develop an\napproximation theory for multivariate hypercomplex functions and establish\nbounds algebra, including operator bounds and tail bounds algebra for\nmultivariate random tensors.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WpLRfBNHLgodeW8UecvD6QBeue3lFU7TaoAvy4EAftU","pdfSize":"609986"}
