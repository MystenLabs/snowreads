A slight variation of the extremal problem is introduced and\nthe different formulations are studied for equivalence. Extending previous\nwork, a general result on existence of extremal functions for the new variant\nis proved under a certain general topological condition.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mYyDnCXEHzH4Qz0hZWhJ3n69ykzgyKJju99GXX-bbGo","pdfSize":"275487"}
