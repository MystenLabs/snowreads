This provides a 3D version of the duality between JT gravity and an\nensemble of random Hamiltonians, in which the matrix and tensor provide random\nCFT$_2$ data subject to a potential that incorporates the bootstrap\nconstraints. We show how the Feynman rules of the ensemble produce a sum over\nall three-manifolds and how surgery is implemented by the matrix integral. The\npartition functions of the resulting 3d gravity theory agree with Virasoro TQFT\n(VTQFT) on a fixed, hyperbolic manifold. However, on non-hyperbolic geometries,\nour 3d gravity theory differs from VTQFT, leading to a difference in the\neigenvalue statistics of the associated ensemble. As explained in\n\\cite{belin2023}, the Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equations of the matrix-tensor\nintegral play a crucial role in understanding how gravity emerges in the limit\nthat the ensemble localizes to exact CFT's. We show how the SD equations can be\ntranslated into a combinatorial problem about three-manifolds.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CF-7p-dnU10KYUvlXTyI1-T-i0Rrud-yl1KijJB0PQw","pdfSize":"8076713"}
