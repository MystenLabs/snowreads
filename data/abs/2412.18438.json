This regime of operation occurs naturally in certain laser systems\nand constitutes a valuable alternative to generate spectra with equidistant\nmodes. Here, we use a low-noise fs-pulse comb as the local oscillator and\ncombine dual comb heterodyne detection with time domain analysis of the\nmulti-heterodyne signal to reveal the temporal trace of both amplitude and\nphase quadratures of FM comb lasers' electric field. This technique is applied\nto both a dense and a harmonic mid-infrared free-running quantum cascade laser\nfrequency comb and shows direct evidence of the FM behavior together with the\nhigh degree of coherence of these sources. Our results furnish a deeper insight\non the origin of the FM combs and pave the way to further improvement and\noptimization of these devices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ppvWGn8Cd4fI_U890QfnmijqmQvGh0PKtwZFLuPvB0o","pdfSize":"776422"}
