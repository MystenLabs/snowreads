This is otained by the proper use of the\nboundary conditions in the functional integral of the generating functional of\nGreen functions. It is well known which boundary conditions are applied to the\nfields of the functional integral to get correct perturbation theory. We\npropose that these conditions should be used for all fields integrated in the\ngenerating functional integral. It is shown that in this case non-perturbative\neffects are absent. That is we assume that perturbation theory defines the\ncomplete generating functional integral. It allows, in particular, to formulate\nthe generating functional integral in a unique way as an exact compact\nmathematical formula.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2jXBral98XYE7Od1H_2iX69PiqYPJKniCuY8kv2RSH4","pdfSize":"76161"}
