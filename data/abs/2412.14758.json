However, the use of logic\nin the context of both human and machine reasoning is typically through the\ndual 'reductive' perspective: collections of sufficient premisses are generated\nfrom putative conclusions. We call this paradigm, 'reductive logic'. This\nexpression of logic encompass as diverse reasoning activities as proving a\nformula in a formal system to seeking to meet a friend before noon on Saturday.\nThis paper is a semantical analysis of reductive logic. In particular, we\nprovide mathematical foundations for representing and reasoning about\n'reduction operators'. Heuristically, reduction operators may be thought of as\n`backwards' inference rules. In this paper, we address their mathematical\nrepresentation, how they are used in the context of reductive reasoning, and,\ncrucially, what makes them 'valid'.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Logic in Computer Science","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rOn_VZ_2hkUh0BaybfEjYAp1weycqFtAjBJzYbAaU4k","pdfSize":"1063234"}
