  "abstract": "  We numerically study the first and the second order topological states of\nelectromagnetic (EM) wave in the three-dimensional (3D) woodpile photonic\ncrystal (PhC). The recent studies on 3D PhCs have mainly focused on the\nobservation of the topological states. Here, we not only focus on finding the\ntopological states but also propose a numerical calculation method for\ntopological invariants, which is based on the Wilson loop. For the 3D woodpile\nPhC, the topological states emerge due to the finite difference in the winding\nnumber or partial Chern number. The selection rule for the emergence of\ntopological hinge states is also pointed out based on the topological\ninvariants. Our numerical calculation results are essential and put a step\ntoward the experimental realization of topological waveguide in 3D PhCs.\n",
