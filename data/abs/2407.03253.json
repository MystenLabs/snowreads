Different classification systems have been suggested thanks to these\nresearch efforts. Nevertheless, they face major challenges owing to low\nperformance metrics due to the limited amount of labeled data. We propose\nSentence Transformers Fine-tuning (STF), a topic detection system that\nleverages pretrained Sentence Transformers models and fine-tuning to classify\ntopics from tweets accurately. Moreover, extensive parameter sensitivity\nanalyses were conducted to finetune STF parameters for our topic classification\ntask to achieve the best performance results. Experiments on two benchmark\ndatasets demonstrated that (1) the proposed STF can be effectively used for\nclassifying tweet topics and outperforms the latest state-of-the-art\napproaches, and (2) the proposed STF does not require a huge amount of labeled\ntweets to achieve good accuracy, which is a limitation of many state-of-the-art\napproaches. Our main contribution is the achievement of promising results in\ntweet topic classification by applying pretrained sentence transformers\nlanguage models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"H8Fg9Lps2M57fUJshYT0PZUM4lF4U7g4nsjeG9Rfknw","pdfSize":"164887"}
