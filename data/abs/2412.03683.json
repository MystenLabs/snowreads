  "abstract": "  The spontaneous breaking of CP symmetry in 4D SU($N$) pure Yang-Mills theory\nat $\\theta=\\pi$ has recently attracted much attention in the context of the\nhigher-form symmetry and the 't Hooft anomaly matching condition. Here we use\nMonte Carlo simulations to study the $N=2$ case, which is interesting since it\nis the case opposite to the large-$N$ limit, where explicit calculations are\navailable. In order to circumvent the severe sign problem due to the $\\theta$\nterm for real $\\theta$, we first obtain results at imaginary $\\theta$, where\nthe sign problem is absent, and make an analytic continuation to real $\\theta$.\nWe use the stout smearing in defining the $\\theta$ term in the action to be\nused in our simulations. Thus we obtain the expectation value of the\ntopological charge and the deconfining temperature at $\\theta=\\pi$, and provide\nan evidence that the CP symmetry, which is spontaneously broken at low\ntemperature, gets restored \\emph{strictly above} the deconfining temperature.\nThis conclusion is consistent with the anomaly matching condition and yet\ndiffers from the prediction in the large-$N$ limit.\n",
