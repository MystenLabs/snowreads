The Clebsch-Gordan\nTransform (CG transform) effectively encodes many-body interactions and is thus\nan important building block for many models of MLFFs. However, the\npermutation-equivariance requirement of MLFFs limits the design space of CG\ntransform, that is, intensive CG transform has to be conducted for each\nneighboring edge and the operations should be performed in the same manner for\nall edges. This constraint results in reduced expressiveness of the model while\nsimultaneously increasing computational demands. To overcome this challenge, we\nfirst implement the CG transform layer on the permutation-invariant abstract\nedges generated from real edge information. We show that this approach allows\ncomplete freedom in the design of the layer without compromising the crucial\nsymmetry. Developing on this free design space, we further propose group CG\ntransform with sparse path, abstract edges shuffling, and attention enhancer to\nform a powerful and efficient CG transform layer. Our method, known as FreeCG,\nachieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in force prediction for MD17, rMD17,\nMD22, and is well extended to property prediction in QM9 datasets with several\nimprovements greater than 15% and the maximum beyond 20%. The extensive\nreal-world applications showcase high practicality. FreeCG introduces a novel\nparadigm for carrying out efficient and expressive CG transform in future\ngeometric neural network designs. To demonstrate this, the recent SOTA,\nQuinNet, is also enhanced under our paradigm. Code will be publicly available.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Chemical Physics","Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cSzpG7tdVhdYv_Pd98YBes3HVLhmwlO0TBBZOkIT5CE","pdfSize":"1855027"}
