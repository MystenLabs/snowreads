To evaluate LLMs' ability to\ncomplete data-cleaning tasks, we implemented a pipeline for LLM-based Auto Data\nCleaning Workflow (AutoDCWorkflow), prompting LLMs on data cleaning operations\nto repair three types of data quality issues: duplicates, missing values, and\ninconsistent data formats. Given a dirty table and a purpose (expressed as a\nquery), this pipeline generates a minimal, clean table sufficient to address\nthe purpose and the data cleaning workflow used to produce the table. The\nplanning process involves three main LLM-driven components: (1) Select Target\nColumns: Identifies a set of target columns related to the purpose. (2) Inspect\nColumn Quality: Assesses the data quality for each target column and generates\na Data Quality Report as operation objectives. (3) Generate Operation &\nArguments: Predicts the next operation and arguments based on the data quality\nreport results. Additionally, we propose a data cleaning benchmark to evaluate\nthe capability of LLM agents to automatically generate workflows that address\ndata cleaning purposes of varying difficulty levels. The benchmark comprises\nthe annotated datasets as a collection of purpose, raw table, clean table, data\ncleaning workflow, and answer set. In our experiments, we evaluated three LLMs\nthat auto-generate purpose-driven data cleaning workflows. The results indicate\nthat LLMs perform well in planning and generating data-cleaning workflows\nwithout the need for fine-tuning.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Databases","Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ropBrqgNo-OxH9y_0g3zqoJKG0wLtKGbXoMZ2Fb01a4","pdfSize":"1910428"}
