In fact, in our case studies, we find a\nquasiconformal mapping that relates the elliptic measure in a domain to the\nharmonic measure in its image domain, and we deduce bounds for the Hausdorff\ndimension of the elliptic measure by the known results on the harmonic side.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XzpIopmU1Wyet9CdzadrMb_rr6udg3z4W5Y7EeavXcQ","pdfSize":"665808"}
