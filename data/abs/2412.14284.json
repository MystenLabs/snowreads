After\nobtaining the variance-covariance matrix of the estimator of the functional\ncoefficient which minimizes the integrated sum of square of errors, we extend\nthe classical definition of optimal design to this estimator, and we provide\nthe expression of the A-optimal and of the D-optimal designs. Examples of\noptimal designs for dynamic experimental factors are then computed through a\nsuitable algorithm, and we discuss different scenarios in terms of the set of\nbasis functions used for their representation. Finally, we present an example\nwith simulated data to illustrate the feasibility of our methodology.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"PHzYa6y8Tp1HpBJaBdWj6V_c049NuhcZ2HI-bxxg7hk","pdfSize":"760339"}
