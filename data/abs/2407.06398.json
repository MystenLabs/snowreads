Our primary contribution is\ncharacterising the asymptotic behavior of percentile mechanisms, which varies\naccording to the distribution governing the agents' types. To achieve this, we\nconnect the $k$-FLP and projection problems in the Wasserstein space. Owing to\nthis relation, we show that the ratio between the expected cost of a percentile\nmechanism and the expected optimal cost is asymptotically bounded. Furthermore,\nwe characterize the limit of this ratio and analyze its convergence speed. Our\nasymptotic study is complemented by deriving an upper bound on the Bayesian\napproximation ratio, applicable when the number of agents $n$ exceeds the\nnumber of facilities $k$. We also characterize the optimal percentile mechanism\nfor a given agent's distribution through a system of $k$ equations. Finally, we\nestimate the optimality loss incurred when the optimal percentile mechanism is\nderived using an approximation of the agents' distribution rather than the\nactual distribution.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pOFFV2D2j7JCNDwTPo4haFMy3e0Dyfdd9CrW20tIZaY","pdfSize":"371179"}
