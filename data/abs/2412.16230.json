The first theorem\nestablishes an improved regularity criterion for the solution of the corrected\nSmagorinsky model in Sobolev spaces $H^s(\\Omega(t))$ with smooth and evolving\nboundaries. The result provides a bound on the Sobolev norm of the solution,\nensuring that the solution remains regular over time. The second theorem\nquantifies the approximation error between the corrected Smagorinsky model and\nthe true Navier-Stokes solution. Taking advantage of high-order Sobolev spaces\nand energy methods, we derive an explicit error estimate for the velocity\nfields, showing the relationship between the error and the external force term.\nThe third theorem focuses on the asymptotic convergence of the corrected\nSmagorinsky model to the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations as time\nprogresses. We provide an upper bound for the error in the $L^2(\\Omega)$ norm,\ndemonstrating that the error decreases as time increases, especially as the\nexternal force term vanishes. This result highlights the long-term convergence\nof the corrected model to the true solution, with explicit dependences on the\ninitial conditions, viscosity, and external forces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"4jG1b3GWlSu_2DanoTShC8W_21SXXWRIJwD-EYca0As","pdfSize":"139023"}
