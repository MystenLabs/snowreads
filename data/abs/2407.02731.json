In this paper we\noutline the machine learning and heuristic techniques implemented by\nTxGraffiti. We also recall its contributions to the mathematical literature and\nannounce a new online version of the program available for anyone curious to\nexplore conjectures in graph theory.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vLkG418cvZlwbjejKW1qR8t3Ym3nYqqh5r4-lrpOn2U","pdfSize":"327215"}
