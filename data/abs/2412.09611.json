This limitation\nprevents the ability to perform precise, attribute-specific modifications\nwithout affecting unrelated aspects of the image. In this paper, we introduce\nFluxSpace, a domain-agnostic image editing method leveraging a representation\nspace with the ability to control the semantics of images generated by\nrectified flow transformers, such as Flux. By leveraging the representations\nlearned by the transformer blocks within the rectified flow models, we propose\na set of semantically interpretable representations that enable a wide range of\nimage editing tasks, from fine-grained image editing to artistic creation. This\nwork offers a scalable and effective image editing approach, along with its\ndisentanglement capabilities.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"J3Nbz3om6nn0nxSP774ZUysgZ6LLAY-d1FRGlkaeP48","pdfSize":"18835585"}
