Formal definitions are provided to\naccount for bounded and asymptotic local synchronization. The definitions are\nsuitable for modern power systems as they remove classical assumptions limiting\nthe application of the concept of synchronization to synchronous machines and\nomitting voltage dynamics. The paper also provides a systematic analytical\ndescription of the synchronization mechanisms of common power system devices.\nFinally, a variety of examples is included to illustrate the theoretical value\nand practical application of the proposed definitions to power systems modeling\nand stability analysis.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"wKzffebDCkxPbptnzWXJRw_bbEcLTus3bGlLQJWDgVQ","pdfSize":"887601"}
