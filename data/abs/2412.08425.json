  "abstract": "  We study high-energy scattering at fixed angle in the planar limit of\nnon-Abelian gauge field theories from type IIB superstring theory scattering\namplitudes. Firstly, we consider four-glueball scattering described in terms of\nthe four-dilaton string theory scattering amplitude. We explicitly calculate\nsome angular integrals of four scalar spherical harmonics on the five sphere\nleading to selection rules for several scattering processes. Then, we consider\nthe high-energy limit of the four-dilatino scattering amplitude in type IIB\nsuperstring theory, which allows to describe four spin-1/2 fermions scattering\nin the dual gauge field theory. In both cases the partonic structure of the\nscattering cross sections is obtained. The Regge behavior is also obtained. In\naddition, we study certain related aspects by considering the effective action\nconstructed from IIB supergravity.\n",
