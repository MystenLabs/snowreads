This project leverages\nthe power of FPGAs to perform wavelet analysis on an input signal. The goal is\nto detect the presence of a specific frequency component - in this case, 6 kHz.\nOur experiments demonstrate that wavelet-based spectral detection is both\npossible, and easily implemented using an FPGA.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"xKv9U4fSO_kokemGD8xo3BC3MyXr0YfAvLUrENAaF2U","pdfSize":"887054"}
