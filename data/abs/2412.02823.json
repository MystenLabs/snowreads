Drawing\non insights from the literature on human concept learning, we test LLMs on\ncarefully designed concept learning tasks, and show that task performance\nhighly correlates with the Boolean complexity of the concept. This suggests\nthat in-context learning exhibits a learning bias for simplicity in a way\nsimilar to humans.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qb_6gLHi9WlkexLThrgjlNx3yrRMpMTuEl04ihtwrFU","pdfSize":"518003"}
