They hold great potential\nfor advancing fluid control by providing responsive and flexible solutions.\nHowever, current designs of passive hydrodynamic metamaterials are limited by\ntheir fixed shapes and specific environments, lacking environmental\nadaptability. These two constraints hinder the broader application of\nhydrodynamic metamaterials. In this work, we propose a design for passive\nintelligent metashells that utilize extremely anisotropic parameters to endow\nhydrodynamic metamaterials with self-adaptive abilities and free-form shapes.\nAchieving the required anisotropic parameters is challenging, but we\ningeniously accomplished this by creating isobaric conditions through\nincreasing the water height in the shell region. We validated the design\nthrough finite-element simulations. This approach overcomes the limitations of\nexisting passive hydrodynamic metamaterials, enhancing their intelligent\nbehavior. Our model improves the flexibility and robustness of hydrodynamic\nmetamaterials in complex and dynamic environments, providing insights for\nfuture designs and practical applications\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GnCzc1TsGThCYUlwytm7YNFEa3J-f9-aKjdsggYkYCw","pdfSize":"3869194"}
