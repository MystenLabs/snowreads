  "abstract": "  A famous paper [Am. J. Phys. 43, 22 (1975)] unveiled the efficiency at\nmaximum power (EMP) of the endo-reversible Carnot heat engine, now commonly\nreferred to as the Curzon-Ahlborn (CA) engine, pioneering finite-time\nthermodynamics. Historically, despite the significance of the CA engine,\nsimilar findings had emerged at an earlier time, such as the Yvon engine\nproposed by J. Yvon in 1955 sharing the exact same EMP. However, the special\nsetup of the Yvon engine has circumscribed its broader influence. This paper\nextends the Yvon engine model to achieve a level of generality comparable to\nthat of the CA engine. A rigorous comparison reveals that the extended Yvon\nengine and CA engine represent the steady-state and cyclic forms of the\nendo-reversible Carnot heat engine, respectively, and are equivalent. Our work\nprovides a pedagogical example for the teaching of thermodynamics and\nengineering thermodynamics, given that the simple and lucid derivation of the\nextended Yvon engine helps students initiate their understanding of\nnon-equilibrium thermodynamics.\n",
