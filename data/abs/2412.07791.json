It traces the evolution from electronic\nto virtual and network democracy, underscoring how each stage has broadened\ndemocratic engagement through technology. Focusing on digital citizenship, the\nchapter examines how AI can improve online engagement and promote ethical\nbehaviour while posing privacy risks and fostering identity stereotyping.\nRegarding political participation, it highlights AI's dual role in mobilising\ncivic actions and spreading misinformation. Regarding representation, AI's\ninvolvement in electoral processes can enhance voter registration, e-voting,\nand the efficiency of result tabulation but raises concerns regarding privacy\nand public trust. Also, AI's predictive capabilities shift the dynamics of\npolitical competition, posing ethical questions about manipulation and the\nlegitimacy of democracy. Finally, the chapter examines how integrating AI and\ndigital technologies can facilitate democratic political advocacy and\npersonalised communication. However, this also comes with higher risks of\nmisinformation and targeted propaganda.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computers and Society","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Ot3cvplPazpMGHxs-asum6jipnjBOsSbrJM13KwYLZ8","pdfSize":"302698"}
