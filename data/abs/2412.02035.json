Existing LLMs\nstruggle to generate ontologies with multiple hierarchical levels, rich\ninterconnections, and comprehensive class coverage due to constraints on the\nnumber of tokens they can generate and inadequate domain adaptation. To address\nthese issues, we extend the NeOn-GPT pipeline for ontology learning using LLMs\nwith advanced prompt engineering techniques and ontology reuse to enhance the\ngenerated ontologies' domain-specific reasoning and structural depth. Our work\nevaluates the capabilities of LLMs in ontology learning in the context of\nhighly specialized and complex domains such as life science domains. To assess\nthe logical consistency, completeness, and scalability of the generated\nontologies, we use the AquaDiva ontology developed and used in the\ncollaborative research center AquaDiva as a case study. Our evaluation shows\nthe viability of LLMs for ontology learning in specialized domains, providing\nsolutions to longstanding limitations in model performance and scalability.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4JgO7VRUO9jO6Gt3cBNPZx3okvWF1OATiH9LDEzvvwc","pdfSize":"2853499"}
