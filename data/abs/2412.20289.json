  "abstract": "  The assumption of independence between observations (units) in a dataset is\nprevalent across various methodologies for learning causal graphical models.\nHowever, this assumption often finds itself in conflict with real-world data,\nposing challenges to accurate structure learning. We propose a\ndecorrelation-based approach for causal graph learning on dependent binary\ndata, where the local conditional distribution is defined by a latent utility\nmodel with dependent errors across units. We develop a pairwise maximum\nlikelihood method to estimate the covariance matrix for the dependence among\nthe units. Then, leveraging the estimated covariance matrix, we develop an\nEM-like iterative algorithm to generate and decorrelate samples of the latent\nutility variables, which serve as decorrelated data. Any standard causal\ndiscovery method can be applied on the decorrelated data to learn the\nunderlying causal graph. We demonstrate that the proposed decorrelation\napproach significantly improves the accuracy in causal graph learning, through\nnumerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.\n",
