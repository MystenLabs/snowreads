We assume\nunknown parameters corresponding to coefficients of the drift term, diffusion\nterm, and jump term, as well as the Poisson intensity and the probability\ndensity function of the underlying jump. We propose estimators based on\nadaptive Bayesian estimation from discrete observations. We demonstrate the\nconsistency and asymptotic normality of the estimators within the framework of\nsmall noise asymptotics.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4K6d4QgXHfcSlaq5kGNDKEMhxqkIEG_Ixg_OZNCbyow","pdfSize":"379042"}
