Here we show that\nthe Euler-Heisenberg Effective Lagrangian can generate circular polarization in\nCMB. This generation is calculated by using the Quantum Boltzmann Equation for\nthe time evolution of the Stokes parameter. Also, we estimate the Faraday\nconversion phase in order of $10^{-13} $ due to this Lagrangian which gives a\nlower bound on circular polarization of CMB.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"WTmSUm7a8xj5KQ1XRVWPGhYw3l8QLBDEedTnsP7-dGQ","pdfSize":"127140"}
