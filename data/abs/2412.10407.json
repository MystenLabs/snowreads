While direct observations provide the strongest evidence\nfor these distributions, they also manifest indirectly through their influence\non processes and quantities that strongly depend on the energy distribution,\nsuch as reaction rates. In this paper, we investigate reaction rates in the\ngeneral context of quasiequilibrium systems, which exhibit only local\nequilibrium. The hierarchical structure of these systems allows their\nstatistical properties to be represented as a superposition of statistics,\ni.e., superstatistics. Focusing on the three universality classes of\nsuperstatistics--$\\chi^2$, inverse-$\\chi^2$, and log-normal--we examine how\nthese nonequilibrium distributions influence reaction rates. We analyze, both\nanalytically and numerically, reaction rates for processes involving tunneling\nphenomena, such as fusion, and identify conditions under which quasiequilibrium\ndistributions outperform Maxwellian distributions in enhancing fusion\nreactivities. To provide a more detailed quantitative analysis, we further\nemploy semi-empirical cross sections to evaluate the effect of these\nnonequilibrium distributions on ionization and recombination rates in a plasma.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Glr65jzESgV_vHiyneoaIJ3RXTEBusKUMD43eHvjNxE","pdfSize":"1996675"}
