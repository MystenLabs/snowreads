Recently, Babu, Benson, and Rajendraprasad significantly improved\nthe upper bound of $f(r)$ by establishing that $f(r) \\leq 1.5r^2 + r + 1$, see\n[Improved bounds for the oriented radius of mixed multigraphs, J. Graph Theory,\n103 (2023), 674-689]. Additionally, they demonstrated that if each edge of a\ngraph $G$ is contained within a cycle of length at most $\\eta$, then the\noriented radius of $G$ is at most $1.5r\\eta$. The authors' results were derived\nthrough Observation 1, which served as the foundation for the development of\nAlgorithm ORIENTOUT and Algorithm ORIENTIN. By integrating these algorithms,\nthey obtained the improved bounds. However, an error has been identified in\nObservation 1, necessitating revisions to Algorithm ORIENTOUT and Algorithm\nORIENTIN. In this note, we address the error and propose the necessary\nmodifications to both algorithms, thereby ensuring the correctness of the\nconclusions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"0mygwuTAIB-OgcrryaFtPv33Tqjn-nkOjDZFNDo-JQU","pdfSize":"311797"}
