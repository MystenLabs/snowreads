  "abstract": "  Disorder can prevent many-body quantum systems from reaching thermal\nequilibrium, leading to a many-body localized phase. Recent works suggest that\nnonperturbative effects caused by rare regions of low disorder may destabilize\nthe localized phase. However, numerical simulations of interacting systems are\ngenerically possible only for small system sizes, where finite-size effects\nmight dominate. Here we perform a numerical investigation of noninteracting\ndisordered spin chains coupled to a local Lindblad bath at the boundary. Our\nresults reveal strong finite-size effects in the Lindbladian gap in both\nbath-coupled Anderson and Aubry-Andr\\'e-Harper models, leading to a\nnon-monotonic behavior with the system size. We discuss the relaxation\nproperties of a simple toy model coupled to local Lindblad baths, connecting\nits features to those of noninteracting localized chains. We comment on the\nimplications of our findings for many-body systems.\n",
