Despite its societal impact, existing models of opinion\nchange fail to account for emotional dynamics nor offer methods to quantify\naffective polarization robustly and in real-time. In this paper, we introduce a\ndiscrete choice model that captures decision-making within affectively\npolarized social networks and propose a statistical inference method estimate\nkey parameters -- in-group love and out-group hate -- from social media data.\nThrough empirical validation from online discussions about the COVID-19\npandemic, we demonstrate that our approach accurately captures real-world\npolarization dynamics and explains the rapid emergence of a partisan gap in\nattitudes towards masking and lockdowns. This framework allows for tracking\naffective polarization across contentious issues has broad implications for\nfostering constructive online dialogues in digital spaces.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Social and Information Networks","Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"f4iDm6ytLousa8G-6oJ9s1WzlQunEJhOTMy09HNrJHM","pdfSize":"1873206"}
