  "abstract": "  We report ring resonators on a silicon germanium on silicon platform\noperating in the mid-infrared wavelength range around 3.5 - 4.6 {\\mu}m with\nquality factors reaching up to one million. Advances in fabrication technology\nenable us to demonstrate such high Q-factors, which put silicon germanium at\nthe forefront of mid-infrared integrated photonic platforms. The achievement of\nhigh Q is attested by the observation of degeneracy lifting between clockwise\n(CW) and counter-clockwise (CCW) resonances, as well as optical bistability due\nto an efficient power buildup in the rings.\n",
