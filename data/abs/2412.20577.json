  "abstract": "  Scattering amplitudes in the high-energy limit can be described in terms of\ntheir singularity structure in the complex angular momentum plane, consisting\nof Regge poles and cuts. In QCD, gluon Reggeization has long been understood as\na manifestation of a Regge pole, but until recently Reggeization violation\nremained largely obscure. New methods, based on iterative solution of rapidity\nevolution equations, facilitate direct computation of components of the\namplitude which are mediated by multi-Reggeon exchange, a manifestation of\nRegge cuts. Upon disentangling the Regge cut from the pole we are now able to\nextract the pole parameters from state-of-the-art fixed-order computations (3\nloops) and make predictions regarding certain components of the amplitude to\nhigher loop orders. In this talk I review the key ideas which led to this\nprogress, describe where we stand in exploring the structure of 2 -> 2 and 2 ->\n3 amplitudes in the (multi-) Regge limit, and comment on the interplay between\nthis research and the study of infrared factorization.\n",
