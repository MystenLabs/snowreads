  "abstract": "  This exhaustive investigation is dedicated to delving into the intricate\nlegal aspects that underlie the inefficiency in the advancement and utilization\nof sustainable energies, with a primary focus on the dynamic landscape of China\nand carefully selected representative nations. In an era where the global\ncommunity increasingly acknowledges the pressing need for\nenvironmentally-friendly alternatives to traditional fossil fuels, renewable\nenergy sources have rightfully garnered substantial attention as encouraging\nsolutions. Nevertheless, notwithstanding their potential to revolutionize the\nenergy sector and counteract climate change, a multitude of legal and\nregulatory barriers may present formidable hindrances that impede their\nseamless integration into the energy landscape. With a resolute and\nconcentrated aim, the research sets forth on a painstaking exploration and\nanalysis of the intricate legal frameworks, policies, and institutional\narrangements in place within China and the chosen representative nations. The\nultimate objective is to discern and identify potential challenges and\ninefficiencies that could hinder the progress of renewable energy projects and\ninitiatives.\n",
