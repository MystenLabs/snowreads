Only specialised expert engineers can decipher such logs and\ntroubleshoot defects in test runs. While AI offers a promising solution for\nautomating defect triage, potentially leading to massive revenue savings for\ncompanies, state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) suffer from\nsignificant drawbacks in this specialised domain. These include a constrained\ncontext window, limited applicability to text beyond natural language, and high\ninference costs. To address these limitations, we propose a compact\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that offers a context window\nspanning up to 200,000 characters and achieves over 96% accuracy (F1>0.9) in\nclassifying multifaceted software logs into various layers in the\ntelecommunications protocol stack. Specifically, the proposed model is capable\nof identifying defects in test runs and triaging them to the relevant\ndepartment, formerly a manual engineering process that required expert\nknowledge. We evaluate several LLMs; LLaMA2-7B, Mixtral 8x7B, Flan-T5, BERT and\nBigBird, and experimentally demonstrate their shortcomings in our specialized\napplication. Despite being lightweight, our CNN significantly outperforms\nLLM-based approaches in telecommunications log classification while minimizing\nthe cost of production. Our defect triaging AI model is deployable on edge\ndevices without dedicated hardware and widely applicable across software logs\nin various industries.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fpL8XoSOwF5PyRSoRcwxpg_C0KcWOcWW_MYHgyfIqQw","pdfSize":"783470"}
