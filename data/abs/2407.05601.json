By considering the real bosons and the real fermions at\n$\\lambda=0$ (or $\\lambda=\\frac{1}{2}$), the ${\\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric\n$W_{\\frac{\\infty}{2}}$ algebra is obtained. At $\\lambda=\\frac{1}{4}$, other\n${\\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric $W_{1+\\infty}[\\lambda=\\frac{1}{4}]$ algebra is\ndetermined. We also obtain the extension of Lie superalgebra $PSU(2,2|{\\cal\nN}=4)$ appearing in the worldsheet theory by using the symplectic bosons and\nthe fermions. We identify the soft current algebra between the graviton, the\ngravitino, the photon (the gluon), the photino (the gluino) or the scalars,\nequivalent to ${\\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric $W_{1+\\infty}[\\lambda]$ algebra, in\ntwo dimensions with the ${\\cal N}=1$ supergravity theory in four dimensions\ndiscovered by Freedman, van Nieuwenhuizen and Ferrara in 1976 and its matter\ncoupled theories, via celestial holography.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"V6oWirOh49HRFq2UTCzsubXuB_aRBhPMk8G8W6KntE0","pdfSize":"566997"}
