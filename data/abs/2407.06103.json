However, both pure and hybrid quantum\nreinforcement learning face challenges such as data encoding and the use of\nquantum computers during the inference stage. We apply the Quantum-Train method\nto reinforcement learning tasks, called QTRL, training the classical policy\nnetwork model using a quantum machine learning model with polylogarithmic\nparameter reduction. This QTRL approach eliminates the data encoding issues of\nconventional quantum machine learning and reduces the training parameters of\nthe corresponding classical policy network. Most importantly, the training\nresult of the QTRL is a classical model, meaning the inference stage only\nrequires classical computer. This is extremely practical and cost-efficient for\nreinforcement learning tasks, where low-latency feedback from the policy model\nis essential.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"qHgSo60oPP75N6MEFLZrUIlBO_JOugjWpCpYBDGkD-8","pdfSize":"2513851"}
