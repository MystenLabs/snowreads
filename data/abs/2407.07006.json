Multiple-environment MDPs (MEMDPs) extend MDPs. They intuitively\nreflect finite sets of MDPs that share the same state and action spaces but\ndiffer in the transition dynamics. The key objective in MEMDPs is to find a\nsingle policy that satisfies a given objective in every associated MDP. The\nmain result of this paper is PSPACE-completeness for almost-sure Rabin\nobjectives in MEMDPs. This result clarifies the complexity landscape for MEMDPs\nand contrasts with results for the more general class of partially observable\nMDPs (POMDPs), where almost-sure reachability is already EXPTIME-complete, and\nalmost-sure Rabin objectives are undecidable.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZE-SRF7ZEJjESn_35wWcIK3xKqzE5oy6yvLGK7gwK3w","pdfSize":"854981"}
