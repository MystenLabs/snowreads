It cycles about the Sun for all time, asymptotically approaching\nthe capture set. In addition to being permanently captured, $P$ is also weakly\ncaptured. A recent result in \\cite{Belbruno:2024} describes this region in\ngeneral. It has a fractal structure. This is applied to the permanent capture\nof rogue planets and other objects from interstellar space\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"A0oQCeYZDblglTNOG8KXU8FO5S2WZTrXFO0_i3CV_oo","pdfSize":"201793"}
