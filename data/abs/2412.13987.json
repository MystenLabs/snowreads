It forms in several phases or\npolymorphs - {\\alpha}, {\\beta}, {\\gamma}, and {\\kappa} - having variable\nproperties because of different lattice symmetries. Optical properties are of\nparticular importance as they determine specific device applications and can\nalso be used for phase identification. However, a direct comparison of optical\npolymorph signatures, including such critical parameters as bandgaps, is\nchallenging due to the scattered, limited, or even absent data for certain\nphases in the literature. To address this issue, in the present work we\nsystematically cross-correlate optical emission and absorption features of\n{\\alpha}, {\\beta}, {\\gamma}, and {\\kappa} thin films, as well as differently\noriented {\\beta}-phase bulk crystals and {\\gamma}/{\\beta} double polymorph\nstructures. We demonstrate that the optical bandgap and emission features scale\nconsistently across these polymorphs upon minimization of the methodological\nuncertainties. As a result, this work provides a comparative library of near-\nand far-field optical signatures of the polymorphs for use by the\nmultidisciplinary research community working with gallium oxide.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"YHJrwWI78T85fP6v-mFhSB2Mxa3MvA5JHthAQp-vK14","pdfSize":"3127190"}
