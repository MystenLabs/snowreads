  "abstract": "  Possible forms of obstructed atomic limits in quasi-one-dimensional systems\nare studied using line group symmetry. This is accomplished by revisiting the\nstandard theory with an emphasis on its group-theoretical background,\nsynthesizing the insights into a theorem that effectively identifies potential\ncases. The framework is then applied across the classes of\nquasi-one-dimensional systems, where the obstructed atomic limit serves as the\nprimary criterion for topological characterization. The results are\nsystematically organized and displayed, complemented by several illustrative\nexamples.\n",
