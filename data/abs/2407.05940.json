The inclusion\nof killing vector field and the Lorentzian metrics make the Ricci-Yamabe\nsoliton richer and interesting. We study the cosmological and dust fluid model\non (RYS) equipped with Lorentzian para Sasakian (LPS) spacetime. The cases of\neta-parallel Ricci tensor and the Poisson structure have been studied on (RYS)\nequipped with (LPS) manifold. Gradient (RYS) equipped with (LPS) manifold also\nreveal. Finally, we establish an example of four-dimensional LP Sasakian\nmanifold (LPS) that satisfy (alpha, beta) (RYS) and some results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fNsu27OkJ3so8tkUba1YjqBK77p65TbCrB3vPHuVaq8","pdfSize":"202093"}
