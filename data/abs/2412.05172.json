It turns out that the choices that\nare required to characterize consistent transition defects match with the\nhomotopy classes of paths between different phases. Our method applies to\nnon-anomalous as well as anomalous GLSMs, and we illustrate both cases with\nexamples. This includes the GLSM associated to the resolution of the $A_N$\nsingularity and one describing the entire parameter space of $N = 2$ minimal\nmodels, in particular, the relevant flows between them. Via fusion with\nboundary conditions, the defects we construct yield functors describing the\ntransport of D-branes on parameter space. We find that our results match with\nknown results on D-brane transport.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"tiG8Vfzz_vewWd5XdPBgYZJyOwNHxoyWH9aKaRlXNm8","pdfSize":"514078"}
