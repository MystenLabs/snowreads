By combining the light-front quark model\n(LFQM) with the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model, which reasonably reproduces\nEMFFs in free space and the saturation properties of nuclear matter,\nrespectively, we systematically analyze the in-medium EMFFs and charge radii of\nmesons with various quark flavors. Our findings show that the EMFFs of charged\n(neutral) mesons exhibit a faster fall-off (increase) with increasing\nfour-momentum transfer squared and nuclear density. Consequently, the absolute\nvalue of the charge radii of mesons increases with nuclear density, where the\nrate of increase depends on their quark flavor contents. We observe that the\nEMFFs of pions and kaons undergo significant modifications in the nuclear\nmedium, while heavy-light mesons are only slightly modified. By decomposing the\nquark flavor contributions to EMFFs, we show that the medium effects primarily\nimpact the light-quark sector, leaving the heavy-quark sector nearly\nunaffected. The results of this study further suggest the importance of the\nmedium effects at the quark level.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zxzuTLCj8J_yM9oYGOwpw1b77O3J7iz4Gi3tCZGouow","pdfSize":"827257"}
