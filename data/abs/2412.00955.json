However, recent works on computational\nbuilding understanding have largely focused on natural imagery of buildings,\nneglecting the fundamental element defining a building's structure -- its\nfloorplan. Conversely, existing works on floorplan understanding are extremely\nlimited in scope, often focusing on floorplans of a single semantic category\nand region (e.g. floorplans of apartments from a single country). In this work,\nwe introduce WAFFLE, a novel multimodal floorplan understanding dataset of\nnearly 20K floorplan images and metadata curated from Internet data spanning\ndiverse building types, locations, and data formats. By using a large language\nmodel and multimodal foundation models, we curate and extract semantic\ninformation from these images and their accompanying noisy metadata. We show\nthat WAFFLE enables progress on new building understanding tasks, both\ndiscriminative and generative, which were not feasible using prior datasets. We\nwill publicly release WAFFLE along with our code and trained models, providing\nthe research community with a new foundation for learning the semantics of\nbuildings.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"94fknJ6oCmAU212au0ATv_rSDosgUGOtdZ4fF6XMetg","pdfSize":"31954987"}
