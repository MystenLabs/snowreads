We present\nnew observations from the C IV in L* survey (CIViL*; PID$\\#$17076) using the\nHubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph. By combining these\nmeasurements with archival C IV data (46 observations total), we estimate\ndetection fractions for star-forming (sSFR $>$ 10$^{-11}$ yr$^{-1}$) and\npassive galaxies (sSFR $\\leq$ 10$^{-11}$ yr$^{-1}$) to be 72$_{-18}^{+14}$\\%\n[21/29] and 23$_{-15}^{+27}$\\% [3/13], respectively. This indicates a\nsignificant dichotomy in C IV presence between L* star-forming and passive\ngalaxies, with over 99% confidence. This finding aligns with Tumlinson et al.\n(2011), which noted a similar dichotomy in O VI absorption. Our results imply a\nsubstantial carbon reservoir in the CGM of L* galaxies, suggesting a minimum\ncarbon mass of $\\gtrsim$ 3.03 $\\times$ 10$^{6}$ M$_{\\odot}$ out to 120 kpc.\nTogether, these findings highlight a strong connection between star formation\nin galaxies and the state of their CGM, providing insight into the mechanisms\ngoverning galaxy evolution.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"D5v4WLxcDzrDnblDL9yDQ4ZPq8BITy-CniZJfslpnTE","pdfSize":"2026492"}
