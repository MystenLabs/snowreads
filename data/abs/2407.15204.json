Interstellar molecules profoundly influence\nthe chemistry and physics of the interstellar medium (ISM), playing pivotal\nroles in planet formation and the emergence of life. Understanding their\nchemistry relies on theoretical approaches such as Density Functional Theory\n(DFT) and post-Hartree-Fock methods, which are essential for exploring pathways\nto molecular complexity and determining their interstellar abundances. Various\ntheoretical methods investigate the formation of interstellar molecules in both\ngaseous and solid states. Molecules in interstellar space may originate from\nbottom-up processes (building up from CO molecules) or top-down processes\n(polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon fragmentation). Here, we present a journey of\ntheoretical investigations aimed at studying the reactivity of interstellar\nmolecules in space.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VWz1cu2aj38_3hLTH5sfW3EwnEOzyrmFWVFOvi9H_OE","pdfSize":"3579111"}
