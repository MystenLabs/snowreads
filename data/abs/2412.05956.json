However, existing research on capacity expansion\nsuffers from two major limitations that undermine the realistic accuracy of the\nproposed models: (i) the lack of modeling of three-phase unbalanced AC\ndistribution networks, and (ii) the absence of explicit treatment of model\nuncertainty. To address these challenges, we develop a two-stage robust\noptimization model that incorporates a 3-phase unbalanced power flow model for\nsolving the capacity expansion problem. Furthermore, we integrate a predictive\nneural network with the optimization model in an end-to-end training framework\nto handle uncertain variables with provable guarantees. Finally, we validate\nthe proposed framework using real-world power grid data collected from our\npartner distribution system operators. The experimental results demonstrate\nthat our hybrid framework, which combines the strengths of optimization models\nand neural networks, provides tractable decision-making support for DER\ndeployments in real-world scenarios.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computer Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"HIXfS5QUxrSfWxs0c1e5Tu3Ny49whmWO6ZbaRs0kFn8","pdfSize":"760399"}
