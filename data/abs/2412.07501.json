Moreover, using\nresults from a companion paper, we treat global theta correspondence using\nC*-algebraic methods. As a byproduct, we exhibit that Rallis inner product\nformula can be interpreted as a certain natural inclusion being an isometry.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras","Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ubr3W8ZoXkRhV8DNye3Ji4NqINSfqobpQQWy5DyNors","pdfSize":"391669"}
