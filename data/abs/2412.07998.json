In personalized\nconversational search, effectively capturing a user's complex search intent\nrequires incorporating both contextual information and key elements from the\nuser profile into query reformulation. The user profile often contains many\nrelevant pieces, and each could potentially complement the user's information\nneeds. It is difficult to disregard any of them, whereas introducing an\nexcessive number of these pieces risks drifting from the original query and\nhinders search performance. This is a challenge we denote as\nover-personalization. To address this, we propose different strategies by\nfusing ranking lists generated from the queries with different levels of\npersonalization.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VGfJxhz056aUtr8hS5lagZnVV5D1KHDMicBqzobSqkc","pdfSize":"159393"}
