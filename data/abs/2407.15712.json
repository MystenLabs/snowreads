While there is more than\none way to measure how different two processes are, special care must be taken\nto ensure quantifiers obey physically desirable conditions such as data\nprocessing inequalities. Here, we analyze two classes of distinguishability\nmeasures commonly used in general applications of quantum combs. We show that\nthe first class, called Choi divergences, does not satisfy an important data\nprocessing inequality, while the second one, which we call generalized\ndivergences, does. We also extend to quantum combs some other relevant results\nof generalized divergences of quantum channels. Finally, given the properties\nwe proved, we argue that generalized divergences may be more adequate than Choi\ndivergences for distinguishing quantum combs in most of their applications.\nParticularly, this is crucial for defining monotones for resource theories\nwhose states have a comb structure, such as resource theories of quantum\nprocesses and resource theories of quantum strategies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"X3T2VjXSChwaELbDVJlFwXKut9TDDT9FR8AFJR622bA","pdfSize":"1335596"}
