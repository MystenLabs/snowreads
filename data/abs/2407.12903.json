If $r_0$ is the horizon radius and\n$\\alpha'$ is the square of the string scale, the 4D Schwarzschild interior is\nstrongly curved at $ \\big(r_0 \\alpha' \\big)^{1/3}$. Infalling massless probes\nthat reach this scale stretch and become excited strings. I generalize this\npicture for a wide class of black hole solutions in string theory. For the\nblack hole dual to the large-$N$ BFSS model in a thermal state, and denoting\n$\\ell_P$ the Planck length, tidal forces are stringy at $r_0\n\\left(\\frac{r_0}{N^{1/3} \\ell_P}\\right)^{3/11}$, which is greater than the\nscale where string perturbation theory breaks down for sufficiently large\n$r_0/\\ell_P$. For 4D Kerr, there is a range of spin parameters for which the\ninner horizon is to the future of the scale of stringy curvature. These results\nspecify the portion of black hole interior solutions where effective field\ntheory can be used; beyond these scales, one must resort to other methods.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kT8hmYKki1-FflCS4TttrSA8YWykA_poe9nCXbB-7f0","pdfSize":"672678"}
