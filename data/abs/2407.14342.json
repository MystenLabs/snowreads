Population-based\nstructural health monitoring seeks to overcomes these challenges by leveraging\ndata/information from similar structures via technologies such as transfer\nlearning. The current paper demonstrate a methodology for quantifying the value\nof information transfer in the context of operation and maintenance\ndecision-making. This demonstration, based on a population of laboratory-scale\naircraft models, highlights the steps required to evaluate the expected value\nof information transfer including similarity assessment and prediction of\ntransfer efficacy. Once evaluated for a given population, the value of\ninformation transfer can be used to optimise transfer-learning strategies for\nnewly-acquired target domains.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DSmEj90HaXrheVYtVuBM-0a3y021HiCMAtrAJl0j89I","pdfSize":"629803","objectId":"0x6a16c361a49700b8af4b17c7585e9df41ecd295183bc59e2996dbcb5077562df","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
