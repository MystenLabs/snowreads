  "abstract": "  Managing clinical trial information is currently a significant challenge for\nthe medical industry, as traditional methods are both time-consuming and\ncostly. This paper proposes a simple yet effective methodology to extract and\nintegrate clinical trial data in a cost-effective and time-efficient manner.\nAllowing the medical industry to stay up-to-date with medical developments.\nComparing time, cost, and quality of the ontologies created by humans, GPT3.5,\nGPT4, and Llama3 (8b & 70b). Findings suggest that large language models (LLM)\nare a viable option to automate this process both from a cost and time\nperspective. This study underscores significant implications for medical\nresearch where real-time data integration from clinical trials could become the\nnorm.\n",
