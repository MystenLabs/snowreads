Current state-of-the-art methods tend to consider\nonly the dependencies between connected skeletal joints, limiting their ability\nto capture non-linear dependencies between physically distant joints. Moreover,\nmost existing approaches distinguish action classes by estimating the\nprobability density of motion representations, yet the high-dimensional nature\nof human motions invokes inherent difficulties in accomplishing such\nmeasurements. In this paper, we seek to tackle these challenges from two\ndirections: (1) We propose a novel dependency refinement approach that\nexplicitly models dependencies between any pair of joints, effectively\ntranscending the limitations imposed by joint distance. (2) We further propose\na framework that utilizes the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion to\ndifferentiate action classes without being affected by data dimensionality, and\nmathematically derive learning objectives guaranteeing precise recognition.\nEmpirically, our approach sets the state-of-the-art performance on NTU RGB+D,\nNTU RGB+D 120, and Northwestern-UCLA datasets.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"YBWy-2YA3ExKd80ZYnfe9zC6bJBNDU746l-bfolfDQ0","pdfSize":"1405390"}
