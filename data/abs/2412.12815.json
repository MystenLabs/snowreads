  "abstract": "  In this paper, we advance the network theory of aging and mortality by\ndeveloping a causal mathematical model for the mortality rate. First, we show\nthat in large networks, where health deficits accumulate at nodes representing\nhealth indicators, the modeling of network evolution with Poisson processes is\nuniversal and can be derived from fundamental principles. Second, with the help\nof two simplifying approximations, which we refer to as mean-field assumption\nand homogeneity assumption, we provide an analytical derivation of Gompertz law\nunder generic and biologically relevant conditions. We identify the parameters\nin Gompertz law as a function of the parameters driving the evolution of the\nnetwork, and illustrate our computations with simulations and analytic\napproximations.\n",
