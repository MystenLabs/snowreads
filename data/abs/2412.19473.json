  "abstract": "  The optimization of robust quantum control is often tailored to specific\ntasks and suffers from inefficiencies due to the complexity of cost functions.\nOur recent findings indicate a highly effective methodology for the engineering\nof quantum gates by initiating the process with a robust control configuration\nof any arbitrary gate. We first introduce the Quantum Control Robustness\nLandscape (QCRL), a conceptual framework that maps control parameters to noise\nsusceptibility. This framework facilitates a systematic investigation of\nequally robust controls for diverse quantum operations. By navigating through\nthe level sets of the QCRL, our Robustness-Invariant Pulse Variation (RIPV)\nalgorithm allows for the variation of control pulses while preserving\nrobustness. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our single- and two-qubit\ngates exceed the quantum error correction threshold even with substantial\nnoise. This methodology opens up a new paradigm for quantum gate engineering\ncapable of effectively suppressing generic noise.\n",
