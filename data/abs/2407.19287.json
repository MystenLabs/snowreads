We define that the uncertainty quantification is trustworthy if\nthe ground truth can be captured by intervals dependent on the predictive\ndistributions with a pre-specified probability. Furthermore, we propose,\nTrust-Bayes, a novel optimization framework for Bayesian meta learning which is\ncognizant of trustworthy uncertainty quantification without explicit\nassumptions on the prior model/distribution of the functions. We characterize\nthe lower bounds of the probabilities of the ground truth being captured by the\nspecified intervals and analyze the sample complexity with respect to the\nfeasible probability for trustworthy uncertainty quantification. Monte Carlo\nsimulation of a case study using Gaussian process regression is conducted for\nverification and comparison with the Meta-prior algorithm.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9rKqSrzr-T4gTeLo7X3sOX1WdP0V3KXJ39aDkZfm84k","pdfSize":"937355"}
