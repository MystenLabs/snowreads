To solve these problems, we propose an\nAlternating Gradient-type algorithm with Inexact Lower-level Solutions (AGILS)\nbased on a Moreau envelope-based reformulation of the bilevel optimization\nproblem. The proposed algorithm does not require exact solutions of the\nlower-level problem at each iteration, improving computational efficiency. We\nprove the convergence of AGILS to stationary points and, under the\nKurdyka-{\\L}ojasiewicz (KL) property, establish its sequential convergence.\nNumerical experiments, including a toy example and a bilevel hyperparameter\nselection problem for the sparse group Lasso model, demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed AGILS.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"S2lK4rLD3ni_8KeBtOc5ajBk-srVOM6nVlrpEBp_IQg","pdfSize":"916933"}
