The controllability of this system has been\npreviously demonstrated over the past decade using the Hilbert uniqueness\nmethod which involves proving an observability inequality, in general,\ndemonstrated via Carleman estimates. Here, we extend this understanding by\nachieving the exact controllability within a space of analytic functions,\nemploying the flatness approach which is a new approach for higher-order\ndispersive systems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"Dhl_Y_K25wliobl3Mtqf1qctaBInlQOSQxivnTraGQQ","pdfSize":"411947","objectId":"0x1b265564cdb7a06590edda0ce6da3a7bf40580125271c950121d68b4f52f6b7b","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
