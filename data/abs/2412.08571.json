The rapidity\nevolution of the dipole amplitude is discussed in detail. Dipole amplitude\nproperties, such as the evolution speed or anomalous dimension behaviour, are\nstudied as a function of the impact parameter and the dipole size and compared\nto solutions of the impact-parameter-dependent leading-order Balitsky-Kovchegov\nequation with the collinearly improved kernel. The next-to-leading evolution\nalso strongly suppresses the Coulomb tails compared to the collinearly improved\nand leading order solutions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-8WV9VoXBUM42RXpm98-ADq4UAwTsgrXUPXn9LCpFLQ","pdfSize":"14919914"}
