It is\nwell-known that the optimal investment strategy is characterized by two trading\nboundaries, i.e., the buy boundary and the sell boundary, between which is the\nno-trading region. We study how the two trading boundaries vary with\ntransaction costs. We reveal that the cost-adjusted trading boundaries are\nmonotone in transaction costs. Our result indicates that (i) the Merton line\nmust lie between two cost-adjusted trading boundaries; (ii) when the Merton\nline is positive, the buy boundary and the sell boundary are monotone in\ntransaction costs and the Merton line lies in the no-trading region as a\nresult.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"RwgPQR0X4FqcCN--yBFFmwvngC3YE7prI6k_I6-3qL8","pdfSize":"225343"}
