By showing a\none-to-one correspondence between Lagrangian $A$-branes with compact support\nand finite-dimensional representations of the spherical DAHA, we provide\nevidence of derived equivalence between the $A$-brane category of\n$\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{C})$-character variety of a four-punctured sphere and\nthe representation category of DAHA of $C^\\vee C_1$. The $D_4$ root system\nplays an essential role in understanding both the geometry and representation\ntheory. In particular, this $A$-model approach reveals the action of an affine\nbraid group of type $D_4$ on the category. As a by-product, our geometric\ninvestigation offers detailed information about the low-energy effective\ndynamics of the SU(2) $N_f=4$ Seiberg-Witten theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Representation Theory","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NpWDnX0eiwmUC9jcX0L211GNkINOuFpAxOnx1d9lSpE","pdfSize":"4610818"}
