In consequence, this survey provides a\nsystematic analysis of this field, outlining the evolution of image processing\nmethods in the context of TRUS image analysis and meanwhile highlighting their\nrelevant contributions. Furthermore, this survey discusses current challenges\nand suggests future research directions to possibly advance this field further.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IsvpWCtcJ0PvXKurQ4XV-0_juGh1gH2cfE-a-5UryYg","pdfSize":"3454171"}
