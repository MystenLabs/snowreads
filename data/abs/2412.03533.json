  "abstract": "  Young and forming planetesimals experience impacts from particles present in\na protostellar disk. Using crater scaling laws, we integrate ejecta\ndistributions for oblique impacts. For impacts at 10 to 65 m/s, expected for\nimpacts associated with a disk wind, we estimate the erosion rate and torque\nexerted on the planetesimal. We find that the mechanism for angular momentum\ndrain proposed by Dobrovolskis and Burns (1984) for asteroids could operate in\nthe low velocity regime of a disk wind. Though spin-down associated with\nimpacts can facilitate planetesimal collapse, we find that the process is\ninefficient. We find that angular momentum drain via impacts operates in the\ngravitational focusing regime, though even less efficiently than for lower mass\nplanetesimals. The angular momentum transfer is most effective when the wind\nspeed is low, the projectile density is high compared to the bulk planetesimal\ndensity, and the planetesimal is composed of low-strength material. Due to its\ninefficiency, we find that angular momentum drain due to impacts within a\npebble cloud does not by itself facilitate collapse of single planetesimals.\n",
