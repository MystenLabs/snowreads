It is widely believed\nthat the bilayer apical oxygens play an important role in the bilayer\nLa$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ electronic structure. Applying the hybrid\nexchange-correlation functionals, we obtain a more accurate electronic\nstructure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at its high-pressure phase, where the binding\n$d_{z^2}$ band is below the Fermi level owing to apical oxygen. The symmetry\nproperties of this electronic structure and its corresponding tight-binding\nmodel are further analyzed. We find the antisymmetric part is highly entangled\nleading to a minimal nearly degenerate two-orbital model. Then, the apical\noxygen vacancies effect is studied using the dynamical cluster approximation.\nThis disorder effect strongly destroys the antisymmetric $\\beta$ Fermi surface\nleading to the possible disappearance of superconductivity.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"S0_qok7zCBLFkXHTK6t3qLZMD3VRt3r3RJ1qtceAeAQ","pdfSize":"2387573"}
