In this\nwork, we explore the efficiency of Depthwise Separable Convolutions in radar\nobject detection networks and integrate them into our model. Additionally, we\nintroduce a novel Feature Enhancement and Compression (FEC) module to the\nPointPillars feature encoder to further improve the model performance. With\nthese innovations, we propose the DSFEC-L model and its two versions, which\noutperform the baseline (23.9 mAP of Car class, 20.72 GFLOPs) on nuScenes\ndataset: 1). An efficient DSFEC-M model with a 14.6% performance improvement\nand a 60% reduction in GFLOPs. 2). A deployable DSFEC-S model with a 3.76%\nperformance improvement and a remarkable 78.5% reduction in GFLOPs. Despite\nmarginal performance gains, our deployable model achieves an impressive 74.5%\nreduction in runtime on the Raspberry Pi compared to the baseline.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RN-8tmd1SMh9rws01VNow4iMYviQZhhYD-tJlxlBzhk","pdfSize":"3233300"}
