Consequently, the magnetic energy reaches a state of non-linear\nsaturation. Here, we investigate the role played by helical and non-helical\ndrives in the triggering and the eventual saturation of a self-consistent\ndynamo. Evidence of small-scale dynamo (SSD) activity is found for both helical\nand non-helical forcing, driven at the largest possible scale. Based on the\nspectrum analysis, we find that the evolution of kinetic energy follows\nKolmogorov's $k^-{\\frac{5}{3}}$ law while that of magnetic energy follows\nKazantsev's $k^{\\frac{3}{2}}$ scaling. Also, we have verified that the\naforementioned scalings remain valid for various magnetic Prandtl numbers (Pm).\nStatistical analysis is found to support our numerical finds.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zuz088kn_DiGv6udvq-d1EtiBJ56OjeVPYA5rBfnPao","pdfSize":"26159138"}
