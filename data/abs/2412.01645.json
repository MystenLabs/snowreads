We assume that the noise is nondegenerate and the drift lies\nin the Besov-H\\\"older space $\\mathcal{C}^\\alpha$ for some $\\alpha>1-1/(2H)$.\nThe latter condition matches the one of the additive noise case, thereby\nproviding a multiplicative analogue of Catellier-Gubinelli in the regime\n$H\\in(1/3,1/2)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZK1Oziw-j5vUtkhTGMfGVr_EKQbvYxahlRuiQKpkqHY","pdfSize":"707137"}
