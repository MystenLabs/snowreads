Rev. D 62,084003 (2000)], whereas an improved equation\n(referred to as OB equation) has been derived by Bozza [Phys. Rev. D 78, 103005\n(2008)] based on a relation found by Ohanian [Am. J. Phys. 55, 428 (1987)]. The\nOB equation was rediscovered later by Takizawa, Ono and Asada [Phys. Rev. D,\n102, 064060 (2020)]. VE and OB equations seem to be very different from each\nother. The present paper shows that there exists an unphysical branch in the VE\nequation. Consequently, the VE equation can be improved by removing the\nunphysical branch. The improved version of the VE equation is found to be the\nsame as the OB equation when a suitable transformation is made between the\ndeflection angles defined differently in the two formulations. An explicit\nexpression of the transformation is found. We also argue possible numerical\ndifferences when the transformation between the deflection angles is ignored.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dV4v4TA3dHcLRI_MOkSUgapghq2tm41o_3mCueBGCEc","pdfSize":"1255721","objectId":"0xb5183e3fa04915ed8b703ce8bf80edad081ec2c83a3bf57a0a4e88c2eb169ed2","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
