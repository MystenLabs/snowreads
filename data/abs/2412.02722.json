Building on the strengths of the\noriginal N-BEATS architecture, which excels in handling complex time series\ndata without requiring preprocessing or domain-specific knowledge, N-BEATS*\nintroduces two key modifications. (1) A novel loss function -- combining\npinball loss based on MAPE with normalized MSE, the new loss function allows\nfor a more balanced approach by capturing both L1 and L2 loss terms. (2) A\nmodified block architecture -- the internal structure of the N-BEATS blocks is\nadjusted by introducing a destandardization component to harmonize the\nprocessing of different time series, leading to more efficient and less complex\nforecasting tasks. Evaluated on real-world monthly electricity consumption data\nfrom 35 European countries, N-BEATS* demonstrates superior performance compared\nto its predecessor and other established forecasting methods, including\nstatistical, machine learning, and hybrid models. N-BEATS* achieves the lowest\nMAPE and RMSE, while also exhibiting the lowest dispersion in forecast errors.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"iSmc5O2kAFG8pi9SUmwKl5eEgvZ1BBzMB7M692RsH6Q","pdfSize":"643412"}
