  "abstract": "  Dually flat statistical manifolds provide a rich toolbox for investigations\naround the learning process. We prove that such manifolds are Monge-Amp\\`ere\nmanifolds. Examples of such manifolds include the space of exponential\nprobability distributions on finite sets and the Boltzmann manifolds. Our\ninvestigations of Boltzmann manifolds lead us to prove that Monge-Amp\\`ere\noperators control learning methods for Boltzmann machines. Using local trivial\nfibrations (webs) we demonstrate that on such manifolds the webs are\nparallelizable and can be constructed using a generalisation of Ceva's theorem.\nAssuming that our domain satisfies certain axioms of 2D topological quantum\nfield theory we show that locally the learning can be defined on hexagonal\nstructures. This brings a new geometric perspective for defining the optimal\nlearning process.\n",
