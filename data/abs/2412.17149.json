However, optimizing these\nsystems often requires labor-intensive, manual adjustments to refine roles,\ntasks, and interactions. This paper introduces a framework for autonomously\noptimizing Agentic AI solutions across industries, such as NLP-driven\nenterprise applications. The system employs agents for Refinement, Execution,\nEvaluation, Modification, and Documentation, leveraging iterative feedback\nloops powered by an LLM (Llama 3.2-3B). The framework achieves optimal\nperformance without human input by autonomously generating and testing\nhypotheses to improve system configurations. This approach enhances scalability\nand adaptability, offering a robust solution for real-world applications in\ndynamic environments. Case studies across diverse domains illustrate the\ntransformative impact of this framework, showcasing significant improvements in\noutput quality, relevance, and actionability.
