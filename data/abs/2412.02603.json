Traditionally, reflective skills are cultivated through\nstructured feedback, mentorship, and guided self-assessment. However, these\napproaches often face challenges such as limited scalability, difficulties in\ndelivering individualized feedback, and a shortage of instructors proficient in\nfacilitating meaningful reflection. This study pioneers the exploration of\ngenerative AI, specifically large language models (LLMs), as an innovative\nsolution to these limitations. By leveraging the capacity of LLMs to provide\npersonalized, context-sensitive feedback at scale, this research examines their\npotential to serve as effective facilitators of reflective exercises,\nmaintaining the depth of engagement and promoting critical thinking. Through an\nin-depth analysis of prompt engineering strategies and the efficacy of LLMs in\nsimulated multi-turn dialogues between tutors and students, this study\ndemonstrates that, with pedagogically aligned prompts, LLMs can function as\naccessible and adaptive tools for automating reflective guidance and\nobjectively assessing the performance of both tutors and students. This work\nalso contributes to the evolving understanding of AI's role in reflective\npedagogy and highlights new possibilities for AI-driven intelligent tutoring\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5wb3gy-gBsL0KaU-FX6YHURWe6sZu2tYIGaYxS5-y0w","pdfSize":"890010"}
