RAG systems enhance\ngenerative models by incorporating relevant information retrieved from external\nknowledge bases, improving the factual accuracy and contextual relevance of\ngenerated responses. The size of the text chunks retrieved and processed is a\ncritical factor influencing RAG performance. This study aims to identify the\noptimal chunk size that maximizes answer generation quality. Through systematic\nexperimentation, we analyze the effects of varying chunk sizes on the\nefficiency and effectiveness of RAG frameworks. Our findings reveal that an\noptimal chunk size balances the trade-off between providing sufficient context\nand minimizing irrelevant information. These insights are crucial for enhancing\nthe design and implementation of RAG systems, underscoring the importance of\nselecting an appropriate chunk size to achieve superior performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"nbWcLBfb1FSgR4LDpSHEeOxhxm4RoMCeJw2S7Kl5s-M","pdfSize":"2671907"}
