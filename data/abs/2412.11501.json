This paper experimentally\nevaluates the performance of the explicit graduated optimization algorithm with\nan optimal noise scheduling derived from a previous study and discusses its\nlimitations. It uses traditional benchmark functions and empirical loss\nfunctions for modern neural network architectures for evaluating. In addition,\nthis paper extends the implicit graduated optimization algorithm, which is\nbased on the fact that stochastic noise in the optimization process of SGD\nimplicitly smooths the objective function, to SGD with momentum, analyzes its\nconvergence, and demonstrates its effectiveness through experiments on image\nclassification tasks with ResNet architectures.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"P7S3BcJZBIu1iTUQI-tz1jodQoYa_FNeCn0bpctftTE","pdfSize":"4463558"}
