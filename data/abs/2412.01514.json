The\nwell-definedness of our definition in particular resolves a problem by Zuther.\nFurthermore, we extend our notion of end degree to also respect, among others,\nthe vertices dominating the end, which we denote as combined end degree. Our\nmain result is a characterisation of the combined end degree in terms of\ncertain sequences of vertices, which we call end-exhausting sequences. This\nestablishes a similar, although more complex relationship as known for the\ncombined end degree and end-defining sequences in undirected graphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZI4fa6mFqJGzYf4nBUtZ7jRBSeDRf0o3tVvmprU7PUA","pdfSize":"507022"}
