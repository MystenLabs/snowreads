Such a baking\nprocess is typically performed in a dedicated oven. In this paper the\nexperimental investigation is described, whether an appropriate heating of an\nelliptical 9-cell 1.3 GHz TESLA cavity is feasible using rf power, which would\nbe a pre-condition for a processing done fully in-situ without the need of\ncostly and risky dismantling / remounting operations. It is demonstrated that\nsuch a heating is possible, whilst complicated by uneven heating rates in the\nindividual cavity cells.\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"8tWsACjZqys1LZglkCW0XFgRoeSYXcDVRpCdwGKs9bA","pdfSize":"8424481"}
