Due to its significance as the primary source of\nhigh-frequency GWs in the solar system, we reexamine this phenomenon\nhighlighting some physical processes, including the contribution of macroscopic\nhydrodynamic fluctuations. Our analysis builds upon several studies of axion\nemission from the Sun, particularly in relation to the treatment of plasma\neffects. Similar to many well-motivated Early Universe signals, we find that\nthe resulting GW spectrum is several orders of magnitude below the current\nsensitivities of axion helioscopes such as (Baby)IAXO.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Mi1GeiXePUWXrt9P7oUuYEMiG7gC_nczzHieSknKTlc","pdfSize":"754493"}
