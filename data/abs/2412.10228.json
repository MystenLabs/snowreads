  "abstract": "  Entanglement and stabilizer entropy are both involved in the onset of complex\nbehavior in quantum many-body systems. Their interplay is at the root of\ncomplexity of simulability, scrambling, thermalization and typicality. In this\nwork, we study the dynamics of entanglement, stabilizer entropy, and a novel\nquantity assessing their interplay - called anti-flatness, after a quantum\nquench of a spin chain. We find that free-fermion theories show a gap in the\nlong-time behavior of these resources compared to their random matrix theory\nvalue while non-integrable models saturate it.\n",
