If $X_1$ and $X_2$ are graphs with\nrespective adjacency matrices $A_1$ and $A_2$ and degree matrices $D_1$ and\n$D_2$, we say that $X_1$ and $X_2$ are degree similar if there is an invertible\nreal matrix $M$ such that $M^{-1}A_1M=A_2$ and $M^{-1}D_1M=D_2$. If graphs\n$X_1$ and $X_2$ are degree similar, then their adjacency matrices, Laplacian\nmatrices, unsigned Laplacian matrices and normalized Laplacian matrices are\nsimilar. We first show that the converse is not true. Then, we provide a number\nof constructions of degree-similar graphs. Finally, we show that the matrices\n$A_1-\\mu D_1$ and $A_2-\\mu D_2$ are similar over the field of rational\nfunctions $\\mathbb{Q}(\\mu)$ if and only if the Smith normal forms of the\nmatrices $tI-(A_1-\\mu D_1)$ and $tI-(A_2-\\mu D_2)$ are equal.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-eYaaqFelCvDw_BPUBSRNi09zTp5EM1BnzNvwNa12I8","pdfSize":"563139","objectId":"0x3a6c47413ef6d0b9947b3e1ffcbf98eb3c79b446111ddd16b949f3874c60219b","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
