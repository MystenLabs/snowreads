  "abstract": "  Heavy Neutral Leptons (HNLs) provide a compelling extension to the Standard\nModel, addressing the neutrino masses, baryogenesis, and dark matter problems.\nWe perform a model-independent collider study, decoupling the active-sterile\nmixing angle ($V$) from the Yukawa coupling ($y$), and explore sensitivities at\nthe HL-LHC for prompt and displaced decays. We also consider the possibility of\nHNLs being long-lived particles decaying in far detectors as FASER. In\naddition, we study the expected reach at FCC-ee for the prompt and displaced\ncases. For zero mixing, FCC-ee and HL-LHC sensitivities to $y$ are comparable,\nwith Higgs width measurements imposing the strongest constraints. With non-zero\nmixing, sensitivities are dominated by $V$, significantly constraining\nparameter space. This work highlights the importance of precision Higgs studies\nand displaced searches in probing HNLs at current and future colliders.\n",
