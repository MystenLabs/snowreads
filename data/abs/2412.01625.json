PDE, 2018) to a more general\nsetting. Their approach essentially exploits that such equations correspond to\ndiscrete problems on an abstract underlying graph. However, a specific\ncondition they assume can be rather restricting in some settings, which\nmotivates the generalization we propose. We still get an Aubry set, which plays\nthe role of a uniqueness set for our problem and appears in the representation\nof solutions. Exploiting it we establish a new comparison principle between\nsuper and subsolutions to the equation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nJNQmk8R-aoGO1shHlvSu1sBtl2zSeijCKJSNdyuAHI","pdfSize":"615725"}
