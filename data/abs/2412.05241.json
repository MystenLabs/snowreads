  "abstract": "  In this paper, we study simultaneous determination of the strain hardening\nexponent, the shear modulus and the yield stress in an inverse problem. First,\nwe analyze the direct and the inverse problems. Then we formulate the inverse\nproblem in the Bayesian framework. After solving the direct problem by an\niterative approach, we propose a numerical method based on a Bayesian approach\nfor the numerical solution of the inverse problem. Numerical examples with\nnoisy data illustrate applicability and accuracy of the proposed method to some\nextent.\\\n",
