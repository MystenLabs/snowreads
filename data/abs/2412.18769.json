The\ngravitational potential is driven by a mass density assumed to be proportional\nto the probability density of the scalar. Unlike related calculations for\ncondensates of ultralight dark matter or boson stars, no assumption of\nspherical symmetry is made for the effective gravitational potential. Instead,\nthe potential has only axial symmetry, consistent with the axial symmetry of\nthe particle's probability density for eigenstates of $L_z$. With total angular\nmomentum no longer a good quantum number, there are in general contributions\nfrom a range of partial waves. This permits us to study the partial-wave\ncontent of self-consistent solutions of the Schr\\\"odinger-Newton system.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sdz9obo-a6aXOY2eqmt__9i13852SnaECW7Ro2kucdA","pdfSize":"343323"}
