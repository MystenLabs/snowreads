  "abstract": "  A search for heavy neutral gauge bosons (Z') decaying into a pair of tau\nleptons is performed in proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV at the\nCERN LHC. The data were collected with the CMS detector and correspond to an\nintegrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. The observations are found to be in\nagreement with the expectation from standard model processes. Limits at 95%\nconfidence level are set on the product of the Z' production cross section and\nits branching fraction to tau lepton pairs for a range of Z' boson masses. For\na narrow resonance in the sequential standard model scenario, a Z' boson with a\nmass below 3.5 TeV is excluded. This is the most stringent limit to date from\nthis type of search.\n",
