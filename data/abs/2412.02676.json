Building on recent advances in planning\nthrough contacts, we introduce Generalizable Planning-Guided Diffusion Policy\nLearning (GLIDE), an approach that effectively learns to solve contact-rich\nbimanual manipulation tasks by leveraging model-based motion planners to\ngenerate demonstration data in high-fidelity physics simulation. Through\nefficient planning in randomized environments, our approach generates\nlarge-scale and high-quality synthetic motion trajectories for tasks involving\ndiverse objects and transformations. We then train a task-conditioned diffusion\npolicy via behavior cloning using these demonstrations. To tackle the\nsim-to-real gap, we propose a set of essential design options in feature\nextraction, task representation, action prediction, and data augmentation that\nenable learning robust prediction of smooth action sequences and generalization\nto unseen scenarios. Through experiments in both simulation and the real world,\nwe demonstrate that our approach can enable a bimanual robotic system to\neffectively manipulate objects of diverse geometries, dimensions, and physical\nproperties.
