Firstly, we prove the local existence\nand uniqueness of the solution by the semigroup method. Secondly, we establish\nthe global existence, the energy decay estimate and the blow-up in finite time\nof the solution with subcritial ($E(0)<d$) and critial ($E(0)=d$) initial\nenergy level by constructing potential wells. We also show that the solution is\nglobal provided the damping dominates the source (that is $m\\geq p$). Moreover,\nwe prove the blow-up in finite time of the solution with arbitrary positive\ninitial energy and give some necessary and sufficient condition for existing\nfinite time blow-up solutions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"r97Cn-FYRf2ymEM_o9-kpiPd1LWddDaIPtSueL_9EZM","pdfSize":"380222"}
