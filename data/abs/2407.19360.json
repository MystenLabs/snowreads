Here, we\nintroduce an onchip, millimeter scale, 7 m spiral resonator that is made of\nultralow loss silicon nitride to act as a frequency ruler for correction of the\ntunable lasers sweeping nonlinearities. The sharp 2 MHz frequency lines of the\n85 M high-quality resonator and the narrow spaced 25.57 MHz frequency ticks of\nthe 7 m spiral allow unprecedented precise nonlinearity correction on an\nintegrated photonics platform. Accurate measurements of the rulers frequency\nspacing, linewidth, and temperature and wavelength sensitivities of the\nfrequency ticks are performed here to demonstrate the quality of the frequency\nruler. In addition, the spiral resonator is implemented in an FMCW LiDAR\nexperiment to demonstrate a potential application of the proposed onchip\nfrequency ruler.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"6zRw8MHS9YIxhtRdpSnCQ20lYVeBsIvL8NIlJ547H6Y","pdfSize":"1028965"}
