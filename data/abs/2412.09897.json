Global polarization measurements of\n$\\bar{\\Lambda}$ and $\\Lambda$ show no significant differences, offering\ninsights into the late-stage evolution of the magnetic field. The new\nmeasurements of the local polarization of $\\Lambda$ perpendicular to the\nreaction plane ($\\langle P_{2,y} \\rangle$) shows a monotonic increase with\ndecreasing collision energy, while the component along the beam direction\n($\\langle P_{2,z} \\rangle$) for both $\\Lambda$ and $\\bar{\\Lambda}$ is small in\nmagnitude with no strong energy dependence. The net local polarization\nobservable, $\\langle P_{2,y}^{net} \\rangle =\\langle P_{2,y}(\\Lambda) \\rangle -\n\\langle P_{2,y}(\\bar{\\Lambda})\\rangle$ and $\\langle P_{2,z}^{net} \\rangle =\n\\langle P_{2,z}(\\Lambda) \\rangle - \\langle P_{2,z}(\\bar{\\Lambda} \\rangle)$\ndesigned to probe baryonic spin Hall effect, is consistent with zero with large\nuncertainty.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"wcEgAjx81cWKCn--yBINaQfjci0JV2HtRVKsVuRPun0","pdfSize":"1307628"}
