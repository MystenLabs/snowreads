Hence,\nultrafast X-ray and electron imaging tools have been developed to probe the\ndynamics of matter by means of the time-resolved diffraction imaging (TRDI). In\nthis work, we report an extension of the theory underlying the TRDI to the case\nof the laser-driven electron dynamics in solid state systems. We demonstrate\nthat the TRDI signal encodes an essential information about the time-dependent\nelectron density of the system under study and thus makes it possible to\ndecipher the ultrafast quantum dynamics and the electron transfer phenomena in\nsolids. We apply the developed approach to image the laser-driven electron\ndynamics in neutral graphene showing that the predictions made by the fully\nquantum version of the TRDI deviate significantly from those obtained with the\nconventional semiclassical approach.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aPPNIeXLio66nJ_ubfy3w1OvkUN_B03JQ17yuS0Ah5o","pdfSize":"11554351"}
