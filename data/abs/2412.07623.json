  "abstract": "  Verifying the proper preparation of quantum states is essential in modern\nquantum information science. Various protocols have been developed to estimate\nthe fidelity of quantum states produced by different parties. Direct fidelity\nestimation is a leading approach, as it typically requires a number of\nmeasurements that scale linearly with the Hilbert space dimension, making it\nfar more efficient than full state tomography. In this article, we introduce a\nnovel fidelity estimation protocol for generic quantum states, with an overall\ncomputational cost that scales only as the square root of the Hilbert space\ndimension. Furthermore, our protocol significantly reduces the number of\nrequired measurements and the communication cost between parties to finite.\nThis protocol leverages the quantum amplitude estimation algorithm in\nconjunction with classical shadow tomography to achieve these improvements.\n",
