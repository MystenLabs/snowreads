  "abstract": "  Efficient storage of telecom-band quantum optical information represents a\ncrucial milestone for establishing distributed quantum optical networks. Erbium\nions in crystalline hosts provide a promising platform for telecom quantum\nmemories; however, their practical applications have been hindered by demanding\noperational conditions, such as ultra-high magnetic fields and ultra-low\ntemperatures. In this work, we demonstrate the storage of telecom photonic\nqubits encoded in polarization, frequency, and time-bin bases. Using the atomic\nfrequency comb protocol in an Er$^{3+}$-doped crystal, we developed a memory\ninitialization scheme that improves storage efficiency by over an order of\nmagnitude under practical experimental conditions. Quantum process tomography\nfurther confirms the memory's performance, achieving a fidelity exceeding 92%.\n",
