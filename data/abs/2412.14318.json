  "abstract": "  Filtering is concerned with online estimation of the state of a dynamical\nsystem from partial and noisy observations. In applications where the state is\nhigh dimensional, ensemble Kalman filters are often the method of choice. This\npaper establishes long-time accuracy of ensemble Kalman filters. We introduce\nconditions on the dynamics and the observations under which the estimation\nerror remains small in the long-time horizon. Our theory covers a wide class of\npartially-observed chaotic dynamical systems, which includes the Navier-Stokes\nequations and Lorenz models. In addition, we prove long-time accuracy of\nensemble Kalman filters with surrogate dynamics, thus validating the use of\nmachine-learned forecast models in ensemble data assimilation.\n",
