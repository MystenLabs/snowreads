  "abstract": "  In the domain of autonomous vehicles, the human-vehicle co-pilot system has\ngarnered significant research attention. To address the subjective\nuncertainties in driver state and interaction behaviors, which are pivotal to\nthe safety of Human-in-the-loop co-driving systems, we introduce a novel\nvisual-tactile perception method. Utilizing a driving simulation platform, a\ncomprehensive dataset has been developed that encompasses multi-modal data\nunder fatigue and distraction conditions. The experimental setup integrates\ndriving simulation with signal acquisition, yielding 600 minutes of fatigue\ndetection data from 15 subjects and 102 takeover experiments with 17 drivers.\nThe dataset, synchronized across modalities, serves as a robust resource for\nadvancing cross-modal driver behavior perception algorithms.\n",
