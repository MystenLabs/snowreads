The MPSP can be used for teaching mathematics\nand mathematical reasoning authentically. It can be used across courses to\ndevelop problem solving skills that can be generalized beyond the course and\ntopic. It has a specific focus on documentation and communication that lets\nstudents leverage skills they grow, and use, in other courses or fields. The\nMPSP can be used in singleton (service) courses, throughout a curriculum,\nand/or within a capstone experience.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/History and Overview"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"iWdDBmYgkiRTHDKbhGtb9Y0aohojwiYYqZ2OogL9sNM","pdfSize":"395671"}
