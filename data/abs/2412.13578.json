  "abstract": "  With the growth of social media and large language models, content moderation\nhas become crucial. Many existing datasets lack adequate representation of\ndifferent groups, resulting in unreliable assessments. To tackle this, we\npropose a socio-culturally aware evaluation framework for LLM-driven content\nmoderation and introduce a scalable method for creating diverse datasets using\npersona-based generation. Our analysis reveals that these datasets provide\nbroader perspectives and pose greater challenges for LLMs than\ndiversity-focused generation methods without personas. This challenge is\nespecially pronounced in smaller LLMs, emphasizing the difficulties they\nencounter in moderating such diverse content.\n",
