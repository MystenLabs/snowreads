Therefore,\nexperimental and theoretical studies of masses devoted to r-process\napplications, such as the nucleosynthesis in the ejecta of neutron star\nmergers, should focus on the physical origin of local changes in mass trends\nwithout necessarily providing highly accurate mass determinations of individual\nnuclei.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fo8iCMRzynZtVmRQthjfSzvLewoUViJzy5aPv-Fy6DI","pdfSize":"397605"}
