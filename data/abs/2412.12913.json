This study reports on a novel\nmicroshear geometry, and demonstrates its applicability for testing the\nstrength and deformation behavior of IM-metal interfaces in Mg-Al-Ca alloys, a\nkey material for light weight automotive applications. The shear tests are\napplied to a model bi-layered system grown by magnetron sputtering, comprising\nof a CaMg2 film deposited onto a Mg layer. A parametric study was performed\nusing finite element modeling to optimize the specimen dimensions.\nSubsequently, in situ microshear tests conducted inside a scanning electron\nmicroscope revealed an interface shear strength of ~136 MPa, and provided\ninsights into the stages of deformation progression. Post mortem examination of\nthe sheared interface revealed an irregular surface indicating ductile\ndeformation at room temperature.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Snp9QEx74CQ_WAOZGjXW3QdUtZ7Kdp0IFe_I_QpbnL4","pdfSize":"1099088"}
