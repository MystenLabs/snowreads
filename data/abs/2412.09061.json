Then for $m = 0$, we establish the\nfollowing decay estimates of the solution operators:\n  $$\n  \\left\\|\\cos (t \\sqrt{H}) P_{ac}(H)\\right\\|_{L^1 \\rightarrow L^{\\infty}} +\n  \\left\\|\\frac{\\sin (t \\sqrt{H})}{t \\sqrt{H}} P_{ac}(H)\\right\\|_{L^1\n\\rightarrow L^{\\infty}} \\lesssim |t|^{-\\frac{1}{2}}.\n  $$ But for $m \\neq 0$, the solutions have different time decay estimates from\nthe case where $m=0$. Specifically, the $L^1$-$L^\\infty$ estimates of $\\cos (t\n\\sqrt{H + m^2})$ and $\\frac{\\sin (t \\sqrt{H + m^2})}{\\sqrt{H + m^2}}$ are\nbounded by $O(|t|^{-\\frac{1}{4}})$ in the low-energy part and\n$O(|t|^{-\\frac{1}{2}})$ in the high-energy part.\n  It is noteworthy that all these results remain consistent with the free cases\n(i.e., $V = 0$) whatever zero is a regular point or a resonance of $H$. As\nconsequences, we establish the corresponding Strichartz estimates, which are\nfundamental to study nonlinear problems of beam equations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5N3Txe0M-yHuvi_m_9oxrVlAEV59SpKVyzj3G9mdfEI","pdfSize":"395419"}
