  "abstract": "  We use the Grassmann tensor renormalization group method to investigate the\n$N_f=2$ Schwinger model with the staggered fermions in the presence of a $2\\pi$\nperiodic $\\theta$ term in a broad range of mass. The method allows us to deal\nwith the massive staggered fermions straightforwardly and to study the $\\theta$\ndependence of the free energy and topological charge in the thermodynamic\nlimit. Our calculation provides consistent results with not only the analytical\nsolution in the large mass limit but also the previous Monte Carlo studies in\nthe small mass regime. Our numerical results also suggest that the $N_f=2$\nSchwinger model on a lattice has a different phase structure, than the model in\nthe continuum limit.\n",
