The tool based on Fourier analysis makes it easy to\nfind wavenumber explicit order of convergence, and can be used for rigorous\nproof. It fills in the gap between the dispersion analysis and the actual error\nwith source term.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-Z_lDn8Wf1NV8F2rkt1crTyE4D_lUi2C8Ez6kMpWn34","pdfSize":"3336068"}
