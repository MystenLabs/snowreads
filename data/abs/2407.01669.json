The main feature of the\nprotocol is the coupling between the particle and an ancillary spin-1/2 degree\nof freedom. This allows us to reconstruct tomographically the scattering\namplitudes, which are in general complex numbers, from the readout of one\nqubit. Applications of our results are discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KRBU96r5fwfBvGcVWVAZycL5QUvssWhMGBogGDbSesI","pdfSize":"779135"}
