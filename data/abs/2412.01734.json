We show that such\ninterpretation cannot be reconciled with a phenomenologically viable minimal\nversion of such scenario, while it can be allowed if one considers an equally\nviable but generalised, non-minimal version of pre-big bang evolution.\nMaintaining the $S$-duality symmetry throughout the high-curvature string phase\nis possible although somewhat disfavoured. The implications of this non-minimal\nscenario for the power spectrum of curvature perturbations are also briefly\ndiscussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_D0Lr3h9UiJTfPU0Uoh7VXfkvn6X0LQmLK82UXOniv4","pdfSize":"5043603"}
