One new\n$\\gamma$-ray transition and indications for an additional two were found,\nallowing for a glimpse at the level scheme beyond the known $2^+_1$ state. The\nnature of the new $1900(4)$-keV transition is discussed in the context of the\nknown energy spectrum of the mirror nucleus $^{32}$Si and shell-model\ncalculations using the FSU and SDPF-M cross-shell effective interactions. Its\nresulting parent state at $3767(5)$ keV, more than $1.3$ MeV above the proton\nseparation energy, is tentatively assigned to have mixed sd-shell and $2p$-$2h$\ncharacter. It might either be the mirror of the $J^{\\pi}=2^+_2$ state of\n$^{32}$Si at $4230.8(8)$ keV, but with a decay branch favoring a transition to\nthe $2^+_1$ over the ground state, or the mirror of the $4983.9(11)$-keV state\nwith quantum numbers $0^+$. The resulting mirror-energy differences of\n$-473(5)$ and $-1218(5)$ keV are both sizable when compared to systematics; in\nthe latter case it would, in fact, be among the largest reported to date in the\nentire nuclear chart or suggest the potential existence of an additional,\nhitherto unidentified, low-lying $0^+$ state of $^{32}$Si.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"lMQI0nGDxO9Ah9eWN04qlED_sqUwVcOHqqCYVGtrkxQ","pdfSize":"432908"}
