  "abstract": "  We invoke probe brane arguments to classify the asymptotic behavior of\ngeneral five-dimensional supergravity theories with eight supercharges near\ninfinite distance boundaries of the vector multiplet moduli space. Imposing\nconsistency of supergravity strings we derive several constraints on the\nChern-Simons couplings entering the prepotential, including their\nnon-negativity. This establishes a classification of infinite distance limits\nanalogous to those for theories obtained as Calabi-Yau compactifications, but\nwithout having to assume a geometric or string theoretic origin. All infinite\ndistance limits are found to be either vector or tensor limits, depending on\nthe nature of the gauge potential becoming weakly coupled at the fastest rate.\nIn particular, we prove uniqueness results for the asymptotically leading gauge\nfields. The asymptotic physics along these limits is in perfect agreement with\nthe predictions of the Emergent String Conjecture and hence serves as bottom-up\nevidence for the latter. Our findings imply that every consistent\nfive-dimensional ${\\cal N}=1$ supergravity with a non-compact vector multiplet\nmoduli space either descends from six dimensions or contains a stringy\nsubsector.\n",
