A related observation is that in the presence of gauge fields with\nnontrivial topology, fermion zeromodes will appear embedded in the extra\ndimension which do not decouple from the four-dimensional world. Here we show\nthat these problems can be evaded by simulating the theory in the trivial\ntopological sector of the boundary gauge fields. A regulated version of the\nStandard Model using this approach in the continuum and large volume limits is\nexpected to appear as if it possessed a Peccei-Quinn mechanism for relaxing\n$\\theta_\\text{QCD}$ to zero, without there being an axion in the spectrum.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Vca-uxyPcCVI4yAt7b-wBWPXNAm-De77pAi0_7Rrvi4","pdfSize":"216974"}
