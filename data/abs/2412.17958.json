Focusing on the aligned spin configuration, we\nextract the corrections to Newton's potential at linear order in the\nperturbations, using the four-point amplitude of the massive spinning objects\nevaluated in the Post-Minkowskian expansion. We then derive the modifications\nto the quadrupole moments at leading order in the cubic perturbations, using a\nfive-point amplitude with emission of a soft graviton. These modified moments,\nalong with the corresponding potentials, are then employed to calculate the\npower emitted by gravitational waves during the inspiral phase. Using these\nresults, we determine the changes to the waveforms, up to linear order in spin,\nin the Stationary Phase Approximation. Finally, we comment on the relation\nbetween cubic and tidal perturbations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1zCSc_4Prqz-OsLeJpnuDPHv6nUsXDortQ1hj_mA1qM","pdfSize":"358131"}
