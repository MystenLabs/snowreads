Tor\\'an and W\\\"orz (TOCL 2023) showed that there is a\nresolution refutation of narrow width $k$ for two graphs if and only if they\ncan be distinguished in ($k+1$)-variable first-order logic (FO$^{k+1}$) and\nhence by a count-free variant of the $k$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman\nalgorithm. While DAG-like narrow width $k$ resolution refutations have size at\nmost $n^k$, tree-like refutations may be much larger. We show that there are\ngraphs of order n, whose isomorphism can be refuted in narrow width $k$ but\nonly in tree-like size $2^{\\Omega(n^{k/2})}$. This is a supercritical trade-off\nwhere bounding one parameter (the narrow width) causes the other parameter (the\nsize) to grow above its worst case. The size lower bound is super-exponential\nin the formula size and improves a related supercritical width versus tree-like\nsize trade-off by Razborov (JACM 2016). To prove our result, we develop a new\nvariant of the $k$-pebble EF-game for FO$^k$ to reason about tree-like\nrefutation size in a similar way as the Prover-Delayer games in proof\ncomplexity. We analyze this game on a modified variant of the compressed CFI\ngraphs introduced by Grohe, Lichter, Neuen, and Schweitzer (FOCS 2023). Using a\nrecent improved robust compressed CFI construction of Janett, Nordstr\\\"om, and\nPang (unpublished manuscript), we obtain a similar bound for width $k$ (instead\nof the stronger but less common narrow width) and make the result more robust.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cmc1Pa6wsGHxID5EsajBXCX0eJuEJRwgMJ_39lVjEv0","pdfSize":"437515"}
