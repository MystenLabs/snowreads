Nonetheless,\nconcurrency bugs have become a prevalent issue within Go, presenting a unique\nchallenge due to the language's dual concurrency mechanisms-communicating\nsequential processes and shared memory. Detecting concurrency bugs and\naccurately classifying program executions as pass or fail presents an immense\nchallenge, even for domain experts. We conducted a survey with expert\ndevelopers at Bytedance that confirmed this challenge. Our work seeks to\naddress the test oracle problem for Go programs, to automatically classify test\nexecutions as pass or fail. This problem has not been investigated in the\nliterature for Go programs owing to its distinctive programming model.\n  Our approach involves collecting both passing and failing execution traces\nfrom various subject Go programs. We capture a comprehensive array of execution\nevents using the native Go execution tracer. Subsequently, we preprocess and\nencode these traces before training a transformer-based neural network to\neffectively classify the traces as either passing or failing. The evaluation of\nour approach encompasses 8 subject programs sourced from the GoBench\nrepository. These subject programs are routinely used as benchmarks in an\nindustry setting. Encouragingly, our test oracle, Go-Oracle, demonstrates high\naccuracies even when operating with a limited dataset, showcasing the efficacy\nand potential of our methodology. Developers at Bytedance strongly agreed that\nthey would use the Go-Oracle tool over the current practice of manual\ninspections to classify tests for Go programs as pass or fail.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Software Engineering","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"uJEZzYVSR1FCtYD3-hch9R_RCA5pFu-xXMbSDG-PqOw","pdfSize":"375327"}
