However, the studies of structured optical tweezers are\nusually accompanied by complex theoretical models, strict simulation\nconditions, and uncertain experimental factors, which may bring about high time\ncosts and insufficiently precise results. In this work, we proposed a\nbidirectional neural network model for the analysis and design of OTs with\noptical vortices (OVs) as a typical structured light beam. In analyzing optical\nforces, the network can achieve over 98% accuracy and improve computational\nefficiency by more than 20 times. In further analyzing particle trajectories,\nthe network can also achieve over 95.5% accuracy. Meanwhile, in OTs with\nOV-like beams, our network can still predict particle motion behavior with a\nhigh accuracy of up to 96.2%. Our network can inversely design optical vortex\ntweezers on demand with 95.4% accuracy. In addition, the experimental results\nin OTs with plasmonic vortex can be analyzed by the proposed model, which can\nbe used to achieve arbitrary optical manipulation. Our work demonstrates that\nthe proposed deep learning network can provide an effective algorithmic\nplatform for the analysis and design of OTs, and is expected to promote the\napplication of OTs in biomedicine.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"R-ZvZ9hilJXmkHq1iCk6zQguCi4EzT2B6P-FyR9Wzoo","pdfSize":"1267954"}
