  "abstract": "  We report on molecular dynamics simulations of the atomic structure and\ndiffusion processes at Al(110)/Si(001) interphase boundary created by simulated\nvapor deposition of Al(Si) alloy onto Si(001) substrate. An array of parallel\nmisfit dislocations of both full and partial types is observed at the\ninterface. Si atoms segregate to the misfit dislocations, with segregation to\nfull dislocations being stronger. The interface diffusion is dominated by\nshort-circuit diffusion along the misfit dislocations, creating a significant\ndiffusion anisotropy. Diffusion of Al and Si atoms along the full misfit\ndislocations is faster than along the partial misfit dislocations. Due to the\npresence of the misfit dislocations, diffusion at the Al(110)/Si(001) interface\nstudied here is faster than diffusion at the Al(111)/Si(111) interfaces\ninvestigated in our previous work.\n",
