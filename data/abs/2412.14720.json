Digital\nphenotyping offers a unique opportunity to collect and analyze high-frequency\ndata in real time, capturing behavioral, psychological, and physiological\nstates of children in naturalistic settings. Traditional models of child growth\nprimarily focus on physical metrics, often overlooking multidimensional aspects\nsuch as emotional, social, and cognitive development. In this paper, we\nintroduce a Bayesian artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that leverages\ndigital phenotyping to create a Multidimensional Index of Child Growth (MICG).\nThis index integrates data from various dimensions of child development,\nincluding physical, emotional, cognitive, and environmental factors. By\nincorporating probabilistic modeling, the proposed algorithm dynamically\nupdates its learning based on data collected by the mobile app used by mothers\nand children. The app also infers uncertainty from response times, adjusting\nthe importance of each dimension of child growth accordingly. Our contribution\napplies state-of-the-art technology to track multidimensional child\ndevelopment, enabling families and healthcare providers to make more informed\ndecisions in real time.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"fpBPojoNbhqbl9PIe11a2Jw7UtBWdZ3X57X07YoKycE","pdfSize":"147421"}
