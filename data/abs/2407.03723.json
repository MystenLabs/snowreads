Specifically,\nwe show that upon light-induced solidification of the underlying medium,\nmicrotubule-kinesin motor mixtures first undergo a cascade of folding in on\nthemselves, which is then followed by a progressive formation of isotropic\nfluid domains, transforming the system into a biphasic active suspension. Using\nan active lyotropic model, we show that the two-stage transition in the system\nis governed by screening effects that become important upon substrate changes,\nleading to higher activity modes to become important. Specifically, the\ncombined effect of friction and quadrupolar activity leads to the hierarchical\nfolding that follows the intrinsic bend instability. Our results demonstrate\nthe dynamics of the collapse of orientational order in active nematics and\npresent a new route for controlling active matter by modifying the activity\nthrough changing the surrounding environment.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wLcrvC1mQAVqLxusp00zcMETmj4mF80d6ShhIi-w70k","pdfSize":"3010981"}
