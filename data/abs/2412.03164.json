On the one hand,\nthere are the Lebesgue constants of the Walsh function system that play an\nimportant role in approximation theory, and on the other hand there is the star\ndiscrepancy of the van der Corput sequence that plays a prominent role in\nuniform distribution theory. Over the decades, these two quantities have been\nexamined in great detail independently of each other and important results have\nbeen proven. Work in these areas has been carried out independently, but as we\nshow here, they actually coincide. Interestingly, many theorems have been\ndiscovered in both areas independently, but some results have only been known\nin one area but not in the other.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"doOg9SZkGBvYghbrB4KyT8RcUP2gNk5AB92HrLv7xHY","pdfSize":"114228"}
