In this paper we consider the partially\nordered set consisting of quadruples $(k,n,\\Pi_f,\\lambda)$ (or\n\\textit{(positroid) pairs} $(\\Pi_f,\\lambda)$ for short). The partial order is\nthe ordering given by the covering relation $\\lessdot$ where $(\\Pi_f',\\lambda')\n\\lessdot (\\Pi_f,\\lambda)$ if $\\Pi_f'$ is obtained by $\\Pi_f$ by\n\\textit{deletion} or \\textit{contraction.} Using the results of Snider [2010],\nwe know that positroid varieties can be studied in a neighborhood of each of\nthese points by \\textit{affine pipe dreams.} Our main theorem provides a quick\ntest of when a positroid variety is smooth at one of these given points. It is\nsufficient to test smoothness of a positroid variety by using the main result\nto test smoothness at each of these points. These results can also be applied\nto the question of whether Schubert varieties in flag manifolds are smooth at\npoints given by 321-avoiding permutations, as studied in Graham/Kreimer [2020].\nWe have a secondary result, which describes the minimal singular positroid\npairs in our ordering - these are the positroid pairs where any deletion or\ncontraction causes it to become smooth.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9mXl0yH7LY-N53z4VR7YSvQhMKoVzFjhkkO47MeCC3c","pdfSize":"1579152"}
