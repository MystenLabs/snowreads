We show that the flux\ndensity spectra of both populations are similarly steep, and the widths of MSP\npulsar profiles obey the same dependence on the rotational period as slow\npulsars. We also show that the polarization of MSPs has similar properties to\nslow pulsars. The commonly used pseudo-luminosity of pulsars, defined as the\nproduct of the flux density and the distance squared, is not appropriate for\ndrawing conclusions about the relative intrinsic radio luminosity of SPs and\nMSPs. We show that it is possible to scale the pseudo-luminosity to account for\nthe pulse duty cycle and the solid angle of the radio beam, in such a way that\nMSPs and SPs do not show clear differences in intrinsic luminosity. The data,\ntherefore, support common emission physics between the two populations in spite\nof orders of magnitude difference in their period derivatives and inferred,\nsurface, dipole magnetic field strengths.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"esd-NSIZ2IOuixQAYvJNoNtlD5bjFYxfWzp7v0djBIU","pdfSize":"928452"}
