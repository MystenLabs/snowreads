This linear matrix equation characterizes the\ncross-sectional steady-state covariance matrix of a Gaussian Markov process,\nand the trek rule links the graphical structure of the drift of the process to\nthe entries of this covariance matrix. In general, the trek rule is a power\nseries expansion of the covariance matrix, while for the special case where the\ndrift is acyclic, it simplifies to a polynomial in the off-diagonal entries of\nthe drift matrix. Using the trek rule we can give relatively explicit formulas\nfor the entries of the covariance matrix for some special cases of the drift\nmatrix. Furthermore, we use the trek rule to derive a new lower bound for the\nvariances in the acyclic case.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"f_THQGqhS42l32zbkc1a1TpvXZ682gq78Rg96CNlcak","pdfSize":"450104"}
