  "abstract": "  Accurately predicting sports viewership is crucial for optimizing ad sales\nand revenue forecasting. Social media platforms, such as Reddit, provide a\nwealth of user-generated content that reflects audience engagement and\ninterest. In this study, we propose a regression-based approach to predict\nsports viewership using social media metrics, including post counts, comments,\nscores, and sentiment analysis from TextBlob and VADER. Through iterative\nimprovements, such as focusing on major sports subreddits, incorporating\ncategorical features, and handling outliers by sport, the model achieved an\n$R^2$ of 0.99, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.27 million viewers, and a Root\nMean Squared Error (RMSE) of 2.33 million viewers on the full dataset. These\nresults demonstrate the model's ability to accurately capture patterns in\naudience behavior, offering significant potential for pre-event revenue\nforecasting and targeted advertising strategies.\n",
