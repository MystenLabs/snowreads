These inequalities\nextend classical results by incorporating weights given by convex,\nnon-decreasing positive functions, which are otherwise arbitrary. Our approach\ngives rise to a broad family of geometric inequalities, as each convex,\nnon-decreasing function yields a corresponding inequality, providing\nconsiderable flexibility.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"uanzO7__lz6sHl1K9087Cxl8G_V5BlgKSmPfAmF1yRM","pdfSize":"267399"}
