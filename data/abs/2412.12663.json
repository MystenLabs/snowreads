DNP in diamond proceeds through different\nDNP mechanisms with a possible temperature-dependence. We report on 13C dynamic\nnuclear polarization (DNP) experiments in diamonds at 3.4 T and 7 T between 300\nK and 1.7 K. Nuclear polarization enhancements between 100 and 600 were\nmeasured for all temperatures, corresponding to polarizations at 7 T between\n0.1% (300 K) and 38% (1.7 K). A strong temperature dependence of the DNP\nprofiles was observed. Longitudinal-detected (LOD) electron paramagnetic\nresonance (EPR) experiments revealed an additional broad temperature-dependent\nelectron line centered around the mI = 0 line of the P1 triplet transitions.\nOur results suggest that nuclei are preferentially polarized via a direct\nhyperfine mediated polarization transfer while spin diffusion in the sample\nplays a minor role.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3X11776iAEypvXNcQDwxjGm1GPSuqQHeQSx0CTfqZu4","pdfSize":"1629172"}
