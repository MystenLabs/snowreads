To evaluate algorithmic fairness, a new metric has been developed\nin education, namely the Model Absolute Density Distance (MADD). This metric\nenables us to measure how different a predictive model behaves regarding two\ngroups of students, in order to quantify its algorithmic unfairness. In this\npaper, we thus develop a post-processing method based on this metric, that aims\nat improving the fairness while preserving the accuracy of relevant predictive\nmodels' results. We experiment with our approach on the task of predicting\nstudent success in an online course, using both simulated and real-world\neducational data, and obtain successful results.
