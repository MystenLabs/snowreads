Imaging was performed using the recent forward modeling imaging method\neht-imaging, which achieved a resolution of 80 $\\mu$as, a factor of $\\sim$2-3\nbetter than traditional imaging methods such as CLEAN. The sequence of images\ndepicts the growth and expansion of the parsec-scale relativistic jet in 3C 84,\nclearly resolving a complex internal structure, showing bending in the jet, and\nchanges in its launching direction and expansion speed. We report measurements\nof the expansion speed in time, which show that the jet undergoes three\nregimes, marked by the beginning and ending of a hot spot frustration phase.\nThe images' high resolution allows us also to measure the projected launching\ndirection as a function of time, finding an irregular variation pattern. Our\nresults confirm previous studies of the morphological transition underwent by\n3C 84 and provide quantitative measurements of the jet's kinematic properties\nover a decade time-scale.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4gQf0F-CUhCMKdf9A3IEptmOPl0edFxLcbnOp1wLH4g","pdfSize":"7170822"}
