  "abstract": "  Post-disaster assessments of buildings and infrastructure are crucial for\nboth immediate recovery efforts and long-term resilience planning. This\nresearch introduces an innovative approach to automating post-disaster\nassessments through advanced deep learning models. Our proposed system employs\nstate-of-the-art computer vision techniques (YOLOv11 and ResNet50) to rapidly\nanalyze images and videos from disaster sites, extracting critical information\nabout building characteristics, including damage level of structural components\nand the extent of damage. Our experimental results show promising performance,\nwith ResNet50 achieving 90.28% accuracy and an inference time of 1529ms per\nimage on multiclass damage classification. This study contributes to the field\nof disaster management by offering a scalable, efficient, and objective tool\nfor post-disaster analysis, potentially capable of transforming how communities\nand authorities respond to and learn from catastrophic events.\n",
