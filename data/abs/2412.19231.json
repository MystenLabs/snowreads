Klipping of Fritz\nHaber Institute, Germany, to the low temperature physics laboratory of Indian\nInstitute of Technology, Madras. During his visit in 1979, Klipping delivered a\nseries of lectures on cryogenic practices and low temperature physics in the\nphysics department. The authors, both Masters degree students at that time,\nwith a specialization in cryogenics, attended these lectures arranged by Prof.\nR. Srinivasan then head of the Low Temperature laboratory. In this non\ntechnical note, the authors attempt to portray the research philosophy and\nattitudes of Klipping as captured through many wise remarks and snippets which\nformed an integral part of his lectures. In the 1970-80s Klipping made\ninvaluable contributions to the development of cryogenics research in India.\n","subjects":["Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"ppyzrixBycUkcWC23adWJFIJnVOriIM5kTcQuKN5__U","pdfSize":"544038"}
