  "abstract": "  An overview of the conceptuality interpretation of quantum mechanics is\npresented, along with an explanation of how it sheds light on key quantum and\nrelativistic phenomena. In particular, we show how the interpretation clarifies\nHeisenberg's uncertainty principle, wave function-based and entanglement-based\nnonlocality, interference effects resulting from the superposition principle,\ndelayed choice experiments, quantum measurements, the mechanism of\nquantization, the reason why entities can establish entanglement bonds, and the\nstatistical behavior of indistinguishable entities. We further argue that the\ninterpretation can also elucidate relativistic effects, focusing on time\ndilation. Finally, we suggest that it can provide a novel and challenging\nperspective on evolution. This article is the second in a two-part series\ndevoted to exploring this promising approach to reality. The first part, which\nserves as a companion to this discussion, outlines the intellectual trajectory\nleading from the first applications of quantum notions to human cognition to\nthe bold rethinking suggested by the conceptuality interpretation.\n",
