We provide non-trivial\nevidence for the existence of such string stars in spacetime dimensions $d\\geq\n7$ as higher-dimensional counterparts of HP solutions in bosonic and type II\nstring theories. In particular, we explicitly construct string star solutions\nin $d=7$ that are under perturbative control. In $d>7$, at the Hagedorn\ntemperature, we identify these string stars as a specific representative of a\nnew one-parameter bounded family of Euclidean solutions which can be under\nperturbative control. The higher-order $\\alpha'$ corrections play a crucial\nrole in our arguments and, as pointed by other works, nullify the previous\narguments against the existence of string stars in $d\\geq 7$. The\nhigher-dimensional string stars have non-zero free energy at Hagedorn\ntemperature and their mass and free energy are of the same order as those of a\nstring-sized black hole. In $d>7$, these solutions are string sized, but in\n$d=7$, the size of these solutions diverges as $\\sim (T_{\\rm H}-T)^{-1/4}$ near\nthe Hagedorn temperature.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"X-1X_ClqV_QBYHhQiNVPXDCJqefeYTCFe6ML44zjhko","pdfSize":"886762"}
