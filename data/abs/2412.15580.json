In our recent study, the terrestrial cell-based theories, which\nincorporates the cell-size data acquired in 2D simulations of helium detonation\nin the double-detonation model, were demonstrated to be a powerful diagnostics\nin reproducing the thresholds in the initiation and quenching provided by\nprevious studies. In the present study, 2D simulation results of the cellular\ndetonation in the base of white-dwarf (WD) envelope are described in detail, in\nterms of the dynamic wave morphology and chemical abundance structure. The\ncellular structure is observed at a range of upstream density and envelope\ncomposition explored in the present work. C/O contamination by the WD core\nmaterial reduces the cell width rapidly, as accelerated by the {\\alpha}-capture\nreaction. It is also indicated that nickel production could be significantly\ndelayed for the C/O-rich composition. The small cell width makes it extremely\ndemanding to resolve the detonation structure in full-star simulations of SNe\nIa; this could raise a concern on the robustness of the outcomes of some\nnumerical simulations in terms of the success and failure of detonation. This\nissue may be overcome by sub-grid modeling that incorporates the cellular\ndynamics acquired in resolved simulations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1lcY90FhG0A1Or_0I4mZ8BOIOfFLYo1C7XcdShkh2dA","pdfSize":"5418396"}
