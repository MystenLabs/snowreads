Here, we propose the utility\nof an existing metric quantifying the lack/presence of structure in a signal\ncalled, \"deviation from stochasticity\" (DS) measure to characterize\nresting-state fMRI time series. The hypothesis is that differences in the level\nof structure in the time series can lead to discrimination between the subject\ngroups. In this work, an autoencoder-based model is utilized to learn efficient\nrepresentations of data by training the network to reconstruct its input data.\nThe proposed methodology is applied on fMRI time series of 50 healthy\nindividuals and 50 subjects with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), obtained from\npublicly available ADNI database. DS measure for healthy fMRI as expected turns\nout to be different compared to that of AD. Peak classification accuracy of 95%\nwas obtained using Gradient Boosting classifier, using the DS measure applied\non 100 subjects.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"x-lif1qCFtOxsbofH2CPL3BKkNdYkWYA2LMAjQd0WxA","pdfSize":"341638"}
