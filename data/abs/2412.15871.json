  "abstract": "  In software applications, user models can be used to specify the profile of\nthe typical users of the application, including personality traits,\npreferences, skills, etc. In theory, this would enable an adaptive application\nbehavior that could lead to a better user experience. Nevertheless, user models\ndo not seem to be part of standard modeling languages nor common in current\nmodel-driven engineering (MDE) approaches. In this paper, we conduct a\nsystematic literature review to analyze existing proposals for user modeling in\nMDE and identify their limitations. The results showcase that there is a lack\nof a unified and complete user modeling perspective. Instead, we observe a lot\nof fragmented and partial proposals considering only simple user dimensions and\nwith lack of proper tool support. This limits the implementation of richer user\ninterfaces able to better support the user-specific needs. Therefore, we hope\nthis analysis triggers a discussion on the importance of user models and their\ninclusion in MDE pipelines. Especially in a context where, thanks to the rise\nof AI techniques, personalization, based on a rich number of user dimensions,\nis becoming more and more of a possibility.\n",
