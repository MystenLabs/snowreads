The\nefficiency of retrieval is directly proportional to the number of documents and\nthe size of the embeddings. Recent studies have shown that it is possible to\nreduce embedding size without sacrificing - and in some cases improving - the\nretrieval effectiveness. However, the methods introduced by these studies are\nquery-dependent, so they can't be applied offline and require additional\ncomputations during query processing, thus negatively impacting the retrieval\nefficiency. In this paper, we present a novel static pruning method for\nreducing the dimensionality of embeddings using Principal Components Analysis.\nThis approach is query-independent and can be executed offline, leading to a\nsignificant boost in dense retrieval efficiency with a negligible impact on the\nsystem effectiveness. Our experiments show that our proposed method reduces the\ndimensionality of document representations by over 50% with up to a 5%\nreduction in NDCG@10, for different dense retrieval models.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tk3UK2ZAwv3RylFKfSXqGnOxJXx6fT_pOtxNuCNiiuw","pdfSize":"555156"}
