It is assumed that\nthe function $\\mu(\\x,\\y)$ is $\\Z^d$-periodic in each variable,\n$\\mu(\\x,\\y)=\\mu(\\y,\\x)$ for all $\\x$ and $\\y$, and $0< \\mu_- \\leqslant\n\\mu(\\x,\\y) \\leqslant \\mu_+< \\infty$. Under these assumptions we show that the\nresolvent $({\\mathbb A}_\\eps + I)^{-1}$ converges, as $\\eps\\to0$, in the\noperator norm in $L_2(\\R^d)$ to the resolvent $({\\mathbb A}^0 + I)^{-1}$ of the\nlimit operator ${\\mathbb A}^0$ given by $$ ({\\mathbb A}^0 u) (\\x) = \\int_{\\R^d}\n\\mu^0 \\frac{\\left( u(\\x) - u(\\y) \\right)}{|\\x - \\y|^{d+\\alpha}}\\,d\\y, $$ where\n$\\mu^0$ is the mean value of $\\mu(\\x,\\y)$. We also show that the operator norm\nof the discrepancy $\\|({\\mathbb A}_\\eps + I)^{-1} - (\\A^0 +\nI)^{-1}\\|_{L_2(\\mathbb R^d)\\to L_2(\\mathbb R^d)}$ can be estimated by\n$O(\\eps^\\alpha)$, if $0< \\alpha < 1$, by $O(\\eps (1 + | \\operatorname{ln}\n\\eps|)^2)$, if $ \\alpha =1$, and by $O(\\eps^{2- \\alpha})$, if $1< \\alpha < 2$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XynDCGsoCij0xB1laB0MiAZKFonpcUFlrKnM14R0VF8","pdfSize":"278523"}
