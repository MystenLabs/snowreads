The atomicity\nprinciple and different atomic patterns for kP algorithms were proposed in the\npast as countermeasures against simple side-channel analysis. In this work, we\ninvestigated the resistance of a kP algorithm implemented in hardware using\nLonga's atomic patterns. We analysed its simulated power trace. We show in the\nexample of our kP implementation for the NIST EC P-256 that the field squaring\noperations are distinguishable from the field multiplications even if they are\nperformed by the same field multiplier, due to the addressing of the second\nmultiplicand. This inherent vulnerability of atomic patterns can be\nsuccessfully exploited for revealing the scalar k.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"r_ycUywz9zDwc741aj11UmVX2yz4fnaDZbrrBqu7mwM","pdfSize":"717326"}
