Current methods typically approach HMER as an\nimage-to-sequence generation task within an autoregressive (AR) encoder-decoder\nframework. However, these approaches suffer from several drawbacks: 1) a lack\nof overall language context, limiting information utilization beyond the\ncurrent decoding step; 2) error accumulation during AR decoding; and 3) slow\ndecoding speed. To tackle these problems, this paper makes the first attempt to\nbuild a novel bottom-up Non-AutoRegressive Modeling approach for HMER, called\nNAMER. NAMER comprises a Visual Aware Tokenizer (VAT) and a Parallel Graph\nDecoder (PGD). Initially, the VAT tokenizes visible symbols and local relations\nat a coarse level. Subsequently, the PGD refines all tokens and establishes\nconnectivities in parallel, leveraging comprehensive visual and linguistic\ncontexts. Experiments on CROHME 2014/2016/2019 and HME100K datasets demonstrate\nthat NAMER not only outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on\nExpRate by 1.93%/2.35%/1.49%/0.62%, but also achieves significant speedups of\n13.7x and 6.7x faster in decoding time and overall FPS, proving the\neffectiveness and efficiency of NAMER.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"n7ytHclV002S6k_qFIRtMwYnuIvmZwvsRuHmnSIzSD4","pdfSize":"3606043"}
