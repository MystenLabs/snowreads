We develop the direct\nsampling method based on probing indices using the saddle point formulation.\nThe medium is constructed by solutions of saddle point problems. The method\nimproves the probing functions for the direct sampling method and directly\nimages the medium. The method is very efficient and can be applied to a general\nclass of inverse medium problems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jO_pfIcycyh739uTLuwRb0ObrlqZh8nil7qNbg53O6I","pdfSize":"94103"}
