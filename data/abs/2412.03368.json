We extend this theorem to surfaces with boundary by\nshowing that a locally convex, embedded compact connected cmc surface, bounded\nby a convex curve in a plane $P$, is contained in one of the halfspaces of\n$\\mathbb{R}^3$ determined by $P$. This extension leads to the conclusion that\nspherical caps are the only examples of locally convex, embedded compact\nconnected cmc surfaces with non-zero curvature, bounded by a circle.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AUdvGHLINF267GYlaGjrhOuRfohapnvcR4Whreo6Gvg","pdfSize":"143662"}
