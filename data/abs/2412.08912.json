To the best of our\nknowledge, our model is the first to consider restoring the artifacts\nintroduced by various codecs (AV1, HEVC) by Denoising Diffusion without\nconsidering additional noise. This approach allows us to model the complex,\nnon-Gaussian nature of compression artifacts, effectively learning to reverse\nthe degradation. Our architecture combines the power of Transformers to capture\nlong-range dependencies with an enhanced windowed mechanism that preserves\nspatiotemporal context within groups of pixels across frames. To further\nenhance restoration, the model incorporates auxiliary \"Look Ahead\" and \"Look\nAround\" modules, providing both future and surrounding frame information to aid\nin reconstructing fine details and enhancing overall visual quality. Extensive\nexperiments on different datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods, particularly for high-resolution videos such as 4K\nand 8K, showcasing its effectiveness in restoring perceptually pleasing videos\nfrom highly compressed sources.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Multimedia"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"4xBD3vgK9Iy9HpKFfaXCjdD_B3xiEAvMZ4_E9AskCyM","pdfSize":"4258263"}
