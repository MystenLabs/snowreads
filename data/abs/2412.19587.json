The proposed approach is\nbuilt on two key components. First, we introduce an innovative early exit\nstrategy that dynamically partitions computations, enabling samples to be\noffloaded to a server based on layer-wise recursive prediction dynamics that\ndetect samples for which the confidence is not increasing fast enough over\nlayers. Second, we develop a Reinforcement Learning-based online optimization\nframework that jointly determines early exit points, computation splitting, and\noffloading strategies, while accounting for wireless conditions, inference\naccuracy, and resource costs. Numerical evaluations in an edge inference\nscenario demonstrate the method's adaptability and effectiveness in striking an\nexcellent trade-off between performance, latency, and resource efficiency.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tFFZ1ECAacrR537s2vo222PuCT-hD14Iq6tE8bk4yZU","pdfSize":"765498"}
