This study proposes a reinforcement learning-based simulation approach\naddressing gaps in existing research that has neglected the dynamic behaviours\nof shooters. We developed an autonomous agent to simulate an active shooter\nwithin a realistic office environment, aiming to offer insights into the\ninteractions between building design parameters and ASI outcomes. A case study\nis conducted to quantitatively investigate the impact of building exit numbers\n(total count of accessible exits) and configuration (arrangement of which exits\nare available or not) on evacuation and harm rates. Findings demonstrate that\ngreater exit availability significantly improves evacuation outcomes and\nreduces harm. Exits nearer to the shooter's initial position hold greater\nimportance for accessibility than those farther away. By encompassing dynamic\nshooter behaviours, this study offers preliminary insights into effective\nbuilding safety design against evolving threats.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"0KHz11F1RHkahuXCHDeW__xYpRgDPCubxsrkt8dWnNc","pdfSize":"1119724"}
