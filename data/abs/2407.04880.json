Traditionally, these services are software\napplications or devices, such as printers. However, Kerberos is not directly\nsuitable for IoT devices due to its relatively heavy-weight protocols and the\nresource-constrained nature of the devices.\n  This paper presents KESIC, a system that enables efficient and secure\nmulti-user access for IoT devices. KESIC aims to facilitate mutual\nauthentication of IoT devices and users via Kerberos without modifying the\nlatter's protocols. To facilitate that, KESIC includes a special Kerberized\nservice, called IoT Server, that manages access to IoT devices. KESIC presents\ntwo protocols for secure and comprehensive multi-user access system for two\ntypes of IoT devices: general and severely power constrained. In terms of\nperformance, KESIC onsumes $\\approx~47$ times less memory, and incurs\n$\\approx~135$ times lower run-time overhead than Kerberos.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"OY_g0sQJU4fpzmau65h9dzlQQDueOHbSsyimN1CYDMY","pdfSize":"869766"}
