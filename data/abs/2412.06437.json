We begin by establishing the existence of such an optimal\ndomain within the class of quasi-open sets, showing that in the physically\nrelevant dimensions $N = 2$ and $3$, the optimal domain is indeed an open set.\nAdditionally, we derive both first and second-order optimality conditions.\nLeveraging these conditions, we demonstrate that in two dimensions, the disk\ncannot be the optimal shape when the Poisson ratio is below a specific\nthreshold, whereas above this value, it serves as a local minimizer. We also\nextend our analysis to show that the disk is nonoptimal for Poisson ratios\n$\\nu$ satisfying $\\nu \\leq 0.4$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZejIUQ5p4gRrU3IV3JyptrSwtQUgAppl2Qv_twM4Gko","pdfSize":"852238"}
