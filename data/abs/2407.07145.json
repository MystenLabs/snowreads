We provide evidence that the generalized\nmodel interpolating between these two lattices features an extended quantum\nspin liquid ground state, which is gapless on the ruby lattice and gapped on\nthe maple-leaf lattice, with the transition between the two occurring midway.\nWe present equal-time spin structure factors which further characterize the\nnature of the presumed quantum spin liquid. Our results are based on one of the\nmost extensive state-of-the-art variational infinite tensor network\ncalculations to date, thereby helping us to resolve the long-standing issue of\nthe delicate competition between magnetically ordered and paramagnetic states\nin this family of models.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"N3ZEtPf7-r9sQpglFqa8LoyhqGmaXG97qc1kMilqzpU","pdfSize":"1150423"}
