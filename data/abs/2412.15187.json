To this end, we introduce a measurement-free deformation protocol\nof the Bacon-Shor code to realize a logical $\\mathit{CCZ}$ gate, enabling a\nuniversal set of fault-tolerant operations. Independently, we demonstrate that\ncertain stabilizer codes can be concatenated in a measurement-free way without\nhaving to rely on a universal logical gate set. This is achieved by means of\nthe disposable Toffoli gadget, which realizes the feedback operation in a\nresource-efficient way. For the purpose of benchmarking the proposed protocols\nwith circuit-level noise, we implement an efficient method to simulate\nnon-Clifford circuits consisting of few Hadamard gates. In particular, our\nfindings support that below-breakeven logical performance is achievable with a\ncircuit-level error rate below $10^{-3}$. Altogether, the deformation protocol\nand the Toffoli gadget provide a blueprint for a fully fault-tolerant\narchitecture without any feed-forward operation, which is particularly suited\nfor state-of-the-art neutral-atom platforms.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jZ0gwTt23X-XPDuCEg_jy_SImjvGKXF_0F_Um55o-Zk","pdfSize":"4638929"}
