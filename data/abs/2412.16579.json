  "abstract": "  An $n\\times n$ complex matrix $M$ with entries in the $k^{\\textrm{th}}$ roots\nof unity which satisfies $MM^{\\ast} = nI_{n}$ is called a Butson Hadamard\nmatrix. While a matrix with entries in the $k^{\\textrm{th}}$ roots typically\ndoes not have an eigenvector with entries in the same set, such vectors and\ntheir generalisations turn out to have multiple applications. A bent vector for\n$M$ satisfies $M{\\bf x} = \\lambda {\\bf y}$ where ${\\bf x}$ and ${\\bf y}$ have\nentries in the $k^{\\textrm{th}}$ roots of unity. In this paper we study in\nparticular the special case that ${\\bf y} = \\overline{\\bf x}$, which we call a\nconjugate self-dual bent vector for $M$.\n  Using techniques from algebraic number theory, we prove some order conditions\nand non-existence results for self-dual and conjugate self-dual bent vectors;\nusing tensor constructions and Bush-type matrices we give explicit examples. We\nconclude with an application to the covering radius of certain non-linear codes\ngeneralising the Reed Muller codes.\n",
