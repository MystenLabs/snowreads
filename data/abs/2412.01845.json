  "abstract": "  The official data provided by \"Central Election Commission\" was analyzed,\nrevealing irregularities that raised reasonable suspicion of election\nmanipulation by the winning ``Georgian Dream Party.\" However, these suspicions\nalone were insufficient to provide concrete evidence. A computational approach\nwas developed based on the official data to address this. Through this\nanalysis, one method estimated the number of manipulated votes to range between\n140,000 and 200,000, while another approach estimated a broader range of 90,000\nto 245,000 votes. Notably, both methods identified the most probable number of\nmanipulated votes as 175,000, providing a strong mathematical basis to\nsubstantiate the claim of election falsification.\n",
