We first provide a characterization of bicausal\ncouplings between weak solutions of stochastic differential equations. We then\nprovide a complete description of all such bicausal Monge couplings. In\nparticular, we show that bicausal Monge couplings of $d$-dimensional Wiener\nmeasures are induced by stochastic integrals of rotation-valued integrands. As\nan application, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for bicausal\ncouplings to be induced by Monge maps and show that such bicausal Monge\ntransports are dense in the set of bicausal couplings between laws of SDEs with\nregular coefficients.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CG4tjfJHdq58Ov55cs3SFOmk76DEgoeds6sesH_E9ZU","pdfSize":"367289"}
