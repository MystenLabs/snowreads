We then make\nthe model more realistic by considering serial dependence: we assume a\ngeometric fractional Brownian motion for the price, then an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\nprocess for the microstructure noise. In these two cases of serial dependence,\nwe propose again consistent and asymptotically normal estimators. All our\nestimators are compared on simulated data with existing approaches, such as\nRoll, Corwin-Schultz, Abdi-Ranaldo, or Ardia-Guidotti-Kroencke estimators.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance","Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance","Quantitative Finance/Trading and Market Microstructure","Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"ysVwaIx-MTIcAVwt6RtNqoHtVmM4QRCnkkxmSlxN5lI","pdfSize":"801123"}
