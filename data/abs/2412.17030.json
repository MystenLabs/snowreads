  "abstract": "  We introduce supersymmetric extensions of the Hom-Lie deformation of the\nVirasoro algebra (super Curtright-Zachos algebra), as realized in the GL(1,1)\nquantum superspace, for Bloch electron systems under Zeeman effects. By\nexamining the duality inherent in quantum superspace scaling operators, we\nestablish a correspondence between quantum superspace and its physical\nrealization through a novel operator mixing mechanism. For the continuous case,\nwe construct super Curtright-Zachos algebra using magnetic translations and\nspin matrix bases, demonstrating explicit realizations for both N=1 and N=2\nsupersymmetric algebras with a natural N=2 decomposition. For the discrete\ncase, we establish cyclic matrix representations in tight-binding models. We\norganize these structures through the *-bracket formalism with Z2-grading,\nrevealing how the quantum superspace structure manifests in physical systems\nwhile preserving essential algebraic properties.\n",
