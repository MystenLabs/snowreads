  "abstract": "  As part of the mission of the International Astronomical Union Centre for the\nProtection of the Dark and Quiet Sky from Satellite Constellation Interference\n(IAU-CPS) Policy Hub to consider national and international regulations about\nthe usage and sustainability in outer space, we also included discussion\nspecific to the rights of Indigenous peoples with respect to outer space under\nthe context of the United Nations Declaration for the Rights of Indigenous\nPeoples (UNDRIP). In this work, we review how some of the articles of UNDRIP\nrequire various actors in the use and exploitation of outer space including\nsatellite companies, nation states, and professional/academic astronomy to\nconsult and support Indigenous peoples/nations and respect Indigenous\nsovereignties. This work is concluded with recommendations for consulting and\ncollaborating with Indigenous peoples and recommendations for moving from the\ntraditional colonial exploitation of outer space and building an anti-colonial\nfuture in relationship with outer space.\n",
