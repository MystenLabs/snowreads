  "abstract": "  Software engineering agents (swe-agents), as key innovations in intelligent\nsoftware engineering, are poised in the industry's end-of-programming debate to\ntranscend from assistance to primary roles. we argue the importance of\nswe-agents' economic viability to their transcendence -- defined as their\ncapacity to maintain efficient operations in constrained environments -- and\npropose its exploration via software engineering economics experimentation.we\nintroduce ghissuemarket sandbox, a controlled virtual environment for\nswe-agents' economic experimentation, simulating the environment of an\nenvisioned peer-to-peer multiagent system for github issues outsourcing\nauctions. in this controlled setting, autonomous swe-agents auction and bid on\ngithub issues, leveraging real-time communication, a built-in\nretrieval-augmented generation (rag) interface for effective decision-making,\nand instant cryptocurrency micropayments. we open-source our software\nartifacts, discuss our sandbox engineering decisions, and advocate towards\nswe-agents' economic exploration -- an emerging field we intend to pursue under\nthe term intelligent software engineering economics (isee).\n",
