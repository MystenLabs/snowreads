There is\ngood reason to hope that technologies such as computer vision and artificial\nintelligence (AI) could reduce these costs, yet obstacles arise when adapting\nadvanced tools to farming environments. In this work, we adapt AI tools to\ndairy cow teat localization, teat shape, and teat skin condition\nclassifications. We also curate a data collection and analysis methodology for\na Machine Learning (ML) pipeline. The resulting teat shape prediction model\nachieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.783, and the teat skin condition\nmodel achieves a mean average precision of 0.828. Our work leverages existing\nML vision models to facilitate the individualized identification of teat health\nand skin conditions, applying AI to the dairy management industry.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Jqlx8xj6JLb0-tmuwiqPLd8j7_8RHKB_Mm4UYHG97Q8","pdfSize":"5929319"}
