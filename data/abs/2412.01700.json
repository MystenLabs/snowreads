  "abstract": "  We present a uniform characterisation of three-valued logics by means of the\nbisequent calculus (BSC). It is a generalised form of a sequent calculus (SC)\nwhere rules operate on the ordered pairs of ordinary sequents. BSC may be\ntreated as the weakest kind of system in the rich family of generalised SC\noperating on items being some collections of ordinary sequents, like\nhypersequent and nested sequent calculi. It seems that for many non-classical\nlogics, including some many-valued, paraconsistent and modal logics, the\nreasonably modest generalisation of standard SC offered by BSC is sufficient.\nIn this paper we examine a variety of three-valued logics and show how they can\nbe formalised in the framework of BSC. We present a constructive syntactic\nproof provided that these systems are cut-free, satisfy the subformula\nproperty, and allow one to prove the interpolation theorem in many cases.\n",
