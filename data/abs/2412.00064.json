  "abstract": "  Recent advances in Diffusion Models have enabled the generation of images\nfrom text, with powerful closed-source models like DALL-E and Midjourney\nleading the way. However, open-source alternatives, such as StabilityAI's\nStable Diffusion, offer comparable capabilities. These open-source models,\nhosted on Hugging Face, come equipped with ethical filter protections designed\nto prevent the generation of explicit images. This paper reveals first their\nlimitations and then presents a novel text-based safety filter that outperforms\nexisting solutions. Our research is driven by the critical need to address the\nmisuse of AI-generated content, especially in the context of information\nwarfare. DiffGuard enhances filtering efficacy, achieving a performance that\nsurpasses the best existing filters by over 14%.\n",
