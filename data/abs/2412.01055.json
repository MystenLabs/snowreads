This study introduces a novel framework for imaging structural\ndefects using significantly fewer samples. In this framework, defects are\nmodeled as regions where physical properties shift from their nominal values to\nresemble those of air, and a linear approximation is formulated to relate these\nbinary shifts in physical properties with corresponding changes in\nmeasurements. Recovering a binary vector from linear measurements is generally\nan NP-hard problem. To address this challenge, this study proposes two\nalgorithmic approaches. The first approach relaxes the binary constraint, using\nconvex optimization to find a solution. The second approach incorporates a\nbinary-inducing prior and employs approximate Bayesian inference to estimate\nthe posterior probability of the binary vector given the measurements. Both\nalgorithmic approaches demonstrate better performance compared to existing\ncompressive sampling methods for binary vector recovery. The framework's\neffectiveness is illustrated through examples of eddy current sensing to image\ndefects in metal structures.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"beZPB9Z-XIqLsS5BDpccRwee3nIoy6h-Z25JFUFW4yc","pdfSize":"2861401"}
