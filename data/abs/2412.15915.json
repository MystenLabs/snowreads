We\ncarry out our lattice simulations on two CLS ensembles at $m_\\pi \\sim\n440~\\text{MeV}$ and $a\\sim 0.066~\\text{fm}$ and obtain results compatible with\nexperiment. Furthermore, we interpret our results analytically using the\n${}^3P_0$ quark model.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9t579S775sUzlPZMfyFN-f8ExSo6DxNFvJzjLFQU35A","pdfSize":"724216"}
