  "abstract": "  The emergence of hexagonal Ge (2H-Ge) as a candidate direct-gap group-IV\nsemiconductor for Si photonics mandates rigorous understanding of its\noptoelectronic properties. Theoretical predictions of a \"pseudo-direct\" band\ngap, characterized by weak oscillator strength, contrast with a claimed high\nradiative recombination coefficient $B$ comparable to conventional (cubic)\nInAs. We compute $B$ in 2H-Ge from first principles and quantify its dependence\non temperature, carrier density and strain. For unstrained 2H-Ge, our\ncalculated spontaneous emission spectra corroborate that measured\nphotoluminescence corresponds to direct-gap emission, but with $B$ being\napproximately three orders of magnitude lower than in InAs. We confirm a\npseudo-direct- to direct-gap transition under $\\sim 2$\\% [0001] uniaxial\ntension, which can enhance $B$ by up to three orders of magnitude, making it\ncomparable to that of InAs. Beyond quantifying strong enhancement of $B$ via\nstrain engineering, our analysis suggests the dominance of additional, as-yet\nunquantified recombination mechanisms in this nascent material.\n",
