Indeed, we are able to obtain the\nsame evolution equations obtained previously by Gay-Balmaz and Yoshimura (see\nEntropy, 21(8):39, 2019) using variational arguments. The proposed geometric\ndescription allows us to apply geometrical tools to discuss reduction by\nsymmetries, the Hamilton-Jacobi equation or discretization of these systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Q_ZprAZSb-LnEiVx5bsMxNCYdVwit8GrevD8FRb1I8E","pdfSize":"255358"}
