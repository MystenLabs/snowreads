The dataset has been released as part\nof Auto-WCBleedGen Challenge Version V2 hosted by the MISAHUB team. Our model\nattained the highest performance among 75 teams that took part in this\ncompetition. It aims to efficiently utilizes CNN based model i.e. DenseNet and\nUNet to detect and segment bleeding and non-bleeding areas in the real-world\ncomplex dataset. The model achieves an impressive overall accuracy of 80% which\nwould surely help a skilled doctor to carry out further diagnostics.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DECbUEHKy40H-oFEsmtv9mGCpflBJXKXFPJvWc6p_fw","pdfSize":"1201103"}
