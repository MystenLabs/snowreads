However, traditional (i.e.\nlargely manual) map production and crowdsourced mapping methods still struggle\nto keep pace with rapid changes in the built environment. Such manual mapping\nworkflows are time-consuming and prone to human errors, leading to early\nobsolescence and/or the need for extensive auditing. The current map updating\nprocess in OpenStreetMap provides an example of this limitation, relying on\nnumerous manual steps in its online map updating workflow. To address this,\nthere is a need to explore automating the entire end-to-end map up-dating\nprocess. Tech giants such as Google and Microsoft have already started\ninvestigating Machine Learning (ML) techniques to tackle this contemporary\nmapping problem. This paper offers an analysis of these ML approaches, focusing\non their application to updating Open-StreetMap in particular. By analysing the\ncurrent state-of-the-art in this field, this study identi-fies some key\nresearch gaps and introduces DeepMapper as a practical solution for advancing\nthe automatic online map updating process in the future.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dABCTQDUWBrNs8d6vaWCXYPQNeNFcFHyPeL6PwkqLzs","pdfSize":"2546185"}
