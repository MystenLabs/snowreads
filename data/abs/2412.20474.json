  "abstract": "  We study the analogy between graviton emission in a thermal radiation\nenvironment and the laser mechanism, where photons of the same momentum and\npolarization are amplified. Using interaction picture perturbation theory, we\nanalyze the time evolution of the graviton number operator and its expectation\nvalue in a squeezed vacuum state, describing the inflationary graviton state.\nDuring the radiation-dominated era of the early universe, we find secular\ngrowth in the graviton number, leading to the breakdown of perturbative\nanalysis within approximately ten Hubble times after reheating. We also explore\nanalogous effects in a Minkowski background. As a thought experiment, we\nconsider LIGO/Virgo-like detectors immersed in a radiation environment at\ntemperatures of $O(10)$ GeV. In this scenario, graviton numbers at $O(100)$ Hz\ncould be enhanced, suggesting a mechanism to amplify gravitational wave\nsignals. While this setup is beyond current experimental capabilities, it\npoints to potential advancements in gravitational wave measurements.\n",
