However, when data is heterogeneous across clients, the global model\ntrained using SSL is unable to learn high-quality personalized models. In this\npaper, we show that when the global model is trained with SSL without\nmodifications, its produced representations have fuzzy class boundaries. As a\nresult, personalized learning within each client produces models with low\naccuracy. In order to improve SSL towards better accuracy without sacrificing\nits advantage in fairness, we propose Calibre, a new personalized federated\nlearning framework designed to calibrate SSL representations by maintaining a\nsuitable balance between more generic and more client-specific representations.\nCalibre is designed based on theoretically-sound properties, and introduces (1)\na client-specific prototype loss as an auxiliary training objective; and (2) an\naggregation algorithm guided by such prototypes across clients. Our\nexperimental results in an extensive array of non-i.i.d.~settings show that\nCalibre achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both mean accuracy\nand fairness across clients.
