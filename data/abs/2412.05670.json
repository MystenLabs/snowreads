  "abstract": "  In this paper, we fist consider the shadow radius of a quantum corrected\nblack hole proposed recently, and provide a bound on the correction parameter\nbased on the observational data of Sgr A*. Then, the effects of the correction\nparameter on the energy, angular momenta and angular velocities of particles on\ncircular orbits in the accretion disk are discussed. It is found that the\ncorrection parameter has significant effects on the angular momenta of\nparticles on the circular orbits even in the far region from the black hole. It\nwould be possible to identify the value of the correction parameter by the\nobservations of the angular momenta of particles in the disk. It is also found\nthat the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit increase with the\nincrease of the correction parameter, while the radiative efficiency of the\nblack hole decreases with the increase of the correction parameter. Finally, we\nconsider how the correction parameter affect the emitted and observed radiation\nfluxes from a thin accretion disk around the black hole. Polynomial fitting\nfunctions are identified for the relations between the maxima of three typical\nradiation fluxes and the correction parameter.\n",
