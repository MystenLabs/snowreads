  "abstract": "  Reentrant localization has recently been observed in systems with\nquasi-periodic nearest-neighbor hopping, where the interplay between dimerized\nhopping and staggered disorder is identified as the driving mechanism. However,\nthe robustness of reentrant localization in the presence of long-range hopping\nremains an open question. In this work, we investigate the phenomenon of\nreentrant localization in systems incorporating long-range hopping. Our results\nreveal that long-range hopping induces reentrant localization regardless of\nwhether the disorder is staggered or uniform. We demonstrate that long-range\nhopping does not inherently disrupt localization; instead, under specific\nconditions, it facilitates the emergence of reentrant localization.\nFurthermore, by analyzing critical exponents, we show that the inclusion of\nlong-range hopping modifies the critical behavior, leading to transitions that\nbelong to distinct universality classes.\n",
