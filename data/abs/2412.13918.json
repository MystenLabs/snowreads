Incremental approaches based on the RETE algorithm provide an adequate\nsolution in many scenarios, but are generally designed to search for query\nresults over the entire graph. However, in certain situations, a user may only\nbe interested in query results for a subgraph, for instance when a developer is\nworking on a large model of which only a part is loaded into their workspace.\nIn this case, the global execution semantics can result in significant\ncomputational overhead.\n  To mitigate the outlined shortcoming, in this article we propose an extension\nof the RETE approach that enables local, yet fully incremental execution of\ngraph queries, while still guaranteeing completeness of results with respect to\nthe relevant subgraph.\n  We empirically evaluate the presented approach via experiments inspired by a\nscenario from software development and with queries and data from an\nindependent social network benchmark. The experimental results indicate that\nthe proposed technique can significantly improve performance regarding memory\nconsumption and execution time in favorable cases, but may incur a noticeable\noverhead in unfavorable cases.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Logic in Computer Science","Computer Science/Databases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Qf5-mbre-yvwuH7pjAEpgpXoX4WWJL8yK7QfajsbEgQ","pdfSize":"1186877"}
