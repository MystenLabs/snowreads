We consider the prospects of a simple extension via 3 generations\nof sterile fermions - the so called ISS(3,3) - in what concerns numerous lepton\nflavour observables. In order to facilitate a connection between the Lagrangian\nparameters and low-energy data, we systematically develop new parametrisations\nof the Yukawa couplings. Relying on these new parametrisations to explore the\nparameter space, we discuss the complementary role of charged lepton flavour\nviolation searches in dedicated facilities, as well as in lepton colliders\n(FCC-ee and $\\mu$TRISTAN). Our results reveal the strong synergy of the\ndifferent indirect searches in probing the distinct flavour sectors of the\nmodel. In particular, we show that in the absence of radiative decays\n$\\ell_\\alpha\\to\\ell_\\beta\\gamma$, sizeable rates for $Z$-penguin dominated\nobservables could hint at a non-trivially mixed and non-degenerate heavy\nspectrum.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iqAcclLfXLSwlHAjvk1Ctcgicex7vk3FycWjUmzclFI","pdfSize":"1008629"}
