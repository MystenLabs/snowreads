However, the probability for such photon-like events drops down\nstrongly at the highest energies due to the increasing probability of Lorentz\nboosted $\\pi^0$'s suffering hadronic interactions before decay. Different\nhadronic interaction models suggest that photon-like hadronic events may be\nobserved at current UHECR observatories. A quantitative comparison of the\nobserved number of background events found in recent photon searches published\nby the Pierre Auger Collaboration allows us conclude that the hypothesis of\nupwards fluctuations of $\\pi^0$-production alone is insufficient to explain the\ndata.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mpJs9qxcs_-vv-e2ANk0xux_BEUhP_7GvVwBnlasnuY","pdfSize":"1754856"}
