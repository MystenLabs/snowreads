Recent efforts have shifted toward\ntraining a single model capable of handling multiple classes. However, directly\nextending early AD methods to multi-class settings often results in degraded\nperformance. In this paper, we analyze this degradation observed in\nreconstruction-based methods, identifying two key issues: catastrophic\nforgetting and inter-class confusion. To this end, we propose a plug-and-play\nmodification by incorporating class-aware contrastive learning (CL). By\nexplicitly leveraging raw object category information (e.g., carpet or wood) as\nsupervised signals, we apply local CL to fine-tune multiscale features and\nglobal CL to learn more compact feature representations of normal patterns,\nthereby effectively adapting the models to multi-class settings. Experiments\nacross four datasets (over 60 categories) verify the effectiveness of our\napproach, yielding significant improvements and superior performance compared\nto advanced methods. Notably, ablation studies show that even using\npseudo-class labels can achieve comparable performance.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"q3ULkss66_rDwmXzjxkBld1QMsvGoQ-l6LMEOwfUUfE","pdfSize":"1834002"}
