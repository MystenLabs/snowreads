  "abstract": "  We conduct a comprehensive analysis of potential annihilation processes of\nlight dark matter (DM) in minimal Higgs portal models near supermassive black\nhole (Sgr A$^{\\star}$) in the Galactic Center, considering interactions between\nDM particles mediated by either a light scalar or pseudoscalar with couplings $\nc_s $ and $ c_p $. Accelerated by the supermassive black hole, DM particles can\nreach velocities up to half the speed of light, significantly enhancing the $ p\n$-wave annihilation cross-section, allowing forbidden annihilation channels\nwithin specific mass ranges, and producing unique gamma-ray spectral signals.\nUtilizing gamma-ray observation from Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) in\nthe direction of Sgr $A^{\\star}$, we constrain light DM parameter in the mass\nrange of $ 0.3-10 \\, \\text{GeV} $ . Our results indicate that the couplings $\nc_s $ and $ c_p $ are constrained to the order of $ 10^{-5} $, corresponding to\na DM annihilation cross-section as low as $ 10^{-38} $$ {\\rm cm}^3/{\\rm s}$. In\nthe future, the Very Large Gamma-ray Space Telescope (VLAST), with a larger\ndetection area and broader detection range from $1$ MeV to $1$ TeV, will\nenhance our ability to probe sub-GeV DM and offer the opportunity to further\nstudy the forbidden annihilation scenario.\n",
