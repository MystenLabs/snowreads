We also classify links up to\nband-pass and band-# moves, which are versions of the usual pass- and #-move,\nrespectively, where each pair of parallel strands belong to the same component.\nThis recovers and generalizes widely a number of partial results in the study\nof these local moves. The proofs make use of clasper theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xtUheVqXRSWuHPB2jeG_E__aEHuPFUeqJWStKI73nw8","pdfSize":"906709"}
