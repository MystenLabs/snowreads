For vector mesons, the decay constants defined by\ntensor currents are given in the $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ scheme at $2$ GeV. The\ncalculation is performed on domain wall fermion configurations generated by the\nRBC-UKQCD Collaborations and the overlap fermion action is used for the valence\nquarks. Comparing the current results with our previous ones at a coarser\nlattice spacing $a\\sim0.11$ fm gives us a better understanding of the\ndiscretization error. We obtain $f_{D_s^*}^T(\\overline{\\rm MS},\\text{2\nGeV})/f_{D_s^*}=0.907(20)$ with a better precision than our previous result.\nCombining our $f_{D_s^*}=277(11)$ MeV with the total width of $D_s^*$\ndetermined in a recent work gives a branching fraction $4.26(52)\\times10^{-5}$\nfor $D_s^*$ leptonic decay.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xptUzzGTxLD8YpnJUyf0IffCBTfdyf6DWu7iQVpxY40","pdfSize":"808666"}
