The minimal model suffers from the\nquality problem, which means that the strong CP angle is generated by\nhigher-dimensional operators and one-loop effects. Consequently, it has been\nconsidered that there is a cosmological domain wall problem and that\nleptogenesis does not work. We point out that just imposing an additional\napproximate global symmetry solves the quality problem. We also propose a\nsimple solution to the domain wall problem and show that the thermal\nleptogenesis scenario works.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rT4lm-asQnnfOvWOQkTr_7C6JlNoDNKjfIKra9S2lsg","pdfSize":"1159992"}
