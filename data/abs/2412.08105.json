  "abstract": "  In 1982, Durnberger proved that every connected Cayley graph of a finite\ngroup with a commutator subgroup of prime order contains a hamiltonian cycle.\nIn this paper, we extend this result to the infinite case. Additionally, we\ngeneralize this result to a broader class of infinite graphs $X$, where the\nautomorphism group of $X$ contains a transitive subgroup $G$ with a cyclic\ncommutator subgroup of prime order.\n",
