Current design tools often\nneglect the importance of constraint adherence throughout the entire design\nflow. In this paper, we propose SuperFlow, a fully-customized RTL-to-GDS design\nflow tailored for AQFP devices. SuperFlow leverages a synthesis tool based on\nCMOS technology to transform any input RTL netlist to an AQFP-based netlist.\nSubsequently, we devise a novel place-and-route procedure that simultaneously\nconsiders wirelength, timing, and routability for AQFP circuits. The process\nculminates in the generation of the AQFP circuit layout, followed by a Design\nRule Check (DRC) to identify and rectify any layout violations. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate that SuperFlow achieves 12.8% wirelength\nimprovement on average and 12.1% better timing quality compared with previous\nstate-of-the-art placers for AQFP circuits.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kJEMI1dTVJvDt5avQ0eoSQlRGJJ2eIJifUWnUBIvIfw","pdfSize":"1691410","objectId":"0xa1acf7df93bcbba7336d5c6cc2fbc7ce90248d840c1107b59a56e7f10f32b9ee","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
