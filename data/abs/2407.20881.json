This provides a positive answer to a question posed by\nF\\'elix, Halperin and Thomas. Furthermore, we give some discussion about the\nrelationship between the homotopy groups of a topological space and its minimal\nSullivan model.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LE2aVeDgGSMJ0Lu_8ucZTxSVAuWto7A_YvJTt0KlSIA","pdfSize":"203043"}
