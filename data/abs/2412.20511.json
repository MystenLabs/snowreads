Since a quantum field is an operator valued regular distribution\nand the warped convolution is (weakly) an oscillatory integral of Rieffel type,\nwe prove that the symbol classes introduced by Hormander admit extensions which\nare suited to the warped convolutions of scalar quantum field operators. We\nfurther show that, if a particular vector state on the undeformed algebra of\nfield operators fulfills the microlocal spectrum condition, then every vector\nstate on the deformed algebra generated by these warped convolutions fulfills\nthe microlocal spectrum condition.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"O1x6j9fit9s27hqjCfn3ptogt5rPEnpzaXGts8SPW60","pdfSize":"390539"}
