We introduce a new Riemannian metric to assess the\nsimilarity between any two data points. Importantly, our metric is agnostic to\nthe parametrization of the generative model and requires only the evaluation of\nits data likelihood. Moreover, the metric leads to the conceptual definition of\ngenerative distances and generative geodesics, whose computation can be done\nefficiently in the data space. Their approximations are proven to converge to\ntheir true values under mild conditions. We showcase three proof-of-concept\napplications of this global metric, including clustering, data visualization,\nand data interpolation, thus providing new tools to support the geometrical\nunderstanding of generative models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2nhV1qrmLfGpDPH1YMV9bUjXbIEoHKRXqBktmZgHuK8","pdfSize":"2386998"}
