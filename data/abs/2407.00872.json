In this paper, we give equivalent criteria for which the star-critical\nRamsey number vanishes. Next, we provide a new general lower bound for\nmulticolor star-critical Ramsey numbers whenever it does not vanish. As an\napplication, we evaluate $r_*(P_k, P_3, P_3)$, where $P_n$ is a path of order\n$n$. In the process of proving these results, we also show that $r_*(C_5,\nP_3)=3$, where $C_5$ is a cycle of order $5$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"47XLBQuj3-jC9FpgHjz6YA0j_Ezzmu_Q-yDQr95uuWA","pdfSize":"809350","objectId":"0x41b8f3d94b360f8305207d5cf33a7057d4517eb17293bda2bfd306f86ce4c517","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
