We further constrain the model's parameters using\nPlanck data and present a specific form of the potential. Our results\ndemonstrate that the model aligns well with observational data.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"vxVvNDccdGe9O4WZkaUqagZkPtmQEVb6uGzgxX9C3n0","pdfSize":"2267734"}
