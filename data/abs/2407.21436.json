However, the semantic information for the interpretation of\nbuilding thermal point clouds can hardly be precisely inferred. Transferring\nthe semantics encapsulated in 3D building models at LoD3 has a potential to\nfill this gap. In this work, we propose a workflow enriching thermal point\nclouds with the geo-position and semantics of LoD3 building models, which\nutilizes features of both modalities: The proposed method can automatically\nco-register the point clouds from different sources and enrich the thermal\npoint cloud in facade-detailed semantics. The enriched thermal point cloud\nsupports thermal analysis and can facilitate the development of currently\nscarce deep learning models operating directly on thermal point clouds.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kdnrzWbTwykjWGdb7mtiCBCurkdDTTAyBgEC9FI4In8","pdfSize":"2891906"}
