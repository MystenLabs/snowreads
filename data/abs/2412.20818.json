For this purpose, we introduce an observable that we call the\noverlap ratio $\\Omega(t)$, whose average is the probability that a particle\nthat is on the top-$n$ list at some time will also be on the top-$n$ list after\ntime $t$. The overlap ratio is a local observable which is concentrated at the\ntop of the ranking and does not require the full ranking of all particles. It\nis simple to measure in practice. We derive an analytical formula for the\naverage overlap ratio for a system of $N$ particles in the stationary state\nthat undergo independent Brownian motion on the positive real half-axis with a\nreflecting wall at the origin and a drift towards the wall. In particular, we\nshow that for $N\\rightarrow \\infty$, the overlap ratio takes a rather simple\nform $\\langle \\Omega(t)\\rangle = {\\rm erfc}(a \\sqrt{t})$ for $n\\gg 1$ with some\nscaling parameter $a>0$. This result is a very good approximation even for\nmoderate sizes of the top-$n$ list such as $n=10$. Moreover, as we show, the\noverlap ratio exhibits universal behavior observed in many dynamical systems\nincluding geometric Brownian motion, Brownian motion with a position-dependent\ndrift and a soft barrier on one side, the Bouchaud-M\\'ezard wealth distribution\nmodel, and Kesten processes.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xVl4jadJU3ps8fgygmT681DqMW5zL4WYHjn2WuMnAXw","pdfSize":"2540737"}
