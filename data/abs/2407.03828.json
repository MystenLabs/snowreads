Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) offer a\ncompelling solution, and traditionally ground-based experiments have eagerly,\nbut to date unsuccessfully, searched for these hypothetical low-mass particles\nthat are expected to be produced in large quantities in the strong\nelectromagnetic fields in the interior of stars. This work offers a fresh look\nat axions and ALPs by leveraging their conversion into X-rays in the magnetic\nfield of the Sun's atmosphere rather than a laboratory magnetic field. Unique\ndata acquired with the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) during\nthe solar minimum in 2020 allows us to set stringent limits on the coupling of\naxions to photons using state-of-the-art magnetic field models of the solar\natmosphere. We report pioneering limits on the axion-photon coupling strength\nof $6.9\\times 10^{-12}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at 95\\% confidence level for axion masses\n$m_a \\lesssim 2\\times 10^{-7}$ eV, surpassing current ground-based searches and\nfurther probing unexplored regions of the axion-photon coupling parameter space\nup to axion masses of $m_a \\lesssim 5\\times 10^{-4}$ eV.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"iPySIARXS3cc53zKoQ84gGrAHA3lWHfpoVnrZmECyRw","pdfSize":"6389558"}
