  "abstract": "  We propose a renormalisation group inspired normalising flow that combines\nbenefits from traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and standard\nnormalising flows to sample lattice field theories. Specifically, we use\nsamples from a coarse lattice field theory and learn a stochastic map to the\ntargeted fine theory. The devised architecture allows for systematic\nimprovements and efficient sampling on lattices as large as $128 \\times 128$ in\nall phases when only having sampling access on a $4\\times 4$ lattice. This\npaves the way for reaping the benefits of traditional MCMC methods on coarse\nlattices while using normalising flows to learn transformations towards finer\ngrids, aligning nicely with the intuition of super-resolution tasks. Moreover,\nby optimising the base distribution, this approach allows for further\nstructural improvements besides increasing the expressivity of the model.\n",
