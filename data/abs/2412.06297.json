All presented results\nare based on the 2015-2018 data set of $13\\,\\mathrm{TeV}$ proton-proton\ncollisions, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about\n$140\\,\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. The discussed models include dark mesons, heavy\nneutral leptons, dark matter, and dark photons. The obtained exclusion limits\nsignificantly extend the probed parameter space and, in some cases, provide the\nfirst collider-based constraints for the considered models.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YpFxT0UJCNYgYhR1TuEIbdTwwWzuFeQSeZwfSiE991c","pdfSize":"819076"}
