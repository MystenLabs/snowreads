Neatest generates these neural\nnetworks using an evolutionary algorithm that is guided by an objective\nfunction targeting individual source code statements. This approach works well\nif the objective function provides sufficient guidance, but deceiving or\ncomplex fitness landscapes may inhibit the search. In this paper, we\ninvestigate whether the issue of challenging fitness landscapes can be\naddressed by promoting novel behaviours during the search. Our case study on\ntwo Scratch games demonstrates that rewarding novel behaviours is a promising\napproach for overcoming challenging fitness landscapes, thus enabling future\nresearch on how to adapt the search algorithms to best use this information.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"eHx2ukcuV5SbEtilcQtW0bfrBh-Bn2Byz2m3UVBY5gQ","pdfSize":"788832"}
