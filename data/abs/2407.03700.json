The in-depth investigation in the\npresent work addresses deep learning applied to data-driven damage detection in\nnonlinear dynamic systems. In particular, autoencoders (AEs) and generative\nadversarial networks (GANs) are implemented leveraging on 1D convolutional\nneural networks. The onset of damage is detected in the investigated nonlinear\ndynamic systems by exciting random vibrations of varying intensity, without\nprior knowledge of the system or the excitation and in unsupervised manner. The\ncomprehensive numerical study is conducted on dynamic systems exhibiting\ndifferent types of nonlinear behavior. An experimental application related to a\nmagneto-elastic nonlinear system is also presented to corroborate the\nconclusions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"moaz_C0jtMFCDtSxfSt18tKR1p1Lw1phd83et0MTekA","pdfSize":"44000508"}
