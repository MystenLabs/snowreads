Existing methods\noften depend on restrictive assumptions such as additional training, operator\nlinearity, or narrow image distributions, thus limiting their generalizability.\nIn this work, we present LADiBI, a training-free framework that uses\nlarge-scale text-to-image diffusion models to solve blind inverse problems with\nminimal assumptions. By leveraging natural language prompts, LADiBI jointly\nmodels priors for both the target image and operator, allowing for flexible\nadaptation across a variety of tasks. Additionally, we propose a novel\nposterior sampling approach that combines effective operator initialization\nwith iterative refinement, enabling LADiBI to operate without predefined\noperator forms. Our experiments show that LADiBI is capable of solving a broad\nrange of image restoration tasks, including both linear and nonlinear problems,\non diverse target image distributions.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zEaWJn3ogQ8CmluURAeOdddUaORrdPmvkjTvK6VA3cA","pdfSize":"12802004"}
