This is especially important for high-stake\ndecision-making, such as insurance underwriting and annuity pricing. This paper\nproposes a new fairness-regularized principal component analysis - Fair PCA, in\nthe context of high-dimensional factor models. An efficient gradient descent\nalgorithm is constructed with adaptive selection criteria for hyperparameter\ntuning. The Fair PCA is applied to mortality modelling to mitigate gender\ndiscrimination in annuity pricing. The model performance has been validated\nthrough both simulation studies and empirical data analysis.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6x9--jp9j1HS3MN8P43hUImYiBpjfzP40MMhtz_dftk","pdfSize":"7152672"}
