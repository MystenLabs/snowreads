While existing\nstandards like SENIAM address specific applications, no comprehensive framework\nspans different sensing modalities and applications. We present a unified\nsensor placement standard that ensures the reproducibility and transferability\nof human movement and physiological data across various systems and research\ndomains. Our framework provides precise anatomical landmarks, coordinate\nsystems, and placement protocols with defined precision levels, compatible with\nexisting data-sharing standards such as the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)\nand Heirechciacal Event Descriptors (HED). This framework aims to enhance data\nquality, reproducibility, and interoperability in applications ranging from\nlab-based clinical biomechanics to continuous health monitoring in everyday\nlife.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ym-kXoPIOx_k3jEUIiaQbas2mVddd-tgyMtIK3dgE44","pdfSize":"669836"}
