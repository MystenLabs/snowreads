  "abstract": "  The earliest stages of star and cluster formation are hidden within dense\ncocoons of gas and dust, limiting their detection at optical wavelengths. With\nthe unprecedented infrared capabilities of JWST, we can now observe\ndust-enshrouded star formation with $\\sim$10 pc resolution out to $\\sim$20 Mpc.\nEarly findings from PHANGS-JWST suggest that 3.3 $\\mu$m polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbon (PAH) emission can identify star clusters in their dust-embedded\nphases. Here, we extend this analysis to 19 galaxies from the PHANGS-JWST Cycle\n1 Treasury Survey, providing the first characterization of compact sources\nexhibiting 3.3$\\mu$m PAH emission across a diverse sample of nearby\nstar-forming galaxies. We establish selection criteria, a median color\nthreshold of F300M-F335M=0.67 at F335M=20, and identify of 1816 sources. These\nsources are predominantly located in dust lanes, spiral arms, rings, and galaxy\ncenters, with $\\sim$87% showing concentration indices similar to optically\ndetected star clusters. Comparison with the PHANGS-HST catalogs suggests that\nPAH emission fades within $\\sim$3 Myr. The H$\\alpha$ equivalent width of PAH\nemitters is 1-2.8 times higher than that of young PHANGS-HST clusters,\nproviding evidence that PAH emitters are on average younger. Analysis of the\nbright portions of luminosity functions (which should not suffer from\nincompleteness) shows that young dusty clusters may increase the number of\noptically visible $\\leq$ 3 Myr-old clusters in PHANGS-HST by a factor between\n$\\sim$1.8x-8.5x.\n",
