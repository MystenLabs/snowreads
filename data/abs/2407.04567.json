{"id":"2407.04567","title":"Anticipating Solar Flares","authors":"Hugh S. Hudson","authorsParsed":[["Hudson","Hugh S.",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2024 14:59:27 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-08","timestamp":1720191567000,"abstract":"  Solar flares commonly have a hot onset precursor event\" (HOPE), detectable\nfrom soft X-ray observations. Detecting this requires subtraction of pre-flare\nfluxes from the non-flaring Sun prior to the event, fitting an isothermal\nemission model to the flare excess fluxes by comparing the GOES passbands at\n1-8 A and 0.5-4 A, and plotting the timewise evolution of the flare emission in\na diagram of temperature \\textit{vs} emission measure. The HOPE then appears as\nan initial \"horizontal branch\" in this diagram. It precedes the non-thermal\nimpulsive phase of the flare and thus the flare peak in soft X-rays as well. We\nuse this property to define a \"flare anticipation index\" (FAI), which can serve\nas an alert for observational programs aimed at solar flares based on\nnear-real-time soft X-ray observations. This FAI gives lead times of a few\nminutes and produces very few false positive alerts even for flare brightenings\ntoo weak to merit NOAA classification.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WSGOLjt4a8AKyOCZAIAbMh4CivjegrstOExN1RCQfo4","pdfSize":"572814"}
