Here we show that this problem is well-posed in suitable Hardy-like\nspaces on the strip. Moreover, in this setting we completely solve this problem\nby providing not only an explicit formula for the optimizers but also for the\noptimal values. In addition, we briefly discuss some applications of these\nresults to interpolation theory and to Lieb-Thirring inequalities.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"ITzG-_BMetUUc69m5aS_hvLWhW-Sf2D4VxAnhsfAkHg","pdfSize":"709667","objectId":"0xba1a2a73622dc68ee159a938f5b9f407e769204c361b1d64f9a7538374f3a783","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
