  "abstract": "  This paper explores the evolution and monotonicity of geometric constants\nwithin the framework of extended Ricci flows, incorporating variable coupling\nparameters. Building on Hamiltons foundational Ricci flow and subsequent\nextensions by List (2008), we introduce modifications to the extended Ricci\nflow by varying parameters that affect the interaction between the metric and\nscalar fields. Specifically, we modify the coefficients in the evolution\nequations governing geometric constants, thereby introducing new degrees of\nfreedom in the analysis. The primary contributions include deriving evolution\nformulas for the modified geometric constant lambda under the extended and\nnormalized extended Ricci flows, and proving conditions under which\nmonotonicity is maintained.\n",
