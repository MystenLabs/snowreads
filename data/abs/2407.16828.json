Our approach optimizes trade-offs between\nkey metrics such as click-through and conversion rates by training on sampled\npreference vectors. A significant advantage is that after training, a single\nmodel can access the entire Pareto front, allowing it to be tailored to meet\nthe specific requirements of different stakeholders by adjusting an additional\ninput vector that weights the objectives. We validate the model's performance\nthrough extensive offline and online evaluation. For broader application and\nresearch, the source code is made available at\nhttps://github.com/otto-de/MultiTRON. The results confirm the model's ability\nto manage multiple recommendation objectives effectively, offering a flexible\ntool for diverse business needs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vFmKf7KtXw4S_5dHLS5xlJlgiyAum_A4LRkIS6mitR8","pdfSize":"554285","objectId":"0x120b6dd1f6db878f2312ff06d14d40b03816763b58300f14eb8ef76cddef5ddb","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
