If it is in\naddition very light, in the micro-eV range or up to a few orders of magnitude\nbelow, these oscillations could even exhibit a Rabi resonance. Though the\nmagnetic tuning required to convert a macroscopic number of neutrons into\nantineutrons is not realistic, sizeable enhancements remain possible. Building\non this observation, axionic realizations for this scenario are systematically\nanalyzed. For true QCD axion models, we find that the Goldstone boson nature of\nthe axion imposes the presence of axionless n-nbar mixing effects, either in\nvacuum or in decays, which are sufficiently constrained experimentally to leave\nno room for axion-induced oscillations. Thus, a generic scalar or axion-like\ndark matter background would have to exist to induce resonant n-nbar\noscillations. Yet, if Nature has taken that path to relate dark matter and\nbaryon number violation, the experimental signature would be striking and\ncertainly worth pursuing.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"omufcPfMCHgWHHFxQqXff2M0p3tkEd9_wjyiExQB8bc","pdfSize":"1516170"}
