In this paper, we show that an effective way to incorporate\ncontextual information is through a patch-based classifier. This patch\nclassifier is trained to identify classes present within an image region, which\nfacilitates the elimination of distractors and enhances the classification of\nsmall object segments. Specifically, we introduce Multi-scale Patch-based\nMulti-label Classifier (MPMC), a novel plug-in module designed for existing\nsemi-supervised segmentation (SSS) frameworks. MPMC offers patch-level\nsupervision, enabling the discrimination of pixel regions of different classes\nwithin a patch. Furthermore, MPMC learns an adaptive pseudo-label weight, using\npatch-level classification to alleviate the impact of the teacher's noisy\npseudo-label supervision the student. This lightweight module can be integrated\ninto any SSS framework, significantly enhancing their performance. We\ndemonstrate the efficacy of our proposed MPMC by integrating it into four SSS\nmethodologies and improving them across two natural image and one medical\nsegmentation dataset, notably improving the segmentation results of the\nbaselines across all the three datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eMA3yY3tROKzASMGq_Xxeh1Iu2yZ9qVRkVoytIme1Gg","pdfSize":"13199006"}
