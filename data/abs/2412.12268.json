  "abstract": "  Neutrino quantum kinetics in dense astrophysical environments is investigated\nrelying on the mean-field approximation. However, it remains to be understood\nwhether mean-field corrections could hinder flavor instabilities that are\notherwise foreseen. In this paper, we heuristically explore whether\nbeyond-mean-field effects due to neutrino degeneracy can affect the flavor\nconversion physics. We find that these corrections shift the stability regions\nfor a suite of (anti)neutrino distributions; a configuration of angular\ndistributions that is stable in the mean-field case can become unstable, or the\nflavor conversion of previously unstable ensembles can be damped. Our work\nshould serve as a motivation for further understanding the limitations of the\nmean-field treatment.\n",
