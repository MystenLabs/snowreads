However, the literature\nfor nonlinear, heterogeneous networked systems is comparatively less. In this\npaper we analyse the controllabiity aspect of a nonlinearly perturbed linear\nnetworked system. The basic assumption is that the linear system is\ncontrollable and the nonlinear perturbation functions satisfy Holder continuity\ncondition and in particular Lipschitz condition. The Boyd-Wong fixed point\ntheorem is employed to prove controllability of the nonlinear system. The\nresult is illustrated with numerical examples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8tAhfJsAMWkq6Rx18qLvHHUN2gdiwsj-yBgjL0WWoEs","pdfSize":"124437"}
