  "abstract": "  As a generalization of the classical knots, knotoids are equivalence classes\nof immersions of the oriented unit interval in a surface. In recent years, a\nvariety of invariants of spherical and planar knotoids have been constructed as\nextensions of invariants of classical and virtual knots. In this paper we\nintroduce a three-variable transcendental invariant of planar knotoids which is\ndefined over an index function of a Gauss diagram. We describe properties of\nthis invariant and show that it is a Vassiliev invariant of order one. We also\ndiscuss the Gordian distance between planar knotoids and provide lower bounds\non the Gordian distance of homotopic planar knotoids by using the\ntranscendental invariant.\n",
