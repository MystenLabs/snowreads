  "abstract": "  Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), the process of creation of lightest elements\nin the early universe, is a highly robust, precise, and ultimately successful\ntheory that forms one of the three pillars of the standard hot-Big-Bang\ncosmological model. Existing theoretical treatments of BBN and the associated\ncomputer codes are accurate and flexible, but are typically highly technical\nand opaque, and not suitable for pedagogical understanding of the BBN. Here we\npresent BBN-simple -- a from-scratch numerical calculation of the lightest\nelement abundances pitched at an advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate\nlevel. We review the physics of the early universe relevant for BBN, provide\ninformation about the reaction rates, and discuss computational-mathematics\nbackground that is essential in setting up a BBN calculation. We calculate the\nabundances of the principal nuclear species in a standard cosmological model,\nand find a reasonably good agreement with public precision-level BBN codes.\n",
