A graph $G$ of order $n$ is called Diophantine if\nthere exists a labeling function $f$ of vertices such that gcd$(f(u); f(v))$\ndivides $n$ for every two adjacent vertices $u; v$ in $G$. In this work,\nmaximal Diophantine graphs on $n$ vertices, $D_n$, are defined, studied and\ngeneralized. The independence number, the number of vertices with full degree\nand the clique number of $D_n$ are computed. Each of these quantities is the\nbasis of a necessary condition for the existence of such a labeling.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"g1KWAQY48smPB4XXIBqlIp7-3uG0J5yU-nKjxn2BQTM","pdfSize":"219849"}
