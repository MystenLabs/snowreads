Our analysis of\napproximately 370 thousand high-quality samples yielded a high-precision\naverage extinction curve for the Milky Way. After incorporating infrared\nphotometric data from 2MASS and WISE, the extinction curve spans wavelengths\nfrom 0.336 to 4.6 $\\mu$m. We determine an average $R_{55}$ of $2.730 \\pm\n0.007$, corresponding to $R_V= 3.073 \\pm 0.009$, and a near-infrared power-law\nindex $\\alpha$ of $1.935 \\pm 0.037$. Our study confirmed some\nintermediate-scale structures within the optical range. Two new features were\nidentified at 540 and 769 nm, and their intensities exhibited a correlation\nwith extinction and $R_V$. This extinction curve can be used to investigate the\ncharacteristics of dust and enhance the extinction correction of Milky Way\nstars. A Python package for this extinction curve is available.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"yLo4_E8pqbXVUfIPOiq2OD5FmtzppUvcFy1_wuJzwVU","pdfSize":"2481940","objectId":"0x486f08f7c34305ec069729c0504c6d476bc21d35e2c537e4827b15eb60361d85","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
