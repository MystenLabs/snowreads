Inspired by living systems, we investigate the\nemergence of prosocial behavior among autonomous agents that are motivated by\nhomeostatic self-regulation. We perform multi-agent reinforcement learning,\ntreating each agent as a vulnerable homeostat charged with maintaining its own\nwell-being. We introduce an empathy-like mechanism to share homeostatic states\nbetween agents: an agent can either \\emph{observe} their partner's internal\nstate (cognitive empathy) or the agent's internal state can be \\emph{directly\ncoupled} to that of their partner's (affective empathy). In three simple\nmulti-agent environments, we show that prosocial behavior arises only under\nhomeostatic coupling - when the distress of a partner can affect one's own\nwell-being. Our findings specify the type and role of empathy in artificial\nagents capable of prosocial behavior.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Multiagent Systems","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hCgPm-L1BxhwuZbyNqHz4SsU3SliHsG4310G2rfPGdw","pdfSize":"2585911"}
