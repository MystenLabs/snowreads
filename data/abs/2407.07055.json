Establishing tissue-level morphology critically\nrelies on how every single cell decides to position itself relative to its\nneighboring cells. Despite its importance, it remains a major challenge to\nunderstand and predict the behavior of every cell within the living tissue over\ntime during such intricate processes. To tackle this question, we propose a\ngeometric deep learning model that can predict multicellular folding and\nembryogenesis, accurately capturing the highly convoluted spatial interactions\namong cells. We demonstrate that multicellular data can be represented with\nboth granular and foam-like physical pictures through a unified graph data\nstructure, considering both cellular interactions and cell junction networks.\nWe successfully use our model to achieve two important tasks, interpretable 4-D\nmorphological sequence alignment, and predicting local cell rearrangements\nbefore they occur at single-cell resolution. Furthermore, using an activation\nmap and ablation studies, we demonstrate that cell geometries and cell junction\nnetworks together regulate local cell rearrangement which is critical for\nembryo morphogenesis. This approach provides a novel paradigm to study\nmorphogenesis, highlighting a unified data structure and harnessing the power\nof geometric deep learning to accurately model the mechanisms and behaviors of\ncells during development. It offers a pathway toward creating a unified dynamic\nmorphological atlas for a variety of developmental processes such as\nembryogenesis.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"b85Woz1veMqCQDOnaS4sKrZVdJ2-BStYUnxYHway0rY","pdfSize":"13433789"}
