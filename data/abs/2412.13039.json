  "abstract": "  Stars are unique bodies of the Universe where self-gravity compress matter to\nsuch high temperature and density that several nuclear fusion reactions ignite,\nproviding enough feedback against further compression for a time that can be\neven larger than the age of the universe. The main property of a star is its\nmass because it determines its structure, evolutionary history, age, and\nultimate fate. Depending on this quantity, stars are broadly classified as\nlow-mass stars, like our Sun, intermediate mass stars as the variable star\nDelta Cephei, and massive stars as Betelgeuse, a red supergiant star in Orion\nconstellation. Here we will introduce the basic notions useful to understand\nstellar evolution of low- and intermediate- mass stars. This mass range (0.1\nM$_{\\odot}$ - 10.0 M$_{\\odot}$) deserves special attention, as it contains most\nof the stars in the universe. This chapter will focus on how these stars form,\nthe processes that drive their evolution, and key details regarding their\nstructure. Finally, we will discuss the death of such stars, emphasizing the\nunique fates associated with low- and intermediate-mass stars.\n",
