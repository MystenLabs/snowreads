Our\nmethod is based on a perturbative expansion of electron-phonon and\nelectron-light couplings in the time-dependent adiabatic GW (TD-aGW) theory. We\nshow that excitonic effects in the IR absorption spectrum can be included by\nreplacing the free electron-hole propagators in the perturbative expression for\nindependent particles with their interacting counterparts, which are readily\navailable from standard GW-Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations. For Raman\nspectrum, our derived expression agrees with the single and double resonance\nterms from a diagrammatic approach. We show significant excitonic enhancement\nin both the IR and resonance Raman scattering intensity for monolayer MoS2,\nWS2, and WSe2. Moreover, the exciton-phonon coupling strength and exciton\nenergy landscape can be accessed by analyzing resonance Raman spectrum of these\nmaterials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OaL4h13MEsrHUO1NH9Ml5M5PKpLzYeOP8DyTNntXUEs","pdfSize":"1210259"}
