We show that if the stable model of $C$\nhas bad reduction over a prime $p$ then $p \\leq d/4$. We give an algorithm to\ncompute the set of such $p$ using the so-called refined Humbert invariant\nintroduced by Kani. Using results from Kudla-Rapoport and the formula of\nGross-Keating, we compute for each of these primes $p$ its exponent in the\ndiscriminant of the stable model of $C$. We conclude with some explicit\ncomputations for $d<100$ and compare our results with an unpublished formula by\nthe third author.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Z5jQ7fIw-dQBSpZe8DqLmWB-ez3nECKmPP7CtJrtrLc","pdfSize":"497189"}
