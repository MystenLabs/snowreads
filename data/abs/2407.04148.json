The Lame\ncoefficients and the density of the half-plane are assumed to be power\nfunctions of depth. The model is different from the standard static model have\nbeen used in contact mechanics since the Sixties and originated from the 1964\nRostovtsev exact solution of the Flamant problem of a power-law graded\nhalf-plane. To solve the governing dynamic equations with variable coefficients\nwritten in terms of the displacements, we propose a method that, by means of\nthe Fourier and Mellin transforms, maps the model problem to a Carleman\nboundary value problem for two meromorphic functions in a strip with two shifts\nor, equivalently, to a system of two difference equations of the second order\nwith variable coefficients. By partial factorization the Carleman problem is\nrecast as a system of four singular integral equations on a segment with a\nfixed singularity and highly oscillating coefficients. A numerical method for\nits solution is proposed and tested. Numerical results for the displacement and\nstress fields are presented and discussed.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"B1cyb2TisZrY2rfrdjR8B9cA-OHmKtuXlJCam2D_suI","pdfSize":"287899"}
