  "abstract": "  Diabetic Retinopathy is one of the most familiar diseases and is a diabetes\ncomplication that affects eyes. Initially, diabetic retinopathy may cause no\nsymptoms or only mild vision problems. Eventually, it can cause blindness. So\nearly detection of symptoms could help to avoid blindness. In this paper, we\npresent some experiments on some features of diabetic retinopathy, like\nproperties of exudates, properties of blood vessels and properties of\nmicroaneurysm. Using the features, we can classify healthy, mild\nnon-proliferative, moderate non-proliferative, severe non-proliferative and\nproliferative stages of DR. Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and Naive\nBayes classifiers are used to classify the stages. Finally, Random Forest is\nfound to be the best for higher accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 76.5%,\n77.2% and 93.3% respectively.\n",
