  "abstract": "  The transverse momentum dependent (TMD) soft function and Collins-Soper (CS)\nkernel may be obtained by formulating the Wilson line in terms of auxiliary\none-dimensional fermion fields on the lattice. Our computation takes place in\nthe region of the lattice that corresponds to the \"spacelike\" region in\nMinkowski space in order to obtain the Collins soft function. The matching of\nour result to the Collins soft function is achieved through the mapping of the\nauxiliary field directional vector that to the Wilson line rapidity. In\nEuclidean space, this directional vector is complex, having a purely imaginary\ntime component. We present some exploratory numerical results of our lattice\ncalculation, and discuss the methodology employed.\n",
