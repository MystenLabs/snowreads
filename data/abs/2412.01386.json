The workshop series employs two key strategies: (1)\nconducting workshops directly in countries with interested audiences, and (2)\ndesigning the series for easy expansion to new venues. The first iteration of\nthe CLASSLA-Express workshop series encompasses 6 workshops in 5 countries. Its\ngoal is to share knowledge on the use of corpus querying tools, as well as the\nrecently-released CLASSLA-web corpora - the largest general corpora for South\nSlavic languages. In the paper, we present the design of the workshop series,\nits current scope and the effortless extensions of the workshop to new venues\nthat are already in sight.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"KqouNG4Vgz4nselzQ6mFyNxDmEjMjSCJKoT7nQyIkbo","pdfSize":"261627"}
