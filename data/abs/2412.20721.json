Marcus, D. Spielman, and N.\nSrivastava at the 2024 International Congress of Basic Science (ICBS) in July,\n2024. Its purpose is to explain the developments surrounding this work over the\npast ten or so years, with an emphasis on connections to other areas of\nmathematics. Earlier surveys about the interlacing families method by the same\nauthors focused on applications in functional analysis, whereas the focus here\nis on applications in spectral graph theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computer Science/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hr_RR5iDvqK5hNyB0BubGUd6AxcV3pMEv7jmqLlWE3Q","pdfSize":"208456"}
