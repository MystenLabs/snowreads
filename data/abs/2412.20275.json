  "abstract": "  In image classification tasks, deep learning models are vulnerable to image\ndistortion. For successful deployment, it is important to identify distortion\nlevels under which the model is usable i.e. its accuracy stays above a\nstipulated threshold. We refer to this problem as Model Assurance under Image\nDistortion, and formulate it as a classification task. Given a distortion\nlevel, our goal is to predict if the model's accuracy on the set of distorted\nimages is greater than a threshold. We propose a novel classifier based on a\nLevel Set Estimation (LSE) algorithm, which uses the LSE's mean and variance\nfunctions to form the classification rule. We further extend our method to a\n\"few sample\" setting where we can only acquire few real images to perform the\nmodel assurance process. Our idea is to generate extra synthetic images using a\nnovel Conditional Variational Autoencoder model with two new loss functions. We\nconduct extensive experiments to show that our classification method\nsignificantly outperforms strong baselines on five benchmark image datasets.\n",
