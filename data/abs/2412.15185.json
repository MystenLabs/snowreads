Traditionally, tiles have been\nconstructed manually, a method that poses significant limitations in\nscalability and flexibility. Recent research has attempted to automate this\nprocess using generative models. However, current approaches primarily focus on\ntiling textures and manipulating models for single-image generation, without\ninherently supporting the creation of multiple interconnected tiles across\ndiverse domains. This paper presents Tiled Diffusion, a novel approach that\nextends the capabilities of diffusion models to accommodate the generation of\ncohesive tiling patterns across various domains of image synthesis that require\ntiling. Our method supports a wide range of tiling scenarios, from self-tiling\nto complex many-to-many connections, enabling seamless integration of multiple\nimages. Tiled Diffusion automates the tiling process, eliminating the need for\nmanual intervention and enhancing creative possibilities in various\napplications, such as seamlessly tiling of existing images, tiled texture\ncreation, and 360{\\deg} synthesis.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"w75mDgnsdkPjrBJcxGveeYIT8B1tzXfbPZmMqg2VE4o","pdfSize":"37744874"}
