  "abstract": "  The accurate prediction of antigen-antibody structures is essential for\nadvancing immunology and therapeutic development, as it helps elucidate\nmolecular interactions that underlie immune responses. Despite recent progress\nwith deep learning models like AlphaFold and RoseTTAFold, accurately modeling\nantigen-antibody complexes remains a challenge due to their unique evolutionary\ncharacteristics. HelixFold-Multimer, a specialized model developed for this\npurpose, builds on the framework of AlphaFold-Multimer and demonstrates\nimproved precision for antigen-antibody structures. HelixFold-Multimer not only\nsurpasses other models in accuracy but also provides essential insights into\nantibody development, enabling more precise identification of binding sites,\nimproved interaction prediction, and enhanced design of therapeutic antibodies.\nThese advances underscore HelixFold-Multimer's potential in supporting antibody\nresearch and therapeutic innovation.\n",
