We find\nthat, despite the strong ISRS, these systems tolerate well easy-to-implement\nsuboptimal launch power profiles, with marginal throughput loss.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mxO5omhCxrhENPfSw2KyUKP1uCmf3qjXKjne_TVRSz8","pdfSize":"949970"}
