Here, we propose a Gr\\\"{u}neisen parameter, the\nrotational Gr\\\"{u}neisen ratio $\\Gamma_\\phi$, by introducing the orientation of\nthe external field as a control parameter. We investigate $\\Gamma_\\phi$ of the\nhighly anisotropic paramagnets CeRhSn and CeIrSn by measuring the rotational\nmagnetocaloric effect in a wide range of temperatures and magnetic fields. We\nfind that the $\\Gamma_\\phi$ data of both compounds are scaled by using the same\ncritical exponents and the field-invariant critical field angle. Remarkably,\nthe scaling function for the $\\Gamma_\\phi$ data reveals the presence of highly\nanisotropic quantum criticality that develops as a function of the easy-axis\ncomponent of the magnetic field from the quantum critical line. This paper\nprovides a thermodynamic approach to detect and identify magnetic quantum\ncriticality in highly anisotropic systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"p-IPnwnlbNf1RcY4jgS3_7QaTug0po8gXkCKSFlwKwU","pdfSize":"816490"}
