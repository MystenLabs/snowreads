Thus a UV theory which introduces\nquark color-flavor monopoles can naturally realize alignment without decoupling\nand can furthermore revive the Weinberg-Wilczek axion. As an example we\nconsider the $SU(9)$ theory of color-flavor unification, which needs no new\nfermions. This is the first model-building use of non-invertible symmetry to\nfind a Dirac natural explanation for a small $\\textit{relevant}$ parameter.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kkX6fqfEVd4P5tjWNvVrv8uemhR8UH4ceAkZDxuBsfk","pdfSize":"1661616"}
