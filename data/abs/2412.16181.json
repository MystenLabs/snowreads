Recent work [He et al. ICML2022] has advanced the\nstate-of-the-art for the Ranking Problem using learning-based methods,\nimproving upon multiple previous approaches. However, the connection to MWFAS\nremains underexplored. This paper investigates this relationship and presents\nefficient combinatorial algorithms for solving MWFAS, thus addressing the\nRanking Problem. Our experimental results demonstrate that these simple,\nlearning-free algorithms not only significantly outperform learning-based\nmethods in terms of speed but also generally achieve superior ranking accuracy.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Information Retrieval","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"GHf2OS3mxbyB6zvopAjizTEnmJhlzwFc6xkI3r26b4Q","pdfSize":"206315"}
