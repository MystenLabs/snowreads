Vast scholarship\nexists aimed at addressing these two issues separately, but surprisingly few\npapers attempt to address them simultaneously. In practice, when faced with\nsimultaneous missing data and confounding, analysts may proceed by first\nimputing missing data and subsequently using outcome regression or\ninverse-probability weighting (IPW) to address confounding. However, little is\nknown about the theoretical performance of such $\\textit{ad hoc}$ methods. In a\nrecent paper Levis $\\textit{et al.}$ outline a robust framework for tackling\nthese problems together under certain identifying conditions, and introduce a\npair of estimators for the average treatment effect (ATE), one of which is\nnon-parametric efficient. In this work we present a series of simulations,\nmotivated by a published EHR based study of the long-term effects of bariatric\nsurgery on weight outcomes, to investigate these new estimators and compare\nthem to existing $\\textit{ad hoc}$ methods. While the latter perform well in\ncertain scenarios, no single estimator is uniformly best. As such, the work of\nLevis $\\textit{et al.}$ may serve as a reasonable default for causal inference\nwhen handling confounding and missing data together.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9wJr5OEnZXRCk382AxOkQQ6vIDyun7G8gNq000RF-wE","pdfSize":"633840"}
