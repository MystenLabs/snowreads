The neurons that\nmanage information encoding, transferring, and processing with high energy\nconsumption, displaying a phenomenon called slow afterhyperpolarization after\nburst firing, whose properties are affected by the energy conditions. Here we\nconstructed a thermodynamical model to quantitatively describe the sAHP process\ngenerated by $Na^+-K^+$ ATPases(NKA) and the Calcium-activated potassium(K(Ca))\nchannels. The model simulates how the amplitude of sAHP is effected by the\nintracellular ATP concentration and ATP hydrolysis free energy $\\Delta$ G. The\nresults show a trade-off between NKA and the K(Ca)'s modulation on the sAHP's\nenergy dependence, and also predict an alteration of sAHP's behavior under\ninsufficient ATP supply if the proportion of NKA and K(Ca)'s expression\nquantities is changed. The research provides insights in understanding the\nmaintenance of neural homeostasis and support furthur researches on\nmetabolism-related and neurodegenerative diseases.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"j_kJb6sJNLuZB1TA2lSymxfJCGbjkkytM-R5daPjLag","pdfSize":"8648839"}
