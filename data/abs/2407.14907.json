The motivating questions concern monotonic\ndeterminacy of a query using views w.r.t. rules, which refers to the ability to\nrecover the query answer from the views via a monotone function. We study the\ndecidability of monotonic determinacy, and compare with variations that require\nthe ``recovery function'' to be in a well-known monotone query language, such\nas conjunctive queries or Datalog. Surprisingly, we find that even in the\npresence of basic existential rules, the borderline between well-behaved and\nbadly-behaved answerability differs radically from the unconstrained case. In\norder to understand this boundary, we require new results concerning entailment\nproblems involving views and rules.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2hd6Vj-X0oh0ewqRncoId8mXX9lF36zZUUt6jSrn5SU","pdfSize":"1480143"}
