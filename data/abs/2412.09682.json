However, while black hole mechanics\nexhibits well-known thermodynamic parallels, a rigorous geometric\ninterpretation of thermodynamic variables directly from the field equations\nwarrants further research. In this manuscript, we present a thermodynamic\nformulation of the field equations through the decomposition of the Riemann\ntensor, employing the Geroch-Held-Penrose (GHP) formalism, to clarify a strong\ncorrespondence between black hole thermodynamic variables and geometrical\nquantities derived from horizon geometry. Our analysis reveals an intrinsic\nconnection between the Penrose and Rindler $K$-curvature and the Smarr\nrelation, motivating a revised definition of both trapping gravity and black\nhole internal energy. Additionally, we derive through this GHP formalism the\nSmarr formula for the Reissner-N\\\"ordstrom black hole cointained in an AdS\nspacetime and we explore the implications of this relationship for black holes\nwith exotic topologies and in the context of extended theories, exemplified by\n$f(R)$ gravity. These findings suggest a deeper geometrical basis for black\nhole thermodynamics, potentially advancing our understanding of gravitational\nenergy, horizon entropy, and their significance within quantum gravity\nframeworks.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8SZlMV3X95L5c4A6cfkZZGJGk9aDHsBxPWcQpG0kVLc","pdfSize":"261603"}
