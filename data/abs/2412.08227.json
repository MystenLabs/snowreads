  "abstract": "  This article presents the results of a study based on a group of\nparticipants' interactions with an experimental sound installation at the\nNational Science and Media Museum in Bradford, UK. The installation used audio\naugmented reality to attach virtual sound sources to a vintage radio receiver\nfrom the museum's collection, with a view to understanding the potentials of\nthis technology for promoting exploration and engagement within museums and\ngalleries. We employ a practice-based design ethnography, including a thematic\nanalysis of our participants' interactions with spatialised interactive audio,\nand present an identified sequence of interactional phases. We discuss how\naudio augmented artefacts can communicate and engage visitors beyond their\ntraditional confines of line-of-sight, and how visitors can be drawn to engage\nfurther, beyond the realm of their original encounter. Finally, we provide\nevidence of how contextualised and embodied interactions, along with authentic\naudio reproduction, evoked personal memories associated with our museum\nartefact, and how this can promote interest in the acquisition of declarative\nknowledge. Additionally, through the adoption of a functional and theoretical\naura-based model, we present ways in which this could be achieved, and,\noverall, we demonstrate a material object's potential role as an interface for\nengaging users with, and contextualising, immaterial digital audio archival\ncontent.\n",
