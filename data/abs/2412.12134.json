  "abstract": "  This paper investigates the complex dynamics and fractal attractors that\nemerge from 60-dimensional ring lattice systems of electrically coupled\nnon-chaotic Rulkov neurons. Although networks of chaotic Rulkov neurons are\nwell-studied, systems of non-chaotic Rulkov neurons have not been extensively\nexplored due to the piecewise complexity of the non-chaotic Rulkov map. We find\nrich dynamics emerge from the electrical coupling of regular spiking Rulkov\nneurons, including chaotic spiking, chaotic bursting, and complete chaos. We\nalso discover general trends in the maximal Lyapunov exponent among different\nring lattice systems as the electrical coupling strength between neurons is\nvaried. By means of the Kaplan-Yorke conjecture, we also examine the fractal\ngeometry of the chaotic attractors of the ring systems and find various\ncorrelations and differences between the fractal dimensions of the attractors\nand the chaotic dynamics on them.\n",
