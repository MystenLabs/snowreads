  "abstract": "  It is well known that intra-life learning, defined as an additional\ncontroller optimization loop, is beneficial for evolving robot morphologies for\nlocomotion. In this work, we investigate this further by comparing it in two\ndifferent environments: an easy flat environment and a more challenging hills\nenvironment. We show that learning is significantly more beneficial in a hilly\nenvironment than in a flat environment and that it might be needed to evaluate\nrobots in a more challenging environment to see the benefits of learning.\n",
