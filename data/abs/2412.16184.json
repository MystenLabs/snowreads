In this work, we investigate this further by comparing it in two\ndifferent environments: an easy flat environment and a more challenging hills\nenvironment. We show that learning is significantly more beneficial in a hilly\nenvironment than in a flat environment and that it might be needed to evaluate\nrobots in a more challenging environment to see the benefits of learning.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7kn_7halbUTeVJylHE1mYgVMBaOIhNc5QGNgxqz5DC4","pdfSize":"262351"}
