Existing bias mitigation\nmethods focus on a small set of predefined biases, limiting their applicability\nin visual datasets where multiple, possibly unknown biases exist. To address\nthis limitation, we introduce MAVias, an open-set bias mitigation approach\nleveraging foundation models to discover spurious associations between visual\nattributes and target classes. MAVias first captures a wide variety of visual\nfeatures in natural language via a foundation image tagging model, and then\nleverages a large language model to select those visual features defining the\ntarget class, resulting in a set of language-coded potential visual biases. We\nthen translate this set of potential biases into vision-language embeddings and\nintroduce an in-processing bias mitigation approach to prevent the model from\nencoding information related to them. Our experiments on diverse datasets,\nincluding CelebA, Waterbirds, ImageNet, and UrbanCars, show that MAVias\neffectively detects and mitigates a wide range of biases in visual recognition\ntasks outperforming current state-of-the-art.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"-_Ta9Jten6zoB7B0ilcUg4x78c4gCED8r6amKbOUkxc","pdfSize":"4455261"}
