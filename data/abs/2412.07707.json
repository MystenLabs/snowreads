  "abstract": "  We study the large fluctuations of the work injected by the random force into\na Brownian particle under the action of a confining harmonic potential. In\nparticular, we compute analytically the rate function for generic uncorrelated\ninitial conditions, showing that, depending on the initial spread, it can\nexhibit no, one, or two singularities associated to the onset of linear tails.\nA dependence on the potential strength is observed for large initial spreads\n(entailing two singularities), which is lost for stationary initial conditions\n(giving one singularity) and concentrated initial values (no singularity). We\ndiscuss the mechanism responsible for the singularities of the rate function,\nidentifying it as a big jump in the initial values. Analytical results are\ncorroborated by numerical simulations.\n",
