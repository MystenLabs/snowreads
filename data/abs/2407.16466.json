In the case of complex nonlinear\nsystems however, these models tend to be expensive to evaluate, making\nsurrogate models quite valuable. Artificial neural networks approximate systems\nvery well by taking advantage of the inherent information of its given training\ndata. In this context, this paper investigates the improvement of the training\nprocess by including sensitivity information, which are partial derivatives\nw.r.t. inputs, as outlined by Sobolev training. In computational mechanics,\nsensitivities can be applied to neural networks by expanding the training loss\nfunction with additional loss terms, thereby improving training convergence\nresulting in lower generalisation error. This improvement is shown in two\nexamples of linear and non-linear material behavior. More specifically, the\nSobolev designed loss function is expanded with residual weights adjusting the\neffect of each loss on the training step. Residual weighting is the given\nscaling to the different training data, which in this case are response and\nsensitivities. These residual weights are optimized by an adaptive scheme,\nwhereby varying objective functions are explored, with some showing\nimprovements in accuracy and precision of the general training convergence.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xsP4t-ddDtJ5jVKvRcsOfwp8VSVGGnVZSpJ6qYOTITg","pdfSize":"4180713"}
