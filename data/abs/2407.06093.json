Yet this task is remarkably difficult\nto automate because of brevity and the absence of context. To address this gap,\nwe have developed a novel approach to generate and appropriately assign coarse\ndomain-specific labels. We show that a Large Language Model (LLM) can provide\nmetadata essential to the task, in a process akin to the augmentation of\nsupplemental knowledge representing human intuition, and propose a workflow. As\na pilot study, we use a corpus of award abstracts from the National Aeronautics\nand Space Administration (NASA). We develop new assessment tools in concert\nwith established performance metrics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"q1wpuWnRJcsPCMTXli_6Y57WZnVUs20Nv-dA_n616yE","pdfSize":"719489"}
