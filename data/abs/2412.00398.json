The main result of the paper states that if a\ntorsion-free minimax group $G$ of nilpotency class 2 admits a faithful\nirreducible representation $\\varphi $ over a finitely generated field $k$ such\nthat $chark \\notin Sp(G)$ then there exist a subgroup $N$ and an irreducible\nprimitive representation $\\psi $ of the subgroup $N$ over $k$ such that the\nrepresentation $\\varphi $ is induced from $\\psi $ and the quotient group\n$N/Ker\\psi $ is finitely generated.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RLbP01bNIsV-zEZK1C5kLMGk25DfQs5sXcMDmBGJhfE","pdfSize":"356103"}
