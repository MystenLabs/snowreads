In three\ndimensions, the well-known Efron's formula was used by Buchta & Reitzner and\nZinani to deduce the mean volume of a random tetrahedron in a tetrahedron and a\ncube. However, for higher moments and/or in higher dimensions, the method\nfails. As it turned out, the same problem is also solvable using the\nBlashke-Petkantschin formula in Cartesian parametrisation in the form of the\nCanonical Section Integral (Base-height splitting). In our presentation, we\nshow how to derive the older results mentioned above using our base-height\nsplitting method and also touch on the essential steps of how the method\ntranslates to higher dimensions and for higher moments.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"knQiA57JNkieP_a6j_uRWe2rFEj3axUxX5Mr7Tt13zw","pdfSize":"3829278"}
