Many undergraduates are\nencouraged to seek them out, but their actual efficacy is not well-established,\nand the out-of-state travel required for many attendees may prove a significant\nbarrier for the very students REUs wish to reach. We interviewed physics\ngraduate students who attended REUs as undergrauates, focusing on how the REUs\nbenefitted them, barriers they faced attending REUs, and their relationship\nwith their REU mentors. Interviewees reported benefits that aligned with the\nNSF goals: skills, enculturation, and knowledge they had not received in their\nundergraduate institutions. They also reported financial barriers they faced\nwhich they were able to overcome due to their financial privilege. Participants\nalso reported widely varying experiences with their mentors. Some mentors did\nand some did not meet their mentees where they were at in their career and\nskill levels. Some students did not know how to approach their mentors with\ntheir questions or needs.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1EZLKYCb3HAXcjxTC8RHfgjZNZ-3ZcZC4QU4h2rl3YM","pdfSize":"89797"}
