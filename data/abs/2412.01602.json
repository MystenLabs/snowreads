  "abstract": "  The cosmological polytope of a graph $G$ was recently introduced to give a\ngeometric approach to the computation of wavefunctions for cosmological models\nwith associated Feynman diagram $G$. Basic results in the theory of positive\ngeometries dictate that this wavefunction may be computed as a sum of rational\nfunctions associated to the facets in a triangulation of the cosmological\npolytope. The normalized volume of the polytope then provides a complexity\nestimate for these computations. In this paper, we examine the (Ehrhart)\n$h^\\ast$-polynomial of cosmological polytopes. We derive recursive formulas for\ncomputing the $h^\\ast$-polynomial of disjoint unions and $1$-sums of graphs.\nThe degree of the $h^\\ast$-polynomial for any $G$ is computed and a\ncharacterization of palindromicity is given. Using these observations, a tight\nlower bound on the $h^\\ast$-polynomial for any $G$ is identified and explicit\nformulas for the $h^\\ast$-polynomials of multitrees and multicycles are\nderived. The results generalize the existing results on normalized volumes of\ncosmological polytopes. A tight upper bound and a combinatorial formula for the\n$h^\\ast$-polynomial of any cosmological polytope are conjectured.\n",
