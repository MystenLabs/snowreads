We derive KS-like dualities via deconfinement, that is assuming\nonly Seiberg-like dualities, which instead just involve fundamental matter. Our\nderivation is split into two main steps. The first step is the construction of\ntwo families of linear quivers with $p\\!-\\!1$ nodes that confine into a\nrank-$2$ chiral field with degree-$(p\\!+\\!1)$ superpotential. Such chiral field\nis an $U(N)$ adjoint in 3d and an $USp(2N)$ antisymmetric in 4d. In the second\nstep we use these linear quivers to derive, via deconfinement, in a relatively\nstraightforward fashion, two classes of KS-like dualities: the Kim-Park duality\nfor $U(N)$ with adjoint in 3d and the Intriligator duality for $USp(2N)$ with\nantisymmetric in 4d. We also discuss the close relation of our 3d family of\nconfining unitary quivers to the 4d $\\mathcal{N}\\!=\\!2$ $D_p[SU(N)]$ SCFTs by\ncircle compactification and various deformations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Sbc5XNbRcY2NDkAKWiS5e7GDejCC1FQzl1LPWumBgYc","pdfSize":"1725047"}
