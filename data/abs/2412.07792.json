  "abstract": "  In their paper arXiv:2206.14108, Nat. Phys. 19, 1293 (2023), Eremets et al.\npresent experimental results for flux creep measurements using H$_{3}$S under\nhigh pressure in a diamond anvil cell, the pioneering material for the era of\nhydride superconductivity, with the aim of providing evidence that magnetic\nflux is trapped in H$_{3}$S under high pressure and that persistent currents\nare circulating there. Initially, it was thought that the measurements started\nimmediately after switching off the applied magnetic field, as indicated by the\nlabeling of the horizontal axis of Fig. 4c of arXiv:2206.14108, Nat. Phys. 19,\n1293 (2023). However, it was revealed in private communications by Eremets et\nal. to the author and in a later paper by Bud'ko et al. (2024) [1] that there\nwas a large delay time in starting the flux creep measurements. If that's the\ncase, the measurement period of 10$^{4}$ s or 10$^{5}$ s as shown in Fig. 4c is\ntoo short to draw any conclusions about flux creep, or even to determine\nwhether flux creep was being measured.\n",
