Previous analyses of this cohort study primarily focused\non caries (count response) or employed a Bayesian approach to the ordinal\nfluorosis outcome. This study is based on the expanded dataset that now\nincludes observations for age 23, whereas earlier works were restricted to ages\n9, 13, and/or 17 according to the participants' ages at the time of\nmeasurement. The adoption of a frequentist perspective enhances the\ninterpretability to a broader audience. Over a choice of several covariance\nstructures, separate models are formulated for the presence (zero versus\nnon-zero score) and severity (non-zero ordinal scores) of fluorosis, which are\nthen integrated through shared regression parameters. This comprehensive\nframework effectively identifies risk or protective effects of dietary and\nnon-dietary factors on dental fluorosis.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4wT2AhjcDqTTTIOL2ZZctr1uN2GTm1WJUnKFHiU6wBM","pdfSize":"509507"}
