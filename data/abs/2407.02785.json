In this study, the high-throughput\nmethod is employed to expedite discoveries of direct-gap silicon crystals. The\nmachine learning (ML) potential is utilized to construct a dataset comprising\n2637 silicon allotropes, which is subsequently screened using an ML Hamiltonian\nmodel and density functional theory calculations, resulting in identification\nof 47 direct-gap Si structures. We calculate transition dipole moments (TDM),\nenergies, and phonon bandstructures of these structures to validate their\nperformance. Additionally, we recalculate bandgaps of these structures\nemploying the HSE06 functional. 22 silicon allotropes are identified as\npotential photovoltaic materials. Among them, the energy per atom of Si22-Pm,\nwhich has a direct bandgap of 1.27 eV, is 0.026 eV/atom higher than diamond\nsilicon. Si18-C2/m, which has a direct bandgap of 0.796 eV, exhibits the\nhighest TDM among identified structures. Si16-P21/c, which has a direct bandgap\nof 0.907 eV, has the mass density of 2.316 g/cm3, which is the highest among\nidentified structures and higher than that of diamond silicon. The structure\nSi12-P1, which possesses a direct bandgap of 1.69 eV, exhibits the highest\nspectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME) among identified structures at\n32.28%, surpassing that of diamond silicon. This study offers insights into\nproperties of silicon crystals while presenting a systematic high-throughput\nmethod for material discovery.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"YFMzGW6oenx9NzKU6b9qfbEh7zSkKWX2IvAn-220Teo","pdfSize":"678081"}
