For a positive\ninteger $n$, an integral quadratic form defined over $R$ is called primitively\n$n$-universal if it primitively represents all quadratic forms of rank $n$. It\nwas proved in arXiv:2005.11268 that the minimal rank of primitively\n$1$-universal quadratic forms over the $p$-adic integer ring $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ is\n$2$ if $p$ is odd, and $3$ otherwise. In this article, we completely determine\nthe minimal rank of primitively $n$-universal quadratic forms over $R$ for any\npositive integer $n$ and any local ring $R$ such that $2$ is a unit or a prime.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ekNYKctTVk1h9FwEJCRcIOhWGc37N65pcg-nAB8P64I","pdfSize":"226499"}
