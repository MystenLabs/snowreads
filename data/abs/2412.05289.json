We present an overview of the current state of visualization\ntechniques and frameworks for KGs, in relation to four identified challenges.\nThe challenges in visualizing Knowledge Graphs include the need for intuitive\nand modular interfaces, performance in handling big data, and difficulties for\nusers in understanding and using query languages. We find frameworks that\ngenerally satisfy the intuitive UI, performance, and query support\nrequirements, but few satisfying the modularity requirement. In the context of\nKnowledge Graph Embeddings, we divide the approaches that use embeddings to\nfacilitate exploration of Knowledge Graphs from those that aim at the\nexplanation of the embeddings themselves. We find significant differences\nbetween the two perspectives. Finally, we highlight some possible directions\nfor future work, including diffusion of the unmet requirements, implementation\nof new visual features, and experimentation with relation visualization as a\npeculiar element of Knowledge Graphs.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Information Retrieval","Computer Science/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"k7JYjvQS-qxyaGYEk5E2CdOK52NgzO2QCnM8-_kvBZ4","pdfSize":"642188"}
