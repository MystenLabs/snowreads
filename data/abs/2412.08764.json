Here we introduce a one-space-dimensional model\nwhich, granted a finite perturbation series, fulfills the criteria for BML\ntrajectories and diffusion. We note that Planck's constant makes an appearance\nin the diffusion coefficient, which further differentiates the present theory\nfrom the work of Poincare and Einstein in the previous century.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ybQEcwjSILOEQJgpZnjszDN5IxvfLMGPtp6SptUPpc8","pdfSize":"884489"}
