We present observational results of H$_{2}$S 1$_{10}$-1$_{01}$,\nH$_{2}$$^{34}$S 1$_{10}$-1$_{01}$, H$_{2}$CS 5$_{14}$-4$_{14}$, HCS$^{+}$ 4-3,\nSiO 4-3, HC$_{3}$N 19-18 and C$^{18}$O 1-0 toward a sample of 51 late-stage\nmassive star-forming regions, to study relationships among H$_{2}$S, H$_{2}$CS,\nHCS$^{+}$ and SiO in hot cores. Chemical connections of these S-bearing\nmolecules are discussed based on the relations between relative abundances in\nsources. Results. H$_{2}$S 1$_{10}$-1$_{01}$, H$_{2}$$^{34}$S\n1$_{10}$-1$_{01}$, H$_{2}$CS 5$_{14}$-4$_{14}$, HCS$^{+}$ 4-3 and HC$_{3}$N\n19-18 were detected in 50 of the 51 sources, while SiO 4-3 was detected in 46\nsources. C$^{18}$O 1-0 was detected in all sources. The Pearson correlation\ncoefficients between H$_{2}$CS and HCS$^+$ normalized by H$_{2}$ and H$_{2}$S\nare 0.94 and 0.87, respectively, and a tight linear relationship is found\nbetween them with slope of 1.00 and 1.09, while they are 0.77 and 0.98 between\nH$_2$S and H$_2$CS, respectively, and 0.76 and 0.97 between H$_2$S and HCS$^+$.\nThe values of full width at half maxima (FWHM) of them in each source are\nsimilar to each other, which indicate that they can trace similar regions.\nComparing the observed abundance with model results, there is one possible time\n(2-3$\\times$10$^{5}$ yr) for each source in the model. The abundances of these\nmolecules increase with the increment of SiO abundance in these sources, which\nimplies that shock chemistry may be important for them. Conclusions. Close\nabundance relation of H$_2$S, H$_2$CS and HCS$^+$ molecules and similar line\nwidths in observational results indicate that these three molecules could be\nchemically linked, with HCS$^+$ and H$_2$CS the most correlated. The comparison\nof the observational results with chemical models shows that the abundances can\nbe reproduced for almost all the sources at a specific time. The observational\nresults, including abundances in these sources need to be considered in further\nmodeling H$_{2}$S, H$_{2}$CS and HCS$^{+}$ in hot cores with shock chemistry.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"msOFsXqUa9l63GjuIjKIurNPRlLwtNyMEgRncZec76Y","pdfSize":"1002907"}
