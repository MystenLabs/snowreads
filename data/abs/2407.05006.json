However, in the recent years research has greatly\nadvanced via collection of language-specific datasets and development of\ndownstream task technologies. Aiming to summarize this research up until May\n2024, this paper also seeks to identify potential areas of future work. To\nachieve this, the paper gives a broad, high-level overview of the linguistic\nproperties of the languages, the current coverage and performance of already\ndeveloped technology, application of transfer learning techniques from\nhigher-resource languages, and availability of labeled and unlabeled data for\neach language. Providing a summary of the current state of affairs, we hope\nthat further research will be facilitated with the considerations we provide in\nthe current paper.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"43Fy3-ZxguekUwFT1ocMqSpNFYEpVq7nhwOXo2XDoNE","pdfSize":"374680"}
