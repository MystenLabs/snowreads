  "abstract": "  As the demand for artificial intelligence (AI) grows to address complex\nreal-world tasks, single models are often insufficient, requiring the\nintegration of multiple models into pipelines. This paper introduces Bel\nEsprit, a conversational agent designed to construct AI model pipelines based\non user-defined requirements. Bel Esprit employs a multi-agent framework where\nsubagents collaborate to clarify requirements, build, validate, and populate\npipelines with appropriate models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this\nframework in generating pipelines from ambiguous user queries, using both\nhuman-curated and synthetic data. A detailed error analysis highlights ongoing\nchallenges in pipeline construction. Bel Esprit is available for a free trial\nat https://belesprit.aixplain.com.\n",
