An open set is called weakly $1$-convex (weakly\n$1$-semiconvex) if, through every boundary point of the set, there passes a\nstraight line (a closed ray) not intersecting the set. A closed set is called\nweakly $1$-convex (weakly $1$-semiconvex) if it is approximated from the\noutside by a family of open weakly $1$-convex (weakly $1$-semiconvex) sets. A\npoint of the complement of a set to the whole space is a $1$-nonconvexity\n($1$-nonsemiconvexity) point of the set if every straight line passing through\nthe point (every ray emanating from the point) intersects the set. It is proved\nthat if the collection of all $1$-nonconvexity ($1$-nonsemiconvexity) points\ncorresponding to an open weakly $1$-convex (weakly $1$-semiconvex) set is\nnon-empty, then it is open. It is also proved that the non-empty interior of a\nclosed weakly $1$-convex (weakly $1$-semiconvex) set in the space is weakly\n$1$-convex (weakly $1$-semiconvex).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Topology","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"h64uMWZtELRnHi0C05K-qzZH4R8HJjO7j0iNZ-bF9WQ","pdfSize":"386843"}
