Although this result is widely acknowledged\nin the literature, a detailed proof was previously absent. Our proof relies on\na generalization of the DuBois-Reymond Lemma. Furthermore, we establish the\nexistence of minimizers for the spline energy functional in cases where\nmultiple interpolation points are prescribed alongside just one velocity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"wqPWRRgt3u9RZ_rOkK25SMuhpzwNuoaZru-DGMrLNmY","pdfSize":"542839"}
