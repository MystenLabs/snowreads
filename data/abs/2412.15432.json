We have employed Monte\nCarlo (MC) simulations to calculate the thermodynamic quantities such as the\nmagnetization per spin $m_{L}^{\\mu}$, magnetic susceptibility $\\chi_{L}^{\\mu}$,\nand the reduced fourth-order Binder cumulant $U_{L}^{\\mu}$ as a function of\ntemperature $T$ and for several values of lattice size $L$. These quantities\nwere obtained for each layer ($\\mu=l)$, for the bulk system ($\\mu=b)$, as a\nfunction of interlayer distance $d$ and the parameter $\\alpha$ that defines the\nscale length of the exponential decay of the interaction. Furthermore, we\napplied the finite-size scaling theory to calculate the critical exponents. Our\nresults reveal that the system exhibits 2D Ising exponents when the layers are\nsufficiently separated. On the other hand, in the compact limit, where $d$\nequals the distance between two adjacent sites within the same layer, our bulk\nresults show that the system exhibits 3D Ising critical exponents, provided\nthat the number of layers $L_{z}$ increases proportionally to the layer sizes.\nEven with the separation increasing up to $d=2.0$, the layers are so correlated\nthat the set of critical exponents retains the values of 3D critical exponents.\nHowever, when the number of layers $L_{z}$ remains fixed, even in the compact\nlimit with periodic boundary conditions, only the exponent $\\beta$ aligns\nclosely with the predicted literature values, on the other hand, the other\nexponents show significant deviations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3I7RDDFQGtDRfo4cI6_b8BORps9orC0F_ApmX-wUTFw","pdfSize":"1982903"}
