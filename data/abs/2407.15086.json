The discovered\nconcepts can facilitate training manipulation policies and promote\ngeneralization. Current methods relying on multimodal foundation models for\nderiving key states usually lack accuracy and semantic consistency due to\nlimited multimodal robot data. In contrast, we introduce an\ninformation-theoretic criterion to characterize the regularities that signify a\nset of physical states. We also develop a framework that trains a concept\ndiscovery network using this criterion, thus bypassing the dependence on human\nsemantics and alleviating costly human labeling. The proposed criterion is\nbased on the observation that key states, which deserve to be conceptualized,\noften admit more physical constraints than non-key states. This phenomenon can\nbe formalized as maximizing the mutual information between the putative key\nstate and its preceding state, i.e., Maximal Mutual Information (MaxMI). By\nemploying MaxMI, the trained key state localization network can accurately\nidentify states of sufficient physical significance, exhibiting reasonable\nsemantic compatibility with human perception. Furthermore, the proposed\nframework produces key states that lead to concept-guided manipulation policies\nwith higher success rates and better generalization in various robotic tasks\ncompared to the baselines, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed\ncriterion.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"K1owEiOw5c4SuE8NzCS-rmx4Dg2EeFqzjZwja0Pr0Vg","pdfSize":"5974123"}
