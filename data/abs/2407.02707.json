Non-trivial\nrelations between equivalent expressions for the result are obtained by doing\nthe computation using functional, canonical and worldline methods. For $q=1$,\nthe results exhibit modular symmetry and may be expressed in terms of massive\nMaass-Jacobi forms. In the complex case with chemical potential for ${\\rm\nU}(1)$ charge turned on, the usual discussion of relativistic Bose-Einstein\ncondensation is modified by the presence of the small dimensions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0ChHTui91xgFwnQat67knfR_Swqf-IJ_kUZlzC1K8K4","pdfSize":"405374","objectId":"0x24f6d3b21750b3b4552cca89f019645c2feb1835b5c65afc37079fd504e8ecfa","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
