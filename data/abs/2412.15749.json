  "abstract": "  We demonstrate a photon proliferation effect from N-body dark matter (DM)\nannihilation in the early Universe, which can induce a drastic\nphoton-temperature shift after neutrino decoupling. For pseudoscalar DM mass\nbelow the eV scale, we show that the photon proliferation effect becomes\nsignificant as the mass approaches the ultralight end, due to the huge\nenhancement from the background DM number density. This presents the leading\nconstraints on the DM-photon coupling, DM self-interaction, and DM-electron\ncoupling, which are stronger than the existing bounds up to several orders of\nmagnitude. The present research can be extended to other interactions and DM\ncandidates, and highlights the importance of multi-body processes in the early\nUniverse.\n",
