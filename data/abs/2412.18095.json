Parameter reduction on neutrino sector occurs due to large mass\nhierarchies between charged-leptons mass eigenvalues and new singly-charged\nbosons in addition to this flavor symmetry. As a result, we have two complex\nfree parameters including modulus $\\tau$. We show several predictions in terms\nof verifiable observables such as Dirac CP, Majorana phases, sum of the\nneutrino masses, and the effective mass for neutrino double beta decay in\naddition to demonstrating allowed regions for our input parameters.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"zk6In6ovK59-yppM6qndYuxuyV1u2TiAh6bjLvuxm8g","pdfSize":"646605"}
