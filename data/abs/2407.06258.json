Assuming an initial Bunch-Davies state, unitary\ntime evolution implies an infinite set of cutting rules for the wavefunction to\nall orders in perturbation theory, collectively known as the cosmological\noptical theorem. In this work, we generalise these results to the case of\nBogoliubov initial states, accounting for both parity-even and parity-odd\ninteractions. We confirm our findings in a few explicit examples, assuming\nIR-finite interactions. In these examples, we preserve scale invariance by\nadiabatically turning on interactions in the infinite past rather than imposing\na Bogoliubov state at some finite initial time. Finally, we give a prescription\nfor computing Bogoliubov wavefunction coefficients from the corresponding\nBunch-Davies coefficients for both n-point contact and four-point exchange\ndiagrams.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sF3K0mMwIAevlH25RDFRs9BlOqr5GUyt6ayUis1Tjx0","pdfSize":"342326"}
