  "abstract": "  The quasisymmetric functions, $QSym$, are generalized for a finite alphabet\n$A$ by the colored quasisymmetric functions, $QSym_A$, in partially commutative\nvariables. Their dual, $NSym_A$, generalizes the noncommutative symmetric\nfunctions, $NSym$, through a relationship with a Hopf algebra of trees. We\ndefine an algebra $Sym_A$, contained within $QSym_A$, that is isomorphic to the\nsymmetric functions, $Sym$, when $A$ is an alphabet of size one. We show that\n$Sym_A$ is a Hopf algebra and define its graded dual, $PSym_A$, which is the\ncommutative image of $NSym_A$ and also generalizes $Sym$. The seven algebras\nlisted here can be placed in a commutative diagram connected by Hopf morphisms.\nIn addition to defining generalizations of the classic bases of the symmetric\nfunctions to $Sym_A$ and $PSym_A$, we describe multiplication,\ncomultiplication, and the antipode in terms of a basis for both algebras. We\nconclude by defining a pair of dual bases that generalize the Schur functions\nand listing open questions.\n",
