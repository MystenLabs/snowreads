These scenarios often involve\nsections that cannot accommodate two moving vehicles simultaneously due to the\npresence of stationary vehicles or limited road width. Autonomous vehicles must\ntherefore profoundly comprehend their surroundings to identify passable areas\nand execute sophisticated maneuvers. To address this issue, this paper presents\na comprehensive model for such an intricate scenario. The primary contribution\nis the principle of road width occupancy minimization, which models the narrow\nroad problem and identifies candidate meeting gaps. Additionally, the concept\nof homology classes is introduced to help initialize and optimize candidate\ntrajectories, while evaluation strategies are developed to select the optimal\ngap and most efficient trajectory. Qualitative and quantitative simulations\ndemonstrate that the proposed approach, SM-NR, achieves high scene pass rates,\nefficient movement, and robust decisions. Experiments conducted in tiny gap\nscenarios and conflict scenarios reveal that the autonomous vehicle can\nrobustly select meeting gaps and trajectories, compromising flexibly for safety\nwhile advancing bravely for efficiency.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TPTGunjJ4eRC6V01x7BYXj8IpzywLNPFix4l9aDWr2s","pdfSize":"8054845"}
