We prove\nthat such solutions are past causally geodesically incomplete and exhibit\nstable Kretschmann scalar blow-up in the contracting direction. In particular,\nthey are $C^2$-inextendible towards the past where causal geodesics become\nincomplete. Moreover, we show that geometry and matter are asymptotically\nvelocity term dominated toward the past, remaining close to their background\ncounterparts. Where the asymptotics do not coincide with those of the isotropic\nbackground solution, the momentum support of the Vlasov distribution approaches\na smooth one-dimensional subbundle of the mass shell. Compared to previous\nresults in higher dimensions, inhomogeneous terms in the wave and Vlasov\nequations factor in more strongly in our setting, which a priori creates\nadditional hurdles to establish stability. As a corollary, our main result\nshows that the Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture holds for certain polarized\n$U(1)$-symmetric solutions to the Einstein vacuum equations that emanate from a\nspatial hypersurface diffeomorphic to $M\\times\\mathbb{S}^1$.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hZXBP-IC89mCgMEWJZEdhiXDorE_eBF2eMW4iZQcFq0","pdfSize":"580260"}
