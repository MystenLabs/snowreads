For small values of $d$, we obtain a tight bound: for\n$d = O(\\sqrt{n})$, every $n$-vertex graph with minimum degree at least $(n+d)/2\n- 1$ is rigid in $\\mathbb{R}^d$. For larger values of $d$, we achieve an\napproximate result: for $d = O(n/{\\log^2}{n})$, every $n$-vertex graph with\nminimum degree at least $(n+2d)/2 - 1$ is rigid in $\\mathbb{R}^d$. This bound\nis tight up to a factor of two in the coefficient of $d$.\n  As a byproduct of our proof, we also obtain the following result, which may\nbe of independent interest: for $d = O(n/{\\log^2}{n})$, every $n$-vertex graph\nwith minimum degree at least $d$ has pseudoachromatic number at least $d+1$;\nnamely, the vertex set of such a graph can be partitioned into $d+1$ subsets\nsuch that there is at least one edge between each pair of subsets. This is\ntight.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_2iWjZyA9Rvoy9kWWlEP5PALX_1EfFNdau-8_1GXHBg","pdfSize":"297335"}
