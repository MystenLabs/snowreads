  "abstract": "  This paper studies the challenging task of makeup transfer, which aims to\napply diverse makeup styles precisely and naturally to a given facial image.\nDue to the absence of paired data, current methods typically synthesize\nsub-optimal pseudo ground truths to guide the model training, resulting in low\nmakeup fidelity. Additionally, different makeup styles generally have varying\neffects on the person face, but existing methods struggle to deal with this\ndiversity. To address these issues, we propose a novel Self-supervised\nHierarchical Makeup Transfer (SHMT) method via latent diffusion models.\nFollowing a \"decoupling-and-reconstruction\" paradigm, SHMT works in a\nself-supervised manner, freeing itself from the misguidance of imprecise\npseudo-paired data. Furthermore, to accommodate a variety of makeup styles,\nhierarchical texture details are decomposed via a Laplacian pyramid and\nselectively introduced to the content representation. Finally, we design a\nnovel Iterative Dual Alignment (IDA) module that dynamically adjusts the\ninjection condition of the diffusion model, allowing the alignment errors\ncaused by the domain gap between content and makeup representations to be\ncorrected. Extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method. Our code is available at\n\\url{https://github.com/Snowfallingplum/SHMT}.\n",
