However, how to integrate LLMs with trading systems has become a\nchallenge. To address this problem, we propose an intelligent trade order\nrecognition pipeline that enables the conversion of trade orders into a\nstandard format in trade execution. The system improves the ability of human\ntraders to interact with trading platforms while addressing the problem of\nmisinformation acquisition in trade execution. In addition, we have created a\ntrade order dataset of 500 pieces of data to simulate real-world trading\nscenarios. Moreover, we designed several metrics to provide a comprehensive\nassessment of dataset reliability and the generative power of big models in\nfinance by experimenting with five state-of-the-art LLMs on our dataset. The\nresults indicate that while LLMs demonstrate high generation rates (87.50% to\n98.33%) and perfect follow-up rates, they face significant challenges in\naccuracy (5% to 10%) and completeness, with high missing rates (14.29% to\n67.29%). In addition, LLMs tend to over-interrogate, suggesting that large\nmodels tend to collect more information, carrying certain challenges for\ninformation security.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LX-WPCBHWhO3eRxJXFZk3zvV0Ug4FqeCkssi9gUUzJU","pdfSize":"3151842"}
