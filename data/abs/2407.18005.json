Recent research has explored the strategic benefits and technical\nlimitations of BBS in various fields, including cybersecurity, healthcare,\neducation, and financial technologies. Despite growing interest from academia\nand industry, there is a lack of empirical evidence, leading to an incomplete\nunderstanding of the processes, methods, and techniques necessary for\nsystematic BBS development. Objectives: Existing research lacks a consolidated\nview, particularly empirically driven guidelines based on published evidence\nand development practices. This study aims to address the gap by consolidating\nempirical evidence and development practices to derive or leverage existing\nprocesses, patterns, and models for designing, implementing, and validating BBS\nsystems. Method: Tied to this knowledge gap, we conducted a two-phase research\nproject. First, a systematic literature review of 58 studies was performed to\nidentify a development process comprising 23 tasks for BBS systems. Second, a\nsurvey of 102 blockchain practitioners from 35 countries across six continents\nwas conducted to validate the BBS system development process. Results: Our\nresults revealed a statistically significant difference (p-value <.001) in the\nimportance ratings of 24 out of 26 BBS tasks by our participants. The only two\ntasks that were not statistically significant were incentive protocol design\nand granularity design. Conclusion: Our research is among the first to advance\nunderstanding on the aspect of development process for blockchain-based systems\nand helps researchers and practitioners in their quests on challenges and\nrecommendations associated with the development of BBS systems\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"nHCEAXpeNj5fBu9Go0rLYWDzvxJ0CUlP_hBn4NGfF7U","pdfSize":"1185635"}
