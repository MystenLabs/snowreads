However, novice contributors often feel\ndiscouraged due to various barriers. Gamification techniques hold the potential\nto foster engagement and facilitate the learning process. Nevertheless, it is\nunknown which game elements are effective in this context. This study explores\nstudents' perceptions of gamification elements to inform the design of a\ngamified learning environment. We surveyed 115 students and segmented the\nanalysis from three perspectives: (1) cognitive styles, (2) gender, and (3)\nethnicity (Hispanic/LatinX and Non-Hispanic/LatinX). The results showed that\nQuest, Point, Stats, and Badge are favored elements, while competition and\npressure-related are less preferred. Across cognitive styles (persona), gender,\nand ethnicity, we could not observe any statistical differences, except for\nTim's GenderMag persona, which demonstrated a higher preference for\nstorytelling. Conversely, Hispanic/LatinX participants showed a preference for\nthe Choice element. These results can guide tool builders in designing\neffective gamified learning environments focused on the OSS contributions\nprocess.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fp9nBP_YCwM9m-gMvKJK2ywBljRpfDpn6Pjumxn5GH8","pdfSize":"281591"}
