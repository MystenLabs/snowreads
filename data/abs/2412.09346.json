  "abstract": "  Time Series Motif Discovery (TSMD), which aims at finding recurring patterns\nin time series, is an important task in numerous application domains, and many\nmethods for this task exist. These methods are usually evaluated qualitatively.\nA few metrics for quantitative evaluation, where discovered motifs are compared\nto some ground truth, have been proposed, but they typically make implicit\nassumptions that limit their applicability. This paper introduces PROM, a\nbroadly applicable metric that overcomes those limitations, and TSMD-Bench, a\nbenchmark for quantitative evaluation of time series motif discovery.\nExperiments with PROM and TSMD-Bench show that PROM provides a more\ncomprehensive evaluation than existing metrics, that TSMD-Bench is a more\nchallenging benchmark than earlier ones, and that the combination can help\nunderstand the relative performance of TSMD methods. More generally, the\nproposed approach enables large-scale, systematic performance comparisons in\nthis field.\n",
