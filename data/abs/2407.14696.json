Inexact updates are performed\nusing a small randomly selected minibatch of the available B1+ measurements to\nupdate RF pulse weights, which perturbs the sequence of alternating\nprojections. Applications to RF shimming, parallel transmit spokes RF pulse\ndesign, and spectral-spatial RF pulse design are considered. Numerical and\nsimulation studies characterized the optimal minibatch size, which was found to\nconsistently produce lower power and lower RMSE solutions across subjects, coil\ngeometries, B1+ resolutions and orientations. The method was validated in-vivo\nat 7 Tesla and produced improvements in image quality in a slice-by-slice\nRF-shimmed imaging sequence. Compared to conventional methods, the pulse design\nmethod can more robustly design RF pulses that correct for B1+ inhomogeneities\nat ultra-high field strengths, and enable pulse designs to be completed with\nincreased computational efficiency\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gYQQXR6GNcL63mooFsCac0bgaEPWG4kDX8YwTxJA6jc","pdfSize":"3516078"}
