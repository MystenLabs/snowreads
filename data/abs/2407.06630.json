It can be integrated with various\nsoftware and simulation tools used in robotics (we have integrated it with\nARGoS, Gazebo, and ROS2), and also be deployed on real robots capable of Wi-Fi\ncommunications. The Toychain package supports the deployment of smart contracts\nwritten in Python (computer programs that can be executed by and synchronized\nacross a distributed network). The nodes in the blockchain can execute smart\ncontract functions by broadcasting transactions, which update the state of the\nblockchain upon agreement by all other nodes. The conditions for this agreement\nare established by a consensus protocol. The Toychain package allows for custom\nimplementations of the consensus protocol, which can be useful for research or\nmeeting specific application requirements. Currently, Proof-of-Work and\nProof-of-Authority are implemented.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ctzxTjfw8wwtNhifqHwzgvn7jzGsRPcap98h9EHbfvI","pdfSize":"191252"}
