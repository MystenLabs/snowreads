This kind of smooth solutions only emerges beyond the unstable de Sitter\nbranch $3\\alpha < \\beta$, $\\alpha$ being the coupling of the $R^2$ term and\n$-\\beta$ the coupling of the $R_{\\mu\\nu}^2$ term. We have analyzed the\nstability of these singularity-free solutions by computing the second-order\nvariation of the action. The complete analysis shows that a Big Bang can emerge\nfrom a singularity-free regime when the parameters of the theory are slightly\nmodified, revealing the unstable nature of this type of solutions.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kZENZpOHu9MqIsmOfrMlGo6u8_d7xZeJZFbi7pr1Bgs","pdfSize":"693809"}
