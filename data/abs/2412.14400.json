  "abstract": "  We study monotone persuasion in the linear case, where posterior\ndistributions over states are summarized by their mean. We solve the two\nleading cases where optimal unrestricted signals can be nonmonotone. First, if\nthe objective is s-shaped and the state is discrete, then optimal monotone\nsignals are upper censorship, whereas optimal unrestricted signals may require\nrandomization. Second, if the objective is m-shaped and the state is\ncontinuous, then optimal monotone signals are interval disclosure, whereas\noptimal unrestricted signals may require nonmonotone pooling. We illustrate our\nresults with an application to media censorship.\n",
