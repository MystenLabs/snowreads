Using self-consistent, hybrid-kinetic simulations with and without\npre-existing turbulence, we study the transition of a shock from ``laminar'' to\nturbulent. We show that the changes in upstream proton transport behaviour are\ncrucial to understand this transition, which we address quantitatively with a\nnovel Eulerian approach. This method, based on the coarse-graining of the\nVlasov equation originally introduced in one of our previous studies, gives\nconsistent results for inertial range scales. The potential applications of the\ncoarse-graining approach beyond the shock-turbulence system are outlined.\n","subjects":["Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YoccFjrr3ycRTMO9G7VUxVCw46qkCeg-HpsaQt6VG2s","pdfSize":"3463272"}
