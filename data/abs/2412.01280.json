Here we first tabulate 141 space groups hosting Hopf-link\nstructure and then investigate Phonon Database at Kyoto University consisting\nof 10034 materials to search for phonon realization of the Hopf-link nodal\nstructure. It is found that almost all the investigated materials own nodal\nloops or nodal chains while only 113 materials can host Hopf-link structure in\nphonon spectra, among which 8 representative materials are manually selected to\nshowcase relatively clean Hopf-link structure including LiGaS$_2$, LiInSe$_2$,\nCa$_2$Al$_2$Si(HO$_4$)$_2$, Ca$_7$GeN$_6$, Al(HO)$_3$, NaNd(GaS$_2$)$_4$,\nGa$_5$(PS)$_3$ and RbTh$_3$F$_{13}$. The visible phonon drumhead surface states\ncorresponding to the nodal loops in the Hopf-link structure are further\ndemonstrated using Ga$_5$(PS)$_3$ as an example.The listed 113 crystalline\nmaterials provide a good platform for experimentalists to further explore the\ninteresting properties related to Hopf-link structure.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bu77G-I5h6AAqgHnvjgyrcT-JXPPASPe4O4OD_VEGtU","pdfSize":"4314356"}
