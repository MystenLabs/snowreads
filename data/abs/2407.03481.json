First, we analyze the convergence of the OTA-FL system and derive the\noptimality gap to illustrate the influence of FAs on learning performance.\nThen, we formulate a nonconvex optimization problem to minimize the optimality\ngap by jointly optimizing the positions of the FAs and the beamforming vector.\nTo address the dynamic environment, we cast this optimization problem as a\nMarkov decision process (MDP) and propose the recurrent deep deterministic\npolicy gradient (RDPG) algorithm. Finally, extensive simulations show that the\nFA-assisted OTA-FL system outperforms systems with fixed-position antennas and\nthat the RDPG algorithm surpasses the existing methods.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Wn7fyJdHAGtKnQ1hmgGsJvOOM11a586OVHwZ5S2FOQ0","pdfSize":"1430908"}
