In this paper, we study\nthe functional identity $G_{1}(y)g(y)G_{2}(y) = H(y)$. By application of the\nresult and its implications, we prove that if $D$ is a non-commutative division\nring with characteristic different from $2$, then the only possible solution of\nadditive maps $g_{1},g_{2}: D \\rightarrow D$ satisfying the identity\n$g_{1}(y)y^{-m} + y^{n}g_{2}(y^{-1})= 0$ with $(m,n) \\neq (1,1)$ are positive\nintegers is $ g_{1} = g_{2} = 0$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"GjmBjcHeR0o4FvO34U60D72dDpT1RIKZZRsDoD9a3X8","pdfSize":"276977"}
