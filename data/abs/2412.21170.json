  "abstract": "  For the nonlinear Dirac equation with scalar self-interaction (the Soler\nmodel) in three spatial dimensions, we consider the linearization at solitary\nwave solutions and find the invariant spaces which correspond to different\nspherical harmonics, thus achieving the radial reduction of the spectral\nstability analysis. We apply the same technique to the bi-frequency solitary\nwaves (which are generically present in the Soler model) and show that they can\nalso possess linear stability properties similar to those of one-frequency\nsolitary waves.\n",
