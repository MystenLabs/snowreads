Para-Hermitian rational matrices\nare square rational matrices that are Hermitian for all $z$ on the unit circle\nthat are not poles. REPs are often solved via linearization, that is, using\nmatrix pencils associated to the corresponding rational matrix that preserve\nthe spectral structure. Yet, non-constant polynomial matrices cannot be\npara-Hermitian. Therefore, given a para-Hermitian rational matrix $R(z)$, we\ninstead construct a $*$-palindromic linearization for $(1+z)R(z)$, whose\neigenvalues that are not on the unit circle preserve the symmetries of the\nzeros and poles of $R(z)$. This task is achieved via M\\\"{o}bius\ntransformations. We also give a constructive method that is based on an\nadditive decomposition into the stable and anti-stable parts of $R(z)$.\nAnalogous results are presented for para-skew-Hermitian rational matrices,\ni.e., rational matrices that are skew-Hermitian upon evaluation on those points\nof the unit circle that are not poles.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"l3ylGwsvmk_eRhKVeKI6ZyePZ8IQRjUBrqi9Gl3wc4M","pdfSize":"296576"}
