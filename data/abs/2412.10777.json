However,\nthe key quantities in RM analysis like emissivity, responsivity, transfer\nfunctions, and mean and root-mean-square (RMS) spectra are fragmentally defined\nin the literature and largely lack a unified formulation. Here, we establish a\nrigorous framework for BLR RM and include a locally dependent responsivity\naccording to photoionization calculations. The mean and RMS spectra are\nanalytically expressed with emissivity- and responsivity-weighted transfer\nfunctions, respectively. We demonstrate that the RMS spectrum is proportional\nto the responsivity-weighted transfer function only when the continuum\nvariation timescale is much longer than the typical extension in time delay of\nthe BLR, otherwise, biases arise in the obtained RMS line widths. The\nlong-standing phenomenon as to the different shapes between mean and RMS\nspectra can be explained by a radial-increasing responsivity of BLRs. The\ndebate on the choice of emission line widths for SMBH mass measurements is\nexplored and the virial factors are suggested to also depend on the luminosity\nstates, in addition to the geometry and kinematics of BLRs.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3W7MraQl-xMjzd6Tkm3ZInVmVKp165B9GmOg-KvmLt8","pdfSize":"1210445"}
