The cube method allows for the selection of\nbalanced samples across various covariate types, ensuring consistent adherence\nto balance tests and, whence, substantial precision gains when estimating\ntreatment effects. We establish several statistical properties for the\npopulation and sample average treatment effects (PATE and SATE, respectively)\nunder randomization using the cube method. The relevance of the cube method is\nparticularly striking when comparing the behavior of prevailing methods\nemployed for treatment allocation when the number of covariates to balance is\nincreasing. We formally derive and compare bounds of balancing adjustments\ndepending on the number of units $n$ and the number of covariates $p$ and show\nthat our randomization approach outperforms methods proposed in the literature\nwhen $p$ is large and $p/n$ tends to 0. We run simulation studies to illustrate\nthe substantial gains from the cube method for a large set of covariates.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WRHehl1b6-6LJf1Extad5m3emW-fFdGYGm5SELlT--w","pdfSize":"1132467"}
