  "abstract": "  Assuming Calabi symmetry, we prove that a numerical condition ensures the\nsolvability of the complex $(k,l)$-Hessian equation, as conjectured by\nSz\\'ekelyhidi. We also propose a conjecture on the existence of a\n$k$-subharmonic representative in a given cohomology class and confirm it under\nthe assumption of Calabi symmetry or when the class is semiample.\n",
