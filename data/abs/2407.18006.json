The class $\\exists\n\\mathbb{R}$ has roots in two different traditions, one based on the\nBlum-Shub-Smale model of real computation, and the other following work by\nMn\\\"{e}v and Shor on the universality of realization spaces of oriented\nmatroids. Over the years the number of problems for which $\\exists \\mathbb{R}$\nrather than NP has turned out to be the proper way of measuring their\ncomplexity has grown, particularly in the fields of computational geometry,\ngraph drawing, game theory, and some areas in logic and algebra. $\\exists\n\\mathbb{R}$ has also started appearing in the context of machine learning,\nMarkov decision processes, and probabilistic reasoning.\n  We have aimed at collecting a comprehensive compendium of problems complete\nand hard for $\\exists \\mathbb{R}$, as well as a long list of open problems. The\ncompendium is presented in the third part of our survey; a tour through the\ncompendium and the areas it touches on makes up the second part. The first part\nintroduces the reader to the existential theory of the reals as a complexity\nclass, discussing its history, motivation and prospects as well as some\ntechnical aspects.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dmYOFsz7sYo_23g9V3TPh83p33c18c5BeMmRjF2mNDk","pdfSize":"2549074"}
