It plays a key role in various areas, such as fraud\ndetection, regulatory compliance, smart contract auditing, and decentralized\nfinance (DeFi) risk management. However, existing blockchain data analysis\ntools face challenges, including data scarcity, the lack of generalizability,\nand the lack of reasoning capability.\n  We believe large language models (LLMs) can mitigate these challenges;\nhowever, we have not seen papers discussing LLM integration in blockchain data\nanalysis in a comprehensive and systematic way. This paper systematically\nexplores potential techniques and design patterns in LLM-integrated blockchain\ndata analysis. We also outline prospective research opportunities and\nchallenges, emphasizing the need for further exploration in this promising\nfield. This paper aims to benefit a diverse audience spanning academia,\nindustry, and policy-making, offering valuable insights into the integration of\nLLMs in blockchain data analysis.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Cryptography and Security","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VYIDNfiiyvi-zFwN_73iihlYjVEEAt86Ql9XFlPXbrE","pdfSize":"1448997"}
