  "abstract": "  We present the results of a novel type of numerical simulation that realizes\na rotating Universe with a shear-free, rigid body rotation inspired by a\nG\\\"{o}del-like metric. We run cosmological simulations of unperturbed glasses\nwith various degrees of rotation in the Einstein-de Sitter and the $\\Lambda$CDM\ncosmologies. To achieve this, we use the StePS N-body code capable of\nsimulating the infinite Universe, overcoming the technical obstacles of\nclassical toroidal (periodic) topologies that would otherwise prevent us from\nrunning such simulations. Results show a clear anisotropy between the polar and\nequatorial expansion rates with more than $1\\%$ deviation from the isotropic\ncase for maximal rotation without closed timeline curves within the horizon,\n$\\omega_{0} \\approx 10^{-3}$ Gyr$^{-1}$; a considerable effect in the era of\nprecision cosmology.\n",
