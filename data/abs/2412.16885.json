  "abstract": "  The first quantum string theories were developed around 1970, prior to the\ndiscovery of QCD, with the goal of producing a theory of hadrons. Basic\nphysical requirements and mathematical consistency of the string theories known\nat that time turned out to require the inclusion of gravity and the existence\nof extra spatial dimensions. This came as a complete surprise to everyone who\nwas involved. It led to a completely new and very ambitious goal for string\ntheory research, namely a unified quantum theory of gravity and all other\nforces. In particular, this goal requires that the string tension is 20 orders\nof magnitude larger than was previously envisioned. Fifty years later, this\ngoal is widely shared.\n",
