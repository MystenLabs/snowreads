In this paper, we explore the feasibility of\nusing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on graph images to predict the\ncardinality of combinatorial properties of random graphs and networks.\nSpecifically, we use image representations of modified adjacency matrices of\nrandom graphs as training samples for a CNN model to predict the stability\nnumber of random graphs; where the stability number is the cardinality of a\nmaximum set of vertices in a graph that contains no pairwise adjacency between\nvertices. The model and results presented in this study suggest potential for\napplying deep learning in combinatorial optimization problems previously not\nconsidered by simple deep learning techniques.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"avcPRaR7IzvXnDwPxEm9EWIWsa4M1zWXambHMyUQJ8M","pdfSize":"719637","objectId":"0x70a0afb1462cc4469eb4a244a2ca241786cd3b988e45a5766ce616bac9cb9815","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
