  "abstract": "  Quantum low-density parity-check codes are promising candidates for quantum\nerror correcting codes as they might offer more resource-efficient alternatives\nto surface code architectures. In particular, bivariate bicycle codes have\nrecently gained attention due to their 2D-local structure, high encoding rate,\nand promising performance under simulation. In this work, we will explore how\none can transform bivariate bicycle codes defined on lattices with periodic\nboundary conditions to codes with the same locality properties on a 2D lattice\nwith open boundary conditions. For this, we introduce the concept of pruning\nquantum codes. We explain how pruning bivariate bicycle codes is always\npossible when the codes are hypergraph products of two classical cyclic codes.\nWe also indicate that this might be possible for more general bivariate bicycle\ncodes by constructing explicit examples. Finally, we investigate fault-tolerant\nquantum computation using the constructed pruned codes by describing\nfold-transversal gates.\n",
