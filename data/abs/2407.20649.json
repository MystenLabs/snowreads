The original\nformulation relies on a mean field theory, which is still most in use today. We\nemploy multiple methods, such as Molecular Dynamics, Metropolis Monte Carlo,\nMean Field Theory with chemical interactions and finite temperature effects to\nshow that the Zener ordering for iron carbon systems is governed by local\nchemical interactions and finite temperature effects and less of mean field\nnature as described originally by Zener.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"d27jSEL7Xix728fhxSkSPXbnNk95Gk5TOgFTIo20xa4","pdfSize":"586074"}
