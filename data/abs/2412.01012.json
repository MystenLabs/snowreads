  "abstract": "  We consider the optimal transportation problem on a globally hyperbolic\nspacetime for some Lorentzian cost function, which corresponds to the optimal\ntransportation problem on a complete Riemannian manifold where the cost\nfunction is the Riemannian distance squared. We establish existence and\nuniqueness results for the optimal transport map and we investigate the\nregularity of weak Kantorovich potentials.\n",
