Traditional\noptimization-based methods often require hours of computational time to\nreconstruct geometry, material properties, and environmental lighting from\ndense multi-view inputs, while still struggling with inherent ambiguities\nbetween lighting and material. On the other hand, learning-based approaches\nleverage rich material priors from existing 3D object datasets but face\nchallenges with maintaining multi-view consistency. In this paper, we introduce\nIDArb, a diffusion-based model designed to perform intrinsic decomposition on\nan arbitrary number of images under varying illuminations. Our method achieves\naccurate and multi-view consistent estimation on surface normals and material\nproperties. This is made possible through a novel cross-view, cross-domain\nattention module and an illumination-augmented, view-adaptive training\nstrategy. Additionally, we introduce ARB-Objaverse, a new dataset that provides\nlarge-scale multi-view intrinsic data and renderings under diverse lighting\nconditions, supporting robust training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nIDArb outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and\nquantitatively. Moreover, our approach facilitates a range of downstream tasks,\nincluding single-image relighting, photometric stereo, and 3D reconstruction,\nhighlighting its broad applications in realistic 3D content creation.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UcLUkCOzORfpvr_5_KvpMF3en2T1pBLXde_Go-aw2eQ","pdfSize":"14323568"}
