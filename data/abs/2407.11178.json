To exhibit this hidden symmetry, the inverse\nmetric must commute with the Killing tensor under the Schouten-Nijenhuis\nbracket, which translates into a system of partial differential equations\n(PDEs) for the inverse metric. For some significant examples, we solve these\nPDEs directly, deriving spacetimes with prescribed hidden symmetries, including\nthose specified by higher-rank Killing tensors. Utilizing the hidden\nsymmetries, we study related problems such as null geodesics, photon region,\nand separation of variables of wave equations. Through this work, we aim to\ndemonstrate that hidden symmetry is more accessible than previously believed.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qeCkzqVyLjC4IiUiW6eOqYpk3BvTorC2pkzBe6T7-Ss","pdfSize":"216762"}
