  "abstract": "  For the finite (non-periodic) systems obtained from a lattice introduced by\nFerapontov and independently by Shabat and Yamilov, we present a\nquadrature-free general solution and a recurrent formula for the characteristic\nintegrals. The derivation of these formulae relies on the underlying\ndeterminantal equations. We illustrate the results using a two-component\nsystem.\n",
