In this paper, we propose Answerability\nFields, a novel approach to predicting answerability within complex indoor\nenvironments. Leveraging a 3D question answering dataset, we construct a\ncomprehensive Answerability Fields dataset, encompassing diverse scenes and\nquestions from ScanNet. Using a diffusion model, we successfully infer and\nevaluate these Answerability Fields, demonstrating the importance of objects\nand their locations in answering questions within a scene. Our results showcase\nthe efficacy of Answerability Fields in guiding scene-understanding tasks,\nlaying the foundation for their application in enhancing interactions between\nintelligent agents and their environments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7h_pds1HSL6NN0uTnaHXtqVadGtUP-siebZpM7f2sOY","pdfSize":"3090210"}
