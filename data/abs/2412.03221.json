Here we present squeeze factors of monolithic periodically\npoled KTP (ppKTP) resonators measured with two laboratory-built balanced\nhomodyne detectors with gigahertz bandwidth. We realise two complete systems\nwithout selection of optical or electronic hardware components to test the\nreproducibility without rejects. As expected, the systems show clear spectral\ndifferences. However, both achieve directly measured squeeze factors in the\norder of 3 dB over a GHz bandwidth, which is achieved here for the first time.\nOur direct measurement of quantum correlation is suitable for increasing the\nkey rate of one-sided, device-independent QKD.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"i6nVf2HiZD3J3sNFmd5tWzCONdzKc2NaMWQw1rVW6E0","pdfSize":"2115263"}
