For\n$F(\\varrho,\\sigma)$ in the form that total fidelity can be represented as a\nquadratic form with superoperator $\\mathcal{F}=\\sum_s\\left\\langle\nB_s\\middle|S\\middle| B_s \\right\\rangle$ (either exactly or as an approximation)\nan iterative algorithm is developed to find the global maximum. The result\ncomprises in $N_s$ operators $B_s$ that collectively form an $IN$ to $OUT$\nquantum channel $A^{OUT}=\\sum_s B_s A^{IN} B_s^{\\dagger}$. The work introduces\ntwo important generalizations of unitary learning: 1. $IN$/$OUT$ states are\nrepresented as density matrices. 2. The mapping itself is formulated as a\ngeneral quantum channel. This marks a crucial advancement from the commonly\nstudied unitary mapping of pure states $\\phi_l=\\mathcal{U} \\psi_l$ to a general\nquantum channel, what allows us to distinguish probabilistic mixture of states\nand their superposition. An application of the approach is demonstrated on\nunitary learning of density matrix mapping $\\varrho^{(l)}=\\mathcal{U}\n\\rho^{(l)} \\mathcal{U}^{\\dagger}$, in this case a quadratic on $\\mathcal{U}$\nfidelity can be constructed by considering $\\sqrt{\\rho^{(l)}} \\to\n\\sqrt{\\varrho^{(l)}}$ mapping, and on a general quantum channel of Kraus rank\n$N_s$, where quadratic on $B_s$ fidelity is an approximation -- a quantum\nchannel is then built as a hierarchy of unitary mappings. The approach can be\napplied to study decoherence effects, spontaneous coherence, synchronizing,\netc.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gqDSmApQRc2psi0lYVhf0vINMRLLMbutHLKtGNjCGM4","pdfSize":"860889"}
