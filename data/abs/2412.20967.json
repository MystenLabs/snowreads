Despite its numerous applications, several\nchallenges are still present in hardware design. We demonstrate an on-chip\nactive wavelength division multiplexer (WDM) operating at THz frequencies. The\nWDM architecture is based on an inverse design topology optimization, which is\napplied in this case to the active quantum cascade heterostructure material\nembedded within a polymer in a planarized double metal cavity. Such an approach\nenables the fabrication of a strongly subwavelength device, with a normalized\nvolume of only $V/\\lambda^3 \\simeq 0.5$. The WDM input is integrated with a THz\nquantum cascade laser frequency comb, providing three broadband output ports,\nranging from 2.2 THz to 3.2 THz, with $\\approx$ 330 GHz bandwidth and a maximum\ncrosstalk of -6 dB. The three ports are outcoupled via integrated broadband\npatch array antennas with surface emission. Such a device can be also function\nas a stand-alone element, unlocking complex on-chip signal processing in the\nTHz range\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uloYXOFMVL0QT2eUIW6ZDINU1UIMrTPFJDfdfWgFt0c","pdfSize":"15421315"}
