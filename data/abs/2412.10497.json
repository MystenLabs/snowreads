Generalizing recently developed matching methods, we determine the\n$m_s$ dependence of the short-range $nn \\to pp$ couplings that appear to\nleading order in the chiral effective field theory description of neutrinoless\ndouble beta decay. We focus on two scenarios, corresponding to the minimal\n$\\nu$SM and left-right symmetric models. We illustrate the impact of our new\nresults in the case of the $\\nu$SM, showing a significant impact on the\nneutrinoless double-beta decay half-life when $m_s$ is in the 200-800 MeV\nrange.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"J01L0_pgUoyDWWHkY5FMdcpcALd6Shwf_122XTB4nU0","pdfSize":"1482291"}
