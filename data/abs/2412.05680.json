  "abstract": "  In this work we consider the free boundary inverse equilibrium problem for 3D\nideal MHD. We review boundary conditions for both fixed and free boundary\nsolutions and under what circumstances a sheet current may exist at the\nplasma-vacuum interface. We develop an efficient and accurate algorithm for\ncomputing the residual of these boundary conditions and use it to compute free\nboundary equilibria in the DESC code both in vacuum and at finite plasma beta,\nwith and without sheet currents.\n",
