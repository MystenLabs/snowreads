Creating an effective decentralized\nsynchronization algorithm for a robotic network would allow multiple robots to\nwork together to achieve a task and would be able to adapt to the addition or\nloss of robots in real-time. The purpose of this study is to improve algorithms\nimplemented developed by the authors for this purpose and experimentally\nevaluate these methods. The most effective algorithm for synchronization and\ndesynchronization found in a former study were modified to improve testing and\nvary its methods of calculation. A multi-robot platform composed of multiple\nRoomba robots was used in the experimental study. Observation of data showed\nhow adjusting parameters of the algorithms affected both the time to reach a\ndesired state of synchronization or desynchronization and how the network\nmaintained this state. Testing three different methods on each algorithm showed\ndiffering results. Future work in cooperative robotics will likely see success\nusing these algorithms to accomplish a variety of tasks.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"dX4OWcAZdaWvniqP5s5fuT9ZfSHTqysscaNPIHEgoRQ","pdfSize":"520217"}
