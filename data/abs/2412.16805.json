  "abstract": "  This paper presents a novel approach for vibration control of satellite-based\nflexible beam-type antennas using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) and\nDeep Learning techniques. The developed control system leverages piezoelectric\n(PZT) actuators and sensors to manage the coupled attitude and structural\ndynamics of the satellite, improving precision and stability. We propose a\ndetailed coupled dynamics model that integrates both satellite attitude and\nbeam structural dynamics, considering the effects of PZT-based actuators.\nThrough MATLAB/Simulink simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the\ncombined NMPC and Deep Learning framework in reducing structural vibrations,\nachieving faster response times, and enhancing overall control accuracy. The\nresults indicate that the proposed system provides a robust solution for\ncontrolling flexible beam-type satellite antennas in space environments.\n",
