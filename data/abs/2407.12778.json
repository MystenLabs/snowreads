In this paper we call such Lie algebras\n$\\hat{\\mathfrak{g}}_\\lambda$, with BMS$_3$ corresponding to the universal\ncentral extension of $\\lambda = -1$. We construct the BRST complex for\n$\\hat{\\mathfrak{g}}_\\lambda$ in two different ways: one in the language of\nsemi-infinite cohomology and the other using the formalism of vertex operator\nalgebras. We pay particular attention to the case of BMS$_3$ and discuss some\nnatural field-theoretical realisations. We prove two theorems about the BRST\ncohomology of $\\hat{\\mathfrak{g}}_\\lambda$. The first is the construction of a\nquasi-isomorphic embedding of the chiral sector of any Virasoro string as a\n$\\hat{\\mathfrak{g}}_\\lambda$ string. The second is the isomorphism (as\nBatalin--Vilkovisky algebras) of any $\\hat{\\mathfrak{g}}_\\lambda$ BRST\ncohomology and the chiral ring of a topologically twisted $N{=}2$\nsuperconformal field theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LjXbjz21smxCei2e9PBcL3SpA7GRogxvFrP26-Gw5VA","pdfSize":"492877","objectId":"0x439e97a97d178a51c11f08b080f79bd80ba3ac4bf2d96d8a6852ad5b96c3c32f","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
