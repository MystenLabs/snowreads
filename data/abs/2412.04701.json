Here, we establish a precise mapping between\nthe global unitary dynamics and the quantum operation involving the system,\nwherein the system is a single qubit, and the environment is modeled as a\ndiscrete lattice space. This approach enables the implementation of arbitrary\nnoise operations on single-polarization qubits using a minimal set of three\nliquid-crystal metasurfaces, whose transverse distribution of the optic axes\ncan be patterned to reproduce the target process. We experimentally validate\nthis method by simulating common noise processes, such as phase errors and\ndepolarization.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IPLsZx5xdv4b7-iA_UvW6j6LCLXVK7JAD4qHyyWJONY","pdfSize":"2776979"}
