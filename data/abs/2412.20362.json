We establish the existence\nand uniqueness of solutions and present a discussion concerning the appropriate\nphase space to define these equations. Also, we prove a version of periodic\naveraging principle to these equations. This type of result was completely open\nin the literature. These equations involving measure bring the advantage to\nencompass others such as impulsive, dynamic equations on time scales and\ndifference equations, expanding their application potential. Additionally, we\napply our theoretical insights to a real-time optimization strategy, using\nextremum seeking to validate the stability of an innovative algorithm under\nstate-dependent delays. This application confirm the relevance of our findings\nin practical scenarios, offering valuable tools for advanced control system\ndesign. Our research provides significant contributions to the mathematical\nfield and suggests new directions for future technological developments.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computer Science/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fg65ooouOwRDdRlMZGqDYm132nskvC7CKRnVowbEsus","pdfSize":"3801458"}
