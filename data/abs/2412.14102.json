In this study, we present a new class of compact resonators\noptimized to operate at higher-order eigenmodes, achieving both high\nfrequencies and enhanced quality factor-frequency (Qf) products. By employing\ntopology optimization to maximize the damping dilution factor, these resonators\nachieve minimized edge bending losses and enhanced intrinsic damping. Their\nhigh-(Qf) performance and compact form factor position these resonators as\npromising candidates for applications in quantum information transduction,\nadvanced optomechanical systems, and next-generation sensing technologies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JeeQ15V9O-8MbVrwWoPQx5anJXPKdaluzJao4vWRdZg","pdfSize":"9369022"}
