  "abstract": "  Nowadays, the global booming of FinTech can be seen everywhere. FinTech has\ncreated innovative disruptions to traditional, long-established financial\ninstitutions (e.g., banks and insurance companies) in financial services\nmarkets. Despite of its popularity, there are many different definitions of\nFinTech. This problem occurs because many existing studies only focus on a\nparticular aspect of FinTech without a comprehensive and in-depth analysis.\nThis problem will hinder further development and industrial application of\nFinTech. In view of this problem, we perform a narrative review involving over\n100 relevant studies or reports, with a view to developing a FinTech clustering\nframework for providing a more comprehensive and holistic view of FinTech.\nFurthermore, we use an Indian FinTech firm to illustrate how to apply our\nclustering framework for analysis.\n",
