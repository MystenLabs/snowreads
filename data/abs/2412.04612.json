One of them requires a certain system of\nequations to have a unique non-trivial solution in the field $K$. Applying this\ncriterion, we provide an example showing that Holgate's well-known sufficient\ncondition for the uniqueness of a weight homomorphism is not necessary, and\ngive also a new example of a baric algebra with two weight homomorphisms.\nAnother criterion found in this paper asserts that a baric algebra has a unique\nweight homomorphism if and only if the transition matrix from any semi-natural\nbasis $B_1$ to any semi-natural basis $B_2$ is stochastic.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lmfoGv6yzSYstypd0ODdQtpSxCvB7bJ5cCuyWBT9HL0","pdfSize":"132958"}
