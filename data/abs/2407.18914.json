Yet, these\ntechniques often fail to accurately capture the inter-relation between the\nobject, ground, and camera. As a result, the reconstructed objects often appear\nfloating or tilted when placed on flat surfaces. This limitation significantly\naffects 3D-aware image editing applications like shadow rendering and object\npose manipulation. To address this issue, we introduce ORG (Object\nReconstruction with Ground), a novel task aimed at reconstructing 3D object\ngeometry in conjunction with the ground surface. Our method uses two compact\npixel-level representations to depict the relationship between camera, object,\nand ground. Experiments show that the proposed ORG model can effectively\nreconstruct object-ground geometry on unseen data, significantly enhancing the\nquality of shadow generation and pose manipulation compared to conventional\nsingle-image 3D reconstruction techniques.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MTposreVhgdzN1W3GUYeET6fjJeNFZx3uHZ7cb_TCgI","pdfSize":"3369321","objectId":"0xe2ff6fcfb798223461f1a14e294b7e69e4a09013a67289e2c5b2b9de8b87c14e","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
