  "abstract": "  The construction of meta-stable four-dimensional de Sitter vacua in type IIB\nstring compactifications represents an important question and an ongoing area\nof work. There is considerable support both for stringy de Sitter vacua in the\ninterior of moduli space and for their scarceness in the strict asymptotic\nregime towards infinite-distance boundaries of the compactification moduli\nspace. Here, we present evidence for the existence of uplifting vacua in the\nthree-form flux-induced scalar potential of the complex structure moduli of\ntype IIB string theory on Calabi-Yau orientifolds in the cross-over region\nbetween the interior of the moduli space and its strictly asymptotic\ninfinite-distance regions. Moreover, we also exhibit the existence of\nlong-range axion valleys which, while not yet supporting slow-roll inflation,\ndo show a flattened scalar potential from complex structure moduli backreaction\nand axion monodromy. We further illustrate how such regions hosting axion\nvalleys may be obtained by using machine learning techniques.\n",
