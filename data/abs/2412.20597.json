We\nleverage the flexibility of a pre-trained GliNER model to improve the\nlemmatization accuracy of Vabamorf by 10% compared to its original\ndisambiguation module and achieve an improvement over the token\nclassification-based baseline. To measure the impact of improvements in\nlemmatization accuracy on the information retrieval downstream task, we first\ncreated an information retrieval dataset for Estonian by automatically\ntranslating the DBpedia-Entity dataset from English. We benchmark several token\nnormalization approaches, including lemmatization, on the created dataset using\nthe BM25 algorithm. We observe a substantial improvement in IR metrics when\nusing lemmatization over simplistic stemming. The benefits of improving lemma\ndisambiguation accuracy manifest in small but consistent improvement in the IR\nrecall measure, especially in the setting of high k.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"F4SPGQRGYNUSLf0ZURgkgn6kBgyE1ErIa1fZJkEndKo","pdfSize":"1627217"}
