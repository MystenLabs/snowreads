We first pre-train a\nlanguage model using millions of antibody sequence data. Then, we employ the\nlearned representations to guide the training of a diffusion model for joint\noptimization over both sequence and structure of antibodies. During the final\nalignment stage, we optimize the model to favor antibodies with low repulsion\nand high attraction to the antigen binding site, enhancing the rationality and\nfunctionality of the designs. To mitigate conflicting energy preferences, we\nextend AbDPO (Antibody Direct Preference Optimization) to guide the model\ntowards Pareto optimality under multiple energy-based alignment objectives.\nFurthermore, we adopt an iterative learning paradigm with temperature scaling,\nenabling the model to benefit from diverse online datasets without requiring\nadditional data. In practice, our proposed methods achieve high stability and\nefficiency in producing a better Pareto front of antibody designs compared to\ntop samples generated by baselines and previous alignment techniques. Through\nextensive experiments, we showcase the superior performance of our methods in\ngenerating nature-like antibodies with high binding affinity consistently.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"jPVF-Q50NhmLW7VwSBQgUIcCgel6deGIdDgTOeuWOLc","pdfSize":"14305654"}
