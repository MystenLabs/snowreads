  "abstract": "  The kinetics of the reactions of nitrogen dioxide, NO$_2$, with atomic oxygen\nand atomic carbon in their ground triplet states ($^3$P) have been studied at\nroom temperature and below using a supersonic flow (Laval nozzle) reactor.\nO($^3$P) and C($^3$P) atoms (hereafter O and C respectively) were created\nin-situ by the pulsed laser photolysis of the precursor molecules NO$_2$ at 355\nnm and CBr$_4$ at 266 nm respectively. While the progress of the O + NO$_2$\nreaction was followed by detecting O atoms by a chemiluminescent tracer method,\nprogress of the C + NO$_2$ reaction was followed by detecting C atoms directly\nby vacuum ultra violet laser induced fluorescence at 116 nm. The measured rate\nconstants for the O + NO$_2$ reaction are found to be in excellent agreement\nwith earlier work at higher temperatures and extend the available kinetic data\nfor this process down to 50 K. The present work represents the first kinetics\nstudy of the C + NO$_2$ reaction. Although both reactions display rate\nconstants that increase as the temperature falls, a more substantial rate\nincrease is observed for the O + NO$_2$ reaction. The effects of these\nreactions on the simulated abundances of interstellar NO$_2$ and related\ncompounds were tested using a gas-grain model of the dense interstellar medium,\nemploying expressions for the rate constants of the form, $k(T) =\n\\alpha(T/300)^\\beta$, with $\\alpha = 1 \\times 10^{-11}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ and\n$\\beta = -0.65$ for the O + NO$_2$ reaction and $\\alpha = 2 \\times 10^{-10}$\ncm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ and $\\beta = -0.11$ for the C + NO$_2$ reaction. Although these\nsimulations predict that gas-phase NO$_2$ abundances are low in dense\ninterstellar clouds, NO$_2$ abundances on interstellar dust grains are\npredicted to reach reasonably high levels, indicating the potential for\ndetection of this species in warmer regions.\n",
