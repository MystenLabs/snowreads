As a first go, we consider the\n  situation where inference is based on independent copies\n  $S_1,\\; \\ldots,\\; S_n$ of the generic variable $S$. Just\n  like the popular Hill estimator in the continuous\n  heavy-tail situation, the estimator $\\widehat{\\beta}$ we\n  propose can be derived by means of a suitable\n  reformulation of the regularly varying condition,\n  replacing $S$'s survivor function by its empirical\n  counterpart. Under mild assumptions, a non-asymptotic\n  bound for the deviation between $\\widehat{\\beta}$ and\n  $\\beta$ is established, as well as limit results\n  (consistency and asymptotic normality). Beyond the\n  i.i.d. case, the inference method proposed is extended\n  to the estimation of the regularity index of a\n  regenerative $\\beta$-null recurrent Markov chain. Since\n  the parameter $\\beta$ can be then viewed as the tail\n  index of the (regularly varying) distribution of the\n  return time of the chain $X$ to any (pseudo-)\n  regenerative set, in this case, the estimator is\n  constructed from the successive regeneration times.\n  Because the durations between consecutive regeneration\n  times are asymptotically independent, we can prove that\n  the consistency of the estimator promoted is preserved.\n  In addition to the theoretical analysis carried out,\n  simulation results provide empirical evidence of the\n  relevance of the inference technique proposed.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cF1kum2scEdyzYsM7Asb_Zn039Ea_VlgiEyiX_V_yF4","pdfSize":"1328279"}
