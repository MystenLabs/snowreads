  "abstract": "  We study a multidimensional renewal risk model, with common counting process\nand cadlag returns. Considering that the claim vectors have common distribution\nfrom some multivariate distribution class with heavy tail, are mutually weakly\ndependent, and each one has arbitrarily dependent components, we obtain\nuniformly asymptotic estimations for the probability of entrance of discounted\naggregate claims into a some rare sets, over a finite time horizon. Direct\nconsequence of the claim behavior is the estimation of the ruin probability of\nthe model in some ruin sets. Further, restricting the distribution class of the\nclaim vectors in the multivariate regular variation, the estimations still hold\nuniformly over the whole time horizon.\n",
