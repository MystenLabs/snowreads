FN-DMC, being a\nprojection method, is often considered minimally affected by basis set biases.\nHere, we show that this assumption is not always valid. While the relative\nerror introduced by a small basis set in the total FN-DMC energy is minor, it\ncan become significant in binding energy ($E_{\\rm b}$) evaluations of weakly\ninteracting systems. We systematically investigated BSIEs in FN-DMC-based\nbinding energy ($E_{\\rm b}$) evaluations using the A24 dataset, a well-known\nbenchmark set of 24 non-covalently bound dimers. Contrary to common\nexpectations, we found that BSIEs in FN-DMC evaluations of $E_{\\rm b}$ are\nindeed significant when small localized basis sets, such as cc-pVDZ, are\nemployed. We observed that BSIEs are larger in dimers with hydrogen-bonding\ninteractions and smaller in dispersion-dominated interactions. We also found\nthat augmenting the basis sets with diffuse orbitals, using counterpoise (CP)\ncorrection, or both, effectively mitigates BSIEs.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sXmxAUBFPMD1jRTpEisgyaavXnCATfyh_w54gdAyTnA","pdfSize":"5840222"}
