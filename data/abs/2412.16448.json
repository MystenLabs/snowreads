($C>0$ is a constant that depends only on the linear\norder.) This improves the previous lower bound $\\geq C \\sqrt[6]{\\log |S| / \\log\n\\log |S|}$ of [HKL06]. The proof establishes a dichotomy about any long walk on\na cycle: the walk either zig-zags between two far away points, or else for a\nlarge amount of time it stays inside a set of small diameter.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Computer Science/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MjRO6fp1FjiAnp55z7qA6RC8XD82zISwrEMZoyftq7s","pdfSize":"799529"}
