  "abstract": "  Neonatal echocardiography is vital for early detection of heart anomalies in\nnewborns, enabling timely, non-invasive interventions where 4D ultrasound, adds\nthe dimension of time to 3D imaging, enhances diagnostic capabilities by\nvisualizing real-time heart dynamics. However, training for 4D neonatal\nechocardiography is limited by the lack of simulators that support 4D\nUltrasound volume visualization within gamified environments. This paper\nintroduces EchoSim4D, an XR-based simulator leveraging novel pipeline for\nvisualizing 4D volume data in Unity, incorporating real-time volume\nreconstruction, and a preloaded version optimized for low-end systems.\nEchoSim4D integrates a sensor-equipped manikin and a custom 3D-printed\ntransducer with a 6-DOF sensor, replicating the precise probe maneuvers\nnecessary for neonatal echocardiography. In a validation study with\npostgraduate medical students (0-5 years of experience), supervised by a domain\nexpert, EchoSim4D demonstrated high visual fidelity and training efficacy.\nFindings suggest that 4D visualization techniques hold significant potential\nfor advancing medical training in neonatal echocardiography.\n",
