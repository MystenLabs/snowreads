We prove a.s. convergence for empirical means\nand further develop general estimates for the difference between the MEM\nsolutions with different priors $\\mu$ and $\\nu$ based upon the epigraphical\ndistance between their respective log-moment generating functions. These\nestimates allow us to establish a rate of convergence in expectation for\nempirical means. We illustrate our results with denoising on MNIST and\nFashion-MNIST data sets.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rTW9DUsSqI1u3i_5E6SDjzCxmWknSo5zRecrumrXIEE","pdfSize":"1197718"}
