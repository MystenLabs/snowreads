In this letter, we conduct the first analysis\nof imaginarity quantification in neutrino flavor and spin-flavor oscillations.\nAs quantum systems in coherent superposition, neutrinos are ideal candidates\nfor quantifying imaginarity within the resource theoretic framework, using\nmeasures such as the $\\ell_1$-norm and the relative entropy of imaginarity. Our\nfindings reveal that even in the case of two-flavor mixing, these measures of\nimaginarity are nonzero. The measures of imaginarity reach their extreme values\nwhen the probabilistic features of quantum theory are fully maximized, i.e.,\nboth the transitional and survival probabilities are approximately equal,\naveraging around $1/2$. We further extend our analysis to explore the dynamics\nof three-flavor neutrino mixing, incorporating the effects of a nonzero CP\nphase. Our study reveals that the imaginarity in neutrino systems is not solely\nattributed to the CP-violating phase. More importantly, it can also arise from\nthe intrinsic quantum dynamics of the neutrino mixing system itself.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"qSHSKa15wVd6qH7oz62DUxEWMlmNjwWoopLp0eq0FYw","pdfSize":"602890"}
