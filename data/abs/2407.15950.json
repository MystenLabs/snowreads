In this\npaper, we use NIRSpec PRISM spectra ($\\sim$0.8$-$5.5 $\\mu$m, $R\\sim$100) of\nfour late T and Y dwarfs to show that standard substellar atmosphere models\nhave difficulty replicating the 4.1$-$4.4 $\\mu$m wavelength range as they\npredict an overabundance of phosphine and an underabundance of carbon dioxide.\nTo help quantify this discrepancy, we generate a grid of models using PICASO\nbased on the Elf Owl chemical and temperature profiles where we include the\nabundances of these two molecules as parameters. The fits to these PICASO\nmodels show a consistent preference for orders of magnitude higher CO$_2$\nabundances and a reduction in PH$_3$ abundance as compared to the nominal\nmodels. This tendency means that the claimed phosphine detection in\nUNCOVER$-$BD$-$3 could instead be explained by a CO$_2$ abundance in excess of\nstandard atmospheric model predictions; however the signal-to-noise of the\nspectrum is not high enough to discriminate between these cases. We discuss\natmospheric mechanisms that could explain the observed underabundance of PH$_3$\nand overabundance of CO$_2$, including a vertical eddy diffusion coefficient\n($K_{\\mathrm{zz}}$) that varies with altitude, incorrect chemical pathways, or\nelements condensing out in forms such as NH$_4$H$_2$PO$_4$. However, our\nfavored explanation for the required CO$_2$ enhancement is that the quench\napproximation does not accurately predict the CO$_2$ abundance, as CO$_2$\nremains in chemical equilibrium with CO after CO quenches.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GEpuoryxXD3HCuv51BYbDwlZEZ4k4SUOkfE6rHMoK1A","pdfSize":"1395614","objectId":"0xbbf0ced997478551ad005782db357acc330f3e91c89eae672cc6cf59c09de0fa","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
