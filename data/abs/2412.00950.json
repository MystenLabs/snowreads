The code is\nbased on the method of transport sweeps, in which the exact solution to the\nscattering-less radiative transfer equation is computed in a single pass\nthrough the entire computational grid. The radiative transfer module is coupled\nto radiation chemistry, and chemical compositions as well as temperatures of\nthe cells are evolved according to photon fluxes computed during radiative\ntransfer. Subsweep extends the method of transport sweeps by incorporating\nsub-timesteps in a hierarchy of partial sweeps of the grid. This alleviates the\nneed for a low, global timestep and as a result Subsweep is able to drastically\nreduce the amount of computation required for accurate integration of the\ncoupled radiation chemistry equations. We succesfully apply the code to a\nnumber of physical tests such as the expansion of HII regions, the formation of\nshadows behind dense objects, and its behavior in the presence of periodic\nboundary conditions.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"npnNiLrdb9KGYvk9DWldYLIphJX5c7ClevP3V6tupqI","pdfSize":"5133163"}
