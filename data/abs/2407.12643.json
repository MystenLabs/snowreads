In this\nrespect, linear plasma devices are ideal experimental testbeds, and numerical\ncodes play a crucial complementary role. In this paper, a numerical\ninvestigation of PMI-relevant helium plasma experimental discharges in GyM\nlinear device is presented, in which SOLPS-ITER and ERO2.0 codes are coupled\nfor plasma background generation and material erosion investigation\nrespectively, with the aim to support the interpretation and complement the\navailable experimental dataset. On the plasma side, simulated profiles are\nvalidated against experimental data to provide a realistic plasma background,\nand the role of He metastable states is assessed for the first time in SOLPS\nsimulations. On the material side, the erosion and deposition effects due to\nthe introduction of the sample-holder in the simulation volume are\ninvestigated, now considering also the real stainless steel composition as wall\nmaterial.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ol2mu-P9lH_v5MiGIIxNxYLjYYKWp4ib64GW4UEnDUA","pdfSize":"8127555"}
