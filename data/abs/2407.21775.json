The\namplitudes of this shadow state are proportional to the expectations of a set\nof operators of interest. The shadow state evolves according to its own\nSchr\\\"odinger equation, and under broad conditions can be simulated on a\nquantum computer. We analyze a number of applications of this framework to\nquantum simulation problems. This includes simulating the dynamics of\nexponentially large systems of free fermions, or exponentially large systems of\nfree bosons, the latter example recovering a recent algorithm for simulating\nexponentially many classical harmonic oscillators. Shadow Hamiltonian\nsimulation can be extended to simulate expectations of more complex operators\nsuch as two-time correlators or Green's functions, and to study the evolution\nof operators themselves in the Heisenberg picture.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VXv_VpBbg974zNRn9DgcFlGUyRd-mbZ7bmY5njhRcgk","pdfSize":"583870"}
