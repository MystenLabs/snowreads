  "abstract": "  High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy is an essential tool in X-ray astronomy,\nenabling detailed studies of celestial objects and their physical and chemical\nproperties. However, comprehensive mapping of high-resolution X-ray spectra for\neven simple interstellar and circumstellar molecules is still lacking. In this\nstudy, we conducted systematic quantum chemical simulations to predict the C1s\nX-ray absorption spectra of CN$^+$, CN, and CN$^-$. Our findings provide\nvaluable references for both X-ray astronomy and laboratory studies. We\nassigned the first electronic peak of CN$^+$ and CN to C1s $\\rightarrow\n\\sigma^*$ transitions, while the peak for CN$^-$ corresponds to a C1s\n$\\rightarrow \\pi^*$ transition. We further calculated the vibronic fine\nstructures for these transitions using the quantum wavepacket method based on\nmulticonfigurational-level, anharmonic potential energy curves, revealing\ndistinct energy positions for the 0-0 absorptions at 280.7 eV, 279.6 eV, and\n285.8 eV. Each vibronic profile features a prominent 0-0 peak, showing overall\nsimilarity but differing intensity ratios of the 0-0 and 0-1 peaks. Notably,\nintroducing a C1s core hole leads to shortened C-N bond lengths and increased\nvibrational frequencies across all species. These findings enhance our\nunderstanding of the electronic structures and X-ray spectra of carbon-nitrogen\nspecies, emphasizing the influence of charge state on X-ray absorptions.\n",
