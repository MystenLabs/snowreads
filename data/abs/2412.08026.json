They are designed to introduce general relativity\nto upper-year undergraduate students directly using the modern language of\ndifferential geometry but in a physically motivated way, and throughout keeping\na logical flow from section to section and chapter to chapter. In doing so,\nthey necessarily cover a number of topics either not normally treated in an\nintroductory course, or from a novel perspective. These include for example:\naffine spaces, comparing and contrasting rank-2 tensors with matrices,\nintegration on manifolds, the Rindler metric, including a proper near-source\nboundary condition for the Schwarzschild metric, approaching Kruskal-Szekeres\ncoordinates from a Rindler perspective, and more.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UpXp5PkNsoFOPaZAvD1OB6L1nWk2CscJfu2fX5cL9Bc","pdfSize":"6600115"}
