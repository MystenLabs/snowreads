  "abstract": "  Postselected weak measurement has shown significant potential for detecting\nsmall physical effects due to its unique weak-value-amplification phenomenon.\nPrevious works suggest that Heisenberg-limit precision can be attained using\nonly the optical coherent states. However, the measurement object is the\ndistribution of postselection, limiting the practical applicability. Here, we\ndemonstrate that the output photons can also reach the quantum scale by\nutilizing the Fisher information transfer effect. In addition, we consider the\ninsertion of a power-recycling cavity and demonstrate its positive impact on\nthe distribution of postselection. Our results enhance the quantum metrological\nadvantages of the postselection strategy and broaden its application scope.\n",
