Downscaling coarse-resolution\nclimate models to finer scales is essential for accurately evaluating the risk\nof extremes. In this study, we apply our downscaling method, which integrates\ndata, physics, and machine learning, to quantify the risks of extreme\nprecipitation in Bangladesh. The proposed approach successfully captures the\nobserved spatial patterns and risks of extreme rainfall in the current climate\nwhile generating risk and uncertainty estimates by efficiently downscaling\nmultiple models under future climate scenarios. Our findings project that the\nrisk of extreme rainfall rises across the country, with the most significant\nincreases in the northeastern hilly and southeastern coastal areas. Projections\nshow that the daily maximum rainfall for a 100-year return period could\nincrease by approximately 50 mm/day by mid-century and around 100 mm/day by the\nend of the century. However, substantial uncertainties remain due to variations\nacross multiple climate models and scenarios.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"_wsVg1jKg2xc6xJTSC8ihUCWbMNJYGkRtREiFW6TOc4","pdfSize":"5861351"}
