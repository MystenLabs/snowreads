While extensive research has been conducted on\nroot cause analysis, most studies have predominantly focused on deterministic\nsettings. In this paper, we investigate causation in more realistic\nnondeterministic domains, where the agent does not have any control on and may\nnot know the choices that are made by the environment. We build on recent\npreliminary work on actual causation in the nondeterministic situation calculus\nto formalize more sophisticated forms of reasoning about actual causes in such\ndomains. We investigate the notions of ``Certainly Causes'' and ``Possibly\nCauses'' that enable the representation of actual cause for agent actions in\nthese domains. We then show how regression in the situation calculus can be\nextended to reason about such notions of actual causes.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fBPeb_muXkddIdDnC6eThLyUdNlIErE3h8kXTh3xZXc","pdfSize":"219051"}
