In a dispersive medium, at a\nzero angle, in addition to hard photons, soft photons are also generated. If\nthe wavelength of the soft photons is greater than or equal to the longitudinal\nsize of the microbunches formed during the FEL process, the microbunches\nradiate coherently. Consequently, the radiation of the bunch will be partially\ncoherent. As a result, intense, quasi-monochromatic, and directed X-ray photon\nbeams are produced, which can have wide practical applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics","Physics/Classical Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JAjtD82bHQ4jMBW41TrOWrXc8qI9Wsj1QUXO6i0vqeo","pdfSize":"179557"}
