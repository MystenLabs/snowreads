The identifiability issues\nshould be carefully investigated while modeling multivariate survival with or\nwithout competing risks. The use of non-parametric frailty distribution(s) is\nsometimes preferred for its robustness and flexibility properties. In this\npaper, we consider modeling of bivariate survival data with competing risks\nthrough four different kinds of non-parametric frailty and parametric baseline\ncause-specific hazard functions to investigate the corresponding model\nidentifiability. We make the common assumption of the frailty mean being equal\nto unity.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"EgiMnUeYH8QeneeeGkzrGUDoawvIAl5jtD4q60U_LHM","pdfSize":"190750"}
