Depending on the\ntype of lattice, these structures are more or less suitable for energy\nabsorption due to the deformation of diagonal struts. The energy absorption\nproperties depend significantly on the type of the selected lattice structure\nand its density, material properties, printing process, and post-treatment.\nHere, five lattice types (Octet, BFCC, Diamond, Truncated Octahedron and\nRhombicuboctahedron) with different volume fractions are compared.\nStereolithography is used to print the different lattices made from liquid\nresin. This allows good results to be achieved with tiny structures. In\nparticular, the sustainability of energy-absorbing structures plays a\nsignificant role in many processes to withstand multiple loads. The lattice\nstructures are made of TPU resin and offer different energy absorption\nproperties without being destroyed under load. The structures are loaded\nabruptly using the Split-Hopkinson pressure bar test in a modified setup. From\nthe measured strain pulses, we can calculate how much of the applied energy was\nabsorbed by the different structures\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RvJIwZ4gzOa8hHnohvGMMUMmTkbEs3um_OOdSomnQcM","pdfSize":"36635088"}
