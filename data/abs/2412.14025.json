The\ncreativity of the generated ideas depends not only on the knowledge retrieved\nfrom the organizations' knowledge bases, but also on the external knowledge\nretrieved from other resources. Unfortunately, organizations often cannot\nefficiently utilize the knowledge in the knowledge bases due to the limited\nabilities of the search and retrieval mechanisms especially when dealing with\nunstructured data. In this paper, we present a new cognitive support framework\nfor ideation that uses the IBM Watson DeepQA services. IBM Watson is a Question\nAnswering system which mimics human cognitive abilities to retrieve and rank\ninformation. The proposed framework is based on the Search for Ideas in the\nAssociative Memory (SIAM) model to help organizations develop creative ideas\nthrough discovering new relationships between retrieved data. To evaluate the\neffectiveness of the proposed system, the generated ideas generated are\nselected and assessed using a set of established creativity criteria.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Sz7CH9S7GDa8FJENy-m12X-fzILTsmIS6uoHVgyxjGk","pdfSize":"874570"}
