  "abstract": "  In 1989 H.Karcher rewrote the theory of elliptic functions through an\napproach that is much more geometrical than analytical. Therewith he obtained\nan optimal control over the behaviour and image values of these functions,\nwhich allowed for their broad application in minimal surfaces. Our work is\ndevoted to presenting the theory of elliptic functions according to Karcher's\napproach, as well as some of its applications in minimal surfaces. The original\npublication was a mini-course that can be downloaded at\nhttps://www.dm.ufscar.br/profs/lobos/IIEPG\n",
