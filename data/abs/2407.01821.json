The relation is very\ngeneral and holds both in equilibrium, when the usual fluctuation-dissipation\ntheorem is valid, and to linear order in an expansion about arbitrary\nnon-equilibrium states, when it is not. We illustrate our results by discussing\nfluids, both in equilibrium and non-equilibrium states, as well as several\nactive-matter systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qbatZK0zKE0PexRossJx9nVuLOFL9JK6tgeeb2zDY_E","pdfSize":"304652"}
