In this study,\nwe leverage predictions from the semi-analytical Cosmic Archaeology Tool (CAT)\nto reconstruct the evolutionary pathways for this overmassive BH population,\ninvestigating how they assemble over cosmic time and interact with their host\ngalaxies. We find that the large $M_{\\rm BH}-M_{\\rm star}$ ratios can be\nexplained if light and heavy BH seeds grow by short, repeated episodes of\nsuper-Eddington accretion, triggered by major galaxy mergers. On average, we\nfind that BH-galaxy co-evolution starts in earnest only at $z < 8$, when\n$\\simeq 30\\%$ of the final galaxy stellar mass has formed outside the massive\nblack hole host. Our model suggests that super-Eddington bursts of accretion\nlast between $0.5-3$ Myr, resulting in a duty cycle of $1-4 \\%$ for the target\nBH sample. The boost in luminosity of BHs undergoing super-Eddington accretion\nhelps explaining the luminosity function of Active Galactic Nuclei observed by\nJWST. At the same time, a large population of these overmassive BHs are\npredicted to be inactive, with Eddington ratio $\\lambda_{\\rm Edd} < 0.05$, in\nagreement with recent observations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zxA_FHLl-eFHhNBoYwGnXcBG41KxfATQ2O2iga5zQ_o","pdfSize":"2129311"}
