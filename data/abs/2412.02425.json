  "abstract": "  Recently, the ParaOpt algorithm was proposed as an extension of the\ntime-parallel Parareal method to optimal control. ParaOpt uses quasi-Newton\nsteps that each require solving a system of matching conditions iteratively.\nThe state-of-the-art parallel preconditioner for linear problems leads to a set\nof independent smaller systems that are currently hard to solve. We generalize\nthe preconditioner to the nonlinear case and propose a new, fast inversion\nmethod for these smaller systems, avoiding disadvantages of the current options\nwith adjusted boundary conditions in the subproblems.\n",
