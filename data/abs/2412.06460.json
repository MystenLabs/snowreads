The\nimplementation of the PA principle would make it possible to create a source\nwith a flux of UCN in a trap significantly exceeding the time average. The\npaper provides a comparative analysis of various approaches to the\nimplementation of the idea of PA of UCN in traps remoted from the place of\ntheir generation. Based on this analysis, the concept of the UCN source, the\ncreation of which is planned at the IBR-2M pulse reactor, was formulated. A\ndistinctive feature of the designed source is a combination of several\napproaches to ensuring the pulsed structure of neutron bunches reaching the UCN\ntrap. One of them is the deceleration of the pulsed flux of VCN using a\nresonant flipper, the second is the use of compensating time lenses.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"RCDQ7mfORmqpBIbjKBLpw2C33L5S1lKradfPpbz7OkI","pdfSize":"1449745"}
