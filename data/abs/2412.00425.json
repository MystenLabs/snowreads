Being able to interpret sarcasm\nis often termed as a sign of intelligence, given the complex nature of sarcasm.\nHence, this is a field of Natural Language Processing which is still complex\nfor computers to decipher. This Literature Survey delves into different aspects\nof sarcasm detection, to create an understanding of the underlying problems\nfaced during detection, approaches used to solve this problem, and different\nforms of available datasets for sarcasm detection.\n",
