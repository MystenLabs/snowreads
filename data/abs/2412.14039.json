Understanding the dynamics of epidemic spread during warfare is\nessential for developing effective containment strategies in complex conflict\nzones. While research has explored epidemic models in various settings, the\nimpact of warfare on epidemic dynamics remains underexplored. In this study, we\nproposed a novel mathematical model that integrates the epidemiological SIR\n(susceptible-infected-recovered) model with the war dynamics Lanchester model\nto explore the dual influence of war and pandemic on a population's mortality.\nMoreover, we consider a dual-use military and civil healthcare system that aims\nto reduce the overall mortality rate which can use different administration\npolicies. Using an agent-based simulation to generate in silico data, we\ntrained a deep reinforcement learning model for healthcare administration\npolicy and conducted an intensive investigation on its performance. Our results\nshow that a pandemic during war conduces chaotic dynamics where the healthcare\nsystem should either prioritize war-injured soldiers or pandemic-infected\ncivilians based on the immediate amount of mortality from each option, ignoring\nlong-term objectives. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating\nconflict-related factors into epidemic modeling to enhance preparedness and\nresponse strategies in conflict-affected areas.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods","Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Multiagent Systems","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"UMrlpWOvo5qo1yCyUHU65qsbudmb3j4kt0D0fUFUfik","pdfSize":"1697229"}
