Despite\nvarious proposed software and hardware mitigations to prevent such attacks, new\nattacks keep arising from unknown vulnerabilities. Thus, a formal and rigorous\nevaluation of the ability of hardware designs to deal with speculative\nexecution attacks is urgently desired. This paper proposes a formal\nverification technique called Contract Shadow Logic that can considerably\nimprove RTL verification scalability while being applicable to different\ndefense mechanisms. In this technique, we leverage computer architecture design\ninsights to improve verification performance for checking security properties\nformulated as software-hardware contracts for secure speculation. Our\nverification scheme is accessible to computer architects and requires minimal\nformal-method expertise. We evaluate our technique on multiple RTL designs,\nincluding three out-of-order processors. The experimental results demonstrate\nthat our technique exhibits a significant advantage in finding attacks on\ninsecure designs and deriving complete proofs on secure designs, when compared\nto the baseline and two state-of-the-art verification schemes, LEAVE and UPEC.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"qBxOM-QfSBTO4cR-SH1x2tJEdItNNsSMnJWpaQW7iVE","pdfSize":"697245"}
