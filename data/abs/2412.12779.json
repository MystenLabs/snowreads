Cavitation is modeled using the homogeneous\nequilibrium model. The mechanical and thermodynamic constitutive behavior of\nthe lubricant is accurately captured by inclusion of compressibility, lubricant\nrheology and thermal effects. Different constitutive models can be selected at\nrun time, through the adoption of the modular approach of OpenFOAM. By\ncombining the lubricant solver with a structural solver using a coupling tool,\nelastohydrodynamically lubricated contacts can be accurately simulated in a\npartitioned way. The solution approach is validated and examples with different\nslip conditions are included. The benefit for the OpenFOAM community of this\nwork is the creation of a new solver for lubricant flow in challenging\nconditions and at the same the illustration of combining OpenFOAM solvers with\nother open-source software packages.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"-d_aAvr1oB-IqBwMPuex-VN269vVQPxEv_by-uoweo4","pdfSize":"34892910"}
