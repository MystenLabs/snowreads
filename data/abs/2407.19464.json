Similarly, Building Energy\nModeling (BEM) describes the process of using a 3D representation of a building\nas a basis for thermal simulations to assess the building's energy performance.\nThis paper explores the intersection of BIM and BEM, focusing on the challenges\nand methodologies in converting BIM data into BEM representations for energy\nperformance analysis. BEMTrace integrates 3D data wrangling techniques with\nvisualization methodologies to enhance the accuracy and traceability of the\nBIM-to-BEM conversion process. Through parsing, error detection, and\nalgorithmic correction of BIM data, our methods generate valid BEM models\nsuitable for energy simulation. Visualization techniques provide transparent\ninsights into the conversion process, aiding error identification, validation,\nand user comprehension. We introduce context-adaptive selections to facilitate\nuser interaction and to show that the BEMTrace workflow helps users understand\ncomplex 3D data wrangling processes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"7Hmr2CgP7XeG8EjfVLDhDQfBEXZKYWy5jT2xZavR8qM","pdfSize":"8966556"}
