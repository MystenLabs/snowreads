This connection provides an order-theoretic framework for\nstudying global dynamics. In the classical setting, the chain recurrent set,\nintroduced by C. Conley, is an example of an ordered Stone space or Priestley\nspace. Priestley duality can be applied in the setting of dynamics on arbitrary\ntopological spaces and yields a notion of Hausdorff compactification of the\n(chain) recurrent set.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pFbBHLa9LNfP2iHOGEznCAHuoKoNx17rQVa2aeK--w0","pdfSize":"1758266"}
