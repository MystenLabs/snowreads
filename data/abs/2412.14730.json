While none of the algorithms is able\nto replicate the real data's graph structure, each excels in specific areas:\nDGAN is ideal for privacy-sensitive tasks, FinDiff and TVAE excel in data\nreplication and augmentation, and CTGAN achieves a balance across all five\ncriteria, making it suitable for general applications with moderate privacy\nconcerns. As a result, our findings offer valuable insights for choosing the\nmost suitable algorithm.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-E5wVNXNOz2bJjZ_163jyj02CeZuJpYl-erXNQH5M9c","pdfSize":"509727"}
