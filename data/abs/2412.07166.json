  "abstract": "  equilibrium-c (eqc) is a program for computing the composition of gas\nmixtures in chemical equilibrium. In typical usage, the program is given a\nknown thermodynamic state, such as fixed temperature and pressure, as well as\nan initial composition of gaseous species, and computes the final composition\nin the limit of a large amount of time relative to the reaction speeds. eqc\nincludes a database of thermodynamic properties taken from the literature, a\nset of core routines written the C programming language to solve the\nequilibrium problems, and a Python wrapper layer to organise the solution\nprocess and interface with user code. Dependencies are extremely minimal, and\nthe API is designed to be easily embedded in multi-physics codes that solve\nproblems in fluid dynamics, combustion, and chemical processing. In this paper,\nI first introduce the equations of chemical equilibrium, then spend some time\ndiscussing their numerical solution, and finally present a series of example\nproblems, with an emphasis on verification and validation of the solver.\n",
