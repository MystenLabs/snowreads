This\nwork identified the type of the defect and crystallographic behaviour by\ncreating energetically relaxed potential atomistic models of stacking faults in\nWC. Experimental evidence supporting the rotation axis along stacking fault\ncaused by variation in carbon ordering at the interstitial site has been\nestablished, in accordance with the theoretical model.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FDCnGKxLf72NxQUWI3_MnYaBG5TOA3R8QGGm7OFwtaQ","pdfSize":"1245607"}
