  "abstract": "  We present a machine learning method to assign stellar parameters\n(temperature, surface gravity, metallicity) to the photometric data of large\nphotometric surveys such as SDSS and SKYMAPPER. The method makes use of our\nprevious effort in homogenizing and recalibrating spectroscopic data from\nsurveys like APOGEE, GALAH, or LAMOST into a single catalog, which is used to\ninform a neural network. We obtain spectroscopic-quality parameters for\nmillions of stars that have only been observed photometrically. The typical\nuncertainties are of the order of 100K in temperature, 0.1 dex in surface\ngravity, and 0.1 dex in metallicity and the method performs well down to low\nmetallicity, were obtaining reliable results is known to be difficult.\n",
