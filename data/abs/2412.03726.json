A most interesting and intriguing phenomenon is that the diffusion\nof water is found to be strongly enhanced by the proximity of a hydrophobic\nconfining wall relative to the bulk diffusion. We report a molecular dynamics\nsimulation using a classical water model investigating the water diffusion near\na non-interacting smooth confining wall, which is assumed to imitate a\nhydrophobic surface. A pronounced diffusion enhancement is observed in the\nwater layers adjacent to the wall. We present evidence that the observed\ndiffusion enhancement can be accounted for, with numerical accuracy, using the\nuniversal scaling law for liquid diffusion that relates the liquid diffusion\nrate to the excess entropy. These results show that the scaling law, that has\nso far only been used for the description of the diffusion in simple liquids,\ncan successfully describe the diffusion in water. It is thus shown that the law\ncan be used for the description of water dynamics under nano-scale confinement\nwhich is currently a subject of intense research activity.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"cZzymwYoY_Ver2Hvhe5KnoJ4PyRcFmzsSeCgbobVcYg","pdfSize":"342747"}
