Using highly robust numerical tools for the Carreau-Yasuda model,\nwe discovered that linear instability, characterised by an azimuthal wavenumber\nof unity, can occur. When the base flow behaves like power law fluids, two\ndistinct unstable modes, a wall mode and a core mode, appear when the power law\nindex falls below the critical values of 0.35 and 0.43, respectively. The\nviscosity ratio from infinite to zero shear rate can significantly impact\ninstability, even if it is small, as observed in experiments. Under the\nparameters used in one of the experiments, where a linear critical point\nexists, we found that the nonlinear solutions undergo a supercritical\nbifurcation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iSR3y7jwGUzS9LBSxNx6OreOL3xtM4Y6Yz5bI5L7V1U","pdfSize":"7623230"}
