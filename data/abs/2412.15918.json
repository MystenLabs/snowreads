Systems facilitating co-located multiuser MR (Co-MUMR) experiences\nallow multiple users to co-present in a shared immersive virtual environment\nwith natural locomotion. They can be used to support a broad spectrum of\napplications such as immersive presentations, public exhibitions, psychological\nexperiments, etc. However, based on our experiences in delivering Co-MUMR\nexperiences in large architectures and our reflections, we noticed that the\ncrucial challenge for hosts to ensure the quality of experience is their lack\nof insight into the real-time information regarding visitor engagement, device\nperformance, and system events. This work facilitates the display of such\ninformation by introducing immersive in situ visualizations.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction","Computer Science/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rVl8NvhYuuApMUwtUzLXZRGycTrgVY2da9Z3GHgnGJI","pdfSize":"6245690"}
