It can be applied to the rough Bergomi\nmodel, avoiding the need to discuss finiteness of higher moments. Our\nmotivation stems from the theory of American option pricing, as an integrable\nsupremum implies the existence of an optimal stopping time for any linearly\nbounded payoff. Moreover, we survey the literature on martingales with\nnon-integrable supremum, and give a new construction that yields uniformly\nintegrable martingales with this property.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"XWPFNZrg0zI3-jtYNe0rKaxtMPF-a5BKsIDWxJU9g-k","pdfSize":"256557"}
