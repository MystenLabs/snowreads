They are\nconstructed systematically with the help of a larger, auxiliary space in a\nprocedure inspired by Cartan geometry originally proposed by Pol\\'a\\v{c}ek and\nSiegel for bosonic strings. It pivots around a maximally isotropic group that\ncaptures the generalized structure group of the physical space. We show how\ndropping the isotropy condition on this group allows us to describe\nheterotic/type I strings. As an immediate application, we construct a new\nfamily of heterotic backgrounds that interpolates between the two-dimensional\ncigar and trumpet backgrounds.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mb8bxERr8b3bXlt100IcfmhrvDNsDb2NnAinJ4YR7ds","pdfSize":"837889"}
