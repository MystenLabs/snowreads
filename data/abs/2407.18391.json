To rigorously evaluate this aspect, we\nintroduce the \"Uncontextualized Uncommon Objects\" (UOUO) benchmark. This\nbenchmark focuses on systematically testing VLMs with both large and small\nparameter counts on rare and specialized objects. Our comprehensive analysis\nreveals that while smaller VLMs maintain competitive performance on common\ndatasets, they significantly underperform on tasks involving uncommon objects.\nWe also propose an advanced, scalable pipeline for data collection and\ncleaning, ensuring the UOUO benchmark provides high-quality, challenging\ninstances. These findings highlight the need to consider long-tail\ndistributions when assessing the true capabilities of VLMs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"t6bb3zmUEf87iWw9yd9Ub7hCtiZVeiblhjfM2sgErGI","pdfSize":"1870271"}
