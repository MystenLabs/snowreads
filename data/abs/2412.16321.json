Therefore, we interviewed 25\nindustry extended reality (XR) developers, including freelancers, startups,\nmidsize, and big tech companies about their motivations, techniques, barriers,\nand attitudes towards incorporating accessibility features in their XR apps.\nOur study revealed a variety of challenges, including conflicting priorities\nbetween application and platform developers regarding accessibility\ninfrastructure; startups rapid development culture prohibiting accessible\ndevelopment; and the lack of accessible interaction design considerations at\nthe ideation, design, and early prototyping stages. As a comprehensive set of\nXR accessibility guidelines has yet to be established, we also compiled and\nevaluated a set of accessibility guidelines for 3D virtual worlds and addressed\ntheir limitations when applied to XR. Finally, we inform the creation of\neffective support methods for industry developers.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zQndTmDWexzrDnXxBhQOFWAIf0UDxauLm2L5H6x2Aiw","pdfSize":"5243949"}
