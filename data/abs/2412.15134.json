Cat codes have been proposed as low-level elements\nin larger architectures, and the theory of rotationally symmetric codes more\ngenerally has been significantly expanded in the recent literature. The\nfault-tolerant preparation and maintenance of cat code states as a stand-alone\nquantum error correction scheme remains however limited by the need for robust\nstate preparation and strong inter-mode interactions. In this work, we consider\nthe teleportation-based correction circuit for cat code quantum error\ncorrection. We show that the class of acceptable ancillary states is broader\nthan is typically acknowledged, and exploit this to propose the use of\nmany-component \"bridge\" states which, though not themselves in the cat code\nspace, are nonetheless capable of syndrome extraction in the regime where\nnon-linear interactions are a limiting factor.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"446ZqZGiO2XgKUH94uVFRLCpX8Aye_W0gaLReVLWafw","pdfSize":"1086283"}
