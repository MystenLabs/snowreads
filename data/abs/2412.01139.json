We show that, for any prize allocation, the\noptimal standard is always at a mode of performance that is weakly higher than\nthe global mode and identify a necessary and sufficient condition for it to be\nat the global mode. When the prize scheme can be designed as well, the\nwinner-take-all prize scheme is optimal for noise distributions with an\nincreasing failure rate; and awarding equal prizes to all qualifying agents is\noptimal for noise distributions with a decreasing failure rate. For\ndistributions with monotone likelihood ratios -- log-concave and log-convex,\nrespectively -- these pay schemes are also optimal in a larger class of\nanonymous, monotone contracts that may depend on cardinal performance.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"k7l485xy09GgHTgrcYSTaUOF4hdIBUTIHu9Sq8HMmkw","pdfSize":"1005180"}
