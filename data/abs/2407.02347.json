Predicting\nrapid crack propagation in the presence of inhomogeneities remains a challenge.\nLinear perturbations leave the net speed of fracture unchanged. We obtain a\nnonlinear equation of motion for planar crack fronts to gain insight into the\ndynamic fracture of moderately heterogeneous solids. The coupling of the front\ngeometry to the heterogeneity landscape renormalizes the energy dissipation and\nthe crack velocity. In materials whose toughness is weakly sensitive to crack\nspeed, such as silica glass, heterogeneity results in increased dissipation and\nslower crack propagation. However, heterogeneity has a reduced effect and may\neven facilitate fracture in strongly velocity-dependent materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fu3v1i92fAgOTjp0BjnmR6tNFyyXI0kUBBqznZicJwY","pdfSize":"1762228"}
