We\npredict that the mass of the n-th resonant state of toponium is given by\nMass(n)=0.81ln}(n) + 347GeV from the empirical law on the resonance level of\nthe bottomonium. The cross-section produced by electron-positron collisions is\n3X10^{-9}mb and an electron-positron collider would need an energy of 270GeV X\n270 GeV to find out the resonance state of toponium. This prediction is based\non the empirical law that the energy levels of hadron resonance states are\nexpressed in logarithms. An interpretation of the appearance of quark resonance\nstates in logarithmic intervals is also given in the paper. An application of\nthis model, we present that the Okubo-Zwig-lizuka law can be viewed as a\ncreation 11and annihilation problem of the two-dimensional resonance planes.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"fi2pd4guXfZnc-LcUgm7fPm6FhwyEgq7zt2KLH0qv7Y","pdfSize":"1448769"}
