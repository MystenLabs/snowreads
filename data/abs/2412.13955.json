The lower bounds can\nbe saturated by Steklov eigenfunctions on Euclidean balls and a family of\nsymmetric warped product manifolds. Moreover, as in Sogge and Taylor, we\nanalyze the interior behavior of harmonic functions by constructing a\nparametrix for the Poisson integral operator and calculate its composition with\nthe spectral cluster. By using microlocal analysis, we obtain several sharp\nestimates for the harmonic functions whose traces are quasimodes on the\nboundary. As applications, we establish the almost-orthogonality, bilinear\nestimates and transversal restriction estimates for Steklov eigenfunctions, and\ndiscuss the numerical approximation of harmonic functions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"55TzZbCyrwZXz6ZTVj81MWWPq0im8GWsWqq3yjRgFbk","pdfSize":"374433"}
