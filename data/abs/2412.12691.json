For this purpose, detailed information are obtained using list mode\nmeasurements where the neutron detection times are recorded in a file called\nthe time list file. In this article, we present the simulation and analysis of\nlist mode measurements performed on SILENE reactor. Analogue Monte Carlo\nsimulations are performed using MCNPX code and the synthetic time list file is\nobtained by processing the MCNPX-PTRAC coincidence capture file. Both measured\nand computed time list files are processed using the same postprocessor that we\nhave developed. This software is used to calculate counting statistics data\nlike counting number probability distribution, Rossi alpha and Feynman\nfunctions for time gates of increasing duration. The parameter uncertainties\nare evaluated using a block bootstrap method.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"woak5QY-iaK_23geeO7NDoAPIaQcCH24UA-u2aijj2M","pdfSize":"1289149"}
