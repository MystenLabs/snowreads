The protocluster galaxies exhibit a median\n$L^\\prime_{[\\text{CI}](2-1)}/L^\\prime_{[\\text{CI}](1-0)}$ ratio of 0.94 with an\ninterquartile range of 0.81-1.24. These ratios are markedly different to those\nobserved in DSFGs in the field (across a comparable redshift and 850$\\,\\mu$m\nflux density range), where the median is 0.55 with an interquartile range of\n0.50-0.76, and we show that this difference is driven by an excess of [CI](2-1)\nin the protocluster galaxies for a given 850$\\,\\mu$m flux density.

Our main interpretation of this result is that the protocluster\ngalaxies have had their cold gas driven to their cores via close-by\ninteractions within the dense environment, leading to an overall increase in\nthe average gas density and excitation temperature, and an elevated [CI](2-1)\nluminosity-to-far-infrared luminosity ratio.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4ZgEly48Jj5iY25acGg0VY74Ts0kqnU734GKYugefk8","pdfSize":"2796892"}
