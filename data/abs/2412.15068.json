Here, we study a\nmodel of parametrically driven cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity QED) for\nenhancing light-matter interaction while subjected to a finite-bandwidth\nsqueezed vacuum drive. Our method is capable of unveiling the effect of\nrelative bandwidth as well as squeezing required to observe the anticipated\nanti-crossing spectrum and enhanced cooperativity without the ideal squeezed\nbath assumption. Furthermore, we analyze the practicality of said models when\nincluding intrinsic photon loss due to resonators imperfection. With these\nresults, we outline the requirements for experimentally implementing an\neffectively squeezed bath in solid-state platforms such as InAs quantum dot\ncavity QED such that \\textit{in situ} control and enhancement of light-matter\ninteraction could be realized.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Agtn5Tp9mFOEvJPqtod5LKdC8HnnmUfJWp67hww_Zvk","pdfSize":"1582992"}
