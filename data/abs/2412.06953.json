  "abstract": "  Cotton theory (CT) introduces a higher derivative extension of General\nRelativity (GR) characterized by third-rank field equations. Recently, key\ndistinctions between CT and GR concerning wave and vacuum solutions have been\nhighlighted in [1, 2]. In this study, two particular non-vacuum solutions of CT\nare investigated within its Codazzi formulation. The motivation is to reveal\nhow this theory might account for or adapt to the effects of non-vacuum\nsources, and whether it can provide new insights into the behavior of both\nsingular and regular black holes in astrophysical contexts. It is shown that CT\ngeneralizes the Kiselev and Dymnikova solutions in GR. Some aspects of the\ngeneralized solutions, in particular concerning singularities, thermodynamics,\nand geodesics, are addressed in comparison to GR.\n",
