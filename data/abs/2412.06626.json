One of the foundational questions in\nthis direction is the origin of dark matter which directly links with its\ncreation. In the present article we study the gravitational production of dark\nmatter in two distinct contexts: firstly, when reheating occurs through the\ngravitational particle production, and secondly, when it is driven by the\ninflaton's decay. We establish a connection between the reheating temperature\nand the mass of dark matter, and from the reheating bounds, we determine the\nrange of viable dark matter mass values.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gIoQ8RtMvLYOxvdMO95STyu8OVjO-SvQrCdVLOaEDtU","pdfSize":"521957"}
