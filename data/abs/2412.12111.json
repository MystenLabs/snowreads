Accurate assessment is crucial for effective\ntreatment, but traditional perceptual assessments are limited by their\nsubjectivity and resource intensity. To mitigate the limitations, automatic\ndysarthric speech assessment methods have been proposed to support clinicians\non their decision-making. While these methods have shown promising results,\nmost research has focused on monolingual environments. However, multilingual\napproaches are necessary to address the global burden of dysarthria and ensure\nequitable access to accurate diagnosis. This thesis proposes a novel\nmultilingual dysarthria severity classification method, by analyzing three\nlanguages: English, Korean, and Tamil.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Sound","Computer Science/Computation and Language","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"ZZzbHXwbzy3Xo2CP3c5FZpTT5NfH866wWB9oNi_tDMU","pdfSize":"3888521"}
