These environments encourage research\nprogress by far, but often provide limited object interactability, visual\nappearance different from real-world environments, or relatively smaller\nenvironment sizes. This prevents the learned models in the virtual scenes from\nbeing readily deployable. To bridge the gap between these learning environments\nand deploying (i.e., real) environments, we propose the ReALFRED benchmark that\nemploys real-world scenes, objects, and room layouts to learn agents to\ncomplete household tasks by understanding free-form language instructions and\ninteracting with objects in large, multi-room and 3D-captured scenes.\nSpecifically, we extend the ALFRED benchmark with updates for larger\nenvironmental spaces with smaller visual domain gaps. With ReALFRED, we analyze\npreviously crafted methods for the ALFRED benchmark and observe that they\nconsistently yield lower performance in all metrics, encouraging the community\nto develop methods in more realistic environments. Our code and data are\npublicly available.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"_aejsa5tJTae2iZGYShcz3o5GLQR-aXsiq79UVKIjdk","pdfSize":"25913061"}
