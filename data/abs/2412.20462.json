  "abstract": "  We investigate the generation rate of the quantum entanglement in a system\ncomposed of multiple massive particles with large spin, where the mass of a\nsingle particle can be split into multiple trajectories by a generalized\nStern-Gerlach interferometer. Taking the coherent spin states (CSS) as the\ninitial state and considering the gravitational interaction due to Newtonian\npotential, we compute the generation rate of the entanglement for different\nconfigurations of the setup. Explicitly, the optimal polar angles of the spin\nare found numerically for systems with three and four particles, respectively.\nWe conclude that the amount of the entanglement increases with the number of\nparticles as well as the spin, and the configuration of the prism with a\nparticle at the center generates the best rate of the entanglement.\n",
