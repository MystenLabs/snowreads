We do this by connecting the Coxeter arrangements of the graph\nwith the homological algebra by introducing the concept of real flows. This\ncategorifies the notion of above and below for alcoves in a hyperplane\narrangement and allows us to generalise much of the machinery of real\nvariations for affine arrangements to the hyperbolic setting. In the process,\nwe show that the derived category with nilpotent cohomology is equivalent to\nthe derived category of nilpotent modules over the preprojective algebra.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"672kOi_3lJ55gLsHBlILLk5eRbk8Tzuv50dIzqGck-s","pdfSize":"1544392"}
