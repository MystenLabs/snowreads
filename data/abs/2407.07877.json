A degenerate twistor deformation (sometimes also\ncalled \"a Tate-Shafarevich twist\") is a family of holomorphically symplectic\nstructures on $M$ parametrized by $H^{1,1}(X)$. All members of this family are\nequipped with a holomorphic Lagrangian projection to $X$, and their fibers are\nisomorphic to the fibers of $\\pi$. Assume that $M$ is a compact hyperkahler\nmanifold of maximal holonomy, and the Lagrangian projection $\\pi$ has no\nmultiple fibers in codimension 1. We prove that $M$ has a degenerate twistor\ndeformation $M'$ such that the Lagrangian projection $\\pi:\\; M' \\to X$ admits a\nmeromorphic section.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jpByBaqNekPWqaQwnR7ALEuA5MFUbW814hdXcmZ7W-s","pdfSize":"310168"}
