We then generate synthetic observations based on\nthe simulation results. Using these, we investigate how the new polarization\ndata analysis method recently introduced by Doi et al. (2021) reflects the\nmagnetic field structure in turbulent filamentary molecular clouds. Doi et al.\n(2021) proposed that the $R_{\\rm{FWHM}}$, the ratio of the Full Width at Half\nMaximum (FWHM) of the polarized intensity ($PI$) to that of the total intensity\n($I$) can be used to probe the three-dimensional structure of the magnetic\nfield. We calculate the $R_{\\rm{FWHM}}$ from the density and magnetic field\nstructure obtained in the 3D-MHD simulations. We find that the mean and\nvariance of $R_{\\rm{FWHM}}$ within a filament are smaller and larger,\nrespectively, with a larger inclination of the magnetic field to the\nplane-of-sky. We also find that both small-scale ($<0.1~\\rm{pc}$) and\nlarge-scale ($\\gtrsim 0.1~\\rm{pc}$) turbulence affect the polarized intensity\nof the dust thermal emission. We conclude that future extensive observations of\n$R_{\\rm{FWHM}}$ may be able to quantify the inclination of the magnetic field\nto the plane-of-sky in the filamentary molecular clouds.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FVdw1VnlbvZrIzSdWy4WT9Fyl44hf-XeR4mxsKxD5WQ","pdfSize":"4089515"}
