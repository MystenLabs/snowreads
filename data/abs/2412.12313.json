  "abstract": "  In this paper, we introduce the generalized Cauchy dual $w(T) =\nT(T^{*}T)^{\\dagger}$ of a closed operator $T$ with the closed range between\nHilbert spaces and present intriguing findings that characterize the Cauchy\ndual of $T$. Additionally, we establish the result $w(T^{n}) = (w(T))^{n}$, for\nall $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, where $T$ is a quasinormal EP operator.\n",
