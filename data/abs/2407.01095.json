Unlike prior\nstudies that focused on trajectory tracking itself or UAV stabilization control\nin simulation, we evaluate the performance of a modified extended IC (eIC)\ncontroller compared to Model Predictive Control (MPC) through both simulated\nand laboratory experiments with a remotely controlled UAV.\n  The evaluation focuses on the computational efficiency and control quality of\nreal-time UAV trajectory tracking compared to previous IC applications. The\nresults demonstrate that the eIC controller achieves competitive performance\ncompared to MPC while significantly reducing computational complexity, making\nit a promising alternative for resource-constrained platforms.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"qmCg8zEM5l4tATxgBTIDQ1N79PxeINWvAoneGWnAbvw","pdfSize":"3311847"}
