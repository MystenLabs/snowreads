By leveraging the\nClifford group, which maps Pauli strings to other Pauli strings while\nmaintaining low computational complexity, we introduce a Clifford dressed\nsingle-site 1-TDVP scheme. During the TDVP integration, we apply a global\nClifford transformation as needed to reduce entanglement by iteratively\nsweeping over two-qubit Clifford unitaries that connect neighboring sites in a\ncheckerboard pattern. We validate the new algorithm numerically using various\nquantum many-body models, including both integrable and non-integrable systems.\nOur results demonstrate that the Clifford dressed TDVP significantly improves\nentanglement management and computational efficiency, achieving higher\naccuracy, extended simulation times, and enhanced precision in computed\nobservables compared to standard TDVP approaches. Additionally, we propose\nincorporating Clifford gates directly within the two-site 2-TDVP scheme.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LgzhWz9qb6Qeekaezg7uv-_xDNHJCxnnVw2iBuj9jw4","pdfSize":"1664129"}
