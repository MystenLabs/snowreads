This work develops a\ndecision-theoretic framework for maximizing profits subject to false discovery\nrate (FDR) control. We build an empirical Bayes solution for the problem via\nthe greedy knapsack approach. We derive an oracle rule based on ranking the\nratio of expected lifts and the cost of wrong rejections using the local false\ndiscovery rate (lfdr) statistic. Our oracle decision rule is valid and optimal\nfor large-scale tests. Further, we establish asymptotic validity for the\ndata-driven procedure and demonstrate finite-sample validity in experimental\nstudies. We also demonstrate the merit of the proposed method over other FDR\ncontrol methods. Finally, we discuss an application to actual Optimizely\nexperiments.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wLNiN-RErYZEhGNLG_u2EwJUjzQgbJEr1j_O2vHDoYo","pdfSize":"881894"}
