In this paper, we introduce a universal method for studying the\ngeneralized statistics of Abelian particles and extended excitations in\nlattices of any dimension. We compute the statistics using the Berry phase of a\nsequence of unitary operators that transports the excitations while canceling\nlocal ambiguities at each step. The sequence is derived from locality, using\nthe Smith normal form. We show that the statistics are quantized invariants.\nOur method unifies the statistics for the braiding and fusion of particles and\nloops, and leads to the discovery of novel statistics for membrane excitations.\nThe statistics can be interpreted as the quantum anomaly of a generalized\nglobal symmetry, which manifests as an obstruction to gauging the symmetry on\nlattices. Furthermore, we show that non-trivial statistics forbid short-range\nentangled states, establishing the dynamical consequence of anomalies in\nmicroscopic lattice models.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OjlEL2RIh-QJLNxYGNih_k56TfUZu6WlP-Ue_ES2ZSg","pdfSize":"1656989"}
