We introduce a\nsupersolid order parameter that uses vortex-vortex trajectory correlations to\nsimultaneously reveal the periodic density of the underlying solid and\nsuperfluidity in a single measure. We propose experiments using existing\ntechnology to optically create and image trajectories of vortex dipoles in\ndipolar BECs. We numerically test our observable and find that vortex-vortex\ncorrelations reveal the supersolid lattice structure while distinguishing it\nfrom superfluidity. Our method sets the stage for experiments to use vortex\ntrajectory correlations to investigate fundamental properties of supersolids\narising from their dynamics and phase transitions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qCmTBkJtmTMW74JAl7cB-Xrr4ggIO7kr36eSdfz6Se8","pdfSize":"5054434"}
