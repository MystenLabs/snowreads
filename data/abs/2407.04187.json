Asgard will enable investigations such as measurement\nof direct stellar masses for Galactic archaeology and direct detection of giant\nexoplanets to probe formation models using the first nulling interferometer in\nthe southern hemisphere. We present the design and implementation of the\nAstralis-built Heimdallr, the beam combiner for fringe tracking and stellar\ninterferometry in K band, as well as Solarstein, a novel implementation of a\n4-beam telescope simulator for alignment and calibration. In this update, we\nverify that the Heimdallr design is sufficient to perform diffraction-limited\nbeam combination. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Solarstein presents an\ninterface comparable to the VLTI with co-phased, equal intensity beams,\nenabling alignment and calibration for all Asgard instruments. In doing so, we\nshare techniques for aligning and implementing large instruments in bulk\noptics.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"a-kAm0ctSMWCNQweSBr2yLzLOQR9oJCOHjG_SxkJnHU","pdfSize":"645328"}
