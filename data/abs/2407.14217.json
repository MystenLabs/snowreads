The objective\nis dual: Firstly, to investigate the accumulation and development of dust\nthroughout the formation of planets, and secondly, to chemically examine\nprotoplanetary disks and protostellar envelopes by studying heavy molecules,\nsuch as chains and rings containing over seven carbon atoms, which exhibit\nsignificantly reduced strength at millimeter wavelengths.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aT23HOLYKxNvGaAO7e_g5idfVxmNj6ZEja3TqtDK7e4","pdfSize":"3032906","objectId":"0x2b2a40ecd4d2c8406fe31279d8c01841e8548c71808bf3e868e531efc94a792a","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
