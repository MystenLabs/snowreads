Lu and Peng\ndefined the semi-derived Ringel-Hall algebra $SH(\\mathcal{A})$ of $\\mathcal{A}$\nand proved that $SH(\\mathcal{A})$ has a natural basis and is isomorphic to the\nDrinfeld double Ringel-Hall algebra of $\\mathcal{A}$. In this paper, we\nintroduce a coproduct formula on $SH(\\mathcal{A})$ with respect to the basis of\n$SH(\\mathcal{A})$ and prove that this coproduct is compatible with the product\nof $SH(\\mathcal{A})$, thereby the semi-derived Ringel-Hall algebra of\n$\\mathcal{A}$ is endowed with a bialgebra structure which is identified with\nthe bialgebra structure of the Drinfeld double Ringel-Hall algebra of\n$\\mathcal{A}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"GYxtfCG6E1eFC2LMeZQLfEm7mWdbteNiqve88EVEeOo","pdfSize":"172354"}
