However, traditional GNNs often grapple with issues such as\ninstability, over-smoothing, and over-squashing, which can degrade performance\nand create a trade-off dilemma. In this paper, we introduce a discriminatively\ntrained, multi-layer Deep Scattering Message Passing (DSMP) neural network\ndesigned to overcome these challenges. By harnessing spectral transformation,\nthe DSMP model aggregates neighboring nodes with global information, thereby\nenhancing the precision and accuracy of graph signal processing. We provide\ntheoretical proofs demonstrating the DSMP's effectiveness in mitigating these\nissues under specific conditions. Additionally, we support our claims with\nempirical evidence and thorough frequency analysis, showcasing the DSMP's\nsuperior ability to address instability, over-smoothing, and over-squashing.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ytyvIftz3M74R_wi2wk0TGvSDmFCZ0U1AqgzKWLgcJ8","pdfSize":"6265741"}
