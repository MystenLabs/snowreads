We explore the Platonic\nview that mathematics can be discovered from its axioms - a game of conjecture\nand proof. We describe Minimo (Mathematics from Intrinsic Motivation): an agent\nthat jointly learns to pose challenging problems for itself (conjecturing) and\nsolve them (theorem proving). Given a mathematical domain axiomatized in\ndependent type theory, we first combine methods for constrained decoding and\ntype-directed synthesis to sample valid conjectures from a language model. Our\nmethod guarantees well-formed conjectures by construction, even as we start\nwith a randomly initialized model. We use the same model to represent a policy\nand value function for guiding proof search. Our agent targets generating hard\nbut provable conjectures - a moving target, since its own theorem proving\nability also improves as it trains. We propose novel methods for hindsight\nrelabeling on proof search trees to significantly improve the agent's sample\nefficiency in both tasks. Experiments on 3 axiomatic domains (propositional\nlogic, arithmetic and group theory) demonstrate that our agent can bootstrap\nfrom only the axioms, self-improving in generating true and challenging\nconjectures and in finding proofs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vlDcZVsyvOZBMti7pu3csPJshrIMcQSGnbxu7Us81Qw","pdfSize":"741895","objectId":"0x406100758dacf9508d79d3ebc1cc3cd91210439913ad94df6bc4db8a42e6002a","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
