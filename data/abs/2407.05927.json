The MMF resolves large-scale convection using\na coarse grid while simultaneously resolving local features through numerous\nfine local grids and coupling them seamlessly. Both large- and small-scale\nprocesses are modeled using the compressible Navier-Stokes equations within the\nNonhydrostatic Unified Model of the Atmosphere (NUMA), and they are discretized\nusing a continuous element-based Galerkin method (spectral elements) with\nhigh-order basis functions. Consequently, the large-scale and small-scale\nmodels share the same dynamical core but have the flexibility to be adjusted\nindividually. The proposed MMF method is tested in 2D and 3D idealized\nlimited-area weather problems involving storm clouds produced by squall line\nand supercell simulations. The MMF numerical results showed enhanced\nrepresentation of cloud processes compared to the coarse model.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"241EiPC6_ri_NMWVuxjhszNtyFCM-cZIgPHVkUg-0Rs","pdfSize":"19348217"}
