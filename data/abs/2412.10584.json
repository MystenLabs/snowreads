To hint that\nthe moir\\'e between graphene and its supporting substrate contributes to the\nhomogeneity of nonlinear currents, the change in the local potential $\\Delta\nV(r)$ around horizontally strained graphene due to a homobilayer of hexagonal\nboron nitride (hBN) was obtained from ab initio calculations, and corrections\nto on-site energies and hopping matrix elements on graphene's tight-binding\nelectronic dispersion of $\\pi-$electrons were calculated. Relying on a\nsemiclassical approximation, Berry dipoles $D$ are seen to change orientation\nand wind throughout the moir\\'e lattice.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_x3LvTeZFHyBKIqQPemGKniS2ugwujwRP4n5nh-bT3M","pdfSize":"5814350"}
