  "abstract": "  The first search for a heavy neutral spin-1 gauge boson (Z') with\nnonuniversal fermion couplings produced via vector boson fusion processes and\ndecaying to tau leptons or W bosons is presented. The analysis is performed\nusing LHC data at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, collected from 2016 to 2018 and\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. The data are\nconsistent with the standard model predictions. Upper limits are set on the\nproduct of the cross section for production of the Z' boson and its branching\nfraction to $\\tau\\tau$ or WW. The presence of a Z' boson decaying to\n$\\tau^+\\tau^-$ (W$^+$W$^-$) is excluded for masses up to 2.45 (1.60) TeV,\ndepending on the Z' boson coupling to SM weak bosons, and assuming a Z' $\\to$\n$\\tau^+\\tau^-$ (W$^+$W$^-$) branching fraction of 50%.\n",
