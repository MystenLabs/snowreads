We investigate the effect of varying physical parameters, such as\ntemperature, density and the cosmic ray ionisation rate (CRIR), on the\nmolecular abundance evolution in low-metallicity hot cores using the UMIST gas\nphase chemical model. CRIR had the strongest effect on molecular abundance. The\nresultant molecular abundances were divided into three categories with\ndifferent trends in time evolution. We compared our results with the\nobservations of hot cores in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Our model fits\nbest with the observations at a time of around $10^5$ years after the\nevaporation of ice and at the CRIR of $1.36 \\times 10^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$. The\nresultant abundances of the oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules (COMs),\nsuch as CH$_3$OH, HCOOCH$_3$ and CH$_3$OCH$_3$, do not fit with observations in\nthe same physical condition and may be located in a different physical\nenvironment. Our results suggest that investigating the CRIR value is crucial\nto predict the molecular evolution in LMC hot cores.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"cLA7fbj1qctr_rwUOkeRR2rwyLmf6YeAb4yT20gyaA4","pdfSize":"1293717"}
