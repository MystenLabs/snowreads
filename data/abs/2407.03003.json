The robot has to interact with the\nenvironment to inspect structures and perform non-destructive measurements. A\nparallel force-impedance control technique is developed to establish contact\nwith the designed surface with a desired force profile. During the interaction,\na pushing phase is required to create a vacuum between the surface and the\nechometer sensor mounted at the end-effector, to measure the thickness of the\ninteraction surface. Repetitive measures are performed to show the\nrepeatability of the algorithm.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"wV8j-NpS2UfwJzk_vmBrjRj_VZ-FySr-pZ5lgJd20ds","pdfSize":"8280329"}
