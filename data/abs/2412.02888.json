Here we use concepts from robust optimization to derive a robust OCS\nproblem and develop two ways to solve the problem using either conic\noptimization or sequential quadratic programming. We have developed the\nopen-source Python package 'robustocs' that leverages the Gurobi and HiGHS\nsolvers to carry out these methods. Our testing shows favourable performance\nwhen solving the robust OCS problem using sequential quadratic programming and\nthe HiGHS solver.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"juKGrdjfWNzsMYLsBwAyBk1GdYK-CgMNtJMrHSv3C7s","pdfSize":"156598"}
