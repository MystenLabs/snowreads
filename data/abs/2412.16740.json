  "abstract": "  In this paper we complete B\\\"{u}chi's proof that there is no decision\nalgorithm for the solubility in integers of arbitrary systems of diagonal\nquadratic form equations, by proving the assertion that whenever $x_1^2,\n\\cdots, x_5^2$ are five squares such that the second differences satisfy\n  \\[x_{k+2}^2 - 2 x_{k+1}^2 + x_k^2 = 2\\]\n  for $k = 1,2,3$, then they must be consecutive. This answers a question of\nJ.~Richard~B\\\"{u}chi.\n",
