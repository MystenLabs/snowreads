Ad targeting algorithms rely\non detailed user profiles and behavioral data to deliver personalized\nadvertisements, thereby driving revenue through targeted placements.\nConversely, organic retrieval systems aim to improve user experience by\nrecommending content that matches user preferences. This paper compares these\ntwo applications and explains the most effective methods employed in each.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TItKuRG4AE--L6vqn_-4tZ_RBnR_2dY4YxAMXAwEPPY","pdfSize":"1208986"}
