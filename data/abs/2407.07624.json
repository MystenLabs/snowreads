The central question is how the vapor flux is\ndistributed between the growth of previously condensed drops and the nucleation\nof new ones. Here, we investigate the nucleation, growth, and coalescence of\ndroplets on soft crosslinked polymer networks. The number of droplets initially\nremains constant, until drops start to coarsen according to a universal law;\nboth phenomena are explained via the formation of a saturated boundary layer.\nAlthough nucleation occurs at a scale where the polymer network resembles a\nmelt, we quantitatively unveil an algebraic sensitivity of the number of\ndroplets on the substrate elasticity. Our findings suggest that nucleation\nfollows a surprisingly low-energy pathway, influenced by the degree of\ncrosslinking. Consequently, breath figures offer a macroscopic approach to\nprobe the molecular characteristics of the polymer interface.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FxGqUrR0QRvAw_RzXrwdxnakEqx_15hM6I2iT2MJWoI","pdfSize":"19404018"}
