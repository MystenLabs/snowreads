  "abstract": "  In Integrated Sensing And Communication (ISAC) systems, estimating the\nmicro-Doppler (mD) spectrogram of a target requires combining channel estimates\nretrieved from communication with ad-hoc sensing packets, which cope with the\nsparsity of the communication traffic. Hence, the mD quality depends on the\ntransmission strategy of the sensing packets, which is still a challenging\nproblem with no known solutions. In this letter, we design a deep Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) framework that fragments such a problem into a sequence of\nsimpler decisions and takes advantage of the mD temporal evolution for\nmaximizing the reconstruction performance. Our method is the first that learns\nsampling patterns to directly optimize the mD quality, enabling the adaptation\nof ISAC systems to variable communication traffic. We validate the proposed\napproach on a dataset of real channel measurements, reaching up to 40% higher\nmD reconstruction accuracy and several times lower computational complexity\nthan state-of-the-art methods.\n",
