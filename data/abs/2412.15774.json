Yet, such active\noriented materials are prone to well-known instabilities, raising the question\nof how oriented tissue deformation can be robust during morphogenesis. In a\nsimple scenario, we recently showed that active oriented deformation can be\nstabilized by the boundary-imposed gradient of a scalar field, which\nrepresents, e.g., a morphogen gradient in a developing embryo. Here, we discuss\na more realistic scenario, where the morphogen is produced by a localized\nsource region, diffuses across the tissue, and degrades. Consistent with our\nearlier results, we find that oriented tissue deformation is stable in the\ngradient-extensile case, i.e. when active stresses act to extend the tissue\nalong the direction of the gradient, but it is unstable in the\ngradient-contractile case. In addition, we now show that gradient-contractile\ntissues can not be stabilized even by morphogen diffusion. Finally, we point\nout the existence of an additional instability, which results from the\ninterplay of tissue shear and morphogen diffusion. Our theoretical results\nexplain the lack of gradient-contractile tissues in the biological literature,\nsuggesting that the active matter instability acts as an evolutionary selection\ncriterion.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Quantitative Biology/Tissues and Organs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YYlNY6H13pvUocj0PAceg4LNzORvBS5xGHs-3rnjOvg","pdfSize":"3978864"}
