Switching to the rescaled exchange and anisotropy constants allows\none to investigate the dynamics by using a reduced number of variables, which\ngreatly speeds up computations. The proposed dynamical scaling is applied to\nthe problem of microwave absorption by a random anisotropy magnet. The\nequivalence of the rescaled model to the original atomic model is confirmed\nnumerically. The method is proposed as a powerful tool in studying static and\ndynamic properties of systems with quenched randomness.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"eDVnlJ7JmLBPZEkDd8Ni6kRDX9o34FwYO3px4gqqtpg","pdfSize":"2696902"}
