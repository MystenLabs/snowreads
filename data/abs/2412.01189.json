  "abstract": "  Recent advancements of generative LLMs (Large Language Models) have exhibited\nhuman-like language capabilities but have shown a lack of domain-specific\nunderstanding. Therefore, the research community has started the development of\ndomain-specific LLMs for many domains. In this work we focus on discussing how\nto build mining domain-specific LLMs, as the global mining industry contributes\nsignificantly to the worldwide economy. We report on MiningGPT, a mining\ndomain-specific instruction-following 7B parameter LLM model which showed a\n14\\% higher mining domain knowledge test score as compared to its parent model\nMistral 7B instruct.\n",
