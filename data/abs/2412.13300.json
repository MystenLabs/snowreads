Concurrently, the truncation to singlets under any subgroup of the\nsphere isometry group leads to consistent truncations with less or no\nsupersymmetry. We review the relation between these truncations in the\nframework of exceptional field theory. As an application, we derive three new\nG$_2$-invariant solutions of $D=11$ supergravity. Their geometry is of the form\nAdS$_4\\times \\Sigma_7$ where $\\Sigma_7$ is a deformed seven-sphere, preserving\nSO(7) isometries.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"933e_Z04HtiW7Rdb8Yyeyxs-5idAE-PcMOTBBFA7QIc","pdfSize":"1720102"}
