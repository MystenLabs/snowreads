  "abstract": "  In an effort to quantify and combat sexual assault, US colleges and\nuniversities are required to disclose the number of reported sexual assaults on\ntheir campuses each year. However, many instances of sexual assault are never\nreported to authorities, and consequently the number of reported assaults does\nnot fully reflect the true total number of assaults that occurred; the reported\nvalues could arise from many combinations of reporting rate and true incidence.\nIn this paper we estimate these underlying quantities via a hierarchical\nBayesian model of the reported number of assaults. We use informative priors,\nbased on national crime statistics, to act as a tiebreaker to help distinguish\nbetween reporting rates and incidence. We outline a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo\n(HMC) sampling scheme for posterior inference regarding reporting rates and\nassault incidence at each school, and apply this method to campus sexual\nassault data from 2014-2019. Results suggest an increasing trend in reporting\nrates for the overall college population during this time. However, the extent\nof underreporting varies widely across schools. That variation has implications\nfor how individual schools should interpret their reported crime statistics.\n",
