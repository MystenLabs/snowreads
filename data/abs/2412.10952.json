To achieve this goal, we\nassociate to each cocommutative coalgebra $C$ and each linear monoidal category\n$\\M$, a $\\Bbbk$-linear monoidal category $\\M_{C}$. This construction is\nfunctorial: any coalgebra morphism $\\iota:C\\to\\widetilde{C}$\n  induces a strict monoidal functor $\\iota^{*}:\\M_{\\widetilde{C}}\\to\\M_{C}$. An\n$\\iota$-deformation of an algebra $(A,m)$ is defined as an algebra\n$(A,\\widetilde{m})$ in the fiber of $\\iota^{*}$ over $(A,m)$. Within this\nframework, the deformations of $(A,m)$ are organized into a presheaf, which is\nshown to be representable. In other words, there exists a universal deformation\nsatisfying a specific universal property.\n  It is well established that classical deformation theory is deeply connected\nto Hochschild cohomology. We identify and analyze the cohomology theory that\ngoverns $\\iota$-deformations in the second part of the paper. Additionally,\nseveral particular cases and applications of these results are examined in\ndetail.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9lDZz1Co9tkQ3ng3rFjhbqYuy1viX9CccJ4Jtj4l_hg","pdfSize":"646196"}
