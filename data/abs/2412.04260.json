  "abstract": "  Domain shift in the field of histopathological imaging is a common phenomenon\ndue to the intra- and inter-hospital variability of staining and digitization\nprotocols. The implementation of robust models, capable of creating generalized\ndomains, represents a need to be solved. In this work, a new domain adaptation\nmethod to deal with the variability between histopathological images from\nmultiple centers is presented. In particular, our method adds a training\nconstraint to the supervised contrastive learning approach to achieve domain\nadaptation and improve inter-class separability. Experiments performed on\ndomain adaptation and classification of whole-slide images of six skin cancer\nsubtypes from two centers demonstrate the method's usefulness. The results\nreflect superior performance compared to not using domain adaptation after\nfeature extraction or staining normalization.\n",
