While most original in situ DNA (oriDNA) was lost,\nancient DNA (aDNA) from petroleum offers an important source of ecological and\nevolutionary information, surpassing traditional fossils. This study reveals\nthat oil, mainly sourced from algae and lower aquatic plants, now serves as a\nnew type of fossil, providing detailed insights into Earth's hidden history,\nincluding unclassified species and ancient events, revolutionizing petroleum\ngeology and paleontology.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Genomics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CWWUOI38WURy5ZueDRF8JxuOmzTtNfqQSSTo_ITyBVY","pdfSize":"1746266"}
