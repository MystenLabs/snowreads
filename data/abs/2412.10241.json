For an \\'etale groupoid $G$, we also establish a bound on the\nnuclear dimension of its $C^*$-algebra provided the quotient of $G$ by its\nisotropy subgroupid has finite dynamic asymptotic dimension in the sense of\nGuentner, Willet and Yu. Our results generalise those of C.~B\\\"oncicke and\nK.~Li to groupoids with large isotropy, including graph groupoids of directed\ngraphs whose $C^*$-algebras are AF-embeddable: we find that the nuclear\ndimension of their $C^*$-algebras is at most $1$. We also show that the nuclear\ndimension of the $C^*$-algebra of a twist over $G$ has the same bound on the\nnuclear dimension as for $C^*(G)$ and the twisted groupoid $C^*$-algebra.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GYwrOY62yNOiOULxKfWHHx8PoB0AawWLnPi6WOUhBsU","pdfSize":"426495"}
