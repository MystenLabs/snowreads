Breaker has won\nonce the tree's root is contained in a finite component, otherwise Maker wins\nby building an infinite path starting at the root. It will be analyzed both as\na positional game (the tree is known to both players at the start) and with\nmore restrictive levels of information (the players essentially explore the\ntree during the game). Reading the number of available edges for play as a\nrandom walk on $\\mathbb{Z}$ allows us to derive the winning probability of\nBreaker via fixed point equations in three natural information regimes. These\nresults provide new insights into combinatorial game theory and random\nstructures, with potential applications to network theory, algorithmic game\ndesign and probability theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZfCDzwFavObU9kOfRwb2boM_vmFQEj0kqiLxh8EMj2s","pdfSize":"824018"}
