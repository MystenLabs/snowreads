Among them 19,536 are\nalternating and have arc index 16. Among the non-alternating knots, 17, 477,\nand 3,180 have arc index 10, 11, and 12, respectively. The remaining 23,762\nhave arc index 13 or 14. There are none with arc index smaller than 10 or\nlarger than 14. We used the Dowker-Thistlethwaite code of the 23,762 knots\nprovided by the program Knotscape to locate non-alternating edges in their\ndiagrams. Our method requires at least six non-alternating edges to find arc\npresentations with 13 arcs. We obtained 8,027 knots having arc index 13. We\nshow them by their minimal grid diagrams. The remaining 15,735 prime\nnon-alternating 14 crossing knots have arc index 14 as determined by the lower\nbound obtained from the Kauffman polynomial.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Z_2eTC6vZYaMqz896SLSpJu2PCIXS7dGTOwR7--Oj9I","pdfSize":"1887347","objectId":"0x52caa27b3c580d05f4a4da4a6df7fe3c321b9710dd7f47b8554251e726ccfbb6","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
