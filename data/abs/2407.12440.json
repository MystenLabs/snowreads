Current methods rely\nheavily on feature engineering and labeled information, both of which have\nsignificant limitations. In this work, we present GraphGuard, a novel\ncontrastive self-supervised graph-based framework for detecting fraudulent\ncredit card transactions. We conduct experiments on a real-world dataset and a\nsynthetic dataset. Our results provide a promising initial direction for\nexploring the effectiveness of graph-based self-supervised approaches for\ncredit card fraud detection.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"tyWkQbmZqpl4i305Rcb2oCrYd2esAAuRecdChPlbZo0","pdfSize":"460032"}
