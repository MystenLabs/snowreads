  "abstract": "  Logs are critical resources that record events, activities, or messages\nproduced by software applications, operating systems, servers, and network\ndevices. However, consolidating the heterogeneous logs and cross-referencing\nthem is challenging and complicated. Manually analyzing the log data is\ntime-consuming and prone to errors. LogBabylon is a centralized log data\nconsolidating solution that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated\nwith Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology. LogBabylon interprets the\nlog data in a human-readable way and adds insight analysis of the system\nperformance and anomaly alerts. It provides a paramount view of the system\nlandscape, enabling proactive management and rapid incident response.\nLogBabylon consolidates diverse log sources and enhances the extracted\ninformation's accuracy and relevancy. This facilitates a deeper understanding\nof log data, supporting more effective decision-making and operational\nefficiency. Furthermore, LogBabylon streamlines the log analysis process,\nsignificantly reducing the time and effort required to interpret complex\ndatasets. Its capabilities extend to generating context-aware insights,\noffering an invaluable tool for continuous monitoring, performance\noptimization, and security assurance in dynamic computing environments.\n",
