We\nprove that \\[ {\\rm Var} (Mf)\\le {\\rm Var} (f) - \\frac12\\big|\n|f(\\infty)|-|f(-\\infty)|\\big| \\] for piecewise constant functions $f$ with\nnonzero and zero values alternating. The above inequality strengthens a recent\nresult of Bilz and Weigt proved for indicator functions of bounded variation\nvanishing at $\\pm\\infty$. We conjecture that the inequality holds for all\nfunctions of bounded variation, which is a stronger version of the known\nconjecture ${\\rm Var} (Mf)\\le {\\rm Var} (f)$. We also obtain the discrete\ncounterpart of our theorem, moreover proving a transference result on\nequivalency between both settings that is of independent interest.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4JUd3sXjanoYuQivhZGIv_48gUAONdeP4ClHk0x8cpQ","pdfSize":"185189"}
