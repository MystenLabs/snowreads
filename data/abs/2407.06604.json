This article addresses why and how corporate newsrooms\ntransform corporate communication following the rise of artificial intelligence\n(AI) systems. It draws on original data from 13 semi-structured interviews with\nexecutive communication experts in large Swiss companies which use corporate\nnewsrooms. Interviews show that corporate newsrooms serve as an organisational\n(rather than spatial) coordination body for topic-oriented and agile corporate\ncommunication. To enable their functionality, it is crucial to find the right\nbalance between optimising and stabilising communication structures. Newsrooms\nactively adopt AI both to facilitate routine tasks and enable more innovative\napplications, such as living data archives and channel translations. Interviews\nalso highlight an urgent need for AI regulation for corporate communication.\nThe article's findings provide important insights into the practical challenges\nand coping strategies for establishing and managing corporate newsrooms and how\nnewsrooms can be transformed by AI.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0cGKX3KYkeFQeG5p_L2oYHp2wpIIudse3KX58IrP6K4","pdfSize":"240782"}
