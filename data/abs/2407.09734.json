Over\ndecades, researchers have conducted theoretical and experimental studies on the\nnew magic number Z(N) = 6, focusing on observables such as radii, binding\nenergy, electromagnetic transition, and nucleon separation energies. We perform\nthe ab initio no-core shell model calculations for the occupation numbers of\nthe lowest single particle states in the ground states of Z(N) = 6 and Z(N) = 8\nisotopes (isotones). Our calculations do not support Z(N) = 6 as a magic number\nover a span of atomic numbers. However, 14C and 14O exhibit the characteristics\nof double-magic nuclei.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"93k-Am9xqV4Q_Euy5g-b8YHd_jtqD2C_rRvy1AxpgKQ","pdfSize":"188876"}
