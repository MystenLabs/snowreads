Despite the vast potential that data holds for\nstrategic insights and operational efficiencies, substantial challenges arise\nin the form of data issues. Recognizing these obstacles, the imperative for\neffective data governance (DG) becomes increasingly apparent. This research\nendeavors to bridge the gap in DG research within the Operations and Supply\nChain Management (OSCM) domain through a comprehensive literature review.\nInitially, we redefine DG through a synthesis of existing definitions,\ncomplemented by insights gained from DG practices. Subsequently, we delineate\nthe constituent elements of DG. Building upon this foundation, we develop an\nanalytical framework to scrutinize the collected literature from the\nperspectives of both OSCM and DG. Beyond a retrospective analysis, this study\nprovides insights for future research directions. Moreover, this study also\nmakes a valuable contribution to the industry, as the insights gained from the\nliterature are directly applicable to real-world scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"ubqGfL_y4AYiycEkp9a9c8oUeTWxkG7BV-DIe0xPNXE","pdfSize":"559025"}
