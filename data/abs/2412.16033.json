A striking fact is that the neutrino seesaw scale is\ntypically around the cosmological inflation scale. In this work, we propose a\nframework incorporating inflation and neutrino seesaw in which the inflaton\nprimarily decays into right-handed neutrinos after inflation. This decay\nprocess is governed by the inflaton interaction with the right-handed neutrinos\nthat respects the shift symmetry. Under the neutrino seesaw mechanism,\nfluctuations of the Higgs field can modulate the inflaton decays, contributing\nto the curvature perturbation. We investigate the induced non-Gaussian\nsignatures and demonstrate that such signatures provides an important means to\nprobe the high-scale neutrino seesaw mechanism.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rLr3qBcX2N7dcY0mKJJinomQL0HRm7Vgh25AQNHZKwc","pdfSize":"2446119"}
