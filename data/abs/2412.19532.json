  "abstract": "  The light scattering experiment establishes a relationship between refractive\nindex fluctuations and fractal dimension in weakly scattering tissue-like\nmedia. Based on the box-counting approach, an analytical model is developed and\nshows that the fractal dimension has a functional dependency on the structural\ndisorder or refractive index fluctuation for short-range correlation and\napproximately linearly depends on each other for tissue-like media. Several\nparametric imaging systems can be connected using this approach. Further,\ntissue's weak multifractality optical scattering is explored using the\nbox-counting method. It is shown that with a functional transformation, the\ndistribution follows lognormal distributions.\n",
