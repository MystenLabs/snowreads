  "abstract": "  This paper investigates the global dynamics of the Euler--Riesz system in\nthree dimensions, focusing on the well-posedness and large-time behavior of\nsolutions near equilibrium. The system generalizes classical interactions by\nincorporating the Riesz interactions $\\nabla (-\\Delta)^{-\\sigma/2}(\\rho - 1)$.\nWe show that the system admits a global smooth solution for small irrotational\ninitial perturbations. Specifically, we establish that if the initial data is\nsufficiently small, the solution remains regular globally in time and decays\nover time at a rate dependent on $\\sigma$.\n",
