  "abstract": "  This paper presents an autoethnography of my recent trip to China, during\nwhich I engaged in using various apps and discovered the cultural and social\nnorms embedded in everyday mobile app use. Navigating between Western and\nChinese cultures, my experience was simultaneously exhilarating, embarrassing,\nand bewildering. Through this autoethnography, I aim to illustrate how I\nadjusted to Chinese technological norms, usage patterns, and interactions\nduring my initial stay, and to offer observations on the technosocial\ndifferences related to smartphone apps in both cultures. Using descriptions and\nsummative analyses, I identified four meaningful themes: 1) smartphones as the\nbackbone for modern living in China, 2) smartphone attachment, 3) the\nsuperapps, and 4) the intricate web of Chinese technosocial norms governing\neveryday usage. Taken together, these findings highlight how cultural and\nsocietal differences shape app design and user experiences, consequently\ninfluencing how travelers and expatriates adapt to an increasingly digitalized\nworld.\n",
