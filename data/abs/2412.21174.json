  "abstract": "  This is the first article in a series aimed at classifying normal del Pezzo\nsurfaces of Picard rank one over algebraically closed fields of arbitrary\ncharacteristic up to an isomorphism. Our guiding invariant is the height of a\ndel Pezzo surface, defined as the minimal intersection number of the\nexceptional divisor of the minimal resolution and a fiber of some\n$\\mathbb{P}^1$-fibration. The geometry of del Pezzo surfaces gets more\nconstrained as the height grows; in characteristic $0$ no example of height\nbigger than $4$ is known.\n  In this article, we classify del Pezzo surfaces of Picard rank one and height\nat most $2$; in particular we describe the non-log terminal ones. We also\ndescribe a natural class of del Pezzo surfaces which have descendants with\nelliptic boundary, i.e. whose minimal resolution has a birational morphism onto\na canonical del Pezzo surface of rank one mapping the exceptional divisor to an\nanti-canonical curve.\n",
