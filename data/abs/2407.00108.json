However, the positive impact of such\nsystems in industry remains unproven. We report on an industrial case study\ncarried out to investigate the benefit of MT in a professional scenario of\ntranslating TV subtitles with a focus on how leveraging extra-textual context\nimpacts post-editing. We found that post-editors marked significantly fewer\ncontext-related errors when correcting the outputs of MTCue, the context-aware\nmodel, as opposed to non-contextual models. We also present the results of a\nsurvey of the employed post-editors, which highlights contextual inadequacy as\na significant gap consistently observed in MT. Our findings strengthen the\nmotivation for further work within fully contextual MT.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"nZwYXFvSVpHYI4Mpg2j1B8NlPIjnwWsR2_3jfAQFpjs","pdfSize":"8892273"}
