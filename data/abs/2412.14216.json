Visual TCAD simulator and the Python\nhigh-level language were employed for the entire simulation process. However,\nthe computational cost was found to be excessively high. The machine learning\napproach represents a novel method for predicting the effects of different\nsources on NCFETs while also reducing computational costs. The algorithm of an\nartificial neural network can effectively predict multi-input to single-output\nrelationships and enhance existing techniques. The analog parameters of Double\nMetal Double Gate Negative Capacitance FETs (D2GNCFETs) are demonstrated across\nvarious temperatures ($T$), oxide thicknesses ($T_{ox}$), substrate thicknesses\n($T_{sub}$), and ferroelectric thicknesses ($T_{Fe}$). Notably, at $T=300K$,\nthe switching ratio is higher and the leakage current is $84$ times lower\ncompared to $T=500K$. Similarly, at ferroelectric thicknesses $T_{Fe}=4nm$, the\nswitching ratio improves by $5.4$ times compared to $T_{Fe}=8nm$. Furthermore,\nat substrate thicknesses $T_{sub}=3nm$, switching ratio increases by $81\\%$\nfrom $T_{sub}=7nm$. For oxide thicknesses at $T_{ox}=0.8nm$, the ratio\nincreases by $41\\%$ compared to $T_{ox}=0.4nm$. The analysis reveals that\n$T_{Fe}=4nm$, $T=300K$, $T_{ox}=0.8nm$, and $T_{sub}=3nm$ represent the optimal\nsettings for D2GNCFETs, resulting in significantly improved performance. These\nfindings can inform various applications in nanoelectronic devices and\nintegrated circuit (IC) design.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zcaAsEQrC00ZdkRnLydyiuwpMNBADbvlJiue3_LqV-M","pdfSize":"20487535"}
