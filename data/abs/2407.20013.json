We elaborate\non the specific challenges encountered during system design, and how we tackled\nthem; namely a small, very imbalanced dataset with a high number of classes and\nhigh visual similarity between classes. We then show how we employed triplet\nnetworks and the multiple input modalities of images, measurements, and genetic\ninformation to overcome these challenges and reach a performance comparable to\nthat of a trained domain expert.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"SgcpgePxTcP6ixKCa4DxXau5qOl3MqXa9Bpl0-43S4s","pdfSize":"24211768"}
