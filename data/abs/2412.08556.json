By optimal, we mean as fast as possible, which is evaluated by a\nmeasure known as the makespan of the proposed solution. This is the setting\nstudied in the Multiagent Path Finding problem. In this work, we additionally\nprovide the agents with a way to communicate with each other. Due to size\nconstraints, it is reasonable to assume that the range of communication of each\nagent will be limited. What should be the trajectories of the agents to,\nadditionally, maintain a backbone of communication? In this work, we study the\nMultiagent Path Finding with Communication Constraint problem under the\nparameterized complexity framework.\n  Our main contribution is three exact algorithms that are efficient when\nconsidering particular structures for the input network. We provide such\nalgorithms for the case when the communication range and the number of agents\n(the makespan resp.) are provided in the input and the network has a tree\ntopology, or bounded maximum degree (has a tree-like topology, i.e., bounded\ntreewidth resp.). We complement these results by showing that it is highly\nunlikely to construct efficient algorithms when considering the number of\nagents as part of the input, even if the makespan is $3$ and the communication\nrange is $1$.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computational Complexity","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ka20IXBv227mvb12zEVX7k16eSO6_1TdZXuEzxU76Jg","pdfSize":"204959"}
