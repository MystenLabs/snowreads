The readout is\ntypically benchmarked by integrating the readout signal and choosing a binary\nthreshold to extract the \"readout fidelity\". We show that such a\ncharacterization may significantly overlook readout-induced leakage errors. We\nintroduce a method to quantitatively assess this error by repeatedly executing\na composite operation -- a readout preceded by a randomized qubit-flip. We\napply this technique to characterize the dispersive readout of an intrinsically\nPurcell-protected qubit. We report a binary readout fidelity of $99.63\\%$ and\nquantum non-demolition (QND) fidelity exceeding $99.00\\%$ which takes into\naccount a leakage error rate of $0.12\\pm0.03\\%$, under a repetition rate of\n$(380 \\rm{ns})^{-1}$ for the composite operation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"n7gKPk5X61hAwlDjbU4JbHA3NTgMQxebrP2iFJKv2XY","pdfSize":"10536975"}
