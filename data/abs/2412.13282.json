Granular particles levitated in an acoustic cavity form a\nmodel system to address this. Such particles self-assemble into free-floating,\nquasi-two-dimensional raft structures which are held together by acoustic\nscattering forces; the strength of this attraction can be changed simply by\nmodifying the sound field. We investigate the mechanical properties of\nacoustically bound granular rafts using substrate-free micro-scale shear tests.\nWe first demonstrate deformation of rafts of spheres and the dependence of this\ndeformation on acoustic pressure. We then apply these methods to rafts composed\nof anisotropic sand grains and smaller spheres, in which the smaller spheres\nhave a thin layer of air separating them from other grain surfaces. These\nspheres act as soft, effectively frictionless particles that populate the\ninterstices between the larger grains, which enables us to investigate the\neffect of lubricating the mixture in the presence of large-grain cohesion.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1lAkPMjfjzVDEE0gfbxjZ35KPGrgyunN7vIrRIXbDBQ","pdfSize":"11665493"}
