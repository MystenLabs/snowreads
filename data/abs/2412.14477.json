  "abstract": "  We address the challenge of incorporating document-level metadata into topic\nmodeling to improve topic mixture estimation. To overcome the computational\ncomplexity and lack of theoretical guarantees in existing Bayesian methods, we\nextend probabilistic latent semantic indexing (pLSI), a frequentist framework\nfor topic modeling, by incorporating document-level covariates or known\nsimilarities between documents through a graph formalism. Modeling documents as\nnodes and edges denoting similarities, we propose a new estimator based on a\nfast graph-regularized iterative singular value decomposition (SVD) that\nencourages similar documents to share similar topic mixture proportions. We\ncharacterize the estimation error of our proposed method by deriving\nhigh-probability bounds and develop a specialized cross-validation method to\noptimize our regularization parameters. We validate our model through\ncomprehensive experiments on synthetic datasets and three real-world corpora,\ndemonstrating improved performance and faster inference compared to existing\nBayesian methods.\n",
