Our main result is the construction of an asymptotically full\nmeasure set of small-amplitude time almost-periodic solutions, which are dense\non invariant tori. In regions corresponding to positive actions, we prove that\nsuch maximal invariant tori are Banach manifolds, which provide a Cantor\nfoliation of the phase space. As a consequence, we establish that, for many\nsmall initial data, the Gevrey norm of the solution remains approximately\nconstant for all time and hence the elliptic fixed point at the origin is\nLyapunov statistically stable. This is first result in KAM Theory for PDEs that\nregards the persistence of a large measure set of invariant tori and hence may\nbe viewed as a strict extension to the infinite dimensional setting of the\nclassical KAM theorem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"irEu_G7A4AsWmOcm5UtGVLlDrGULSiLLe48f1OqnjXg","pdfSize":"560994"}
