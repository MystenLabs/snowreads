Moreover, the time until state 0 is hit by left-continuous random walk on\n$\\mathbb{Z}$ has a direct connection to the total progeny in branching\nprocesses. In this article, the probability of left-continuous random walk to\nbe negative at an even (resp.\\ odd) time is derived and used to determine the\nprobability of nearly left-continuous random walk to eventually become\nnegative.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Fyv_NO9UE9QTFyeeg7r8Jlwq6hslz8UxkVk_48S6dic","pdfSize":"544107"}
