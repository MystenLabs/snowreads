To this end, we present \\texttt{ModelVerification.jl\n(MV)}, the first comprehensive, cutting-edge toolbox that contains a suite of\nstate-of-the-art methods for verifying different types of DNNs and safety\nspecifications. This versatile toolbox is designed to empower developers and\nmachine learning practitioners with robust tools for verifying and ensuring the\ntrustworthiness of their DNN models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EoCQF91uKnzHP8AGg9byPNfDP5N_wus-_kFkAhVf1q4","pdfSize":"2074831"}
