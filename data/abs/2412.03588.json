We do not attempt to treat\nthese two approaches separately but rather provide broad motivation and the\nnecessary background to reach to the frontiers of this fast-evolving field of\nresearch, explaining simultaneously the relevant geometric and physical\naspects. The targeted audience is researchers and advanced students from either\na rather mathematical or physical oriented education who wish to enter the\nfield.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jk6oLF0fA_J_DHSV0Y2DuOTsnM4s3eIUqNy36R5YKSU","pdfSize":"5383449"}
