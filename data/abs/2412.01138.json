  "abstract": "  In this paper, for solving a class of linear parabolic equations in\nrectangular domains, we have proposed an efficient Parareal exponential\nintegrator finite element method. The proposed method first uses the finite\nelement approximation with continuous multilinear rectangular basis function\nfor spatial discretization, and then takes the Runge-Kutta approach accompanied\nwith Parareal framework for time integration of the resulting semi-discrete\nsystem to produce parallel-in-time numerical solution. Under certain regularity\nassumptions, fully-discrete error estimates in $L^2$-norm are derived for the\nproposed schemes with random interpolation nodes. Moreover, a fast solver can\nbe provided based on tensor product spectral decomposition and fast Fourier\ntransform (FFT), since the mass and coefficient matrices of the proposed method\ncan be simultaneously diagonalized with an orthogonal matrix. A series of\nnumerical experiments in various dimensions are also presented to validate the\ntheoretical results and demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed\nmethod.\n",
