The computational procedure is demonstrably robust\nand does not require parameter tuning. The essential feature of the strategy is\nthat the computational solution of the Navier--Stokes equations is a reliable\nproxy for laboratory experiments investigating sensitivity to flow parameters.\nThe applicability of our bifurcation detection strategy is demonstrated by an\ninvestigation of two classical examples of flow instability associated with\nthermal convection. The codes used to generate the numerical results are\navailable online.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4cU9GTx3KPFYCTA4e18l5ohL4K4rQnRfofN7e586Ut4","pdfSize":"1817668"}
