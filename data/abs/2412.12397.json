  "abstract": "  We present an application of a single-qubit Data Re-Uploading (QRU) quantum\nmodel for particle classification in calorimetric experiments. Optimized for\nNoisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, this model requires minimal\nqubits while delivering strong classification performance. Evaluated on a novel\nsimulated dataset specific to particle physics, the QRU model achieves high\naccuracy in classifying particle types. Through a systematic exploration of\nmodel hyperparameters -- such as circuit depth, rotation gates, input\nnormalization and the number of trainable parameters per input -- and training\nparameters like batch size, optimizer, loss function and learning rate, we\nassess their individual impacts on model accuracy and efficiency. Additionally,\nwe apply global optimization methods, uncovering hyperparameter correlations\nthat further enhance performance. Our results indicate that the QRU model\nattains significant accuracy with efficient computational costs, underscoring\nits potential for practical quantum machine learning applications.\n",
