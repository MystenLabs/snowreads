By leveraging a system of multiple AI agents,\nsimulations can provide personalized learning experiences, offering students\nthe opportunity to practice skills in scenarios with AI-generated mentors,\nrole-players, and instructor-facing evaluators. We describe a prototype,\nPitchQuest, a venture capital pitching simulator that showcases the\ncapabilities of AI in delivering instruction, facilitating practice, and\nproviding tailored feedback. The paper discusses the pedagogy behind the\nsimulation, the technology powering it, and the ethical considerations in using\nAI for education. While acknowledging the limitations and need for rigorous\ntesting, we propose that generative AI can significantly lower the barriers to\ncreating effective, engaging simulations, opening up new possibilities for\nexperiential learning at scale.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Q4JRS3pWJ7rchIyiGnTDElAwu0eKQQu7SgBiKz3LB-I","pdfSize":"1762747"}
