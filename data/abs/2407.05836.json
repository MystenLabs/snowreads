The scientific\nliterature can be viewed as a conversation between authors and the audience.\nCBF uses abstracts to infer authors' positions, and GB uses citations to infer\nresponses from the audience. In this paper, we describe nine differences\nbetween CBF and GB, as well as synergistic opportunities for hybrid\ncombinations. Two embeddings will be used to illustrate these opportunities:\n(1) Specter, a CBF method based on BERT-like deepnet encodings of abstracts,\nand (2) ProNE, a GB method based on spectral clustering of more than 200M\npapers and 2B citations from Semantic Scholar.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cjZuOyEtD4ZhiqichJfkf-QLk31T8e0JofG9yhwp83E","pdfSize":"1179167"}
