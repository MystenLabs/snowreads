  "abstract": "  This paper proposes a dataset augmentation method by fine-tuning pre-trained\ndiffusion models. Generating images using a pre-trained diffusion model with\ntextual conditioning often results in domain discrepancy between real data and\ngenerated images. We propose a fine-tuning approach where we adapt the\ndiffusion model by conditioning it with real images and novel text embeddings.\nWe introduce a unique procedure called Mixing Visual Concepts (MVC) where we\ncreate novel text embeddings from image captions. The MVC enables us to\ngenerate multiple images which are diverse and yet similar to the real data\nenabling us to perform effective dataset augmentation. We perform comprehensive\nqualitative and quantitative evaluations with the proposed dataset augmentation\napproach showcasing both coarse-grained and finegrained changes in generated\nimages. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art augmentation techniques on\nbenchmark classification tasks.\n",
