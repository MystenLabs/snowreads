Alternatively, the computation can be\nmoved offline using explicit MPC; however, the online memory requirements and\nthe offline computation can then become excessive. In this work we propose a\nsolution in between online and explicit MPC, addressing the above issues by\npartially dividing the computation between online and offline. To solve the\nunderlying MPC problem, a policy, learned offline, specifies the sequence of\nPWA regions that the dynamics must follow, thus reducing the complexity of the\nremaining optimization problem that solves over only the continuous states and\ncontrol inputs. We provide a condition, verifiable during learning, that\nguarantees feasibility of the learned policy's output, such that an optimal\ncontinuous control input can always be found online. Furthermore, a method for\niteratively generating training data offline allows the feasible policy to be\nlearned efficiently, reducing the offline computational burden. A numerical\nexperiment demonstrates the effectiveness of the method compared to both online\nand explicit MPC.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computer Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nYDmhyHVZMRSNB1MkNpaaO61YGs3RCTbt-KRYuwdxEs","pdfSize":"464518"}
