We further investigate whether\nIES and ICS can also exponentially improve the measurement precision of\ntemperature. In the case of fully thermalized qubits isolated from thermal\nbath, the measurement precision of temperature can be improved exponentially\nwhen the temperature or measurement time or the input photon number approaches\n0. In general, thermal fluctuations prevent the action of squeezed light. When\nmultiple qubits maintain interacting with the thermal bath, the Heisenberg\nscaling can be achieved if the loss rate of the cavity is large and the\ncoupling between the qubit and the optical cavity is weak enough. In the\nmeantime, IES can also further promote the improvement of the measurement\nprecision of the temperature exponentially.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"D5b9-b1lnCNhY5mdThPUU-pjto3dd3NwkQVq4esgjPw","pdfSize":"341388"}
