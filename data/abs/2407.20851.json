This tiling can be\nviewed as a discrete analogue of the uniformizing conformal map that maps a\nsimply connected domain with four distinguished prime ends to a rectangle, so\nthat the four prime ends are mapped to the four corners of the rectangle. We\nmake this intuition precise by showing that if $\\Omega$ is a simply connected\ndomain with four distinguished prime ends $A,B,C,D$ in counterclockwise order\nand $(\\Omega_{n})_{n\\geq{1}}$ is a sequence of orthodiagonal maps with\ndistinguished boundary vertices $A_{n}, B_{n}, C_{n}, D_{n}$ in\ncounterclockwise order, that are finer and finer approximations of $\\Omega$\nwith its distinguished boundary points $A,B,C,D$, then the corresponding\n\"rectangle tiling maps\" converge uniformly on compacts to the aforementioned\nconformal map on $\\Omega$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"O020z6GcjSW0v6bkBb7LpGLZtWo9WPyG05ul_DPz_rk","pdfSize":"2424696","objectId":"0x9772bff8b816a37181c1f7b2b46bae68a04d5bf8ea5cc314d3bf0827b1f64419","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
