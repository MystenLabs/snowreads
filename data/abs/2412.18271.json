During molecular dynamics\nsimulations, data exchange can be implemented through torch.Tensor or\nnumpy.ndarray, depending on the specific use case. This enhancement\nsignificantly expands OpenMM's capabilities, facilitating seamless integration\nof accelerated Python modules within molecular dynamics simulations. This\napproach represents a general solution that can be adapted to other molecular\ndynamics engines beyond OpenMM.
