We apply our method to three\nexamples of new physics at the LHC of increasing complexity, showing that\nmodels can be clustered according to their LHC phenomenology: different models\nare mapped to distinct regions in latent space, while indistinguishable models\nare mapped to the same region. This opens interesting new avenues on several\nfronts, such as model discrimination, selection of representative benchmark\nscenarios, and identifying gaps in the coverage of model space.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7YpgEBa8E0xXTplMAHRnBu0rDb1In9HKK38NKs2H8Ns","pdfSize":"2134772"}
