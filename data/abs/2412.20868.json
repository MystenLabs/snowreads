  "abstract": "  Understanding the long-time dynamics of complex physical processes depends on\nour ability to recognize patterns. To simplify the description of these\nprocesses, we often introduce a set of reaction coordinates, customarily\nreferred to as collective variables (CVs). The quality of these CVs heavily\nimpacts our comprehension of the dynamics, often influencing the estimates of\nthermodynamics and kinetics from atomistic simulations. Consequently,\nidentifying CVs poses a fundamental challenge in chemical physics. Recently,\nsignificant progress was made by leveraging the predictive ability of\nunsupervised machine learning techniques to determine CVs. Many of these\ntechniques require temporal information to learn slow CVs that correspond to\nthe long timescale behavior of the studied process. Here, however, we\nspecifically focus on techniques that can identify CVs corresponding to the\nslowest transitions between states without needing temporal trajectories as\ninput, instead using the spatial characteristics of the data. We discuss the\nlatest developments in this category of techniques and briefly discuss\npotential directions for thermodynamics-informed spatial learning of slow CVs.\n",
