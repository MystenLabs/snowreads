The largest event\nfraction arises from the fully hadronic final state in which every Higgs boson\ndecays to a bottom quark-antiquark pair ($b\\bar{b}$). This introduces a\ncombinatorial challenge known as the \\emph{jet assignment problem}: assigning\njets to sets representing Higgs boson candidates. Symmetry-preserving attention\nnetworks (SPA-Nets) have been been developed to address this challenge.\nHowever, the complexity of jet assignment increases when simultaneously\nconsidering both $H\\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ reconstruction possibilities, i.e.,\ntwo \"resolved\" small-radius jets each containing a shower initiated by a\n$b$-quark or one \"boosted\" large-radius jet containing a merged shower\ninitiated by a $b\\bar{b}$ pair. The latter improves the reconstruction\nefficiency at high $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$. In this work, we introduce a\ngeneralization to the SPA-Net approach to simultaneously consider both boosted\nand resolved reconstruction possibilities and unambiguously interpret an event\nas \"fully resolved'', \"fully boosted\", or in between. We report the performance\nof baseline methods, the original SPA-Net approach, and our generalized version\non nonresonant $HH$ and $HHH$ production at the LHC. Considering both boosted\nand resolved topologies, our SPA-Net approach increases the Higgs boson\nreconstruction purity by 57--62\\% and the efficiency by 23--38\\% compared to\nthe baseline method depending on the final state.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Computer Science/Machine Learning","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"U87D_0Z6Vc_ejxuAxBl5ZEJ0z4NtxdbKTfdPv3kDCss","pdfSize":"1145228"}
