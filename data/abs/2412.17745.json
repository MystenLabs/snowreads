  "abstract": "  The hardness of materials plays an important role in material design. There\nare numerous experimental methods to measure the hardness of materials, but\ntheoretical prediction of hardness is challenging. By investigating the\ncorrelation between hardness and the elastic properties of materials, namely\nshear and bulk moduli, the pressure derivative of bulk modulus, we have\nconstructed a simple and physically intuitive hardness model. By introducing\nthe spatial variation of the shear modulus, it is possible to predict the\nhardness anisotropy of materials to define the minimum and maximum values of\nhardness possessed by a particular material. Furthermore, by using the equation\nof states to define the pressure derivative of the bulk modulus, it is possible\nto determine the temperature dependencies of hardness for given materials. All\nquantities in the model can be obtained directly from accurate first-principles\ncalculations or from experiments, making it suitable for practical\napplications.\n",
