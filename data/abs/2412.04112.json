  "abstract": "  Photonics has unlocked the potential for energy-efficient acceleration of\ndeep learning. Most approaches toward photonic deep learning have diligently\nreproduced traditional deep learning architectures using photonic platforms,\nseparately implementing linear-optical matrix calculations and nonlinear\nactivations via electro-optical conversion, optical nonlinearities, and\nsignal-encoded materials. Here we propose a concept of nonlinear unitary\nphotonic circuits to achieve the integration of linear and nonlinear\nexpressivity essential for deep neural networks. We devise a building block for\ntwo-dimensional nonlinear unitary operations, featuring norm-preserving\nmappings with nonconservative inner products, which enables the construction of\nhigh-dimensional nonlinear unitary circuits. Using deep nonlinear unitary\ncircuits, we demonstrate exponential growth in trajectory length and\nnear-complete coverage of the output space, both of which are essential for\ndeep learning. Along with neuroevolutionary learning examples for the\nregression of a nonconvex function, our results pave the way to photonic neural\nnetworks with highly expressive inference and stable training.\n",
