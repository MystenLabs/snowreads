  "abstract": "  Chromosomal inversions are structural mutations resulting in the reversal of\nthe gene order along the corresponding genomic region. Due to their influence\non recombination patterns, they can have a major influence on genetic variation\nand the evolutionary process. Accordingly, inversions can act as supergenes\nthat keep together co-adapted gene complexes that form the genetic basis of\nmany complex phenotypes in diverse organisms. In this book chapter, I will\npresent an analysis pipeline to investigate the influence of two common\ncosmopolitan inversion, In(2L)t and In(3R)Payne, on genome-wide genetic\nvariation and differentiation in world-wide populations of the vinegar fly\nDrosophila melanogaster. We will use single-individual and pooled resequencing\ndata in combination with population genomics analysis tools to explore the\nimpact of these two inversions on genetic variation, population structure, and\nclinal variation in natural populations.\n",
