Traditional\nstatistical causal discovery methods, while well-established, predominantly\nrely on observational data and often overlook the semantic cues inherent in\ncause-and-effect relationships. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has\nushered in an affordable way of leveraging the semantic cues for\nknowledge-driven causal discovery, but the development of LLMs for causal\ndiscovery lags behind other areas, particularly in the exploration of\nmulti-modality data. To bridge the gap, we introduce MATMCD, a multi-agent\nsystem powered by tool-augmented LLMs. MATMCD has two key agents: a Data\nAugmentation agent that retrieves and processes modality-augmented data, and a\nCausal Constraint agent that integrates multi-modal data for knowledge-driven\ninference. Delicate design of the inner-workings ensures successful cooperation\nof the agents. Our empirical study across seven datasets suggests the\nsignificant potential of multi-modality enhanced causal discovery.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"obn9AYpEvNbPCy7w26gemLK8Z49-W4DfXphi1pZdl6c","pdfSize":"1431122"}
