Such an instability may develop as the ohmic heating increases the\nelectrical conductivity in a positive feedback loop, which ultimately leads to\na runaway of the atmospheric temperature. We extend our previous axisymmetric\none-dimensional radial model, by representing the temperature and magnetic\ndiffusivity as a first order Fourier expansion in longitude. This allows us to\npredict the hot spot offset during the unfolding of the thermoresistive\ninstability and following Alfv\\'enic oscillations. We show a representative\nsimulation undergoing the thermoresistive instability, in which the peak flux\noffset varies between approximately $\\pm 60^{\\circ}$ on timescales of a few\ndays with potentially observable brightness variations. Therefore, this\nthermoresistive instability could be an observable feature of hot Jupiters,\ngiven the right timing of observation and transit and the right planetary\nparameters.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Tj4acUYnAEIQxVPY1sbxXoiMP_Di_YkS067kgR-OadY","pdfSize":"4162742"}
