  "abstract": "  This paper considers the problem of maximizing multiple linear functions over\nthe probability simplex. A classification of feasible points is indicated. A\nnecessary and sufficient condition for a member of each class to be an\nefficient solution is stated. This characterization yields a computational\nprocedure for ascertaining whether a feasible point is efficient. The procedure\ndoes not require that candidates for efficiency be extreme points. An\nillustration of the procedure is offered.\n",
