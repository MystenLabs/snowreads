However, the gradient of the objective does not exist at a\nconsiderable set of singular points. Recently, a de-singularity subgradient\nmethod has been proposed to fix this problem, but it can only handle the\n$q$-th-powered $\\ell_2$-norm case ($1\\leqslant q<2$), which has only finite\nsingular points. In this paper, we further establish the de-singularity\nsubgradient for the $q$-th-powered $\\ell_p$-norm case with $1\\leqslant\nq\\leqslant p$ and $1\\leqslant p<2$, which includes all the rest unsolved\nsituations in this problem. This is a challenging task because the singular set\nis a continuum. The geometry of the objective function is also complicated so\nthat the characterizations of the subgradients, minimum and descent direction\nare very difficult. We develop a $q$-th-powered $\\ell_p$-norm Weiszfeld\nAlgorithm without Singularity ($q$P$p$NWAWS) for this problem, which ensures\nconvergence and the descent property of the objective function. Extensive\nexperiments on six real-world data sets demonstrate that $q$P$p$NWAWS\nsuccessfully solves the singularity problem and achieves a linear computational\nconvergence rate in practical scenarios.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"opUSh0ce0h8S86yRRXHXfaFaSBFk9lCOJHmWdDv7NqY","pdfSize":"467465"}
