  "abstract": "  The correlation between intrinsic and tracer diffusion coefficients\nconsidering the molar volume of the diffusing elements and cross\nphenomenological constants of Onsager contributing to the vacancy wind effect\nin ternary and multicomponent systems. Manning established this correlation\nassuming constant molar volume. The difference in data calculated considering a\nconstant molar volume and neglecting the vacancy wind effect, which is mainly\npractised until today, is compared with the data considering the molar volume\nof diffusing elements and vacancy wind effect in NiCoFeCr and an imaginary\nquaternary multi-principal element system. This indicates a significant error\nin estimated data when considering a constant molar volume if the molar volumes\nof the diffusing elements are reasonably different. Therefore, the outcome of\nthis study is expected to bring a significant change in diffusion analysis in\nternary and multicomponent systems.\n",
