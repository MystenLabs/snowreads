The analytical study is based on Lorentz force and continuity\nequations. Perturbation technique and quasi-static approximation are used for\nevaluating the generated longitudinal wakefields. Trapping and acceleration of\nelectrons are examined by injecting a test electron in the generated\nwakefields. The results are compared with those obtained via linearly polarized\nlaser pulses. The validation of analytical results is performed using the\nFourier-Bessel particle-in-cell (FBPIC) simulation code. It is seen that there\nis a significant enhancement in amplitude of the longitudinal wakefield\ngenerated and electron energy gain via radially polarized laser pulses as\ncompared to linearly polarized laser pulse case.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Nndh--PrOVrmfWpgGte_K0KCaSh1pj1Whc4ZS-kAB0I","pdfSize":"545005"}
