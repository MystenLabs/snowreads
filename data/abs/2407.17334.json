We apply the linearized version of this\nextension to the stationary heat problem and the Poiseuille channel and compare\nour analytical solutions to asymptotic and numerical solutions of the\nlinearized Boltzmann equation. In both model problems, our solutions compare\nremarkably well in the transition regime. For some macroscopic variables, this\nagreement even extends far beyond the transition regime.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zcGWMZwH0uLwRjK3pRlaLHlL9Cs4gFqosnt_XjcefmM","pdfSize":"1536964","objectId":"0x72a4fed31dfa9c3021013e3a2c281234e6425e9f54e0511601fd0cd15bb788ee","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
