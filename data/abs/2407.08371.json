We provide a\ngeometric proof of this fact. We express the probabilities of these ranks in\nterms of the probabilities of the numbers of intersection points of a random\nlinear space with the Segre variety. In addition, we give some heuristics to\nunderstand how the probabilities of these ranks behave, based on asymptotic\nresults on the average number of real points in a random linear slice of a\nSegre variety with a subspace of complementary dimension.\n  The typical ranks of real $3\\times 3\\times 5$ tensors are $5$ and $6$. We\nlink the rank probabilities of a $3\\times 3 \\times 5$ tensor with i.i.d.\\\nGaussian entries to the probability of a random cubic surface in $\\P^3$ having\nreal lines. As a consequence, we get a bound on the expected number of real\nlines on such a surface.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dZFohTRt5KI-E2UD8R6WEL6D9j93FWBZ5Qnl5xyUGXE","pdfSize":"772115"}
