Yet, the evaluation of such images can be a time-consuming\nprocess and is subjective to human perception. In this study, we present a fast\nand robust method to obtain quantitative insight based on qualitative oil-flow\nvisualizations. Using a convolutional neural network, the local flow direction\nis predicted based on the oil-flow texture. This was achieved with supervised\ntraining based on an extensive dataset involving approximately one million\nimage patches that cover variations of the flow direction, the wall\nshear-stress magnitude and the oil-flow mixture. For a test dataset that is\ndistinct from the training data, the mean prediction error of the flow\ndirection is as low as three degrees. A reliable performance is also noted when\nthe model is applied to oil-flow visualizations from the literature,\ndemonstrating the generalizability required for an application in diverse flow\nconfigurations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tD0GE5r5u85nzDr7KLSvdgKWmNcN9TOCubMwtVLFyFw","pdfSize":"38272971"}
