Under the assumptions that the initial data is a small\nperturbation of the constant state, we prove the global existence and\nuniqueness of the solutions and establish the time decay rates of the solution\nas well as its higher-order spatial derivatives. Moreover, we derive that the\nsolutions of the system are time asymptotically approximated by the solutions\nof the modified parabolic system and obtain decay rates in $L^2$ and $L^1$.\nFurthermore, we show that the solution of the system is time asymptotically\napproximated in $L^p (1 \\leq p \\leq+\\infty)$ by the diffusion waves.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"8Vo-JXj8f9HqAESlgOwh3LH7bNkICIBsr5WAL1e7Yb0","pdfSize":"327457"}
