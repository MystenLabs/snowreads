VNN-COMP is held annually to\nfacilitate the fair and objective comparison of state-of-the-art neural network\nverification tools, encourage the standardization of tool interfaces, and bring\ntogether the neural network verification community. To this end, standardized\nformats for networks (ONNX) and specification (VNN-LIB) were defined, tools\nwere evaluated on equal-cost hardware (using an automatic evaluation pipeline\nbased on AWS instances), and tool parameters were chosen by the participants\nbefore the final test sets were made public. In the 2024 iteration, 8 teams\nparticipated on a diverse set of 12 regular and 8 extended benchmarks. This\nreport summarizes the rules, benchmarks, participating tools, results, and\nlessons learned from this iteration of this competition.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LQJROw8pfX3N5LoJlsXXCyuithoAbjNGEGi83x_PHaU","pdfSize":"2387325"}
