  "abstract": "  As the demand for internet of things (IoT) and device-to-device (D2D)\napplications in next generation communication systems increases, we are\nconfronted with a challenge of spectrum scarcity. One promising solution to\nthis problem is cognitive radio network (CRN), where the key element is the\nspectrum - a valuable and sharable natural resource that should not be wasted.\nTo design efficient and sustainable networks for the future, it is crucial to\nensure that spectrum sensing is not only accurate and rapid, but also\nenergy-efficient. Spectrum sensing is a critical aspect of CRNs, and this study\nis mainly focused on it. In this research, we employ the supervised machine\nlearning algorithm, support vector machine (SVM), to detect primary users (PU).\nWe investigate different variants of SVM, including linear, polynomial, and\nGaussian radial basic function (RBF), and employ an ensemble\nclassification-based approach to improve the classifier's performance and\nproductivity. The simulation results demonstrate that the ensemble classifier\nachieves the highest performance.\n",
