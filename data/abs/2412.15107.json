Further, we present methods to calculate the band\nstructure of a material with an arbitrary graphical representation, which\nallows one to study the Fermi level of the material as well as conductivity at\nzero temperature. We present results for both circular chains as well as\nrandomly-generated unit cell structures, and also use this representation to\nshow that the connectivity of the unit cell is not correlated to its band gap\nat half filling. This paper provides an introductory insight into the\nutilization of graph theory for computational solid-state physics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EHNyYxypUCN7J2-gKCAQ3jx-9Js8YUgS3nQRhSuuraA","pdfSize":"934374"}
