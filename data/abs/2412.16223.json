  "abstract": "  In symplectic topology one uses elliptic methods to prove rigidity results\nabout symplectic manifolds and solutions of Hamiltonian equations on them,\nwhere the most basic example is given by geodesics on Riemannian manifolds.\nHarmonic maps from surfaces are the natural 2-dimensional generalizations of\ngeodesics. In this paper, we give the corresponding generalization of\nsymplectic manifolds and Hamiltonian equations, leading to a class of partial\ndifferential equations that share properties similar to Hamiltonian (ordinary)\ndifferential equations. Two rigidity results are discussed: a non-squeezing\ntheorem and a version of the cuplength result for quadratic Hamiltonians on\ncotangent bundles. The proof of the latter uses a generalization of Floer\ncurves, for which the necessary Fredholm and compactness results will be\nproven.\n",
