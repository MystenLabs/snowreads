This paper reports that the AIEC is naturally built in\nsynthetic antiferromagnets depending on the thin film growth condition. For the\nsynthetic antiferromagnets consisting of Pt/Co/Ir/Co/Pt layers, two kinds of\nfilm growth parameters are examined: the effects of epitaxial growth and\noblique incident of sputter-deposition. The present results indicate that the\nspatial fluctuations in thicknesses are one of the major sources inducing the\nAIEC while the epitaxial growth, which leads to the sharp interfaces and the\nuniformity in layer thicknesses, effectively suppresses the unexpected AIEC. In\naddition, the oblique sputter-deposition provides the large AIEC and the\nanisotropic distribution of AIEC direction in the case of textured films. The\nfindings in this study provide key factors for designing the AIEC and is useful\nto develop emerging computing technologies with artificial three-dimensional\ntopological magnetic structures.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"J_jWDibqzuhrDBM6DrTuqhwvzz3-shn863PaOLLtmes","pdfSize":"2061558"}
