These scars are simple valence-bond solids with exactly zero energy, and\nthey exist in even-by-even systems and ladders of width 2. Ladders have\nadditional scars corresponding to injecting one or two magnons on top of a\nparent valence-bond solid scar. These scars have a remarkably simple physical\norigin based only the angular momentum algebra and cancellations from\nspin-antialignment within a valence bond. Our comprehensive exact\ndiagonalization calculations suggest that our valence-bond solids exhaust all\nexact eigenstates in the Heisenberg model except for few-magnon states near the\ntop of the spectrum. Our scars are interesting because they are not part of a\ntower, have area-law entanglement, break translation symmetry, and exist for\nHeisenberg models of all spin.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4BeJAZwz42A7eSrx3saGP0gIpKcA9ezMum0Z4YQExHA","pdfSize":"782341"}
