However, existing KG alignment\nmethods mainly rely on entity type (etype) label matching as a prerequisite,\nwhich is poorly performing in practice or not applicable in some cases. In this\npaper, we design a machine learning-based framework for KG extension, including\nan alternative novel property-based alignment approach that allows aligning\netypes on the basis of the properties used to define them. The main intuition\nis that it is properties that intentionally define the etype, and this\ndefinition is independent of the specific label used to name an etype, and of\nthe specific hierarchical schema of KGs. Compared with the state-of-the-art,\nthe experimental results show the validity of the KG alignment approach and the\nsuperiority of the proposed KG extension framework, both quantitatively and\nqualitatively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xHpbVJVyEdF7ToAwWwoBa_EBbc5cMacUBjomVpGrOxA","pdfSize":"879646"}
