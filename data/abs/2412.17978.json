The Dyn-cGAN includes a dynamics block within\na modified conditional GAN, enabling the simultaneous identification of\ntemporal dynamics and their dependence on system parameters. The learned\nDyn-cGAN model takes into account the system parameters to predict the flow\nfields of the system accurately. We evaluate the effectiveness and limitations\nof the developed Dyn-cGAN through numerical studies of various parameterized\nnonlinear fluid dynamical systems, including flow over a cylinder and a 2-D\ncavity problem, with different Reynolds numbers. Furthermore, we examine how\nReynolds number affects the accuracy of the predictions for both case studies.\nAdditionally, we investigate the impact of the number of time steps involved in\nthe process of dynamics block training on the accuracy of predictions, and we\nfind that an optimal value exists based on errors and mutual information\nrelative to the ground truth.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xqcOF4yMP2UU9HdcaWkgU9S5CqXLrqMaSXTFBkaUEDI","pdfSize":"4888894"}
