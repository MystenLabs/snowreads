  "abstract": "  As Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to advance rapidly, Friendly AI\n(FAI) has been proposed to advocate for more equitable and fair development of\nAI. Despite its importance, there is a lack of comprehensive reviews examining\nFAI from an ethical perspective, as well as limited discussion on its potential\napplications and future directions. This paper addresses these gaps by\nproviding a thorough review of FAI, focusing on theoretical perspectives both\nfor and against its development, and presenting a formal definition in a clear\nand accessible format. Key applications are discussed from the perspectives of\neXplainable AI (XAI), privacy, fairness and affective computing (AC).\nAdditionally, the paper identifies challenges in current technological\nadvancements and explores future research avenues. The findings emphasise the\nsignificance of developing FAI and advocate for its continued advancement to\nensure ethical and beneficial AI development.\n",
