  "abstract": "  The integration of retrieval-augmented techniques with LLMs has shown promise\nin improving performance across various domains. However, their utility in\ntasks requiring advanced reasoning, such as generating and evaluating\nmathematical statements and proofs, remains underexplored. This study explores\nthe use of Lean, a programming language for writing mathematical proofs, to\npopulate the knowledge corpus used by RAG systems. We hope for this to lay the\nfoundation to exploring different methods of using RAGs to improve the\nperformance of LLMs in advanced logical reasoning tasks.\n",
