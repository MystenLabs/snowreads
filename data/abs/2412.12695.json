In addition, diphoton\nmeasurements at low diphoton masses are crucial for studies of light meson\nresonance contributions in $\\gamma\\gamma \\to \\gamma\\gamma$ scattering. We also\nfocus on the interference between different contributions. For future\nexperiments with the ALICE FoCal and ALICE-3 detectors, we have calculated\nbackground contamination and have explored possibilities to minimize their\nimpact.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1TUfQleB9dqArR8f1tonR75Ou5CJERgKuc7hAHgpGlc","pdfSize":"278127"}
