  "abstract": "  The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) highlights the essence of financial\nnews in stock price movement. Financial news comes in the form of corporate\nannouncements, news titles, and other forms of digital text. The generation of\ninsights from financial news can be done with sentiment analysis.\nGeneral-purpose language models are too general for sentiment analysis in\nfinance. Curated labeled data for fine-tuning general-purpose language models\nare scare, and existing fine-tuned models for sentiment analysis in finance do\nnot capture the maximum context width. We hypothesize that using actual and\nsynthetic data can improve performance. We introduce BertNSP-finance to\nconcatenate shorter financial sentences into longer financial sentences, and\nfinbert-lc to determine sentiment from digital text. The results show improved\nperformance on the accuracy and the f1 score for the financial phrasebank data\nwith $50\\%$ and $100\\%$ agreement levels.\n",
