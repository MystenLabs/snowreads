Existing symbolic solvers are often slow, and prior\nresearch has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) alone struggle with CSPs\nbecause of their complexity. To bridge this gap, we build upon the existing\nSOFAI architecture (or SOFAI-v1), which adapts Daniel Kahneman's ''Thinking,\nFast and Slow'' cognitive model to AI. Our enhanced architecture, SOFAI-v2,\nintegrates refined metacognitive governance mechanisms to improve adaptability\nacross complex domains, specifically tailored for solving CSPs like graph\ncoloring. SOFAI-v2 combines a fast System 1 (S1) based on LLMs with a\ndeliberative System 2 (S2) governed by a metacognition module. S1's initial\nsolutions, often limited by non-adherence to constraints, are enhanced through\nmetacognitive governance, which provides targeted feedback and examples to\nadapt S1 to CSP requirements. If S1 fails to solve the problem, metacognition\nstrategically invokes S2, ensuring accurate and reliable solutions. With\nempirical results, we show that SOFAI-v2 for graph coloring problems achieves a\n16.98% increased success rate and is 32.42% faster than symbolic solvers.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"R_uZutEHqrlR5WDrnJuWfmHfBABPdHT2kFWhlBGTqjw","pdfSize":"860682"}
