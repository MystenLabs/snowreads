We have shown that the minimal size $r$ that the ellipsoid can reach\nduring collapse depends on its initial eccentricity $e_0$ as $r\\propto\ne_0^\\nu$, where $\\nu \\approx 15/8$, and this dependence is very universal. We\nhave estimated the parameters (in particular, the initial eccentricity) of a\nhomogeneous pressureless ellipsoid, whereat it collapses directly into a black\nhole.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"x_CXeG-9yF_l-D5dxSJCgEF2YOagV7l7xJcEdlk7Oyo","pdfSize":"391558"}
