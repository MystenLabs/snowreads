By measuring eigenstates of a massless overlap Dirac operator on\nthe gauge configurations, we provide a gauge invariant method to study spectral\nproperties of non-Abelian gauge theories. Whereas the majority of these\neigenstates below the magnetic scale have universal nearest-neighbor level\nspacing fluctuations consistent with certain class of random matrix theories at\ntemperatures away from the chiral crossover transition in QCD, a few among them\nstart to become prominent just above the crossover forming clusters percolating\nover the entire volume. By matching the non-perturbative magnetic scales in a\nhigh temperature thermal state and a particular non-equilibrium chaotic state\nof QCD, we provide an estimate of thermalization time $\\sim 1.44$ fm/c.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"3_H7W8LVFtPFgBv2GyhuMuA83hTaDj1DzbN8hD_knZU","pdfSize":"515877"}
