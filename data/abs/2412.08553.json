  "abstract": "  We propose an {\\em implementable} numerical scheme for the discretization of\nlinear-quadratic optimal control problems involving SDEs in higher dimensions\nwith {\\em control constraint}. For time discretization, we employ the implicit\nEuler scheme, deriving discrete optimality conditions that involve time\ndiscretization of a backward stochastic differential equations. We develop a\nrecursive formula to compute conditional expectations in the time\ndiscretization of the BSDE whose computation otherwise is the most\ncomputationally demanding step. Additionally, we present the error analysis for\nthe rate of convergence. We provide numerical examples to demonstrate the\nefficiency of our scheme in higher dimensions.\n",
