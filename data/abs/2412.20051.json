Our research explores the possibility\nof nucleating skyrmions in X-Fe/Ir(111) multilayer nano-structure where, X is\none of the 4d transition metals, such as, Pd, Rh, Ru, Mo and Nb. The resulting\nfinal state is determined by the competition between the frustrated exchange\ninteraction, primarily contributed by the top 4d transition metal layer, and\nthe Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions induced significantly by the 5d heavy\nmetal Ir(111) layer. We apply a perpendicular dc magnetic field to the\nnano-structure and observe gradual phase transformation from the spin spiral\nground state to a stable relaxed state of nano-scale skyrmions . A proper\nchoice of magnetic anisotropy and interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction\nleads to a range of external magnetic fields essential for the existence and\nstability of skyrmions. By raising the temperature, we assess the thermal\nstability of the nucleated skyrmions to evaluate their potential as information\ncarriers in future spintronic devices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2juIyC5A3MPZT8iUPFY-KWSt3CqrofJdp9ACjw-4cBM","pdfSize":"21327083"}
