They also enable yield prediction and phenotyping in agricultural\nsettings. In this paper, we introduce an efficient and scalable approach for\nactive semantic mapping in horticultural environments, employing a mobile robot\nmanipulator equipped with an RGB-D camera. Our method leverages probabilistic\nsemantic maps to detect semantic targets, generate candidate viewpoints, and\ncompute corresponding information gain. We present an efficient ray-casting\nstrategy and a novel information utility function that accounts for both\nsemantics and occlusions. The proposed approach reduces total runtime by 8%\ncompared to previous baselines. Furthermore, our information metric surpasses\nother metrics in reducing multi-class entropy and improving surface coverage,\nparticularly in the presence of segmentation noise. Real-world experiments\nvalidate our method's effectiveness but also reveal challenges such as depth\nsensor noise and varying environmental conditions, requiring further research.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"uBr06juiPURjxngDXOBSFWFxzi2F9DFh6oumemkoqDw","pdfSize":"2945777"}
