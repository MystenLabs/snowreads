  "abstract": "  We present the first general stability results for nonlinear offset-free\nmodel predictive control (MPC). Despite over twenty years of active research,\nthe offset-free MPC literature has not shaken the assumption of closed-loop\nstability for establishing offset-free performance. In this paper, we present a\nnonlinear offset-free MPC design that is robustly stable with respect to the\ntracking errors, and thus achieves offset-free performance, despite plant-model\nmismatch and persistent disturbances. Key features and assumptions of this\ndesign include quadratic costs, differentiability of the plant and model\nfunctions, constraint backoffs at steady state, and a robustly stable state and\ndisturbance estimator. We first establish nominal stability and offset-free\nperformance. Then, robustness to state and disturbance estimate errors and\nsetpoint and disturbance changes is demonstrated. Finally, the results are\nextended to sufficiently small plant-model mismatch. The results are\nillustrated by numerical examples.\n",
