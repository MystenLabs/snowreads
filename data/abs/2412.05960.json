The characteristic temperature of SG can be effectively tuned by\nfine-control of Bi-doping in the SG layer. A doping- and temperature-dependent\nphase diagram is established. We demonstrate the remote manipulation and\ndetection of the states of individual Mn-layer spins by tunneling electrons in\nfavor of the electron-phonon, spin-phonon, spin-transfer torque and spin-flip\ninteractions among hot electrons, lattice and local spins, where the spin valve\nlayer is even buried below two-quintuple-layer Bi2Te3. The integration of the\nSG state into spin valves opens the opportunity of realizing atomic-scale\nspintronics by integrating different degrees of freedom in two dimensional\nmaterials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"G4tBbAWJzXIGHHAI1ZpSxRdRWX6tvJK_ASSL7HaOW5E","pdfSize":"4635435"}
