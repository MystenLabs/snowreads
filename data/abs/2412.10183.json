Self-Organising Maps (SOMs), a type of\nunsupervised machine learning, can be used to address this problem. We map\n251,259 multi-Gaussian sources from Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS) onto a\nSOM with discrete neurons. Similarity metrics, such as Euclidean distances, can\nbe used to identify the best-matching neuron or unit (BMU) for each input\nimage. We establish a reliability threshold by visually inspecting a subset of\ninput images and their corresponding BMU. We label the individual neurons based\non observed morphologies and these labels are included in our value-added\ncatalogue of RACS sources. Sources for which the Euclidean distance to their\nBMU is $\\lesssim$ 5 (accounting for approximately 79$\\%$ of sources) have an\nestimated $>90\\%$ reliability for their SOM-derived morphological labels. This\nreliability falls to less than 70$\\%$ at Euclidean distances $\\gtrsim$ 7.\nBeyond this threshold it is unlikely that the morphological label will\naccurately describe a given source. Our catalogue of complex radio sources from\nRACS with their SOM-derived morphological labels from this work will be made\npublicly available.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sWkz0M3pbB8utUVwWB0pwf0VVFTS5s_Q920Pbu93lW8","pdfSize":"3265953"}
