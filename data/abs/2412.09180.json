Our work extends one of the most conventional\napplications of MFG, which is the price impact model in an order book, by\nincorporating an AMM instead of a traditional order book. Through our approach,\nwe achieve results that support the existence of solutions to the Mean Field\nGame and, additionally, the existence of approximate Nash equilibria for the\nproposed problem. These results not only offer a new perspective for\nrepresenting liquidity pools in AMMs but also open promising opportunities for\nfuture research in this emerging field.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lHu77Nfj14c6F3xniAJTrLMMUXlUGR5G-Dm_UxHsOHQ","pdfSize":"564866"}
