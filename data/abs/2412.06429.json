This is achieved by comparing the flat space limit of the dual D1D5\nCFT correlator to an ansatz for the amplitude as a worldsheet integral in terms\nof single valued multiple polylogarithms. The first curvature correction is\nfully fixed in this way, and satisfies consistency checks in the high energy\nlimit, and by comparison of the energy of massive string operators to a\nsemiclassical expansion. Our result gives infinite predictions for CFT data in\nthe planar limit at strong coupling, which can guide future integrability\nstudies.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"Wpbz6TcV2gKuxsxAOPyP9qeF4ItslEY2Iluv6y6NUI4","pdfSize":"510951"}
