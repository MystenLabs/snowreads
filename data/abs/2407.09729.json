We employ the surface\nmode technique to derive a generalized Lifshitz formula for this specific\ngeometry. Our formulation accounts for the unique dielectric properties of the\nmaterials composing the waveguide, leading to a precise calculation of the\nCasimir-Lifshitz energy. In the asymptotic limit, our results recover the\nclassical expressions for perfect reflecting boundaries. The behavior of the\nforce on the rectangular cavity walls admit us to identify the system as a\nCasimir-Lifshitz anharmonic oscillator, that may vibrate due only the to vacuum\nstress if we allow two parallel non-fixed walls.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lbb4B5IipyeV5omLVu3JobsCpaHpRsuSTwVuPCH0kcs","pdfSize":"564206"}
