Newman, we introduce a pair of new partition statistics, squrank\nand recrank. It is related to a polynomial bosonic form of statistical\nconfiguration sums for an integrable cellular automaton. For all nonnegative\ninteger $n$, we prove that the partitions of $n$ on which squrank or recrank\ntakes on a particular value, say $r$, are equinumerous with the partitions of\n$n$ on which the odd/even minimal exclutant takes on the corresponding value,\n$2r+1$ or $2r+2$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"b4T3JJlC-MnfoekKXTi5giv2q3WPwlzWFISban0GhQc","pdfSize":"304895"}
