This work exploits this\nrepresentation to include the propagation of uncertainties, where the\npolynomials are modified to work with stochastic variables. Thus, a new\nuncertainty quantification technique is proposed, where the KO solution is\nexpanded to include the prediction of central moments, up to an arbitrary\norder. The propagation of uncertainties is then expanded to develop a new\nfiltering algorithm, where measurements are considered as additional\nobservables in the KO mathematics. Numerical simulations in astrodynamics\nassess the accuracy and performance of the new methodologies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"8UJSI7rMLldA_sOt-dvd49YUxv6Kd1_l2MhKv1QjO5U","pdfSize":"4213112","objectId":"0xf99595b4e39435fa83336a66ecadb072110f713d167e7896f591edde1b6fcb78","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
