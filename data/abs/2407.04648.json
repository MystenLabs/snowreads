In this work, both\navenues are simultaneously embraced across several distinct efforts existing at\nthree general scales of abstractions of what a material is - atomistic,\nphysical, and design. At each, an efficient materials informatics\ninfrastructure is being built from the ground up based on (1) the fundamental\nunderstanding of the underlying prior knowledge, including the data, (2)\ndeployment routes that take advantage of it, and (3) pathways to extend it in\nan autonomous or semi-autonomous fashion, while heavily relying on artificial\nintelligence (AI) to guide well-established DFT-based ab initio and\nCALPHAD-based thermodynamic methods.\n  The resulting multi-level discovery infrastructure is highly generalizable as\nit focuses on encoding problems to solve them easily rather than looking for an\nexisting solution. To showcase it, this dissertation discusses the design of\nmulti-alloy functionally graded materials (FGMs) incorporating ultra-high\ntemperature refractory high entropy alloys (RHEAs) towards gas turbine and jet\nengine efficiency increase reducing CO2 emissions, as well as hypersonic\nvehicles. It leverages a new graph representation of underlying mathematical\nspace using a newly developed algorithm based on combinatorics, not subject to\nmany problems troubling the community. Underneath, property models and phase\nrelations are learned from optimized samplings of the largest and highest\nquality dataset of HEA in the world, called ULTERA. At the atomistic level, a\ndata ecosystem optimized for machine learning (ML) from over 4.5 million\nrelaxed structures, called MPDD, is used to inform experimental observations\nand improve thermodynamic models by providing stability data enabled by a new\nefficient featurization framework.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Databases","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"j4h8HiDWO8PB7GU4MggQq2JsJogFrkSieeP_e7Zjojs","pdfSize":"46816727"}
