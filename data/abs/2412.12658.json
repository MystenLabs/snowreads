  "abstract": "  Models based on spins or hysterons with appropriately chosen interactions can\ncapture advanced memory effects in complex materials, such as transients in\nrepeatedly compressed crumpled sheets or sequential computing in driven\nmetamaterials. However, unphysical self-loops dominate the response when\ninteractions are chosen randomly, undermining statistical approaches. Here, we\nuncover the origin of self-loop proliferation in randomly coupled models. We\nintroduce the weakly asymmetric ensemble to suppress self-loops and then\ndevelop interaction ensembles to strictly eliminate these. Finally, we use\nthese ensembles to explore the statistics of large systems. Our work highlights\nthe subtle role of interaction symmetries and paves the way for statistical\nstudies of the sequential response and memory effects in complex, multistable\nmaterials.\n",
