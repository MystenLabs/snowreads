This solution\ndescribes a steady, purely azimuthal equatorial flow with an associated free\nsurface. Using functional analytic techniques, we demonstrate that if a free\nsurface is known beforehand, the variations in pressure needed to achieve this\nsurface implicitly define the shape of the free surface in a unique way.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"V2wmlXzlug02swm-_bqXFWIomCqxooDTgZ0cG-9CeAE","pdfSize":"153367"}
