We\nfocus on interaction mediated by a heavy fermionic particle $F$ and investigate\nthe attenuation of neutrino fluxes from these sources. We model the unscattered\nneutrino flux from DSNB via core-collapse supernova (CCSN) and star-formation\nrate (SFR), then use the DUNE experiment to set limits on DM-neutrino\ninteraction. For AGNs, NGC 1068 and TXS 0506+056 where the neutrino carries\nenergy above TeV, we select the kinematic region $m^2_F \\gg E_\\nu m_\\phi \\gg\nm^2_\\phi$ such that the $\\nu \\phi$ scattering cross section features an\nenhancement at high energy. We investigate the constraint on $m_\\phi$ and\nscattering cross section by including DM density spikes at center of AGNs and\ncomputing the neutrino flux at IceCube, where the $\\phi\\phi^*$ annihilation\ncross section is implemented to obtain the saturation density of the spikes.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mhxHCT6kfccAgJ0Q7806QK2dc5QMemChWdJrK1NG2GY","pdfSize":"903395"}
