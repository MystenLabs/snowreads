The result of this measurement is used to generate two FSMs\nthat jointly estimate any pure state up to a null measure set. This estimate is\nused to adapt a third FMS, which provides the final estimate of the unknown\nstate. Our approach achieves an average estimation infidelity very close to the\nGill-Massar lower bound (GMB) without requiring prior information beyond the\npurity of the unknown state, extending the applicability of FSM to any unknown\nstate. The total number of measurement outcomes of the method scale linearly as\n$7d-3$, avoiding the need for collective measurements on multiple copies of the\nunknown state. This work highlights the potential of adaptive estimation\ntechniques in quantum state characterization while maintaining efficiency in\nthe number of measurement outcomes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"I45VSVG_HVqam68Qvni9i0I1JI5ad4PWsbmB0uktEgY","pdfSize":"1269645"}
