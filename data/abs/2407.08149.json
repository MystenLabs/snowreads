Although polarization cues have been used in\nvarious applications, such as shape from polarization (SfP), BRDF estimation,\nand reflection removal, their application in SSS estimation has not yet been\nexplored. Our observations indicate that the SSS affects not only the light\nintensity but also the polarization signal. Hence, the polarization signal can\nprovide additional cues for SSS estimation. We also introduce the first\nlarge-scale synthetic dataset of polarized translucent objects for training our\nmodel. Our method outperforms several baselines from the SfP and inverse\nrendering realms on both synthetic and real data, as demonstrated by\nqualitative and quantitative results.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SrgfA1PBsfBkU4CAs4_z_BGqRB8JyU1R7E0Xg-C0gQQ","pdfSize":"4665982"}
