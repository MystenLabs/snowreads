In this work motivated by the aforementioned progress,\nwe conduct first-principles calculations to explore the structural, phonon\ndispersion relations, single-layer exfoliation energies and mechanical features\nof the Nb3X8 (X=Cl, Br, I) nanosheets. Acquired phonon dispersion relations\nreveal the dynamical stability of the Nb3X8 (X=Cl, Br, I) monolayers. In order\nto isolate single-layer crystals from bulk counterparts, we predicted\nexfoliation energies of 0.24, 0.27 and 0.28 J/m2, for the Nb3Cl8, Nb3Br8 and\nNb3I8 monolayers, respectively, which are noticeably lower than that of the\ngraphene. We found that the Nb3X8 monolayers are relatively strong nanosheets\nwith isotropic elasticity and anisotropic tensile strength. It is moreover\nshown that by increasing the atomic weight of halogen atoms in the Nb3X8\nnanosheets, mechanical characteristics decline. Presented results provide a\nuseful vision about the key physical properties of novel 2D systems of Nb3X8\n(X=Cl, Br, I).\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"W51xMymCi17sly7C_Vx_1zFkHGWHWmhn5FAm_z3_hNY","pdfSize":"1137607"}
