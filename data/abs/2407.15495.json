By investigating an associated constraint minimization problem, the\nexistence and non-existence of ground states are classified completely. Under\ncertain conditions on the trapping potentials, we present a precise analysis on\nthe concentration behavior of the minimizers as the coupling coefficient goes\nto a critical value, where the minimizers blow up and the maximum point\nsequence concentrates at a global minima of the associated trapping potentials.\nWe also identify an optimal blowing up rate under polynomial potentials by\nestablishing some delicate estimates of energy functionals.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gd5hmoUAThZEzP00JF6-wpK7mDntkPID9n_doImhJgQ","pdfSize":"366227"}
