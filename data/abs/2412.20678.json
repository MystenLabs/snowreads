  "abstract": "  One of the emerging techniques in node classification in heterogeneous graphs\nis to restrict message aggregation to pre-defined, semantically meaningful\nstructures called metapaths. This work is the first attempt to incorporate\nattention into the process of encoding entire metapaths without dropping\nintermediate nodes. In particular, we construct two encoders: the first uses\nsequential attention to extend the multi-hop message passing algorithm designed\nin \\citet{magna} to the metapath setting, and the second incorporates direct\nattention to extract semantic relations in the metapath. The model then employs\nthe intra-metapath and inter-metapath aggregation mechanisms of \\citet{han}. We\nfurthermore use the powerful training scheduler specialized for heterogeneous\ngraphs that was developed in \\citet{lts}, ensuring the model slowly learns how\nto classify the most difficult nodes. The result is a resilient,\ngeneral-purpose framework for capturing semantic structures in heterogeneous\ngraphs. In particular, we demonstrate that our model is competitive with\nstate-of-the-art models on performing node classification on the IMDB dataset,\na popular benchmark introduced in \\citet{benchmark}.\n",
