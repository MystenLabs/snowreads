  "abstract": "  Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic $p$. We\ndescribe the full lattice of subfunctors of the diagonal $p$-permutation\nfunctor $kR_k$ obtained by $k$-linear extension from the functor $R_k$ of\nlinear representations over $k$. This leads to the description of the\n``composition factors'' $S_P$ of $kR_k$, which are parametrized by finite\n$p$-groups (up to isomorphism), and of the evaluations of these particular\nsimple diagonal $p$-permutation functors over $k$.\n",
