However, a critical challenge in current ZOC methods lies in their\ninability to identify high-quality exemplars effectively. This deficiency\nhampers scalability across diverse classes and undermines the development of\nstrong visual associations between the identified classes and image content. To\nthis end, we propose the Visual Association-based Zero-shot Object Counting\n(VA-Count) framework. VA-Count consists of an Exemplar Enhancement Module (EEM)\nand a Noise Suppression Module (NSM) that synergistically refine the process of\nclass exemplar identification while minimizing the consequences of incorrect\nobject identification. The EEM utilizes advanced vision-language pretaining\nmodels to discover potential exemplars, ensuring the framework's adaptability\nto various classes. Meanwhile, the NSM employs contrastive learning to\ndifferentiate between optimal and suboptimal exemplar pairs, reducing the\nnegative effects of erroneous exemplars. VA-Count demonstrates its\neffectiveness and scalability in zero-shot contexts with superior performance\non two object counting datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"wXMBkrRfmxkrvURJY4m0IKkaug-ezDRj7vsAM77FzMI","pdfSize":"6134501"}
