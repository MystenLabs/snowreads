  "abstract": "  The coldest metal-poor population made of T and Y dwarfs are archaeological\ntracers of our Galaxy because they are very old and have kept the pristine\nmaterial. The optical properties of these objects are important to characterise\ntheir atmospheric properties. We aim at characterising further the optical\nproperties of ultracool metal-poor population with deep far-red optical images\nand parallax determinations. We solve trigonometric parallaxes of five\nmetal-poor T dwarf candidates using 2-year monitoring with Calar-Alto 3.5-m\ntelescope. We obtain $z'$-band photometry for the other 12 metal-poor T dwarf\ncandidates using the 10.4-m GTC, the 8.2-m VLT, and the DES, increasing the\nsample of T subdwarfs with optical photometry from 12 to 24. We report a\n3-$\\sigma$ limit for the Accident in five optical bands using the 10.4-m GTC.\nWe confirm four T subdwarfs and the Accident as a Y subdwarf, and propose two\nmore Y subdwarf candidates. We emphasise that the $z_{PS1}-W1$ colour combining\nwith the $W1-W2$ colour could break the metallicity-temperature degeneracy for\nT and possibly for Y dwarfs. The $z_{PS1}-W1$ colour shifts redward when\nmetallicity decreases for a certain temperature, which is not predicted by\nstate-of-the-art ultracool models. The Accident has the reddest $z_{PS1}-W1$\ncolour among our sample. The $z_{PS1}-W1$ colour will be useful to search for\nother examples of this cold and old population in upcoming and existing deep\noptical and infrared large-area surveys.\n",
