While\nKGE approaches are effective in these applications, most existing approaches\nassume that all information in the given KG is correct. This enables attackers\nto influence the output of these approaches, e.g., by perturbing the input.\nConsequently, the robustness of such KGE approaches has to be addressed. Recent\nwork focused on adversarial attacks. However, non-adversarial attacks on all\nattack surfaces of these approaches have not been thoroughly examined. We close\nthis gap by evaluating the impact of non-adversarial attacks on the performance\nof 5 state-of-the-art KGE algorithms on 5 datasets with respect to attacks on 3\nattack surfaces-graph, parameter, and label perturbation. Our evaluation\nresults suggest that label perturbation has a strong effect on the KGE\nperformance, followed by parameter perturbation with a moderate and graph with\na low effect.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TzKxzAUiMwA5pfzY0rQ9NvA_ffCz9kWtljBby1HVdPU","pdfSize":"581045"}
