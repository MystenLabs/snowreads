We show that the system possesses two types of HOTPs. The first type,\nanalogous to Floquet topology, generates a total of $8$ corner modes at $0$ or\n$\\pi$ eigenphase, while the second type, hidden behind a weak topological\nphase, yields a unique phase with $8$ corner modes at $\\pm\\pi/2$ eigenphase\n(after gapping out the counterpropagating edge states), arising from the\nproduct of particle-hole and phase rotation symmetry. By using a bulk\n$\\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological index ($Q$), we found both HOTPs have $Q=2$, whereas\n$Q=0$ for the trivial and the conventional weak topological phase. Together\nwith a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological index associated with the reflection matrix,\nwe are able to fully distinguish all phases. Our work motivates further studies\non magnetic topological phases and symmetry protected $2\\pi/n$ boundary modes,\nas well as suggests that such phases may find their experimental realization in\ncoupled-ring-resonator networks.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hkwlWfav9MxXM7RoZmLkfXRYIMxMdxdkcJdVp-FRPwM","pdfSize":"10827295"}
