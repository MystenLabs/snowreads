Here, we consider such\ntransitions under the addition of local random white noise and measurement\ninefficiency in a XX spin chain. We identify a non-monotonic dependence on the\nlocal noise strength in both the averaged entanglement and operator\ncorrelations, specifically the subsystem parity variance. While the\nnon-monotonicity persists at any finite efficiency for the operator\ncorrelations, it disappears at finite inefficiency for the entanglement. The\nanalysis of scaling with the system size in a finite length chain indicates\nthat, at finite efficiency, this effect leads to distinct MiPTs for operator\ncorrelations and entanglement. Our result hints at a difference between\narea-law entanglement scaling and Zeno-localized phases for inefficient\nmonitoring.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xCYA1HKaaWPVv4BZh0jFldYK5lk-lJN7wptZ8uzv6HQ","pdfSize":"855972","objectId":"0x48c5debc4356fd73ceb62bc46ccf6d6a581d76efa3e074cd9c14074275248e03","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
