The RF structure and e-beam circuit\nparameters are computed for different beam envelope radii and oscillation\namplitudes and then the self-excitation thresholds are obtained from the\nDeterminant equations. A new solution of the beam envelope equation not limited\nby the small-amplitude oscillations is derived and used to determine the\nmagnetic focusing conditions providing various beam envelope radii and\noscillation amplitudes. It is shown for the example Ka-band serpentine\nstructure that the optimum radius as well as axial position of the oscillating\nbeam envelope allow achieving significantly greater gain and power of RF\namplifiers.\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MfUZrvsJRFk1n9tvxNSeKYn4rZj2lCK2CbH9RvPD8Jw","pdfSize":"485094"}
