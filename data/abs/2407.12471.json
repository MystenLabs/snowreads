However, research on the toxicity dynamics is not\nenough. This study aims to provide a first exploration of the potential\nlanguage toxicity flow among Left, Right and Center users. Specifically, we aim\nto examine whether Left users were easier to be attacked by language toxicity.\nIn this study, more than 500M Twitter posts were examined. It was discovered\nthat Left users received much more toxic replies than Right and Center users.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"m8NNs45mNrRYLpV8RYg6TsdbzgBT1vuSEDzjpKvzma4","pdfSize":"316857"}
