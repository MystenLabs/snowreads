The\ngate-tunable superconducting transmon qubit (gatemon) is the paradigmatic\nexample of such a superconducting circuit. However, gatemons typically suffer\nfrom unstable and hysteretic qubit frequencies with respect to the applied gate\nvoltage and reduced coherence times. Here we develop methods for characterizing\nthese challenges in gatemons and deploy these methods to compare the impact of\nshunt capacitor designs on gatemon performance. Our results indicate a strong\nfrequency- and design-dependent behavior of the qubit stability, hysteresis,\nand dephasing times. Moreover, we achieve highly reliable tuning of the qubit\nfrequency with 1 MHz precision over a range of several GHz, along with improved\nstability in grounded gatemons compared to gatemons with a floating capacitor\ndesign.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tCx3qZiI5e2ROu0P3YuDC86fdLUBj6utMn_zYZujTc4","pdfSize":"6046002"}
