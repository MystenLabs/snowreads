This study proposes a novel predictive model based on the\nTransformer, utilizing statistical feature embedding and window positional\nencoding. Statistical features provide an effective representation of sensor\ndata, and the embedding enables the Transformer to learn both time- and\nsensor-related information. Window positional encoding captures precise time\ndetails from the feature embedding. The model's performance is evaluated in two\nproblems: fault detection and virtual metrology, showing superior results\ncompared to baseline models. This improvement is attributed to the efficient\nuse of parameters, which is particularly beneficial for sensor data that often\nhas limited sample sizes. The results support the model's applicability across\nvarious manufacturing industries, demonstrating its potential for enhancing\nprocess management and yield.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"AcnzUX1wrFbfNQTTsNLoxIIPK6CkQ77zzikg6CCsoZ0","pdfSize":"6494305"}
