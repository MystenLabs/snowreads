We show that the (sum\nof squares) length of $f$ is the same in the ring of regular functions of $C\n\\times \\mathbb{A}_K$ and in the field of rational functions of $C \\times\n\\mathbb{A}_K$. With this we are able to show that the Pythagoras number of the\nring of regular functions is the same as the Pythagoras number of the field of\nrational functions, for some product algebraic surfaces. This shows that the\nPythagoras number of the ring of regular functions of the real plane is 4,\nwhich was not known before.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Zj3tzOQP9Mi4Y090NtgRIePMrpEbFVI5bLjoK17Drhc","pdfSize":"140318","objectId":"0x8e3c886b0a7a339e0fdabc3890c3297d361171c83ab486b9135487fa9d46c87c","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
