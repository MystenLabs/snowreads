In this paper, we study the permutation classes that comprise all the\nfinite subpermutations contained in an infinite pin sequence. We prove that\nthese permutation classes have proper growth rates and establish a procedure\nfor calculating these growth rates.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"A7TkWpzl0NsAMq7am9Y1XUF66L21pqb0AyoVVOyJCKc","pdfSize":"491783"}
