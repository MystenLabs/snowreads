The model coefficient is often calculated dynamically through\nthe minimization of the Germano-identity error (GIE). However, the driving\nmechanism behind the dynamic model's success is still not well understood. In\nwall-bounded flows, we postulate that the principal directions of the resolved\nrate-of-strain tensor play an important role in the dynamic models.\nSpecifically, we find that minimization of the GIE along only the three\nprincipal directions (or less), in lieu of its nine components in its original\nformulation, produces equally comparable results as the original model when\nexamined in canonical turbulent channel flows, a three-dimensional turbulent\nboundary layer, and a separating flow over periodic hills. This suggests that\nnot all components of the Germano identity are equally important for the\nsuccess of the dynamic model, and that there might be dynamically more\nimportant directions for modeling the subgrid dynamics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NExI4tIr_Lk9Ru_p1dpkJKaK_cKHD-qQGQPQK036vtw","pdfSize":"1719148","objectId":"0xbad14365196b58421a5c379e1fbed0b3d7ab091abbc7a76678246658b9b433ec","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
