We consider two settings that are distinguished by the type of\ninformation that each player has about the game and their opponent's strategy.\nThe first setting is the full information case, in which each player knows\ntheir own and the opponent's payoff matrices and observes the opponent's mixed\nstrategy. The second setting is the minimal information case, where players do\nnot observe the opponent's strategy and are not aware of either of the payoff\nmatrices (instead they only observe their realized payoffs). For this setting,\nalso known as the radically uncoupled case in the learning in games literature,\nwe study a two-timescale learning dynamics that combine smoothed best-response\ntype updates for strategy estimates with a TD-learning update to estimate a\nlocal payoff function. For these dynamics, without additional exploration, we\nprovide polynomial-time finite-sample guarantees for convergence to an\n$\\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bQ0KeCI9QxjJ4FkMKXqQe470feu4IY0C6eJ_fgrZX3U","pdfSize":"443687"}
