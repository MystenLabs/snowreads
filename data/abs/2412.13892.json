  "abstract": "  This paper addresses, for the first time, the uplink performance optimization\nof multi-user pinching-antenna systems, recently developed for next-generation\nwireless networks. By leveraging the unique capabilities of pinching antennas\nto dynamically configure wireless channels, we focus on maximizing the minimum\nachievable data rate between devices to achieve a balanced trade-off between\nthroughput and fairness. An effective approach is proposed that separately\noptimizes the positions of the pinching antennas and the resource allocation.\nThe antenna positioning problem is reformulated into a convex one, while a\nclosed-form solution is provided for the resource allocation. Simulation\nresults demonstrate the superior performance of the investigated system using\nthe proposed algorithm over corresponding counterparts, emphasizing the\nsignificant potential of pinching-antenna systems for robust and efficient\nuplink communication in next-generation wireless networks.\n",
