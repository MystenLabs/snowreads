This modification, called mSMACOF, has the same stress values as\nSMACOF in each iteration, but unlike SMACOF it produces a sequence of\nconfigurations that properly converges to a solution. We show that the modified\nalgorithm can be implemented by iterating ordinary SMACOF to convergence, and\nthen rotating the SMACOF solution to principal components. The speed of linear\nconvergence of SMACOF and mSMACOF is the same, and is equal to the largest\neigenvalue of the derivative of the Guttman transform, ignoring the trivial\nunit eigenvalues that result from rotational indeterminacy.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"Gb4-3wue4TY0gcD1OFVzwuN7NhJuM-0FelAczQbM2H8","pdfSize":"164656"}
