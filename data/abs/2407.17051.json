El Sahili\nand Ghazo Hanna [J. Graph Theory 102 (2023), 684-701] showed that any oriented\ngraph $D$ with maximum degree at most 2 is converse invariant. They proposed a\nquestion: Can we characterize all converse invariant oriented graphs?\n  In this paper, we introduce a digraph polynomial and employ it to give a\nnecessary condition for an oriented graph to be converse invariant. This\npolynomial serves as a cornerstone in proving all the results presented in this\npaper. In particular, we characterize all orientations of trees with diameter\nat most 3 that are converse invariant. We also show that all orientations of\nregular graphs are not converse invariant if $D$ and $-D$ have different degree\nsequences. In addition, in contrast to the findings of El Sahili and Ghazo\nHanna, we prove that every connected graph $G$ with maximum degree at least\n$3$, admits an orientation $D$ of $G$ such that $D$ is not converse invariant.\nWe pose one conjecture.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kAKSiHK4cOlW4Fc1P4_LfwOu8nujPaLRC8P1QUZb7eI","pdfSize":"169979","objectId":"0xe5f38aecdb938b04ca24848fd93477d41a34e066c8509613de1d6f3fa4f28614","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
