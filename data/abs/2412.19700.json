  "abstract": "  Controlled introduction of oxygen vacancies offers an effective route to\ninduce metal-to-insulator transition in strongly correlated rare-earth\nnickelates ($R$NiO$_3$) at room temperature. However, the role played by the\nrare-earth cations on the structure, thermodynamic stability, and electronic\nproperties of oxygen-deficient nickelates remains unclear. Here, we employ\ndensity functional theory calculations with Hubbard corrections (DFT + $U$) to\ninvestigate the whole family of $R$NiO$_{2.5}$ ($R$ = Pr-Er) compounds in two\ncommonly observed oxygen-vacancy ordered configurations, namely brownmillerite,\nand square planar. We find that square planar polymorph is always more stable\n($\\sim$0.4 eV/u.f) than the brownmillerite for all rare-earth cations, owing to\nthe exceedingly low volumetric strains (< 1\\%). Formation energy of\n$R$NiO$_{2.5}$ gradually increases with decreasing size of $R$ owing to\nstronger Ni-O covalent interactions in pristine $R$NiO$_3$ with small $R^{3+}$\ncations. This necessitates more oxygen-lean environments for synthesis of\n$R$NiO$_{2.5}$ with smaller $R^{3+}$ cations. Analysis of the density of states\nand band structures reveals that electronic structure of $R$NiO$_{2.5}$ is\ngoverned by two factors: (a) localization of electron on NiO$_6$ octahedra\nyielding a Mott insulating state with strong correlations as Ni $e_g$ is half\nfilled, and (b) crystal field splitting in the NiO$_4$ tetrahedra/square planar\npolyhedra. Brownmillerite $R$NiO$_{2.5}$ is metallic, while square planar\n$R$NiO$_{2.5}$ is an insulator with a predicted gap of $\\sim$ 0.2-0.3 eV,\ndepending on the $R^{3+}$ cation. Crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP)\nanalysis indicates that the Ni-O bond belonging to square-planar NiO$_4$\npolyhedra exhibit much greater covalent character than those in NiO$_6$\noctahedra in square planar $R$NiO$_{2.5}$.\n",
