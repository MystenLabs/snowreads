In this note we show that the category of central\ncomplexes admits functorial monoidal transfers with respect to morphisms\nbetween the dual groups. Combining with the work of Bezrukavnikov-Deshpande, we\nshow that the $\\ell$-adic bi-Whittaker categories (resp. the category of\nvanishing complexes, the category of stable complexes) on reductive groups\nadmit functorial transfers. As an application, we give a new geometric proof of\nLaumon-Letellier's fromula for transfer maps of stable functions on finite\nreductive groups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lC2bPSGkikOW1HtGmPQYGXtJgXFdXGCvYZqtOiQ6yis","pdfSize":"202047"}
