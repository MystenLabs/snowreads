  "abstract": "  In this paper, we study the Fu\\v{c}\\'{\\i}k spectrum of a square matrix $A$\nand provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of\nFu\\v{c}\\'{\\i}k curves emanating from the point $(\\lambda,\\lambda)$ with\n$\\lambda$ being a real eigenvalue of $A$. We extend recent results by\nMaroncelli (2024) and remove his assumptions on symmetry of $A$ and simplicity\nof $\\lambda$. We show that the number of Fu\\v{c}\\'{\\i}k curves can\nsignificantly exceed the multiplicity of $\\lambda$ and determine all the\npossible directions they can emanate in. We also treat the situation when the\nalgebraic multiplicity of $\\lambda$ is greater than the geometric one and show\nthat in such a case the Fu\\v{c}\\'{\\i}k curves can loose their smoothness and\nprovide the slopes of their \"one-sided tangent lines\". Finally, we offer two\npossible generalizations: the situation off the diagonal and Fu\\v{c}\\'{\\i}k\nspectrum of a general Fredholm operator on the Hilbert space with a lattice\nstructure.\n",
