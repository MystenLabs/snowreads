Combined with the\nEichler-Shimura theory developed by B\\\"ockle, this leads to a trace formula for\nHecke operators on Drinfeld modular forms. As a corollary, we deduce a\nRamanujan bound on the traces of Hecke operators.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ja2Vb6jyCUh5YPMaAgel61l4cl7ZOe6tZpSxAgoFesQ","pdfSize":"612971"}
