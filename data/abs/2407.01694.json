We also present the first elemental\nabundance measurements of the young K-dwarf (K0) host star, BD+60 1417 using\nhigh resolution~(R = 50,000) spectra taken with PEPSI/LBT. In the complex\ncloudy L-dwarf regime the emergence of condensate cloud species complicates\nretrieval analysis when only near-infrared data is available. We find that for\nboth L dwarfs in this work, despite testing three different thermal profile\nparameterizations we are unable to constrain reliable abundance measurements\nand thus the C/O ratio. While we can not conclude what the abundances are, we\ncan conclude that the data strongly favor a cloud model over a cloudless model.\nWe note that the difficulty in retrieval constraints persists regardless of the\nsignal to noise of the data examined (S/N $\\sim$ 10 for CWISER\nJ124332.12+600126.2 and~40 for WISEP J004701.06+680352.1). The results\npresented in this work provide valuable lessons about retrieving young,\nlow-surface gravity, cloudy L-dwarfs. This work provides continued evidence of\nmissing information in models and the crucial need for JWST to guide and inform\nretrieval analysis in this regime.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"evSbd4VjajsC3M7KjlivVivtxtxoQlOre7lV5jpWKww","pdfSize":"4989245","objectId":"0xa1e27bc3751cc95a0dacd8e43ac0d02d5f73a37c0c29c407446746559bf809c0","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
