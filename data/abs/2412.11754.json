Therefore, the quality of\npredictors is crucial for the overall reliability and performance of the system\nunder control. This paper studies predictors in systems exhibiting\nprobabilistic and non-deterministic behavior modelled as Markov decision\nprocesses (MDPs). Main contributions are the introduction of quantitative\nnotions that measure the effectiveness of predictors in terms of their average\ncapability to predict the occurrence of failures or other undesired system\nbehaviors. The average is taken over all memoryless policies. We study two\nclasses of such notions. One class is inspired by concepts that have been\nintroduced in statistical analysis to explain the impact of features on the\ndecisions of binary classifiers (such as precision, recall, f-score). Second,\nwe study a measure that borrows ideas from recent work on probability-raising\ncausality in MDPs and determines the quality of a predictor by the fraction of\nmemoryless policies under which (the set of states in) the predictor is a\nprobability-raising cause for the considered failure scenario.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"JWtTjNZ74IHAFYNQKuK4uM751_cIPzC29WQ6JV-5fiw","pdfSize":"227357"}
