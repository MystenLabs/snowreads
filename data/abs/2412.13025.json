  "abstract": "  We introduce the notion of the free product of $q$-matroids, which is the\n$q$-analogue of the free product of matroids. We study the properties of this\nnoncommutative binary operation, making an extensive use of the theory of\ncyclic flats. We show that the free product of two $q$-matroids $M_1$ and $M_2$\nis maximal with respect to the weak order on $q$-matroids having $M_1$ as a\nrestriction and $M_2$ as the complementary contraction. We characterise\n$q$-matroids that are irreducible with respect to the free product and we prove\nthat the factorization of a $q$-matroid into a free product of irreducibles is\nunique up to isomorphism. We discuss the representability of the free product,\nwith a particular focus on rank one uniform $q$-matroids and show that such a\nproduct is represented by clubs on the projective line.\n",
