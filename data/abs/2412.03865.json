Four weeks later,\nDudeney demonstrated a beautiful four-piece solution, which today remains\nperhaps the most famous example of a dissection. In this paper (over a century\nlater), we finally solve Dudeney's puzzle, by proving that the equilateral\ntriangle and square have no common dissection with three or fewer polygonal\npieces. We reduce the problem to the analysis of a discrete graph structure\nrepresenting the correspondence between the edges and vertices of the pieces\nforming each polygon, using ideas from common unfolding.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computational Geometry","Computer Science/Discrete Mathematics","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"a5E_tA8u9m9k3x098Y0wsjqt74l_Y5U-hHgwsQdF_nQ","pdfSize":"2608900"}
