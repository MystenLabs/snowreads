That decline is proportional to the movement in\nthe AMM's implied price, i.e. for every basis point the trade moves the ratio\nof assets, the marginal fee declines by a basis point. These fees create\nincentives that protect against price staleness, while still allowing the AMM\nto earn meaningful fee revenue. Triangle fees can strictly improve the Pareto\nfrontier of price accuracy versus losses generated by the status quo of\nconstant fee mechanisms.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"dflpyIOKFxOEQ67OJkaQ56k-pIVa5aU6I_573qdgfJs","pdfSize":"1190904"}
