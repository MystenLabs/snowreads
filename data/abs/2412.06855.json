Evolutionary game theory\noffers a lens to understand the structures and incentives that enable\ncooperation to be a successful strategy. As artificial intelligence agents\nbecome integral to human systems, the dynamics of cooperation take on\nunprecedented significance. The convergence of human-agent teaming, contract\ntheory, and decentralized frameworks like Web3, grounded in transparency,\naccountability, and trust, offers a foundation for fostering cooperation by\nestablishing enforceable rules and incentives for humans and AI agents. We\nconceptualize Incentivized Symbiosis as a social contract between humans and\nAI, inspired by Web3 principles and encoded in blockchain technology, to define\nand enforce rules, incentives, and consequences for both parties. By exploring\nthis paradigm, we aim to catalyze new research at the intersection of systems\nthinking in AI, Web3, and society, fostering innovative pathways for\ncooperative human-agent coevolution.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Multiagent Systems","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1zaQZEP8ca6toL4qCNBMCoviCmWcuDuGCUOAwyEHCeQ","pdfSize":"218043"}
