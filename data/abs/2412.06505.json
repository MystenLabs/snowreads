  "abstract": "  This paper is devoted to studying propagation phenomena in\nintegro-differential equations with a weakly degenerate non-linearity. The\nreaction term can be seen as an intermediate between the classical logistic (or\nFisher-KPP) non-linearity and the standard weak Allee effect one. We study the\neffect of the tails of the dispersal kernel on the rate of expansion. When the\ntail of the kernel is sub-exponential, the exact separation between existence\nand non-existence of travelling waves is exhibited. This, in turn, provides the\nexact separation between finite speed propagation and acceleration in the\nCauchy problem. Moreover, the exact rates of acceleration for dispersal kernels\nwith sub-exponential and algebraic tails are provided. Our approach is generic\nand covers a large variety of dispersal kernels including those leading to\nconvolution and fractional Laplace operators. Numerical simulations are\nprovided to illustrate our results.\n",
