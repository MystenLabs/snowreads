  "abstract": "  The main aim of this article is to prove that for any continuous function $f\n\\colon X \\to X$, where $X$ is metrizable (or, more generally, for any family\n$\\mathcal{F}$ of such functions, satisfying an additional condition), there\nexists a compatible metric $d$ on $X$ such that the $n$th iteration of $f$\n(more generally, the composition of any $n$ functions from $\\mathcal{F}$) is\nLipschitz with constant $a_k$ where $(a_k)_{k=1}^{\\infty}$ is an arbitrarily\nfixed sequence of real numbers such that $1 < a_k$ and\n$\\lim\\limits_{k\\to+\\infty}a_k = +\\infty$. In particular, any dynamical system\ncan be remetrized in order to significantly control the distance between points\nby their initial distance.\n",
