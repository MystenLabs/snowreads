The effect\nof the relativistic boost on single-particle generalized Gaussian wave packets\nis studied. The coherence of the wave function as measured by the boosted\nobserver is studied as a function of the momentum and the boost parameter.\nUsing various formulations of coherence, it is shown that in general the\ncoherence decays with the increase in momentum of the state, as well as the\nboost applied to it. A more prominent loss of coherence due to relativistic\nboost is observed for a single particle electron than that of a neutron. The\nanalysis is carried out with generalized Gaussian wave packet of the form $\\sim\np^n \\exp(-\\frac{p^2}{\\sigma^2})$. We also obtain a bound on the unknown\nparameter $n$ appearing in the wave packet. It is found to have a dependence on\nthe mass of the particle and the width of the Gaussian wave packet.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FSYNqwDPcplKv8ag6W3_XJFQpRhBRFamgya11SCZcDU","pdfSize":"563958"}
