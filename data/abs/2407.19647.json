Main goal of this work is to find a correlation between the\nalpha-decay half-lives and the stiffness of the symmtery energy. Parameters of\nKIDS model are determined to reproduce the nuclear data (energy and charge\nradii of 40Ca, 48Ca and 208Pb) and the neutron star observations including\nconstraints by NICER, tidal deformability from GW170817, and the maximum mass\nlimit of neutron star observations. We use the KIDS models (A-D) which have\ndistinctive values for the parameters controlling the stiffness of the nuclear\nmatter equation of state. We find that the alpha-decay half-lives increase\nsystematically from KIDS-A model to KIDS-D model. This implies a correlation\nbetween the alpha-decay half-lives and the symmetry energy. We find that the\ncorrelation can be understood from the dependence of the particle distribution\nin the core and the surface region on the symmetry energy.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"hIdUCIbsA6UQfguTlhIfDoSAvo2onnkD0XHrXG2wFgY","pdfSize":"1223641"}
