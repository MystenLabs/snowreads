However, little effort has been put into\nunderstanding these \"black box\" models. We show how one can apply integrated\ngradients (IGs) to understand these models by designing different baselines, by\ntaking an example case study in particle physics. We find that the zero-vector\nbaseline does not provide good feature attributions and that an averaged\nbaseline sampled from the background events provides consistently more\nreasonable attributions.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IOSHFNdOeo6rC3rMomx1lnjzjZbgLV7JxnGfOi7zyOs","pdfSize":"394047"}
