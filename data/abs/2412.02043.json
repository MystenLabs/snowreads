Recognizing this paradigm\nshift at the intersection of IR and generative AI (IR-GenAI), a visioning\nworkshop supported by the Computing Community Consortium (CCC) was held in July\n2024 to discuss the future of IR in the age of generative AI. This workshop\nconvened 44 experts in information retrieval, natural language processing,\nhuman-computer interaction, and artificial intelligence from academia,\nindustry, and government to explore how generative AI can enhance IR and vice\nversa, and to identify the major challenges and opportunities in this rapidly\nadvancing field.\n  This report contains a summary of discussions as potentially important\nresearch topics and contains a list of recommendations for academics, industry\npractitioners, institutions, evaluation campaigns, and funding agencies.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Information Retrieval","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lj6vTwz3DprG7a2MQ6uau8IFjnuq8kKVjO-YE75VE3Y","pdfSize":"898263"}
