Here, we demonstrate birefringent\nphase-matching in a 20-mm-long waveguide fabricated on 5~$\\mu$m-thick x-cut\nlithium niobate on insulator. The waveguide is deviated from the optical axis\nof LN by an angle of 53.5$^\\circ$, enabling the phase matching between telecom\nand visible wavelengths. The phase-matching wavelength of this device can be\nthermally tuned with rate of 0.617~nm/K. We demonstrate the type-1 spontaneous\nparametric down-conversion to generate photon pairs with brightness of\n2.2~MHz/mW and coincidence-to-accidental ratio up to $2.8\\times10^5$.\nFurthermore, the heralded single photon is obtained from the photon pair with\nefficiency of 13.8\\% and count rate up to 37.8~kHz.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ClPUT3V1tjUOzDu6JbS8JEUyRRUaMSYgvGffiC29OBc","pdfSize":"485320"}
