These\nmaterials exhibit intriguing quantum phenomena, which when harnessed properly,\npromise extraordinary advancements across various scientific and technological\ndomains. To fully exploit their potential, it is imperative to synthesize such\nquantum materials in thin film form so that they are compatible with\nwell-established device fabrication techniques. In this perspective, an\noverview of the current status and future directions of thin film quantum\nmaterial synthesis is provided. The criteria for quantum materials are\ndiscussed, as well as the many benefits of preparing them as thin films.\nProminent deposition techniques such as molecular beam epitaxy and chemical\nvapor deposition are reviewed along with potential contenders. Despite\nchallenges, progress in thin film quantum material technology holds the\npotential to realize practical devices with unprecedented functionalities.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZYp6y5B6LZCs6DNC7N9m_n_sWqAhcBDbAWjXwv7O0tA","pdfSize":"1313361"}
