  "abstract": "  Several generalizations of Vershik-Kerov limit shape problem are motivated by\ntopological string theory and supersymmetric gauge theory instanton count. In\nthis paper specifically we study the circular and linear quiver theories. We\nalso briefly discuss the double-elliptic generalization of the Vershik-Kerov\nproblem, related to six dimensional gauge theory compactified on a torus, and\nto elliptic cohomology of the Hilbert scheme of points on a plane. We prove\nthat the limit shape in that setting is governed by a genus two algebraic\ncurve, suggesting unexpected dualities between the enumerative and equivariant\nparameters.\n",
