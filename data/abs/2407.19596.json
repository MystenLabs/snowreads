Despite its importance in\nmodelling complex dependence structures, there are very few fully nonparametric\napproaches to estimate the conditional copula function. In the bivariate\nsetting, the only nonparametric estimator for the conditional copula is based\non Sklar's Theorem and proposed by Gijbels \\textit{et al.} (2011). In this\npaper, we propose an alternative nonparametric approach %based on functional\nprincipal component analysis. We to construct an estimator for the bivariate\nconditional copula from the Karhunen-Lo\\`eve representation of a suitably\ndefined conditional copula process. We establish its consistency and weak\nconvergence to a limit Gaussian process with explicit covariance function.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9cRrZb1fXl5wLzRhe1XaSyhSdzi6IipEd2JfzJsupyc","pdfSize":"155609"}
