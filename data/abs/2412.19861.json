  "abstract": "  Based on the coupling mechanism between new infrastructure investment level\nand digital transformation level, a comprehensive index system is constructed.\nBy using entropy weight method, coupling coordination evaluation model,\nexploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) and standard deviation ellipse model,\nthe coupling coordination development level of new infrastructure investment\nlevel and digital transformation level in 31 provinces and cities in China from\n2014 to 2021 is calculated, and its spatial agglomeration level and\nspatial-temporal evolution characteristics are analyzed.\n",
