  "abstract": "  We investigate a quantum dot (QD) system coupled to a vibrational environment\nwith a super-Ohmic spectral density and weakly to a leaky cavity mode, a model\nrelevant for semiconductor-based single-photon sources. The phonon coupling\ninduces dephasing and broadens the absorption and emission line shapes, while\nthe weakly coupled cavity mode leads to effective driving of the QD. To capture\nnon-Markovian effects, we use non-Markovian Quantum State Diffusion and its\nhierarchical extension the Hierarchy of Pure States to compute multitime\ncorrelation functions underlying absorption and resonance fluorescence spectra.\nWe present numerical results for the absorption spectra at strong phonon\ncoupling and finite temperature, as well as for resonance fluorescence spectra\nat varying phonon coupling strengths and temperatures, and analyse the\nvisibility of the resonance fluorescence spectra to provide insights into how\nphonon coupling and thermal effects influence the spectral features.\n",
