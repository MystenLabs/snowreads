NREL's HPC\ncapabilities support the research needs of the Department of Energy's Office of\nEnergy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). In ten years of operation, HPC\nuse in EERE-sponsored sustainability research has grown by a factor of 30. This\npaper analyzes this research portfolio, providing examples of individual use\ncases. The paper documents NREL's history of operating one of the world's most\nsustainable data centers while examining pathways to improving sustainability\nbeyond reduction of PUE. This paper concludes by examining the unique\nopportunities created for sustainable computing research created by combining\nan HPC system dedicated to sustainability research and a research program in\nsustainable computing.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zXv584wX2z1cK4xi0Dd14GTBFd-GsRX2t9HLLaBils0","pdfSize":"3639572"}
