Written in Coq/Rocq and based on the\nMathematical Components library, it covers a large part of the contents of a\ngraduate level textbook in the field. The flagship result is a proof of the\nLittlewood-Richardson rule, which computes the structure constants of the\nalgebra of symmetric function in the schur basis which are integer numbers\nappearing in various fields of mathematics, and which has a long history of\nwrong proofs. A specific feature of algebraic combinatorics is the constant\ninterplay between algorithms and algebraic constructions: algorithms are not\nonly in computations, but also are key ingredients in definitions and proofs.\nAs such, the proof of the Littlewood-Richardson rule deeply relies on the\nunderstanding of the execution of the Robinson-Schensted algorithm. Many\nresults in this library are effective and actually used in computer algebra\nsystems, and we discuss their certified implementation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4SuZBKAWwL3e5JiFF3DkL_i34o0XQjfbt3ihTeh92pU","pdfSize":"927184"}
