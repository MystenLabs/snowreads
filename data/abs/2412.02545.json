  "abstract": "  Shadows introduce challenges such as reduced brightness, texture\ndeterioration, and color distortion in images, complicating a holistic\nsolution. This study presents ShadowHack, a divide-and-conquer strategy that\ntackles these complexities by decomposing the original task into luminance\nrecovery and color remedy. To brighten shadow regions and repair the corrupted\ntextures in the luminance space, we customize LRNet, a U-shaped network with a\nrectified outreach attention module, to enhance information interaction and\nrecalibrate contaminated attention maps. With luminance recovered, CRNet then\nleverages cross-attention mechanisms to revive vibrant colors, producing\nvisually compelling results. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets are\nconducted to demonstrate the superiority of ShadowHack over existing\nstate-of-the-art solutions both quantitatively and qualitatively, highlighting\nthe effectiveness of our design. Our code will be made publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/lime-j/ShadowHack\n",
