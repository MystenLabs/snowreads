PDF parsing offers fast and\naccurate extraction but faces challenges with non-Unicode Nepali fonts. OCR,\nspecifically PyTesseract, overcomes these challenges, providing versatility for\nboth digital and scanned PDFs. The study reveals that while PDF parsers are\nfaster, their accuracy fluctuates based on PDF types. In contrast, OCRs, with a\nfocus on PyTesseract, demonstrate consistent accuracy at the expense of\nslightly longer extraction times. Considering the project's emphasis on Nepali\nPDFs, PyTesseract emerges as the most suitable library, balancing extraction\nspeed and accuracy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iw8cc108q3M-ByugmCkMvYAIpgavFwb-EgZQk1m1ARk","pdfSize":"920190"}
