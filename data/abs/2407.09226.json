Therefore we introduce the special and general\nprojectivity groups attached to simplices $F$. If the residue of $F$ is\nirreducible, we determine the permutation group of the projectivity groups of\n$F$ acting on the residue of $F$ and show that this determines the precise\naction of the Levi subgroup of a parabolic subgroup on the corresponding\nresidue. This reveals three special cases for the exceptional types $E_6$,\n$E_7$, $E_8$. Furthermore, we establish a general diagrammatic rule to decide\nwhen exactly the special and general projectivity groups of $F$ coincide.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"TN_VAe-lvZUlm779RhR-DTGNsHE00tN5QRxJDeUtDMk","pdfSize":"505522"}
