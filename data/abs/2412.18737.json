The\nmean signal and the statistics of the noise can be probed by the moments of the\nspectral form factor, also known as higher-point spectral form factors. We\nidentify saddle points in the SYK model that describe the moments during the\nramp region. Perturbative corrections around the saddle point indicate that SYK\nmimics random matrix statistics for the low order moments, while large\ndeviations for the high order moments arise from fluctuations near the edge of\nthe spectrum. The leading correction scales inversely with the number of random\nparameters in the SYK Hamiltonian and is amplified in a sparsified version of\nthe SYK model, which we study numerically, even in regimes where a linear ramp\npersists. Finally, we study the $q=2$ SYK model, whose spectral form factor\nexhibits an exponential ramp with increased noise. These findings reveal how\ndeviations from random matrix universality arise in disordered systems and\nmotivate their interpretation from a bulk gravitational perspective.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iJLDWLeGJCCJvtX8zsEmHbekAnRNIjrBAy8WWuSKZEs","pdfSize":"1044797"}
