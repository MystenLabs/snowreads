We present deep\nobservations from ~ 105.8 GHz to 113.6 GHz toward 50 Galactic massive\nstar-forming regions using IRAM 30-m millimeter telescope, with noise levels\nranging from 6 to 29 at frequency channel spacing of 195 kHz, which corresponds\nto ~ 0.54 km/s at 110 GHz. Totally, 27 molecular species have been identified,\nof which 16 are complex organic molecules. The related parameters, such as peak\ntemperature, integrated intensity, and line width of the identified molecular\nlines were obtained. The line widths of the chemically related molecules show\nstrong positive correlations, suggesting they likely originate from similar\ngases within star-forming regions. This work highlights the fundamental\nproperties of the detected molecular lines and offers a valuable dataset for\nfurther studies on the astrochemical evolution of molecules in massive\nstar-forming cores.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jcy8vHsHCMFP9Zil3Ql-N5UI33r5BwG9OZVJClKufi0","pdfSize":"1699394"}
