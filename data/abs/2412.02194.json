Use of dielectrics, instead, suitable for light propagation was\nmore attractive due to its extremely wide bandwidth. Many of the devices, both\nactive and passive, have been demonstrated using these insulating materials.\nDue to its excellent optical characteristics, established fabrication history,\nand cheaper throughput, silicon found its place in photonics arena. However,\ndue to its indirect band structure, efficient light sources are not possible\nusing silicon as the base material. Nevertheless, techniques such as stimulated\nRaman scattering and third-harmonic generation have made it possible to avoid\nthis natural hurdle in the path of silicon as a light source. This paper\nreviews basic theory of stimulated Raman scattering, its applications in the\ncontext of silicon based photonic integrated circuits and describes ways to\nimprove this nonlinear effect. This paper also covers few of the most important\ndemonstrations of stimulated Raman scattering published in literature from the\nlast decade.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Computer Science/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"YfTpNCn1DJsQklH9fGPBkY3zk3evCsR_x2UmEJSkW1k","pdfSize":"493609"}
