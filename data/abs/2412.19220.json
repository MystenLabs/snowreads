We prove the validity of our algorithm, and adopt some\ntricks for practical calculations. The formulations of the particle oscillation\nprocesses are also improved in the framework of the quantum field theory,\noffering us the ability to simulate the flying distances of the oscillating\nintermediate sterile neutrinos while regarding them as the internal lines in\nthe Feynmann diagrams.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"9f0aMIa7ZeuVq5dVZC2yePwY5598He_GD77gbJ8OqBI","pdfSize":"818715"}
