  "abstract": "  In this paper we theoretically describe a distinct class of two-dimensional\nN\\'{e}el ordered metallic antiferromagnets on a honeycomb-like lattice in which\nthe two sublattices are connected only by a combination of time-reversal and\nmirror symmetry operations. As a result of this symmetry, conducting fermions\nhave antiferromagnetic spin-splitting consistent with the symmetry, the\nmirror-symmetric spin-splitting. It is shown that the anomalous spin Hall\neffect is expected in such systems. We also consider a system in which there\nare no symmetries between the sublattices and obtain asymmetric spin-splitting.\nSuch systems are expected to have the anomalous Hall effect.\n",
