However, the growing reliance on extensive\ndata for training and inference has raised significant privacy concerns,\nranging from data leakage to adversarial attacks. This survey comprehensively\nexplores the landscape of privacy-preserving mechanisms tailored for LLMs,\nincluding differential privacy, federated learning, cryptographic protocols,\nand trusted execution environments. We examine their efficacy in addressing key\nprivacy challenges, such as membership inference and model inversion attacks,\nwhile balancing trade-offs between privacy and model utility. Furthermore, we\nanalyze privacy-preserving applications of LLMs in privacy-sensitive domains,\nhighlighting successful implementations and inherent limitations. Finally, this\nsurvey identifies emerging research directions, emphasizing the need for novel\nframeworks that integrate privacy by design into the lifecycle of LLMs. By\nsynthesizing state-of-the-art approaches and future trends, this paper provides\na foundation for developing robust, privacy-preserving large language models\nthat safeguard sensitive information without compromising performance.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Cryptography and Security","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"8Qg7rg4_0sXqUFpTph9LQlBesy1zmuNiEZQ0rSiTHxA","pdfSize":"104721"}
