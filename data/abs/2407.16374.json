We concentrate on\nquadratic distances, which depend on a non-negative definite kernel. We propose\na unified framework for the study of two-sample and k-sample goodness of fit\ntests based on the concept of matrix distance. We provide a succinct review of\nthe goodness of fit literature related to the use of distance measures, and\nspecifically to quadratic distances. We show that the quadratic distance\nkernel-based two-sample test has the same functional form with the maximum mean\ndiscrepancy test. We develop tests for the $k$-sample scenario, where the\ntwo-sample problem is a special case. We derive their asymptotic distribution\nunder the null hypothesis and discuss computational aspects of the test\nprocedures. We assess their performance, in terms of level and power, via\nextensive simulations and a real data example. The proposed framework is\nimplemented in the QuadratiK package, available in both R and Python\nenvironments.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"WYe4s5n51Znu3I0Tq39fOQVSZU5rm5pLljvxjuRtwr4","pdfSize":"929962","objectId":"0x43dcbf03e31d43f1f7e09b67a98385bc744758033ef4150af5f475dcdab691c0","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
