This results in discretized sparse Newton systems that admit a simple\nand effective block preconditioner. The solver can handle both obstacle-type,\n$u \\leq \\varphi$, and gradient-type, $|\\nabla u| \\leq \\varphi$, constraints. We\napply the resulting algorithm to solve obstacle problems with $hp$-adaptivity,\na gradient-type constrained problem, and the thermoforming problem, an example\nof an obstacle-type quasi-variational inequality. We observe $hp$-robustness in\nthe number of Newton iterations and only mild growth in the number of inner\nKrylov iterations to solve the Newton systems. Crucially we also provide\nwall-clock timings that are faster than low-order discretization counterparts.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uI0H8gThPcL6la2Gf_KM6VW1XMioEbwZn24V8Dbf6F8","pdfSize":"49935274"}
