  "abstract": "  Loop quantum cosmology was shown to interpolate between de Sitter and FLRW\nUniverse phases through a bounce by including Euclidean and Lorentzian terms of\nthe Hamiltonian constraint with weight one -that corresponding to classical\nGeneral Relativity. Unitary evolution required self-adjoint extensions of the\nconstraint and a Planckian cosmological constant was obtained. Independent work\ntook a positive weight to get a cosmological constant with the observed value,\nwithout considering unitarity. In this work we address the unitary evolution of\nthe model for arbitrary weight. For non positive weight parameter unitary holds\nbut for positive values self-adjoint extensions are required. To encompass\nobservations the extensions here provided are mandatory. These are implemented\nin a propagator. Finally, we discuss our results and perspectives.\n",
