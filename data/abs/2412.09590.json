This approach incorporates a modified total energy\nbalance, utilizing a binary tensor Young measure. The central finding is a weak\n(measure-valued)--strong uniqueness principle: if both a dissipative\nmeasure-valued solution and a classical smooth solution originate from the same\ninitial data, they will be identical as long as the classical solution exists.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"ZpYK1h_wxXvXXASoZ3AmcT6zG3e6s1pNgcDGD74npuo","pdfSize":"336912"}
