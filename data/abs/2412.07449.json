  "abstract": "  In the quantitative theory of quantum coherence, the amount of coherence for\ngiven states can be meaningfully discussed only when referring to a preferred\nbasis. One of the objections to this quantification is that the amount of\ncoherence is an intrinsically basis-dependent quantity. This limitation can,\nhowever, be lifted when considering a set of quantum states invariant under\narbitrary unitary transformations. Thus, we analyze a basis-independent\ndefinition of quantum coherence, and the incoherent state is taken as the\nmaximally mixed state. We describe the relationship between the\nbasis-independent and the basis-dependent approaches and give several\napplications to show the advantages of the former method. The relations among\nbasis-independent coherence, quantum entanglement, and quantum discord are\ndiscussed by using the relative entropy within a multipartite system.\n",
