To foster the above, Finland has established a framework\nfor the secondary use of health and social data through legislative measures\nand the creation of specialized institutions, which are the first of their kind\nin the world. In this paper, we give an overview of our implementation for\nusing secondary health and social data in a centralized fashion. As a technical\ncontribution, we also address key implementation aspects related to\nimplementing the framework.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computers and Society","Computer Science/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MTssVirFHK-xqgij4kooNMuTSE24BieK_Xn_fzUe8gM","pdfSize":"234955"}
