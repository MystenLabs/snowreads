The initial\nstep involves representing the droplet's shape as a Fourier series.\nSubsequently, the Fourier coefficients are reduced to lower-dimensional vectors\nby using autoencoder models. The exploitation of the domain knowledge of the\ndroplet shapes allows us to map generic droplet shapes to just 2D space in\ncontrast to previous direct methods involving autoencoders that could map it on\nminimum 8D space. This 6D reduction in the dimensionality of the droplet's\ndescription opens new possibilities for applications, such as automated droplet\ngeneration via reinforcement learning, the analysis of droplet shape evolution\ndynamics and the prediction of droplet breakup. Our findings underscore the\nbenefits of incorporating domain knowledge into autoencoder models,\nhighlighting the potential for increased accuracy in various other scientific\ndisciplines.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sEiCpxuOVDy5tCqAXVERuBH8BnwGYlVq4XlkgYqGET4","pdfSize":"6836763"}
