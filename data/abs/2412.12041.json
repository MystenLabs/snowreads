Despite several results enlighting us about their repartition, the set\nof prime numbers is often informally qualified as misterious. In the present\npaper, we introduce a formalism allowing to state a formal conjecture: the set\nof prime numbers is supernatural. Our conjecture has no analog in the existing\nliterature. We explain that this conjecture is expected to be a hard challenge\nfor any kind of intelligence. However it is really natural and even seems very\nclose to be canonical.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bSc6Nf68cGwyTo73fiYW9eunKlVRrQjDuZei7U9fABM","pdfSize":"120430"}
