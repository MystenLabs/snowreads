The proposed model bifurcates\ninto a system of elliptic and hyperbolic equations depending on waveguide\nparameters. The proposed model leads to a stable first-order system of\nequations, distinguishing itself from the canonical nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger\nequation. We have employed the space-time discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin finite\nelement method to discretize the first-order system of equations. We present a\nstability analysis for both the elliptic and hyperbolic systems of equations\nand demonstrate the stability of the proposed model through several numerical\nexamples on space-time meshes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Z3thDyDdE6phjqzSBYb56HIJ2XkoIwG8dIoedUZlQ2s","pdfSize":"22505307"}
