  "abstract": "  The aim of this paper is to discuss several aspects of connections between\nthe p-Laplacian and mathematical models in hydrology. At first we present\nmodels of groundwater flow in phreatic aquifers and models of irrigation and\ndrainage that lead to quasilinear parabolic equations involving the\np-Laplacian. Next, we survey conditions of validity of Strong Maximum Principle\nand Strong Comparison Principle for this type of problems. Finally, we employ\ncomputer fluid dynamics simulations to realistic scenario of fracture networks\nto estimate values of the parameters of constitutive laws governing groundwater\nflow in the context of fractured hard-rock aquifers.\n",
