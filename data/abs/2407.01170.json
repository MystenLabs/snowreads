For nilpotent differential operators acting on these\nbundles, we show that the kernels of induced Hodge-Dirac-type operators remain\nisomorphic under uniform perturbations of the geometric data. We consider\napplications of this to the Hodge-Dirac operator on differential forms induced\nby so-called rough Riemannian metrics, which can be of only measurable\ncoefficient in regularity, on both compact and non-compact settings. As a\nconsequence, we show that the kernel of the associated non-smooth Hodge-Dirac\noperator with respect to a rough Riemannian metric remains isomorphic to smooth\nand singular cohomology when the underlying manifold is compact.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"99DHCO3bf2r7RK9sxB6oKTFqYF1W_7g8R3daCMOooHU","pdfSize":"483800"}
