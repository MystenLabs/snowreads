  "abstract": "  We know that the electric field generated by a plasmonic nano-particle (with\nnegative permittivity) is given as a polarization of the incident electric\nfield. Similarly, the electric field produced by a dielectric nano-particle\n(with positive but high permittivity) is given as a polarization of the\nincident magnetic field. In this work, we demonstrate that a hybrid dimer\ncomposed of two closely coupled nano-particles, one plasmonic and the other\ndielectric can polarize both the incident electric and magnetic fields.\nConsequently, such hybrid dimers have the potential to modify both the electric\npermittivity and magnetic permeability of the surrounding medium. However, this\ndual modification occurs only when the two nano-particles share common resonant\nfrequencies. We derive the asymptotic expansion of the fields generated by\nthese hybrid dimers in the subwavelength regime for incident frequencies near\ntheir shared resonant frequencies.\n",
