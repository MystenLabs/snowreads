  "abstract": "  Long-range correlations are essential across numerous machine learning tasks,\nespecially for data embedded in Euclidean space, where the relative positions\nand orientations of distant components are often critical for accurate\npredictions. Self-attention offers a compelling mechanism for capturing these\nglobal effects, but its quadratic complexity presents a significant practical\nlimitation. This problem is particularly pronounced in computational chemistry,\nwhere the stringent efficiency requirements of machine learning force fields\n(MLFFs) often preclude accurately modeling long-range interactions. To address\nthis, we introduce Euclidean fast attention (EFA), a linear-scaling\nattention-like mechanism designed for Euclidean data, which can be easily\nincorporated into existing model architectures. A core component of EFA are\nnovel Euclidean rotary positional encodings (ERoPE), which enable efficient\nencoding of spatial information while respecting essential physical symmetries.\nWe empirically demonstrate that EFA effectively captures diverse long-range\neffects, enabling EFA-equipped MLFFs to describe challenging chemical\ninteractions for which conventional MLFFs yield incorrect results.\n",
