Although there is a wide variety of introductory books\navailable, there has been no material targeting software engineering students\nparticularly, until now. In this chapter we provide an introduction to teaching\nand learning ethnography for faculty teaching ethnography to software\nengineering graduate students and for the students themselves of such courses.\n  The contents of the chapter focuses on what we think is the core basic\nknowledge for newbies to ethnography as a research method. We complement the\ntext with proposals for exercises, tips for teaching, and pitfalls that we and\nour students have experienced.\n  The chapter is designed to support part of a course on empirical software\nengineering and provides pointers and literature for further reading.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iphEGIxMzV-R2sPFgq60eqOZbuDv7yaxjtN52Xinz68","pdfSize":"321135"}
