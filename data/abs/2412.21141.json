First, we consider duality defects in $V^\\natural$ for all\nnon-anomalous Fricke elements of the Monster group, and provide a general\nformula for the corresponding defect McKay-Thompson series. Furthermore, we\ndescribe some general properties of the category of defect lines preserving the\n$N=1$ superVirasoro algebra in $V^{f\\natural}$. We argue that, under some mild\nassumptions, every such defect in $V^{f\\natural}$ is associated with a\n$\\mathbb{Z}$-linear map form the Leech lattice to itself. This correspondence\nestablishes a surjective (not injective) ring homomorphism between the\nGrothendieck ring of the category of topological defects and the ring of Leech\nlattice endomorphisms. Finally, we speculate about possible generalization of\nthe Moonshine conjectures that include topological defect lines.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ua2tbGR8bXDVLZgsYlSNQYia2USneAUIPx9os6X6Qs0","pdfSize":"1452518"}
