Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) addresses\nthis by perturbing features and measuring their impact on a model's output. In\ntext-based tasks, LIME typically removes present words (bits set to 1) to\nidentify high-impact tokens. We propose \\textbf{Q-LIME $\\pi$} (Quantum LIME\n$\\pi$), a quantum-inspired extension of LIME that encodes a binary feature\nvector in a quantum state, leveraging superposition and interference to explore\nlocal neighborhoods more efficiently. Our method focuses on flipping bits from\n$1 \\rightarrow 0$ to emulate LIME's ``removal'' strategy, and can be extended\nto $0 \\rightarrow 1$ where adding features is relevant. Experiments on subsets\nof the IMDb dataset demonstrate that Q-LIME $\\pi$ often achieves near-identical\ntop-feature rankings compared to classical LIME while exhibiting lower runtime\nin small- to moderate-dimensional feature spaces. This quantum-classical hybrid\napproach thus provides a new pathway for interpretable AI, suggesting that,\nwith further improvements in quantum hardware and methods, quantum parallelism\nmay facilitate more efficient local explanations for high-dimensional data.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TZ9_do8DfuGyFReJCmtOVdXIuyA2Gi_0Xu5knswd4ss","pdfSize":"148662"}
