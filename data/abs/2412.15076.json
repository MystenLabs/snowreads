Identifying\noptimal study designs that achieve sufficient power for drawing proper\nstatistical inferences to detect group level effects with small sample sizes\nhas been challenging. Moreover, average effects derived from traditional\ngroup-level inference do not necessarily apply to individual participants.\nHere, we introduce N-of-1 trials as an innovative study design that can be used\nto draw valid statistical inference about the effects of interventions on\nindividual participants and can be aggregated across multiple study\nparticipants to provide population-level inferences more efficiently than\nstandard group randomized trials. In this manuscript, we introduce the key\ncomponents and design features of N-of-1 trials, describe statistical analysis\nand interpretations of the results, and describe some available digital tools\nto facilitate their use using examples from experimental physiology.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"26plIaSmOu-wT4MUA7TCpbkDkugbokqyp6lh0tE_JAM","pdfSize":"331207"}
