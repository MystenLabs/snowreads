Audio Atlas is designed to facilitate\nthe exploration and analysis of audio datasets using a contrastive embedding\nmodel and a vector database for efficient data management and semantic search.\nThe system maps audio embeddings into a two-dimensional space and leverages\nDeepScatter for dynamic visualization. Designed for extensibility, Audio Atlas\nallows easy integration of new datasets, enabling users to better understand\ntheir audio data and identify both patterns and outliers. We open-source the\ncodebase of Audio Atlas, and provide an initial implementation containing\nvarious audio and music datasets.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Sound","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"teJ880Z79Ql8hefYkniN1EdbK0u5z21j06SARKJpJ3c","pdfSize":"3245757"}
