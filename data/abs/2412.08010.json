However, like many computer software systems,\nthey can fail by generating confusing or erroneous outputs or by deferring to\nhuman operators to interpret the results and make final decisions. In this\npaper, we employ the recently proposed quantum-tunnelling neural networks\n(QT-NNs), inspired by human brain processes, alongside quantum cognition\ntheory, to classify image datasets while emulating human perception and\njudgment. Our findings suggest that the QT-NN model provides compelling\nevidence of its potential to replicate human-like decision-making and\noutperform traditional ML algorithms.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Physics/Physics and Society","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-19orTKHm3yF5_gNsgEnd2zFPEvOLdvrLohNjGWfmJ0","pdfSize":"12282650"}
