We compute the essential dimension\nof the moduli stack of symplectic bundles over $X$. Unlike the case of vector\nbundles, we are able to precisely compute the essential dimension as the\ngeneric gerbe of the moduli stack has period 2 over it's moduli space.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NwZgnJZgIOl1TPF8jO9NkFdV7RnY6uT-omxRrN7gqAU","pdfSize":"663475"}
