One can view our results as saying that the classical\ncharacterizations of $[0,1]$ (e.g., as the unique continuum with exactly two\nnon-cut points, and other similar characterizations), appropriated expressed,\nare the simplest possible characterizations of $[0,1]$. Formally, we show that\nthe set of homeomorphic copies of $[0,1]$ is $\\mathbf{\\Pi}^0_4$-Wadge-complete.\nWe also show that the set of homeomorphic copies of $S^1$ is\n$\\mathbf{\\Pi}^0_4$-Wadge-complete. On the other hand, we show that the set of\nhomeomorphic copies of $\\mathbb{R}$ is $\\mathbf{\\Pi}^1_1$-Wadge-complete. It is\nthe local compactness that cannot be expressed in a Borel way; the set of\nhomeomorphic copies of $\\mathbb{R}$ is $\\mathbf{\\Pi}^0_4$-Wadge-complete within\nthe locally compact spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ujkEIZdhfRZ_N0k619HFvNnfOm7bgQWHa6YKxkSm-gA","pdfSize":"350663"}
