Quantifying the spin-orbit torques in antiferromagnet/heavy metal\nheterostructures is an important first step towards this goal. Here, we employ\nmagneto-optic techniques to study damping-like spin-orbit torque (DL-SOT) in\na-plane $\\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ (hematite) with a Pt spin-orbit overlayer. We find\nthat the DL-SOT efficiency is two orders of magnitude larger than reported in\nc- and r-plane hematite/Pt using harmonic Hall techniques. The large magnitude\nof DL-SOT is supported by direct imaging of current-induced motion of\nantiferromagnetic domains that happens at moderate current densities. Our study\nintroduces a new method for quantifying spin-orbit torque in antiferromagnets\nwith a small canted moment and identifies a-plane $\\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ as a\npromising candidate to realize efficient SOT switching.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"c4wNzySD-MVVGZHRNrpf4g7HADUNCaSWtpgKyP0l2lQ","pdfSize":"1570757"}
