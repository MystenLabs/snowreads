New GrNLS\nfeatures include the existence of nontrivial solutions occupying a single mode,\nthus independent of the truncation, and quasi-periodic tori with and without\nintroducing on-torus invariants. Numerical tests find that instability leads\nsuch solutions to nontrivial longulent states with remarkable solitonic\nlongons, corresponding to presumably whiskered tori. The possibility of\nnontrivially longulent GrCGL states, not proved yet, is discussed for\nmotivation.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gHJHtHqbGn8FQowx5AMSxKfV6ZxKyGhCuh95BZDwC2Q","pdfSize":"7341615"}
