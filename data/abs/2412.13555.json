  "abstract": "  With the increasing complexity of modern software and the demand for high\nperformance, energy consumption has become a critical factor for developers and\nresearchers. While much of the research community is focused on evaluating the\nenergy consumption of machine learning and artificial intelligence systems --\noften implemented in Python -- there is a gap when it comes to tools and\nframeworks for measuring energy usage in other programming languages. C++, in\nparticular, remains a foundational language for a wide range of software\napplications, from game development to parallel programming frameworks, yet\nlacks dedicated energy measurement solutions. To address this, we have\ndeveloped CPPJoules, a tool built on top of Intel-RAPL to measure the energy\nconsumption of C++ code snippets. We have evaluated the tool by measuring the\nenergy consumption of the standard computational tasks from the Rosetta Code\nrepository. The demonstration of the tool is available at\n\\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZXYF3AKzPk} and related artifacts at\n\\url{https://rishalab.github.io/CPPJoules/}.\n",
