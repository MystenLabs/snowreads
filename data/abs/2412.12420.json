In this method, optical\nvariations of AGNs are monitored and CL-AGNs may appear to have a pattern of\nbeing bluer when in brightening flare-like events. Applying this method,\npreviously-classified type 2 AGNs that show the bluer-when-brighter (BWB)\npattern are selected. Among more than ten thousands type 2 AGNs classified in\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we find 73 candidates with possibly the\nstrongest BWB pattern. We note that 13 of them have previously been reported as\nCL-AGNs. We have observed nine candidates, and found that five among them\nshowed the CL transition from type 2 to type 1. In addition, we also test\nextending the selection to previously-classified type 1 AGNs in the SDSS by\nfinding sources with a possible redder-when-brighter pattern, but none of the\nthree sources observed by us is found to show the transition from type 1 to\ntype 2. We discuss the variation properties in both the success and failure\ncases, and plan to observe more candidates selected with the method. From the\nobservational results, a detailed comparison between the CL-AGNs and none\nCL-AGNs will help quantitatively refine the selection criteria and in turn\nallow us to configure the general properties of CLAGNs.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AY_Nu1KUVEYUOpWY7blL7rnPpEW8r5HtA4w5ZWJIt4s","pdfSize":"5279721"}
