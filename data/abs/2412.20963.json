  "abstract": "  The existence of indistinguishable quantum particles provides an explanation\nfor various physical phenomena we observe in nature. We lay out a path for the\nstudy of indistinguishable particles in general probabilistic theories (GPTs)\nvia two frameworks: the traditional GPT framework and the diagrammatic\nframework of process theories. In the first approach we define different types\nof indistinguishable particle by the orbits of symmetric states under\ntransformations. In the diagrammatic approach, we find a decomposition of the\nsymmetrised state space using two key constructions from category theory: the\nbiproduct completion and the Karoubi envelope. In both cases for pairs of\nindistinguishable particles in quantum theory we recover bosons and fermions.\n",
