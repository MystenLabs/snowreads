We point out a new use of these facilities for\nneutrino physics and beyond the Standard Model physics \\emph{using their main\ndetectors}. Muon decays along the main accelerator rings induce an intense,\nhighly collimated beam of neutrinos. As this beam crosses a thin slice of the\nkt-scale detector, it would induce unprecedented numbers of neutrino\ninteractions, with $\\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ events per second for a 10 TeV\n$\\mu^+\\mu^-$ collider. We characterize these events, showing that they are\nhighly energetic and possess a distinct timing signature with a large\ntransverse displacement. We discuss promising applications of these events for\ninstrumentation, electroweak, and beyond-the-Standard Model physics. For\ninstance, we show that a sub-percent measurement of the neutrino-electron\nscattering rate enables new precision measurements of the Weak angle and a\nnovel detection of the neutrino charge radius.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"x3wSn1zr-nxPKOdyTS3kbjbAF1kD0yVLClc2jFKJ1lY","pdfSize":"3499183"}
