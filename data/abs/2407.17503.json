The initial task\nusually involves selecting an appropriate raw dataset that captures the\nintricate aspects of legal texts. Following this, extracting text becomes a\ncomplicated task, as legal documents often have complex structures, footnotes,\nreferences, and unique terminology. The importance of data cleaning is\nmagnified in this context, ensuring that redundant information is eliminated\nwhile maintaining crucial legal details and context. Creating comprehensive yet\nstraightforward annotation guidelines is imperative, as these guidelines serve\nas the road map for maintaining uniformity and addressing the subtle nuances of\nlegal terminology. Another critical aspect is the involvement of legal\nprofessionals in the annotation process. Their expertise is valuable in\nensuring that the data not only remains contextually accurate but also adheres\nto prevailing legal standards and interpretations. This paper provides an\nexpanded view of these challenges and aims to offer a foundational\nunderstanding and guidance for researchers and professionals engaged in legal\ndata annotation projects. In addition, we provide links to our created and\nfine-tuned datasets and language models. These resources are outcomes of our\ndiscussed projects and solutions to challenges faced while working on them.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"N8fbL-phZRpZ7IuIbRYdFbVTBQ5dLfC2bhXiUm_ndu8","pdfSize":"243267","objectId":"0xecbb1c0a572397a0cbebdba6a129e4f6058f8f42f0e27a15dd548a7f4b2a5123","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
