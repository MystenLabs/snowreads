  "abstract": "  We study competitive equilibria in exchange economies when a continuum of\ngoods is conflated into a finite set of commodities. The design of conflation\nchoices affects the allocation of scarce resources among agents, by\nconstraining trading opportunities and shifting competitive pressures. We\ndemonstrate the consequences on relative prices, trading positions, and\nwelfare.\n",
