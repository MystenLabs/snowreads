  "abstract": "  A recent article in J. Chem. Phys. argues that the two algorithms, the\nvelocity-Verlet, and position-Verlet integrators, commonly used in Molecular\nDynamics (MD) simulations, are different \\cite{Ni2024}. But not only are the\ntwo algorithms just different formulations of the same discrete algorithm, but\nso are other simple discrete algorithms used in MD in the natural sciences.\nThey are all reformulations of the discrete algorithm derived by Newton in 1687\nin $\\textit{Proposition I}$ in the very first part of his book $Principia$. The\ndifferent reformulations of Newton's algorithm for discrete dynamics lead to\nidentical discrete dynamics with the same invariances, momentum, angular\nmomentum, and energy as Newton's analytical dynamics. Hundreds of thousands of\nMD simulations with Newton's discrete dynamics have appeared, but unfortunately\nwith many recorded errors for energies, potential energies, temperatures, and\nheat capacities. The public software for MD should be corrected.\n",
