Here, we form a QAD in the integer and fractional QH\nregimes at nominal Landau-level filling factor $\\nu$ = 2, 1, and 2/3 using a\nsubmicron pillar gate with an airbridge connection. After confirming the\nrequired conditions for a fully depleted QAD, we analyze the observed Coulomb\noscillations in terms of the area of the QAD and the effective charge for the\noscillation period in an identical gate voltage range. The area at $\\nu$ = 2/3\nis significantly smaller than that at $\\nu$ = 2 and 1, in qualitative agreement\nwith the previous report. By assuming a constant gate capacitance, the\neffective charge at $\\nu$ = 2/3 is about 2/3 of that at $\\nu$ = 2 and 1. The\nQAD device can be used to capture and emit charges in the unit of 2e/3.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gfW91LFm83mtcz-W7flerJvxh4Q2jzCV2qDQiusBpT8","pdfSize":"645274"}
