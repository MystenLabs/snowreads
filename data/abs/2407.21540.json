A kinematically controlled configuration\nassumes that both joint angles are directly prescribed as phase-shifted\nperiodic input. In another configuration of the robot, only one joint is\nperiodically actuated while the second joint is passively governed by a\nvisco-elastic torsion spring. In our work, we constructed the two\nconfigurations of the wheeled robot and conducted motion experiments under\ndifferent actuation inputs. Analysis of the motion tracking measurements\nreveals a significant amount of wheels' skid, in contrast to the assumptions\nused in standard nonholonomic models. Therefore, we propose modified dynamic\nmodels which include wheels' skid and viscous friction forces, as well as\nrolling resistance. After parameter fitting, these dynamic models reach good\nagreement with the motion measurements, including effects of input's frequency\non the mean speed and net displacement per period. This illustrates the\nimportance of incorporating wheels' skid and friction into the system's model.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YPkPQAxVJAEPlWlkV43QG3lbKRJ2CT7yP28aSF3g_nA","pdfSize":"5335163","objectId":"0x8d25c6375614a802672f3397109fb3dcb5838995efecca8f01c9ae95dc5eb11e","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
