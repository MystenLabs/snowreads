The approach is\nbased on the Visibility Graph (VG) algorithm, and a slightly modified version\nof it, the Horizontal Visibility Graph (HVG), which map a time series into a\ncomplex network. Various network metrics exhibit either an exponential or a\nscale-free behavior, and we find that the evolution of the characteristic decay\nexponents is consistent with variations of the sunspots number along solar\ncycles. During solar minimum, the sunspots number and the solar index time\nseries have characteristic decay exponents that correlate well with the next\nmaximum sunspots number, suggesting that they may be good precursors of the\nintensity of the next solar maximum. Based on this observation, we find that,\nbased on current data, the algorithm predicts a number of 179 sunspots for\ncycle 25. Combining this with the Hathaway function, adjusted to yield such\nmaximum sunspots number, we find that the maximum for solar cycle 25 will occur\nin December 2024/January 2025.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Y70FT94pngxLOl2kFuAVx75RPJX53yvu3W-xjn9UImM","pdfSize":"1899099"}
