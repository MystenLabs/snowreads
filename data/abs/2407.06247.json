Our algorithm derives\nthe semantic contexts from video object proposals which encode the key\nevolution of objects and the relationship among objects over the\nspatio-temporal domain. This semantic contexts are propagated across the video\nto estimate the pairwise contexts between all pairs of local superpixels which\nare integrated into a conditional random field in the form of pairwise\npotentials and infers the per-superpixel semantic labels. The experiments\ndemonstrate that our contexts learning and propagation model effectively\nimproves the robustness of resolving visual ambiguities in semantic video\nobject segmentation compared with the state-of-the-art methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3zE-G8XvK5m4DRynkq_Mvj_3WKDtj-vwATY7VmFQ1Ps","pdfSize":"2309600"}
