  "abstract": "  Eradicating extreme poverty and inequality are the key leverage points to\nachieve the seventeen Sustainable Development goals. Yet, the reduction in\nextreme poverty and inequality are vulnerable to shocks such as the pandemic\nand climate change. We find that that these vulnerabilities emerge from the\ninteraction between individual and institutional mechanisms. Individual\ncharacteristics like risk aversion, attention, and saving propensity can lead\nto sub-optimal diversification and low capital accumulation. These individual\ndrivers are reinforced by institutional mechanisms such as lack of financial\ninclusion, access to technology, and economic segregation, leading to\npersistent inequality and poverty traps. Our experiments demonstrate that\naddressing above factors yields 'double dividend' - reducing poverty and\ninequality within-and-between communities and create positive feedback that can\nwithstand shocks.\n",
