  "abstract": "  This paper focuses on optimality conditions for $C^{1,1}$-smooth optimization\nproblems subject to inequality and equality constraints. By employing the\nconcept of limiting (Mordukhovich) second-order subdifferentials to the\nLagrangian function associated with the problem, we derive new second-order\noptimality conditions for the considered problem. Applications for\nmultiobjective optimization problems are studied as well. These results extend\nand refine existing results in the literature.\n",
