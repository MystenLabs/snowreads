In order to\ncharacterize Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) and Single Electron Sensitive Read\nOutput (SiSeRO) detectors in the soft X-ray region, the X-ray Astronomy and\nObservational Cosmology (XOC) group at Stanford has developed, assembled, and\ncommissioned a 2.5-meter-long X-ray beamline test system. The beamline is\ndesigned to efficiently produce monoenergetic X-ray fluorescence lines in the\n0.3-10 keV energy range and achieve detector temperatures as low as 173 K. We\npresent design and simulation details of the beamline, and discuss the vacuum,\ncooling, and X-ray fluorescence performance achieved. As a workhorse for future\ndetector characterization at Stanford, the XOC beamline will support detector\ndevelopment for a broad range of X-ray astronomy instruments.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KjIS4BJdiI3dKahDWafoCfmxiD7flWXOvd4XujdVE2Q","pdfSize":"43599805"}
