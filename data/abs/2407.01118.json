In\nthis work, we will report the preliminary results of near-infrared sky\nbrightness measurements at Lenghu. Utilizing a wide-field small telescope\nequipped with an InGaAs camera, we have been conducting long-term monitoring of\nnear-infrared sky brightness in the J and H' bands, respectively, since January\n2024. For each image, photometry and astrometry were performed, then sky\nbackground was calibrated by standard stars from the 2MASS catalog. This report\nincludes preliminary results on the sky brightness at zenith in the J and H'\nbands, as well as their variations with solar elevation at Lenghu. Our initial\nresults indicate that the near-infrared sky brightness at Lenghu is comparable\nto that of other world-class sites, and long-term monitoring will be continued.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"F7am9kAZbAdhHmEgJQqtS4idjiue18BKBOCN-KRFmt0","pdfSize":"3897884","objectId":"0xed140e56a89e068fc795856362605f09240cd140d03c9ebf5957627b9613a2f8","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
