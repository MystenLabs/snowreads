  "abstract": "  We consider an infinite-dimensional non-linear operator related to a hard\ncore (HC) model with a countable set $\\mathbb{N}$ of spin values. It is known\nthat finding the fixed points of an infinite-dimensional operator is generally\nimpossible. But we have fully analyzed the fixed points of an\ninfinite-dimensional operator by applying a technique of reducing an\ninfinite-dimensional operator to a two-dimensional operator. The set of\nparameters is divided into subsets $A_{i,j},$ where the index $i$ means the\nnumber of fixed points on the line $y=x$, $j$ means the number of fixed points\noutside of $y=x.$ The number of fixed points can be up to seven, and the\nexplicit form of each fixed point is found.\n",
