We present a method that uses existing data\nfrom computer model simulations to fit a Gaussian process surrogate and use a\nnewly proposed Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique, which we refer to as\nSmoothed Approximate Bayesian Computation to sample sets of parameters that\nyield a desired response, which improves on ``hard-clipped\" versions of ABC. We\nprove that our method converges to the correct distribution (i.e. the posterior\ndistribution of level sets, or probability contours) and give results of our\nmethod on known functions and a dam breach simulation where the relationship\nbetween input parameters and responses of interest is unknown. Two versions of\nS-ABC are offered based on: 1) surrogating an accurately known target model and\n2) surrogating an approximate model, which leads to uncertainty in estimating\nthe level sets. In addition, we show how our method can be extended to multiple\nresponses with an accompanying example. As demonstrated, S-ABC is able to\nestimate a level set accurately without the use of a predefined grid or signed\ndistance function.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NeyGg7ofT6X4VJQ3OOtzJF-7SEIw74VaZ_AsG_nYFTo","pdfSize":"2744431"}
