Among the material ejected, long lived\nradioisotopes, such as 60Fe (iron) and 26Al (aluminum), offer unique signs of\nactive nucleosynthesis in our galaxy. There is a long-standing discrepancy\nbetween the observed 60Fe/26Al ratio by {\\gamma}-ray telescopes and predictions\nfrom supernova models. This discrepancy has been attributed to uncertainties in\nthe nuclear reaction networks producing 60Fe, and one reaction in particular,\nthe neutron-capture on 59Fe. Here we present experimental results that provide\na strong constraint on this reaction. We use these results to show that the\nproduction of 60Fe in massive stars is higher than previously thought, further\nincreasing the discrepancy between observed and predicted 60Fe/26Al ratios. The\npersisting discrepancy can therefore not be attributed to nuclear\nuncertainties, and points to issues in massive-star models.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1xizuX85DnCdhFl7sUiCp0_dW4oyAGt7SH4AIu5S-cU","pdfSize":"1978741"}
