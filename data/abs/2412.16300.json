The formalism relies on flow symmetries\nin astrophysical problems involving expansion, contraction, and center-of-mass\nmotion. The formalism is fully consistent with the upwind constrained transport\nmethod implemented in Athena++ and is accurate to 2nd order in space. Applying\nour implementation to standard magneto-hydrodynamic test cases leads to\nimproved results and higher efficiency, compared to the fixed-grid solutions.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Azg7DWcRViaQj6xAoJlIctLzInNViaNIidAh6AeOVvY","pdfSize":"4576900"}
