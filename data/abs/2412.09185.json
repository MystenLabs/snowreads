  "abstract": "  We show that a uniformly Euclidean metric with isolated singularity on $M^n =\nT^n \\# M_0$, where $4\\leq n\\leq 7$ or $n\\geq 4$, $M_0$ spin, and nonnegative\nscalar curvature on the smooth part is Ricci flat and extends smoothly over the\nsingularity. This confirms Schoen's Conjecture in these cases. The key to the\nproof is to show that the space has nonnegative synthetic Ricci curvature,\ni.e., an $RCD(0, n)$ space. Our result also holds when the singular set\nconsists of a finite union of submanifolds (of possibly different dimensions)\nintersecting transversally under additional assumption on the co-dimension and\nthe location of the singular set.\n",
