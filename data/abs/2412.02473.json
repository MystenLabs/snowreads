In this article, we\npropose synthetic altermagnets, composed of two anisotropic ferromagnetic\nlayers arranged such that the total net magnetization is zero. We investigate\nthe properties of these synthetic altermagnets, focusing on their electronic\nband structures, spin current, Berry curvature, and anomalous Hall\nconductivity. By developing a minimal model for our synthetic altermagnets, we\nexamine the influence of factors such as anisotropic coupling strengths and\nspin-orbit coupling on the physical phenomena altermagnets manifest. Our\nfindings open a new path for the realization of altermagnetic materials\nexperimentally and highlight their potential applications in\nmagneto-electronics, magneto-optics, and spintronics devices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"2bFqzDDp5ttglYIh3Ox4IZ7evrnhkhzjbHwAjtcxdaM","pdfSize":"974663"}
