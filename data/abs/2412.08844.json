In this study, we examine that the zero\nmass limit of the Kerr-MOG black hole is equivalent to a wormhole. Moreover, we\nderive the Kerr-Schild form of the Kerr-MOG black hole through specific\ncoordinate transformations. We further investigate the physical and topological\ncharacteristics of the Kerr-MOG black hole within the framework of modified\ngravity. Our analysis also includes a discussion of the wormhole using\ncylindrical coordinates, which comprises two distinct coordinate patches.\nFurthermore, we extend our analysis to the Kerr-Newman black hole and show that\nthe \\emph{zero mass limit of the Kerr-Newman black hole does not yield a\nwormhole}. However, if we impose an additional criterion such that \\emph{both\nthe mass parameter and the charge parameters are equal to zero}, then the\nKerr-Newman black hole will be a wormhole.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SyyCwChz1zUEDnJKjUPVLdcwKpoG0tDy2wv2NAn_cCk","pdfSize":"200911"}
