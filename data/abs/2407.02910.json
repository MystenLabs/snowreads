In real-world use cases, two problems must be addressed: anomalous\ndata is sparse and the same types of anomalies need to be detected on\npreviously unseen objects. Current anomaly detection approaches can be trained\nwith sparse nominal data, whereas domain generalization approaches enable\ndetecting objects in previously unseen domains. Utilizing those two\nobservations, we introduce the hybrid task of domain generalization on sparse\nclasses. To introduce an accompanying dataset for this task, we present a\nmodification of the well-established MVTec AD dataset by generating three new\ndatasets. In addition to applying existing methods for benchmark, we design two\nembedding-based approaches, Spatial Embedding MLP (SEMLP) and Labeled\nPatchCore. Overall, SEMLP achieves the best performance with an average\nimage-level AUROC of 87.2 % vs. 80.4 % by MIRO. The new and openly available\ndatasets allow for further research to improve industrial anomaly detection.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XRK94BOvPRXIiafHNFhQWTuJXVPfWhcYC5UFNoeGxf8","pdfSize":"9833345"}
