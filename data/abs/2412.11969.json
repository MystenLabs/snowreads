(complex) random variables and $\\{p_{n,\\alpha}\\}_{|\\alpha|\\leq\nn}$ form a basis for $\\mathcal P_n$, the holomorphic polynomials of degree at\nmost $n$ in ${\\mathbb C}^d$. In particular, this includes the setting where\n$\\{p_{n,\\alpha}\\}$ are orthonormal in a space $L^2(e^{-2n Q} \\tau)$, where\n$\\tau$ is a compactly supported Bernstein-Markov measure and $Q$ is a\ncontinuous weight function. Under an optimal moment condition on the random\nvariables $\\{\\xi^{(n)}_{\\alpha}\\}$, in dimension $d=1$ we prove convergence in\nprobability of the zero measure to the weighted equilibrium measure, and in\ndimension $d \\ge 2$ we prove convergence of zero currents.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"M9GX9xpcWEOHLiBYlKRqttDCVBetc1KB8MAmIqdBDU8","pdfSize":"285344"}
