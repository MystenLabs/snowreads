  "abstract": "  Recent observations of neutron stars, combined with causality, thermodynamic\nstability, and nuclear constraints, indicate rapid stiffening of QCD matter at\ndensity slightly above nuclear saturation density ($n_0 \\simeq 0.16\\,{\\rm\nfm}^{-3}$). The evolution of the stiffening is quicker than expected from\npurely nucleonic models with many-body repulsion. Taking into account the quark\nsubstructure of baryons, we argue that the saturation of quarks states occur at\n$\\sim$ 2-3$n_0$, driving the quark matter formation even before baryonic cores\nof the radii $\\sim$0.5 fm spatially overlap. We describe the continuous\ntransitions from hadronic to quark matter are described within a quarkyonic\nmatter model in which gluons are assumed to be confining at density of\ninterest. To obtain analytic insights for the transient regime, we construct an\nideal model of quarkyonic matter, IdylliQ model, in which one can freely switch\nfrom baryonic to quark languages and vice versa.\n",
