Our method\ngenerates difference images by subtracting an over-sampled reference, with\niterative masking to address outlier pixels. We also provide an analytic\ncorrection for small dither offset errors. Microlensing event detection is\nachieved through a three-dimensional matched-filtering technique, optimized\nwith Gaussian kernels to capture varying event durations, and verified through\nsynthetic tests with high recovery rates. Transient photometry is performed via\nPSF fitting on difference images, using Nelder-Mead optimization for sub-pixel\naccuracy. The software, Dazzle, is available as an open-source Python package\nbuilt on widely used libraries, offering accessible tools for the detection and\ncharacterization of transient phenomena in crowded fields.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"v0577jN-I0dRgAkYdReb_FCTW0zhV6JS8b046BFuGKE","pdfSize":"488932"}
