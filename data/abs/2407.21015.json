From a probabilistic\nperspective, we perform stochastic fusion on the Type D ASEP and analyze the\noutcome on generator matrices, limits of drift speed, stationary distributions,\nand Markov self-duality. From an algebraic perspective, we construct a fused\nType D ASEP system from a Casimir element of $U_q(so_6)$, using crystal bases\nto analyze and manipulate various representations of $U_q(so_6)$. We conclude\nthat both approaches produce different processes and therefore the previous\nmethod of arXiv:1908.02359, which analyzed the usual ASEP, does not generalize\nto all finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ebSJ1_fDur_2SBOBhr_1r3VgpF_x_-1tY_e6PPiLxkc","pdfSize":"735695"}
