  "abstract": "  Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has significantly enhanced the capability of\nlarge language models (LLMs) by structuring their reasoning processes. However,\nexisting methods face critical limitations: handcrafted demonstrations require\nextensive human expertise, while trigger phrases are prone to inaccuracies. In\nthis paper, we propose the Zero-shot Uncertainty-based Selection (ZEUS) method,\na novel approach that improves CoT prompting by utilizing uncertainty estimates\nto select effective demonstrations without needing access to model parameters.\nUnlike traditional methods, ZEUS offers high sensitivity in distinguishing\nbetween helpful and ineffective questions, ensuring more precise and reliable\nselection. Our extensive evaluation shows that ZEUS consistently outperforms\nexisting CoT strategies across four challenging reasoning benchmarks,\ndemonstrating its robustness and scalability.\n",
