  "abstract": "  Deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) is an essential process for exploring the\nstructure of visible matter and testing the standard model. At the same time,\nthe theoretical interpretation of DIS measurements depends on QCD factorization\ntheorems whose validity deteriorates at the lower values of $Q^2$ and $W^2$\ntypical of neutrino DIS in accelerator-based oscillation searches. For this\nreason, progress in understanding the origin and limits of QCD factorization is\ninvaluable to the accuracy and precision of predictions for these upcoming\nneutrino experiments. In these short proceedings, we introduce a novel approach\nbased on the quantum entropy associated with continuous distributions in QCD,\nusing it to characterize the limits of factorization theorems relevant for the\ndescription of neutrino DIS. This work suggests an additional avenue for\ndissecting factorization-breaking dynamics through the quantum entropy, which\ncould also play a role in quantum simulations of related systems.\n",
