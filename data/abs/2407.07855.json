In particular, we consider the anti-self-dual Nutku geometry, and\nembed it in the membranes and five-branes of the eleven-dimensional\nsupergravity. We explicitly show that the solutions preserve eight\nsupersymmetries. Upon compactification on a circle, we find fully localized\nintersecting brane systems. We also discuss the T-dual and the decoupling\nlimits of the solutions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VKnZqg9D4c6Gq-_W1K9EqiiUE5JjJsyutUxsig2oydU","pdfSize":"575018"}
