Our\napproach leverages a whole-body model predictive controller in conjunction with\na footstep sequencer to achieve robust locomotion. Simulation results\ndemonstrate effective velocity tracking as well as push and slippage recovery\nabilities. In addition to that, we provide a theoretical sensitivity analysis\nof the footstep sequencing problem to enhance the understanding of the results.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pusRhD96wHc7NDab1A0TCLj6JqbwNYLS34lfoqsmI_I","pdfSize":"2746890"}
