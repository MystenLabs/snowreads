Human organ motions, such as those in the liver, exhibit rhythmic\ncomponents influenced by respiratory and cardiac cycles, making effective laser\nenergy delivery to target lesions while compensating for tumor motion crucial.\nThis research introduces a data-driven method to derive surrogate models of a\nsoft manipulator. These low-dimensional models offer computational efficiency\nwhen integrated into the Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework, while still\ncapturing the manipulator's dynamics with and without control input. Spectral\nSubmanifolds (SSM) theory models the manipulator's autonomous dynamics,\nacknowledging its tendency to reach equilibrium when external forces are\nremoved. Preliminary results show that the MPC controller using the surrogate\nmodel outperforms two other models within the same MPC framework. The\ndata-driven MPC controller also supports a design-agnostic feature, allowing\nthe interchangeability of different soft manipulators within the laser ablation\nsurgery robot system.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-meN8ZUJrDQUqsUs7l9-D8y-hK_2zFb0Z1qg8e_IAz8","pdfSize":"43046666"}
