The isomorphism is constructed as a q-analogue of Oblomkov's\ncyclotomic radial parts map for the rational case. In the appendix, we also\nprove that the spherical cyclotomic DAHA is isomorphic to the image of a\nshifted quantum toroidal algebra under Tsymbaliuk's GKLO homomorphism.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-Bue6oqSZmVaTHEZBsFqqBOAY55EgS_NpTCQlumgpto","pdfSize":"1036569","objectId":"0xb7bb9a79afff349947a740903e95de74dc0c9c5db29f9b3cd236d74a8986abf3","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
