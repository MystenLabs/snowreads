  "abstract": "  To solve MHD problems within the framework of the theory of two-scale mean\nfields, it is important to study the invariants of magnetic lines. Such\ninvariants are constructed on the basis of invariants of classical links, which\nmust satisfy the asymptotic property. We choose the simplest asymptotic\ninvariant $M_3$ of three-component links, which is not expressed in terms of\nthe pairwise linking coefficients of the components. We check the asymptotic\nproperty based only on the combinatorial definition of the invariant and do not\nuse the analytic integral. For simple examples, the proven formula is verified\nby calculation.\n",
