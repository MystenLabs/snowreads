By exploring the correlations between spatially separated qubits, we\nunravel the complex interplay between quantum correlations and decoherence\ninduced by the reservoir. Our findings demonstrate that non-classical\ncorrelations such as quantum consonance, quantum discord, local quantum\nuncertainty, and quantum Fisher information are highly sensitive to the\ncollective regime. These insights identify key parameters for optimizing\nquantum metrology and parameter estimation in systems exposed to environmental\ninteractions. Furthermore, we quantify these quantum correlations in the\ncontext of practical applications such as quantum teleportation, using the two\nmetrics viz. maximal teleportation fidelity and fidelity deviation. This work\nbridges theoretical advancements with real-world applications, offering a\ncomprehensive framework for leveraging quantum resources under the influence of\nenvironmental decoherence.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MeowqBQPUcfrFQxU5WGHUNMLJMsz8yVZk1kzRproFbw","pdfSize":"1245656"}
