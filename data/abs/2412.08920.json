Giving constraints in natural language form\nhas great potential for practical scenarios due to its flexible transfer\ncapability and accessibility. Previous safe RL methods with natural language\nconstraints typically need to design cost functions manually for each\nconstraint, which requires domain expertise and lacks flexibility. In this\npaper, we harness the dual role of text in this task, using it not only to\nprovide constraint but also as a training signal. We introduce the\nTrajectory-level Textual Constraints Translator (TTCT) to replace the manually\ndesigned cost function. Our empirical results demonstrate that TTCT effectively\ncomprehends textual constraint and trajectory, and the policies trained by TTCT\ncan achieve a lower violation rate than the standard cost function. Extra\nstudies are conducted to demonstrate that the TTCT has zero-shot transfer\ncapability to adapt to constraint-shift environments.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-pki4QKNOb-tgLV9NUPQCePZ_wXOHm2h6unx2iC8QIc","pdfSize":"7950059"}
