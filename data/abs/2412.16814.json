  "abstract": "  This paper takes an exploratory approach to examine the use of ChatGPT for\npattern mining. It proposes an eight-step collaborative process that combines\nhuman insight with AI capabilities to extract patterns from known uses. The\npaper offers a practical demonstration of this process by creating a pattern\nlanguage for integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with data sources and\ntools. LLMs, such as ChatGPT, are a new class of AI models that have been\ntrained on large amounts of text, and can create new content, including text,\nimages, or video. The paper also argues for adding affordances of the\nunderlying components as a new element of pattern descriptions. The primary\naudience of the paper includes pattern writers interested in pattern mining\nusing LLMs.\n",
