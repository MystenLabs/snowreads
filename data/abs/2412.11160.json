  "abstract": "  For random walks on graph $\\mathcal{G}$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, the\nmean hitting time $H_j$ from a vertex chosen from the stationary distribution\nto vertex $j$ measures the importance for $j$, while the Kemeny constant\n$\\mathcal{K}$ is the mean hitting time from one vertex to another selected\nrandomly according to the stationary distribution. In this paper, we first\nestablish a connection between the two quantities, representing $\\mathcal{K}$\nin terms of $H_j$ for all vertices. We then develop an efficient algorithm\nestimating $H_j$ for all vertices and \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) in nearly linear time of\n$m$. Moreover, we extend the centrality $H_j$ of a single vertex to $H(S)$ of a\nvertex set $S$, and establish a link between $H(S)$ and some other quantities.\nWe further study the NP-hard problem of selecting a group $S$ of $k\\ll n$\nvertices with minimum $H(S)$, whose objective function is monotonic and\nsupermodular. We finally propose two greedy algorithms approximately solving\nthe problem. The former has an approximation factor\n$(1-\\frac{k}{k-1}\\frac{1}{e})$ and $O(kn^3)$ running time, while the latter\nreturns a $(1-\\frac{k}{k-1}\\frac{1}{e}-\\epsilon)$-approximation solution in\nnearly-linear time of $m$, for any parameter $0<\\epsilon <1$. Extensive\nexperiment results validate the performance of our algorithms.\n",
