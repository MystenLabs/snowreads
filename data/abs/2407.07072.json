But the vital question for many is not if a causal\neffect exists but why and how it exists. Even so, many researchers avoid causal\nmediation analyses due to the assumptions required, instead opting to explore\ncausal mechanisms through what we call intermediate outcome tests. These tests\nuse the same research design used to estimate the effect of treatment on the\noutcome to estimate the effect of the treatment on one or more mediators, with\nauthors often concluding that evidence of the latter is evidence of a causal\nmechanism. We show in this paper that, without further assumptions, this can\nneither establish nor rule out the existence of a causal mechanism. Instead,\nsuch conclusions about the indirect effect of treatment rely on implicit and\nusually very strong assumptions that are often unmet. Thus, such causal\nmechanism tests, though very common in political science, should not be viewed\nas a free lunch but rather should be used judiciously, and researchers should\nexplicitly state and defend the requisite assumptions.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"vCLnTEPCburFH-pbH1QPj2RcLVXuwL1syLtDrTg8-rE","pdfSize":"576858"}
