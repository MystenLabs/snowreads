In the case of the\nrod, the equations reduce to a wave equation with appropriate boundary\nconditions. Using Fourier transforms, the resonant frequencies are found and an\nexplicit distributional solution is given, both for a plus- and a\ncross-polarised gravitational wave. In the case of the spinning ring, the\nequations are coupled wave equations with periodic boundary conditions. Using a\nFourier series expansion, the system of wave equations is recast as a family of\nordinary differential equations for the Fourier coefficients, which are then\nsolved via Fourier transforms. The resonant frequencies are found, including\nsimple approximate expressions for slowly rotating rings, and an explicit\ndistributional solution is obtained in the case of the non-spinning ring.\nInterestingly, it is possible to tune the resonant frequencies by adjusting the\nangular velocity of the spinning ring.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Qx6NI68DJOd3UXx1m3pGix-4MmvKIbIIWeh3gH6_m4o","pdfSize":"511728"}
