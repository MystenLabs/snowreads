  "abstract": "  The current fluctuation in one-dimensional driven diffusive systems is\nreported to have a upper bound that is set by its mean value together with the\ndriving force. The resulting inequality arises from interactions between the\ndiffusive particles, and the bound is approached in near-equilibrium systems or\nfar-from-equilibrium systems with weak interactions between the diffusive\nparticles. Three systems of increasing physical complexity are used to\nillustrate how the inequality is arrived at. The first system consists of only\ntwo reservoirs with particles randomly exchange between them at constant rates.\nFor this system, the bound is shown to be saturated. The second one is the\nsymmetric simple exclusion process, where the inequality is rigorously proven.\nThe third one is the transport of charged particles driven by an external\nelectric field, and numerical studies for this system also support the\nexistence of the inequality.\n",
