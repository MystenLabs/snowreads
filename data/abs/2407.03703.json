The notations $\\mathcal{R}$ and\n$\\mathcal{G}$ denote the Ricci scalar and the Gauss-Bonnet invariant,\nrespectively. Radio pulsars, which are neutron stars with masses greater than\n1.8 times that of the Sun ($M_\\odot$), provide exceptional opportunities for\ndelving into fundamental physics in extraordinary environments unparalleled in\nthe observable universe and surpassing the capabilities of experiments\nconducted on Earth. Through the utilization of both the linear and quadratic\nexpressions of the function { $f(\\mathcal{G}) = \\alpha_1 \\mathcal{G}^2$, where\n$\\alpha_1$ (with dimensional units of [${\\textit length}^6$]) are\nincorporated}, we have achieved an accurate analytical solution for anisotropic\nperfect-fluid spheres in a state of hydrostatic equilibrium. By integrating the\ndimensional parameters $\\alpha_1$ and the compactness factor, defined as\n${\\mathcal C=\\frac{2GM}{Rc^2}}$, we showcase our capacity to encompass and\ndepict all physical characteristics within the stellar structure. We illustrate\nthat the model is capable of producing a stable arrangement encompassing its\nphysical and geometric properties. We illustrate that by utilizing the\nquadratic form of $\\mathcal{G}$ in the $\\mathcal{R}+f(\\mathcal{G})$ framework,\nthe ansatz of Krori-Barua establishes connection between pressure in the radial\ndirection ($p_r$) using semi-analytical methods, pressure in the tangential\ndirection ($p_t$), and density ($\\rho$).\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aqVz0H4bAT37O3IOlKH5psnGS5eq2mz7l3iO9kbaJAE","pdfSize":"1004230"}
