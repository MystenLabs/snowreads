This system is constructed by stacking two-dimensional Chern\ninsulators and hosts Weyl-like points defined in the parameter space $(k_x,\nk_y, z)$, distinct from conventional Weyl points in momentum space $(k_x, k_y,\nk_z)$. The Weyl-semimetal-like phase exhibits characteristics akin to those of\nWeyl semimetals, including linear dispersion near the Weyl-like points,\nnontrivial bulk topology, and the presence of Fermi arcs connecting the\nWeyl-like points. Unlike traditional Weyl semimetals, these features manifest\nin real space rather than momentum space. Additionally, we compute the\nlayer-resolved Floquet Hall conductivity and demonstrate that the positions of\nthe Weyl-like points can be controlled via high-frequency laser pumping.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"40VMbKRaR27tI3TtSbzGqpd2zHOTZ2f_udsTg_--vLo","pdfSize":"1487528"}
