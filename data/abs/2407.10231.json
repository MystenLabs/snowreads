The challenge stems from\nthe trade-offs between source brightness and instrument noise. This work\npresents a probability theory of coincidence detection to address the detection\nlimit in source characterization. We use Bayes' theorem to model instruments as\na noisy communication channel and apply statistical inference to identify the\nminimum detectable coincidence rate. A triplet generation rate of 1-100 Hz is\nrequired for source characterization performed over 1-72 hours using\nsuperconducting nanowire single-photon detectors.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3dnoi-dVff98Ui6p2ME5gt2ZHfxgSho3TZWRNT06-RU","pdfSize":"3597824"}
