This allows us to \"solve\" a set of gauge consistency conditions for\nfamilies of gauge invariant regularisation schemes. We recover several known\nexamples such as dimensional and denominator regularisations, as well as some\nmore general solutions. We also study anomalies in chiral theories in order to\ncarefully describe how our formalism should be properly implemented.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VnnLomYXFJepEQzs9OIy-vEk5bQGcAaqONSYe8thHhI","pdfSize":"242681"}
