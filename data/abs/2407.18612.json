The\nperspective highlights the debate between proponents of using BNM as either an\nexploratory phase or even as the sole phase in the definition of structural\nmodels, and those advocating for SEM as the superior alternative for\nexploratory analysis. The individual strengths and limitations of SEM and BNM\nare recognized, but this exploration evaluates the contention between utilizing\nSEM's robust structural inference capabilities and the dynamic probabilistic\nmodeling offered by BNM. A case study of the work of, \\citet{balaguer_2022} in\na structural model for personal positive youth development (\\textit{PYD}) as a\nfunction of positive parenting (\\textit{PP}) and perception of the climate and\nfunctioning of the school (\\textit{CFS}) is presented. The paper at last\npresents a clear stance on the analytical primacy of SEM in exploratory causal\nanalysis, while acknowledging the potential of BNM in subsequent phases.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"VL2xn6D5MXZcy5p7pGsJ6HOUEaOYkPwu_U6_F92tvGk","pdfSize":"2089812"}
