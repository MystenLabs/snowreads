  "abstract": "  In this work, we apply the DFT+U approach for a detailed ab initio study of\nthe refined structure of the low-temperature phase of magnetite [M. S. Senn et\nal., Nature 481, 173 (2012)]. We compare the electronic properties of this\nstructure and several alternatives with respect to the presence of trimeron\nordering and the bandgap properties. The connection of the trimeron arrangement\nwith site-selective doping of magnetite is discussed. Calculations of the\npolaron hopping energy allow us to make one step forward toward understanding\nthe complex interplay of polaronic and bandgap contributions to electronic\nproperties of the magnetite.\n",
