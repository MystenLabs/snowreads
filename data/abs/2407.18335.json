This study investigates the convergence of cognitive AI and generative\nAI for self-explanation in interactive AI agents such as VERA. From a cognitive\nAI viewpoint, we endow VERA with a functional model of its own design,\nknowledge, and reasoning represented in the Task--Method--Knowledge (TMK)\nlanguage. From the perspective of generative AI, we use ChatGPT, LangChain, and\nChain-of-Thought to answer user questions based on the VERA TMK model. Thus, we\ncombine cognitive and generative AI to generate explanations about how VERA\nworks and produces its answers. The preliminary evaluation of the generation of\nexplanations in VERA on a bank of 66 questions derived from earlier work\nappears promising.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cOi3UXSSnH9lZuDRJSDN6yhAe9u6BYO50rd_EhvtbDc","pdfSize":"892632"}
