We\nintroduce Gummy's Way Out, an interactive tangible narrative experience where\ninteractors eat a gummy bear and help him find his way out of their bodies by\neating various food items. By consuming different things, the interactor either\nhelps or hinders the gummy bear's journey through an imagined Diegetic body\nthat overlaps with their own. Interactors are endowed with the gummy bear's\nwell-being and are also encouraged to reflect on how their actions can impact\ntheir Lived body. We present preliminary results of a user study and design\nconsiderations on how to design for the diegetic body in interactive food based\nnarrative experiences. We recommend leveraging the sensory and emotional\nproperties of food to create a visceral narrative experience.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Y-4Ht5n2YJxfAzlnjVcPxcKvn_p3KPXlWCqvCnCvOG4","pdfSize":"1138234"}
