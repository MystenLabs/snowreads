  "abstract": "  Quantum entanglement, a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics, has become\na powerful tool impacting various areas of physics. In this proceeding, we\ninvestigate the presence of quantum entanglement within the Higgs to ZZ* (HZZ*)\ninteraction at the ATLAS experiment. Utilizing quantum tomography techniques,\nwe extract the complete spin density matrix characterizing the HZZ* interaction\nfrom ATLAS Standard Monte Carlo (MC) HZZ* 4l Run2 samples. We then evaluate the\npresence of quantum entanglement in the system using the derived spin density\nmatrix. Our investigation sheds light on the entanglement properties within the\nHZZ* interaction, which offers valuable insights into its quantum\ncharacteristics.\n",
