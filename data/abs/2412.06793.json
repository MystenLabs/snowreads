  "abstract": "  Designing user-centric mobile applications is increasingly essential in\neducational technology. However, platforms like MIT App Inventor-one of the\nworld's largest educational app development tools-face inherent limitations in\nsupporting modern UI/UX design. This study introduces the Figma-Enhanced App\nDesign (FEAD) Method, a structured framework that integrates Figma's advanced\ndesign tools into MIT App Inventor using an identify-design-implement workflow.\nLeveraging principles such as the 8-point grid system and Gestalt laws of\nperception, the FEAD Method empowers users to address design gaps, creating\nvisually appealing, functional, and accessible applications. A comparative\nevaluation revealed that 61.2% of participants perceived FEAD-enhanced designs\nas on par with professional apps, compared to just 8.2% for baseline designs.\nThese findings highlight the potential of bridging design with development\nplatforms to enhance app creation, offering a scalable framework for students\nto master both functional and aesthetic design principles and excel in shaping\nthe future of user-centric technology.\n",
