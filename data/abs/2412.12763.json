  "abstract": "  At the Seventeenth Marcel Grossman meeting, researchers gathered to discuss\nsignificant advances in the study of ultra-long period sources. Presentations\ncovered key aspects, including emission properties, evolutionary scenarios, and\nmodels for their emission. In this proceeding, we summarize key observational\nbreakthroughs and touch upon the proposed evolutionary pathways and\nstate-of-the-art models that seek to explain these sources. Finally, we outline\nfuture directions, including the potential of ongoing and upcoming surveys,\nimproved detection algorithms, and multiwavelength observations to\nsignificantly expand the known population of these mysterious sources.\n",
