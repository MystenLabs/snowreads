  "abstract": "  Quantum entanglement can be used to extend the baseline of telescope arrays\nin order to increase the spatial resolution. In one proposal by Marchese and\nKok [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 160801 (2023)], identical single photons are shared\nbetween receivers, and interfere with a star photon. In this paper we consider\ntwo outstanding questions: i) what is the precise effect of the low photon\noccupancy of the mode associated with the starlight, and ii) what is the effect\non the achievable resolution of imperfect indistinguishability (or partial\ndistinguishability) between the ground and star photons. We find that the\neffect of distinguishability is relatively mild, but low photon occupancy of\nthe optical mode of the starlight quickly deteriorates the sensitivity of the\ntelescope for higher auxiliary photon numbers.\n",
