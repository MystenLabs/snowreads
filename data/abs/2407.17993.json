Our strategy is\nrather flexible and allows us to get a new and simpler proof of the bounds\nobtained by Bourgain in the case of the quintic nonlinearity, as well as its\nextension to the case of higher order nonlinearities. Our main ingredients are\na combination of integration by parts and classical dispersive estimates.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7muKcrO6DUem_neze-PMQEw8D4pJC4Ppy7HKcyqbROs","pdfSize":"316111"}
