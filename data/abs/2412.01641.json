This paper constructs the first lattice-based linearly homomorphic\nsignature scheme that achieves tight security against existential\nunforgeability under chosen-message attacks (EUF-CMA) in the standard model.\nFurthermore, among existing schemes, the scheme proposed in this paper also\noffers certain advantages in terms of public key size, signature length, and\ncomputational cost.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Cryptography and Security","Computer Science/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8_IVoCZecJQ8SfKmdL0rRaputCIma2Tyxx0ya1UF5fw","pdfSize":"310061"}
