We\nintroduce a bipartite graph $\\mathcal{B}(G)$ on $G$ whose vertex set is the\nunion of two sets $G \\times G$ and $L(G)$, and two vertices $(a, b) \\in G\n\\times G$ and $H \\in L(G)$ are adjacent if $H$ is generated by $a$ and $b$. We\nestablish connections between $\\mathcal{B}(G)$ and the generating graph of $G$.\nWe also discuss about various graph parameters such as independence number,\ndomination number, girth, diameter, matching number, clique number,\nirredundance number, domatic number and minimum size of a vertex cover of\n$\\mathcal{B}(G)$. We obtain relations between $\\mathcal{B}(G)$ and certain\nprobabilities associated to finite groups. We also obtain expressions for\nvarious topological indices of $\\mathcal{B}(G)$. Finally, we realize the\nstructures of $\\mathcal{B}(G)$ for the dihedral groups of order $2p$ and $2p^2$\nand dicyclic groups of order $4p$ and $4p^2$ (where $p$ is any prime) including\ncertain other small order groups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"WSwd6Vpfnuc3IEj2DuyGs9m2SemyM2SfXNcqDl2zJ4g","pdfSize":"292083"}
