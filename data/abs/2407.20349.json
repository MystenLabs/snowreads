A Legendre transformation is a symmetry of the WDVV equations,\nintroduced by Dubrovin. We explicitly compute the results of a Legendre\ntransformation applied to $A_n$- and $B_n$-type multi-parameter rational\nsolutions, relating them to known and new trigonometric solutions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ekejvbqieu3tbPFoPdlE688R4Hrtfu8oVrzZIcygBBE","pdfSize":"270361"}
