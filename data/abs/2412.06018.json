Handling missing data effectively is thus a\ncritical data processing and modeling step. Our formative interviews with\nresearchers working in longitudinal health and behavior passive sensing\nrevealed a recurring theme: most researchers consider imputation a low-priority\nstep in their analysis and inference pipeline, opting to use simple and\noff-the-shelf imputation strategies without comprehensively evaluating its\nimpact on study outcomes. Through this paper, we call attention to the\nimportance of imputation. Using publicly available passive sensing datasets for\ndepression, we show that prioritizing imputation can significantly impact the\nstudy outcomes -- with our proposed imputation strategies resulting in up to\n31% improvement in AUROC to predict depression over the original imputation\nstrategy. We conclude by discussing the challenges and opportunities with\neffective imputation in longitudinal sensing studies.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"a9-98cI6VKHOhvXA-TpURuzotZDxubDeW8isHDbZtOs","pdfSize":"1111672"}
