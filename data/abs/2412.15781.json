  "abstract": "  Let ${\\rm dim}(G)$ and $D(G)$ respectively denote the metric dimension and\nthe distinguishing number of a graph $G$. It is proved that $D(G) \\le {\\rm\ndim}(G)+1$ holds for every connected graph $G$. Among trees, exactly paths and\nstars attain the bound, and among connected unicyclic graphs such graphs are\n$t$-cycles for $t\\in \\{3,4,5\\}$. It is shown that for any $1\\leq n< m$, there\nexists a graph $G$ with $D(G)=n$ and ${\\rm dim}(G)=m$. Using the bound $D(G)\n\\le {\\rm dim}(G)+1$, graphs with $D(G) = n(G)-2$ are classified.\n",
