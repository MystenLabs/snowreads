The GSAR model extends the logistic SAR,\nprobit SAR, and Poisson SAR approaches by offering greater flexibility in\nmodeling spatial dependencies while ensuring computational feasibility.\nFundamentally, theoretical results are established on the convergence,\nefficiency, and consistency of the estimates obtained by the model. In\naddition, it improves the statistical properties of existing methods and\nextends them to new distributions. Simulation samples show the theoretical\nresults and allow a visual comparison with existing methods. An empirical\napplication is made to Republican voting patterns in the United States. The\nGSAR model outperforms standard spatial models by capturing nuanced spatial\nautocorrelation and accommodating regional heterogeneity, leading to more\nrobust inferences. These findings underline the potential of the GSAR model as\nan analytical tool for researchers working with categorical or count data or\nskewed distributions with spatial dependence in diverse domains, such as\npolitical science, epidemiology, and market research. In addition, the R codes\nfor estimating the model are provided, which allows its adaptability in these\nscenarios.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"0DZ48TN66nutPwguXXCDAhoZkl8FFgY5GOn8JWDnT1Q","pdfSize":"5072745"}
