In spite of much effort, it has been\ndifficult to substantially mitigate the effects of this noise or, in many\ncases, to fully understand its physical origin. We propose a method to make\nprogress on both of these issues. When an oscillating field is applied to a\nTLS, stochastic resonance can occur and the noise spectrum is moved to higher\nfrequencies. This shift in the TLS noise spectrum will increase the dephasing\ntimes of the qubits that they influence. Furthermore, the details of this\neffect depend on the physical properties of the noise sources. Thus one can use\nqubit spectroscopy to investigate their physical properties, specifically the\nextent to which the TLS themselves possess quantum coherence. We find that it\nshould be possible to determine the dephasing rate and the energy level\nseparation of the TLS themselves in this way.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QhPhx6LILYxsndoTUHIELP8cn4v8GlAvjNgl-FyI8Vg","pdfSize":"6168893"}
