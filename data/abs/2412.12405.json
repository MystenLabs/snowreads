We consider a unified approach to voluntary survey\ndata analysis under the assumption that the sampling mechanism is ignorable.\nGeneralized entropy calibration is introduced as a unified tool for calibration\nweighting to control the selection bias. We first establish the relationship\nbetween the generalized calibration weighting and its dual expression for\nregression estimation. The dual relationship is critical in identifying the\nimplied regression model and developing model selection for calibration\nweighting. Also, if a linear regression model for an important study variable\nis available, then two-step calibration method can be used to smooth the final\nweights and achieve the statistical efficiency. Asymptotic properties of the\nproposed estimator are investigated. Results from a limited simulation study\nare also presented.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"T41qdrrnTFFP7nPQI-CWH4YJTy1zDoxbT6Oea9dLhfA","pdfSize":"353829"}
