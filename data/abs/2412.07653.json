This framework\nis only build on several fundamental facts in quantum mechanics, while\nproviding a rigorous and systematic theory for statistics independent to\ntopological order and field theory. Additionally, we propose several\nconjectures that may hold mathematical interest. We also present a computer\nprogram for computing statistics, which has yielded results consistent with\ntraditional physical theories.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Pr6XJN0wO-30ZfRrv2elN7aLSMSLqv3edYuawPi8Gco","pdfSize":"879487"}
