We focus on $\\mu\\tau$ LFV\ninteractions and assume that the ALP is coupled to a dark state $\\chi$, which\ncan be either less or more massive than $a$. Such a setup is demonstrated to be\nconsistent with $\\chi$ being a candidate for dark matter, in the experimentally\nrelevant regime of parameters. We consider the currently operating NA64-$\\mu$\nexperiment and proposed FASER$\\nu$2 detector as both the target and the\ndetector for the process $\\mu A \\to \\tau A\\, a$, where $A$ is the target\nnucleus. We also show that a possible future active muon fixed-target\nexperiment operating at a 3 TeV muon collider or in its preparatory phase can\nprovide an impressive reach for the LFV process considered, with future\nFASER$\\nu$2 data providing a pilot study towards that goal. The implications of\nthe muon anomalous magnetic moment $(g-2)_\\mu$ measurements for the underlying\nmodel, in case of a positive signal, are also examined, and a sample UV\ncompletion is outlined.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hJr0u3IG-3FFrijZQwHkQylMortA8kBCjs5j9R_OleM","pdfSize":"1443663"}
