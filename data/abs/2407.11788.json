The main difficulty stems from the mixed nature of the problem,\ndiscrete search together with continuous trajectory optimization. To speed up\nthe discrete search problem, we propose in this paper to learn the properties\nof transitions from one contact mode to the next. In particular, we learn a\nfeasibility classifier and an offset network; the former predicts if a\npotential next contact state is feasible from the current contact state, while\nthe latter learns to compensate for misalignment in achieving a desired contact\nstate due to imperfections of the low-level control. We integrate these learned\nnetworks in a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) contact planner to better prune\nthe tree and improve the heuristic. Our simulation results demonstrate that\ntraining these networks with offline data significantly speeds up the online\nsearch process and improves its accuracy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oVxO8vW2O8xFEe9L4YnV2Px1TIC8fhJ8RKGK22yguco","pdfSize":"4537710"}
