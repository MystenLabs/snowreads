  "abstract": "  We compute the Hilbert series of the space of $n=3$ variable quasi-invariant\npolynomials in characteristic $2$ and $3,$ capturing the dimension of the\nhomogeneous components of the space, and explicitly describe the generators in\nthe characteristic $2$ case. In doing so we extend the work of the first author\nin 2023 on quasi-invariant polynomials in characteristic $p>n$ and prove that a\nsufficient condition found by Ren-Xu in 2020 on when the Hilbert series differs\nbetween characteristic $0$ and $p$ is also necessary for $n=3,p=2,3$. This is\nthe first description of quasi-invariant polynomials in the case where the\nspace forms a modular representation over the symmetric group, bringing us\ncloser to describing the quasi-invariant polynomials in all characteristics and\nnumbers of variables.\n",
