  "abstract": "  Natural language explanations (NLEs) are commonly used to provide plausible\nfree-text explanations of a model's reasoning about its predictions. However,\nrecent work has questioned their faithfulness, as they may not accurately\nreflect the model's internal reasoning process regarding its predicted answer.\nIn contrast, highlight explanations--input fragments critical for the model's\npredicted answers--exhibit measurable faithfulness. Building on this\nfoundation, we propose G-Tex, a Graph-Guided Textual Explanation Generation\nframework designed to enhance the faithfulness of NLEs. Specifically, highlight\nexplanations are first extracted as faithful cues reflecting the model's\nreasoning logic toward answer prediction. They are subsequently encoded through\na graph neural network layer to guide the NLE generation, which aligns the\ngenerated explanations with the model's underlying reasoning toward the\npredicted answer. Experiments on T5 and BART using three reasoning datasets\nshow that G-Tex improves NLE faithfulness by up to 12.18% compared to baseline\nmethods. Additionally, G-Tex generates NLEs with greater semantic and lexical\nsimilarity to human-written ones. Human evaluations show that G-Tex can\ndecrease redundant content and enhance the overall quality of NLEs. Our work\npresents a novel method for explicitly guiding NLE generation to enhance\nfaithfulness, serving as a foundation for addressing broader criteria in NLE\nand generated text.\n",
