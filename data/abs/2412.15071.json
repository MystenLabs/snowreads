In the Ising model, the\nspins assume only two values, $\\sigma = \\pm 1$, and interact through\nferromagnetic coupling $J$. The network is characterized by four variable\nparameters: $\\alpha$ denotes the degree distribution exponent, the minimum\ndegree $k_0$, the maximum degree $k_m$, and the $p_r$ represents the\nassortativity or disassortativity of the network. To investigate the effect of\ndegree correlations on the critical behavior of the system, we fix $k_0=4$,\n$k_m=10$, and $\\alpha=1$, and vary $p_r$ to obtain an assortative mixing of\nedges. As result, we have calculated the phase transition points of the system,\nand the critical exponents related to magnetization $\\beta$, magnetic\nsusceptibility $\\gamma$, and the correlation length $\\nu$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"icoriePv6vhr6tfuASGDKQpZw4YK06Dz88IoasOGh5Y","pdfSize":"717274"}
