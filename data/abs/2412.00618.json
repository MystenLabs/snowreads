  "abstract": "  We introduce an attention-based fermionic neural network (FNN) to\nvariationally solve the problem of two-dimensional Coulomb electron gas in\nmagnetic fields, a canonical platform for fractional quantum Hall (FQH)\nliquids, Wigner crystals and other unconventional electron states. Working\ndirectly with the full Hilbert space of $N$ electrons confined to a disk, our\nFNN consistently attains energies lower than LL-projected exact diagonalization\n(ED) and learns the ground state wavefunction to high accuracy. In low LL\nmixing regime, our FNN reveals microscopic features in the short-distance\nbehavior of FQH wavefunction beyond the Laughlin ansatz. For moderate and\nstrong LL mixing parameters, the FNN outperforms ED significantly. Moreover, a\nphase transition from FQH liquid to a crystal state is found at strong LL\nmixing. Our study demonstrates unprecedented power and universality of FNN\nbased variational method for solving strong-coupling many-body problems with\ntopological order and electron fractionalization.\n",
