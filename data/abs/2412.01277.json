The Action Dependency Graph (ADG)\nframework offers a way to ensure correct action execution by establishing\nprecedence-based dependencies between wait and move actions retrieved from a\nMAPF planning result. The original construction algorithm is not only\ninefficient, with a quadratic worst-case time complexity it also results in a\nnetwork with many redundant dependencies between actions. This paper introduces\ntwo key improvements to the ADG framework. First, we prove that wait actions\nare generally redundant and show that removing them can lead to faster overall\nplan execution on real robot systems. Second, we propose an optimized ADG\nconstruction algorithm, termed Sparse Candidate Partitioning (SCP), which skips\nunnecessary dependencies and lowers the time complexity to quasi-linear,\nthereby significantly improving construction speed.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Multiagent Systems","Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1AEJAL7ENe1p77iqdiIgIThptoJc1qmC4YFkCjEeSXw","pdfSize":"1146276"}
