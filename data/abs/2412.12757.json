Data-driven surrogate models\nusing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown promise but are\nconstrained to regular Cartesian grids and struggle with unstructured meshes\nnecessary for accurately modeling complex geological features in subsurface\nsimulations.\n  To tackle this difficulty, we build surrogate models based on Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) to approximate space-time solutions of multi-phase flow and\ntransport processes. Particularly, a novel Graph U-Net framework, referred to\nas AMG-GU, is developed to enable hierarchical graph learning for the parabolic\npressure component of the coupled partial differential equation (PDE) system.\nDrawing inspiration from aggregation-type Algebraic Multigrid (AMG), we propose\na graph coarsening strategy adapted to heterogeneous PDE coefficients,\nachieving an effective graph pooling operation.\n  Results of three-dimensional heterogeneous test cases demonstrate that the\nmulti-level surrogates predict pressure and saturation dynamics with high\naccuracy, significantly outperforming the single-level baseline. Our Graph\nU-Net model exhibits great generalization capability to unseen model\nconfigurations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"ptwfhhHr0eSOYv3Z8kg2i3V0B2ohffnYT1hiUrJMcbg","pdfSize":"10087872"}
