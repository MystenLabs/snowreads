We\nexperimented with a combination of large language models, including Qwen,\nMistral, and Gemma-2, and leveraged pre-processing and sequential learning for\nnot only identifying fraudulent financial content but also generating coherent,\nand concise explanations that clarify the rationale behind the classifications.\nOur approach achieved competitive results with an F1-score of 0.8283 for\nclassification, and ROUGE-1 of 0.7253 for explanations. This work highlights\nthe transformative potential of LLMs in financial applications, offering\ninsights into their capabilities for combating misinformation and enhancing\ntransparency while identifying areas for future improvement in robustness and\ndomain adaptation.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computer Science/Machine Learning","Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"4P6MApx26AB1y_Ipjwjr5NkF6XWK_KXlNn4aP0NQOII","pdfSize":"627425"}
