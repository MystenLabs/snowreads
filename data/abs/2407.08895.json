However, our studies have revealed a\ndiscrepancy between practitioners' understanding of 'AI/ML bias' and the\ndefinitions of tech companies and researchers. This indicates a misalignment\nthat needs addressing. Efforts should be made to match practitioners'\nunderstanding of AI/ML bias with the definitions developed by tech companies\nand researchers. These efforts could yield a significant return on investment\nby aiding AI/ML practitioners in developing unbiased AI/ML systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"IUbiTDpqX7duiF3fDsm2JRxOB9OHCigEs3KGr9OL37I","pdfSize":"161041"}
