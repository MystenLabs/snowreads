  "abstract": "  In two dimensions, Hermitian lattices with non-zero Chern numbers and\nnon-Hermitian lattices with a higher-order skin effect (HOSE) bypass the\nconstraints of the Nielsen-Ninomiya \"no-go\" theorem at their one-dimensional\nboundaries. This allows the realization of topologically protected\none-dimensional edge states with nonreciprocal dynamics. However, unlike the\nedge states of Chern insulators, the nonreciprocal edges of HOSE phases exist\nonly at certain edges of the two-dimensional lattice, not all, leading to\ncorner-localized states. In this work, we investigate the topological\nconnections between these two systems and uncover novel non-Hermitian\ntopological phases possessing \"higher-order topological knots\" (HOTKs). These\nphases arise from multiband topology protected by crystalline symmetries and\nhost point-gap-protected nonreciprocal edge states that circulate around the\nentire boundary of the two-dimensional lattice. We show that phase transitions\ntypically separate HOTK phases from \"Complex Chern insulator\" phases\n--non-Hermitian lattices with nonzero Chern numbers protected by imaginary line\ngaps in the presence of time-reversal symmetry.\n",
