We\ncompare predictions of a recently developed constitutive equation for\ndisentanglement to molecular dynamics simulations of both united-atom\npolyethylene and Kremer-Grest models for polymers in shear and extensional\nflow. We confirm that entanglements recover on the retraction timescale, rather\nthan the reptation timescale. We find that the convective constraint release\nparameter $\\beta$ is independent of molecular weight, but that it increases\nwith the ratio of Kuhn length $b_K$ to packing length $p$ as $\\beta\\sim\n(b_K/p)^\\alpha$, with an exponent $\\alpha=1.9$, which may suggest that\ndisentanglement rate correlates with an increase in the tube diameter. These\nresults may help shed light on which polymers are more likely to undergo shear\nbanding.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tNtknJwIipGLroIUTBjVrF3q0MCMSrhL7-e2SS-E4so","pdfSize":"717179"}
