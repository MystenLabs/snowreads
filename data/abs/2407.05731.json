We employ a\nmodeling method to determine the effective magnetic field induced by the spin\ntexture, thereby circumventing the computational challenges associated with\nsuperlattice calculations. Based on these results, we construct a Wannier\ntight-binding Hamiltonian to characterize the electronic states and calculate\nthe Hall conductivity. Applying this approach to the skyrmion material $\\rm\nGd_2PdSi_3$ shows good agreement with experimental data. Our analysis in\nmomentum space further reveals that the dominant contribution to the THE arises\nfrom the crossing points between the folded bands along high-symmetry lines in\nthe Brillouin zone. This work advances numerical techniques for simulating\ngeneral magnetic system, examplified by but not restricted to skyrmion lattice,\nand its result offering insights into the complex interplay between spin\ntextures and electronic transport.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4uT8o0GFADK0Uyg2roy5heRNdMx-5AqcVSLN6K268_w","pdfSize":"5990657"}
