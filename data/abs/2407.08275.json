Given the sheer volume of available\noptions, identifying clusters of similar models streamlines this model\nselection process. Relying solely on benchmark performance scores only allows\nfor a weak assessment of model similarity. Thus, in this study, we evaluate the\nsimilarity of embedding models within the context of RAG systems. Our\nassessment is two-fold: We use Centered Kernel Alignment to compare embeddings\non a pair-wise level. Additionally, as it is especially pertinent to RAG\nsystems, we evaluate the similarity of retrieval results between these models\nusing Jaccard and rank similarity. We compare different families of embedding\nmodels, including proprietary ones, across five datasets from the popular\nBenchmark Information Retrieval (BEIR). Through our experiments we identify\nclusters of models corresponding to model families, but interestingly, also\nsome inter-family clusters. Furthermore, our analysis of top-k retrieval\nsimilarity reveals high-variance at low k values. We also identify possible\nopen-source alternatives to proprietary models, with Mistral exhibiting the\nhighest similarity to OpenAI models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YISwxSgKQ-bt13IyKJWFeDVpRKW2la1o2oCwLDC_Q9c","pdfSize":"1593972"}
