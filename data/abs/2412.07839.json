  "abstract": "  We study the potential of symbolic regression (SR) to derive compact and\nprecise analytic expressions that can improve the accuracy and simplicity of\nphenomenological analyses at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). As a benchmark,\nwe apply SR to equation recovery in quantum electrodynamics (QED), where\nestablished analytical results from quantum field theory provide a reliable\nframework for evaluation. This benchmark serves to validate the performance and\nreliability of SR before extending its application to structure functions in\nthe Drell-Yan process mediated by virtual photons, which lack analytic\nrepresentations from first principles. By combining the simplicity of analytic\nexpressions with the predictive power of machine learning techniques, SR offers\na useful tool for facilitating phenomenological analyses in high energy\nphysics.\n",
