Most of the existing methods for comparing topology are based\non Wasserstein distance between persistence barcodes and they don't take into\naccount the localization of topological features. The minimization of SFTD\nensures that the corresponding topological features of scalar functions are\nlocated in the same places. The proposed tool provides useful visualizations\ndepicting areas where functions have topological dissimilarities. We provide\napplications of the proposed method to 3D computer vision. In particular,\nexperiments demonstrate that SFTD as an additional loss improves the\nreconstruction of cellular 3D shapes from 2D fluorescence microscopy images,\nand helps to identify topological errors in 3D segmentation. Additionally, we\nshow that SFTD outperforms Betti matching loss in 2D segmentation problems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Co5xo64sd__-HNYncsSPOUCCV-Tja3xaPo7i8ksPT7A","pdfSize":"6005560","objectId":"0xe32ff47106b73fda686aa47ff815c2913f1f63ffe652dfe0036b2eb8ab964344","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
