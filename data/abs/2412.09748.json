However, in order for nominal attributes to be\nclustered, their values must be properly encoded. In the encoding process,\nnominal attributes obtain a new representation in numerical form. Only the\nnumeric attributes can be subjected to factor analysis, which allows them to be\nclustered in terms of their similarity to factors. The proposed method was\ntested for several sample datasets. It was found that the proposed method is\nuniversal. On the one hand, the method allows clustering of numerical\nattributes. On the other hand, it provides the ability to cluster nominal\nattributes. It also allows simultaneous clustering of numerical attributes and\nnumerically encoded nominal attributes.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kJxtBW7XrOlO9E29xgZTD4SuJGzo3ZG2NcdCB5gypVc","pdfSize":"1514764"}
