Traditional\nphysics-based optimization methods for these parameters can be slow,\nlabor-intensive, and costly, as they require physical manufacturing and\ntesting. Here, we introduce a first step in extending Polymer Informatics, an\nAI-based approach proven effective for neat polymer design, into the realm of\npolymer composites. We curate a comprehensive database of commercially\navailable polymer composites, develop a scheme for machine-readable data\nrepresentation, and train machine-learning models for 15 flame-resistant,\nmechanical, thermal, and electrical properties, validating them on entirely\nunseen data. Future advancements are planned to drive the AI-assisted design of\nfunctional and sustainable polymer composites.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"v_SzGaTaekoiNb2Rfdb96LOkuc25nLr-p3xC3ceHi2Y","pdfSize":"2492841"}
