  "abstract": "  Let $D$ be a simple derivation of the polynomial ring\n$\\mathbb{k}[x_1,\\dots,x_n]$, where $\\mathbb{k}$ is an algebraically closed\nfield of characteristic zero, and denote by\n$\\operatorname{Aut}(D)\\subset\\operatorname{Aut}(\\mathbb{k}[x_1,\\dots,x_n])$ the\nsubgroup of $\\mathbb{k}$-automorphisms commuting with $D$. We show that the\nconnected component of $\\operatorname{Aut}(D)$ passing through the identity is\na unipotent algebraic group of dimension at most $n-2$, this bound being sharp.\nMoreover, $\\operatorname{Aut}(D)$ is an algebraic group if and only if it is a\nconnected ind-group. Given a simple derivation $D$, we characterize when\n$\\operatorname{Aut}(D)$ contains a normal subgroup of translations. As an\napplication of our techniques we show that if $n=3$, then either\n$\\operatorname{Aut}(D)$ is a discrete group or it is isomorphic to the additive\ngroup acting by translations, and give some insight on the case $n=4$.\n",
