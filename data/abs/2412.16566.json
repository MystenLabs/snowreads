We present Carbonyl4, an innovative algorithm designed\nspecifically for SIM data streams, ensuring accuracy, unbiasedness, and\nadaptability. Carbonyl4 introduces two pioneering techniques: the Balance\nBucket for refined variance optimization, and the Cascading Overflow for\nmaintaining precision amidst overflow scenarios. Our experiments across four\ndiverse datasets establish Carbonyl4's supremacy over existing algorithms,\nparticularly in terms of accuracy for item-level information retrieval and\nadaptability to fluctuating memory requirements. The versatility of Carbonyl4\nis further demonstrated through its dynamic memory shrinking capability,\nachieved via a re-sampling and a heuristic approach. The source codes of\nCarbonyl4 are available at GitHub.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DLgL5oHuhxQgPLwb_TuXFMIk-L9fPtrEamYHb0GOndk","pdfSize":"1381827"}
