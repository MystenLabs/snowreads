  "abstract": "  With the rise of simulation-based inference (SBI) methods, simulations need\nto be fast as well as realistic. $\\texttt{UFig v1}$ is a public Python package\nthat generates simulated astronomical images with exceptional speed - taking\napproximately the same time as source extraction. This makes it particularly\nwell-suited for simulation-based inference (SBI) methods where computational\nefficiency is crucial. To render an image, $\\texttt{UFig}$ requires a galaxy\ncatalog and a description of the point spread function (PSF). It can also add\nbackground noise, sample stars using the Besan\\c{c}on model of the Milky Way,\nand run $\\texttt{SExtractor}$ to extract sources from the rendered image. The\nextracted sources can be matched to the intrinsic catalog, flagged based on\n$\\texttt{SExtractor}$ output and survey masks, and emulators can be used to\nbypass the image simulation and extraction steps. A first version of\n$\\texttt{UFig}$ was presented in Berg\\'e et al. (2013) and the software has\nsince been used and further developed in a variety of forward modelling\napplications.\n",
