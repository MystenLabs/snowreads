In this article, we discuss the experimental\nobservables and state-of-the-art theoretical calculations that characterize and\nexplain the shell evolution leading to new magic numbers. Particular focus\nshall be afforded to the experimental progress of the shell migration study at\nand beyond N = 32, 34 in Ar, K, Ca, and Sc isotopes at the RIBF using direct\nreactions with liquid hydrogen targets over the past ten years. The results\nprove the double magicity of \\ts{52,54}Ca, and support the persistence of the N\n= 34 subshell closure below Z = 20 with a sharp weakening beyond Z = 20. Future\nmeasurements of intruder bands of N = 32, 34 nuclei and shell evolution towards\nN = 40 are discussed within the context of an upgraded RIBF facility and the\ndevelopment of novel detection systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zEYRHQRB-x00wHwa9SjNaIZ8Tz9-CQEsIYF1jORHUdQ","pdfSize":"1548394"}
