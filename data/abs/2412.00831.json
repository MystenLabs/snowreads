  "abstract": "  Augmented reality display performance depends strongly on features of the\nhuman visual system. This is especially true for retinal scan glasses, which\nuse laser beam scanning and transparent holographic optical combiners.\nHuman-centered approaches allow us to go beyond conventional optical metrology\nand evaluate display performance as it is perceived in actual augmented reality\nuse cases. Here, we first present a theoretical formula for the retinal scan\nluminance and ambient contrast ratio calculated from optical powers,\nwavelengths, field of view, and human pupil diameter. As a promising insight we\nfound that the pupil diameter dependence is beneficial in assimilating the\nvirtual image luminance to the ambient luminance. Second, we designed and\nperformed a psychophysical experiment to assess perceived resolution in\naugmented reality settings using a fully functional retinal scan glasses\nprototype. We present the results of the trials and illustrate how this\napproach can be useful in the further development of augmented reality smart\nglasses.\n",
