  "abstract": "  The first generation of transiting planet searches in globular clusters\nyielded no detections, and in hindsight, only placed occurrence rate limits\nslightly higher than the measured occurrence rate in the higher-metallicity\nGalactic thick disk. To improve these limits, we present the first results of a\nnew wide field search for transiting hot Jupiters in the globular cluster\n47~Tucanae. We have observed 47~Tuc as part of the Multiband Imaging Survey for\nHigh-Alpha Planets (MISHAPS). Using 24 partial and full nights of observations\ntaken with the Dark Energy Camera on the 4-m Blanco telescope at CTIO, we\nperform a search on 19,930 stars in the outer regions of the cluster. Though we\nfind no clear planet detections, by combining our result with the upper limit\nenabled by Gilliland et al.'s 2000 Hubble search for planets around an\nindependent sample of 34,091 stars in the inner cluster, we place the strongest\nlimit to date on hot Jupiters with periods of $0.8 \\leq P \\leq 8.3$ days and\n$0.5~R_{\\rm Jup} \\leq R_{\\rm P} \\leq 2.0~R_{\\rm Jup}$ of $f_{\\rm HJ} < 0.11\\%$,\na factor of ${\\sim}$4 below the occurrence rate in the \\textit{Kepler} field.\nOur search found 35 transiting planet candidates, though we are ultimately able\nto rule out each without follow-up observations. We also found 4 eclipsing\nbinaries, including 3 previously-uncataloged detached eclipsing binary stars.\n",
