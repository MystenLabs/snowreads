  "abstract": "  Despite decades of effort, understanding the shape of genome space in biology\nremains a challenge due to the similarity, variability, diversity, and\nplasticity of evolutionary relationships among species, genes, or other\nbiological entities. We present a k-mer topology method, the first of its kind,\nto delineate the shape of the genome space. K-mer topology examines the\ntopological persistence and the evolution of the homotopic shape of the\nsequences of k nucleotides in species, organisms, and genes using persistent\nLaplacians, a new multiscale combinatorial approach. We also propose a\ntopological genetic distance between species by their topological invariants\nand non-harmonic spectra over scales. This new metric defines the topological\nphylogenetic trees of genomes, facilitating species classification and\nclustering. K-mer topology substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods\non a variety of benchmark datasets, including mammalian mitochondrial genomes,\nRhinovirus, SARS-CoV-2 variants, Ebola virus, Hepatitis E virus, Influenza\nhemagglutinin genes, and whole bacterial genomes. K-mer topology reveals the\nintrinsic shapes of the genome space and can be directly applied to the\nrational design of viral vaccines.\n",
