This\nallows models to develop a comprehensive understanding of the 3D scene,\nenabling their applicability to a broader range of areas, such as autonomous\nnavigation, robotics, and AR/VR. While large multi-modal models (LMMs) have\nachieved remarkable progress in a wide range of image and video understanding\ntasks, their capabilities to perform 3D spatial reasoning on diverse natural\nimages are less studied. In this work we present the first comprehensive 3D\nspatial reasoning benchmark, 3DSRBench, with 2,772 manually annotated visual\nquestion-answer pairs across 12 question types. We conduct robust and thorough\nevaluation of 3D spatial reasoning capabilities by balancing the data\ndistribution and adopting a novel FlipEval strategy. To further study the\nrobustness of 3D spatial reasoning w.r.t. camera 3D viewpoints, our 3DSRBench\nincludes two subsets with 3D spatial reasoning questions on paired images with\ncommon and uncommon viewpoints. We benchmark a wide range of open-sourced and\nproprietary LMMs, uncovering their limitations in various aspects of 3D\nawareness, such as height, orientation, location, and multi-object reasoning,\nas well as their degraded performance on images with uncommon camera\nviewpoints. Our 3DSRBench provide valuable findings and insights about the\nfuture development of LMMs with strong 3D reasoning capabilities.
