However, the\ncomputational demands of physics-based algorithms used in operational systems\nlimits the volume and diversity of observations that are assimilated. Here, we\npresent \"EarthNet\", a multi-modal foundation model for data assimilation that\nlearns to predict a global gap-filled atmospheric state solely from satellite\nobservations. EarthNet is trained as a masked autoencoder that ingests a 12\nhour sequence of observations and learns to fill missing data from other\nsensors. We show that EarthNet performs a form of data assimilation producing a\nglobal 0.16 degree reanalysis dataset of 3D atmospheric temperature and\nhumidity at a fraction of the time compared to operational systems. It is shown\nthat the resulting reanalysis dataset reproduces climatology by evaluating a 1\nhour forecast background state against observations. We also show that our 3D\nhumidity predictions outperform MERRA-2 and ERA5 reanalyses by 10% to 60%\nbetween the middle troposphere and lower stratosphere (5 to 20 km altitude) and\nour 3D temperature and humidity are statistically equivalent to the Microwave\nintegrated Retrieval System (MiRS) observations at nearly every level of the\natmosphere. Our results indicate significant promise in using EarthNet for\nhigh-frequency data assimilation and global weather forecasting.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"k1kN8wX0CHwzMSXDnXkt9IsUAS8yceQ1SgyMW-n7W60","pdfSize":"15648885"}
