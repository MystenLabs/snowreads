To address these\nissues, we propose two approaches: a feature-based method using machine\nlearning to improve performance on structured inputs, and a novel context-aware\nframework that considers the broader context and semantic relationships between\nthe original text and generalized candidates. The context-aware approach\nemploys Multilingual-BERT for text representation, functional transformations,\nand mean squared error scoring to evaluate candidates. Experiments on the\nWikiReplace dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of both methods, with the\ncontext-aware approach outperforming the feature-based one across different\nscales. This work contributes to advancing PII generalization techniques by\nhighlighting the importance of feature selection, ensemble learning, and\nincorporating contextual information for better privacy protection in text\nanonymization.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"dwHVK1_P4yA1oxUmm_wreojHiX82B9sxw1HFPWzem9g","pdfSize":"1622454"}
