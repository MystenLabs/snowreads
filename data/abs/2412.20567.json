A Gaussian window leads to a Fock space of\nentire functions, studied in the companion paper by the same authors\n[\\emph{Beurling-type density theorems for sampling and interpolation on the\nflat cylinder}]. When $g$ is a Hermite function, we are lead to true Fock\nspaces of polyanalytic functions (Landau Level eigenspaces) on the vertical\nstrip $[0,1)\\times{R}$. Furthermore, an analogue of the sufficient Wexler-Raz\nconditions is obtained. This leads to a new criteria for Gabor frames in\n$L^{2}({R})$, to sufficient conditions for Gabor frames in $L_{\\nu }^{2}(0,1)$\nwith Hermite windows (an analogue of a theorem of Gr\\\"{o}chenig and Lyubarskii\nabout Gabor frames with Hermite windows) and with totally positive windows. We\nalso consider a vectorial STFT in $L_{\\nu }^{2}(0,1)$ and the (full) Fock\nspaces of polyanalytic functions on $[0,1)\\times {R}$, associated Bargmann-type\ntransforms, and an analogue of Vasilevski's orthogonal decomposition into true\npolyanalytic Fock spaces (Landau level eigenspaces on $[0,1)\\times {R}$). We\nconclude with an analogue of Gr\\\"{o}chenig-Lyubarskii's sufficient condition\nfor Gabor super-frames with Hermite functions, equivalent to a sufficient\nsampling condition on the full Fock space of polyanalytic functions on\n$[0,1)\\times \\mathbb{R}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8OpsF0b8CqKH1TEAalhzy6G2ecPg1mACbP5sbwF-K6Y","pdfSize":"488186"}
