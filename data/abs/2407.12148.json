The tradeoff hypothesis suggests that virulence evolves to reach an\noptimal transmission intensity relative to the mortality caused by the disease.\nThis study introduces a mathematical model that incorporates key factors such\nas recovery times and mortality rates, focusing on the diminishing effects of\nparasite growth on transmission, with a focus on vector-borne diseases. The\nanalysis reveals conditions under which heightened virulence occurs in hosts,\nindicating that these factors can support vector-host transmission of a\npathogen, even if the host-only component is insufficient for sustainable\ntransmission. This insight helps explain the increased presence of pathogens\nwith high fatality rates, especially in vector-borne diseases. The findings\nemphasize an elevated risk in major pandemics involving vector-host diseases.\nEnhanced surveillance of mortality rates and techniques to monitor pathogen\nevolution are vital to effectively control future epidemics. This study\nprovides essential insights for pandemic preparedness and highlights the need\nfor ongoing research into pathogen evolution.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"zFKfW5ZCCwVQSCWXOIqXNA0flAIeec5Rw0db-VUibhg","pdfSize":"1790241"}
