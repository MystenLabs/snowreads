By\ntheir design, ROAs can protect the inter-domain routing system against prefix\nand sub-prefix hijacks. However, it is hard for the state-of-the-art approach,\nthe maxLength-based ROA encoding scheme, to guarantee security and scalability\nat the same time when facing various authorization scenarios. To this end, we\npropose a novel bitmap-based encoding scheme for ROAs to provide flexible and\ncontrollable compression. Furthermore, the hybrid ROA encoding scheme (h-ROA)\nis proposed, which encodes ROAs based on maxLength and bitmap jointly. This\napproach ensures strong security, provides flexibility and significantly\nimproves system scalability, enabling it to effectively handle various\nauthorization patterns. According to the performance evaluation with real-world\ndata sets, h-ROA outperforms the state-of-the-art approach $1.99 \\sim 3.28$\ntimes in terms of the encoding speed, and it can reduce the cost of a router to\nsynchronize all validated ROA payloads by $43.9\\% \\sim 56.6\\%$.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"mktBsfNYXqiGUjX6Ur47Qnt3ik1n5-vR5Cn-L9TYZVg","pdfSize":"2158228"}
