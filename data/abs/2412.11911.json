In this\npaper, we review how Hour of Code activities engage with the five big ideas of\nAI, in particular with machine learning and societal impact. We found that a\nlarge majority of activities focus on perception and machine learning, with\nlittle attention paid to representation and other topics. A surprising finding\nwas the increased attention paid to critical aspects of computing. However, we\nalso observed a limited engagement with hands-on activities. In the discussion,\nwe address how future introductory activities could be designed to offer a\nbroader array of topics, including the development of tools to introduce\nnovices to artificial intelligence and machine learning and the design of more\nunplugged and collaborative activities.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"-pyVDRfpDooLJRU31WpRqAQysS1gEc4xrQ6-EDkc6iM","pdfSize":"1272469"}
