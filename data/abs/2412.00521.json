However, existing GNN\nmethods struggle with the complexity of the heterogeneous graphs induced by\ndatabases with numerous tables and relations. Traditional approaches either\nconsider all possible relational meta-paths, thus failing to scale with the\nnumber of relations, or rely on domain experts to identify relevant meta-paths.\nA recent solution does manage to learn informative meta-paths without expert\nsupervision, but assumes that a node's class depends solely on the existence of\na meta-path occurrence. In this work, we present a self-explainable\nheterogeneous GNN for relational data, that supports models in which class\nmembership depends on aggregate information obtained from multiple occurrences\nof a meta-path. Experimental results show that in the context of relational\ndatabases, our approach effectively identifies informative meta-paths that\nfaithfully capture the model's reasoning mechanisms. It significantly\noutperforms existing methods in both synthetic and real-world scenario.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Databases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fKeK3EO198tfmeQYimEDf9bxNdeYoQDPaGEEfoPHCgU","pdfSize":"1324712"}
