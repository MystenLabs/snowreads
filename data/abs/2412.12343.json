Rotation is added by applying an improper\ncoordinate transformation to the known static toroidal black hole with Skyrme\nhair, while the electric charge is supplemented by considering a $U(1)$ gauge\nfield interacting with Einstein gravity. We perform the thermal analysis in the\ngrand canonical ensemble, explicitly showing the role that the flavor number\nplays. Some discussions about stability are also considered.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9YnbmuyC5xLcpjMxQfi6PDpggopuh_tCJyfBacXVhdw","pdfSize":"499234"}
