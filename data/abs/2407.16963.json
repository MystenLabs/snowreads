This will result in phase boundary effects in\nthe metastable and unstable regions. It is important to include these effects\nin phenomenological models of heavy ion collisions to identify experimental\nsignatures of a phase transition. This requires building intuition on phase\nseparation in rapidly expanding fluids. In this work we present the equations\nof relativistic hydrodynamics with a phase boundary, provide prescriptions to\nextend the equation of state to metastable and unstable regions, and show the\neffects of spinodal separation in a Bjorken flow.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gPedrOxQtpEXbG34w1RvF_DWqYt1fqlj_xqUiW_a4lo","pdfSize":"551858"}
