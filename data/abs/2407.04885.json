We utilize LLM prompting techniques, like\nchain-of-thought, to generate features from limited data, then extract insights\nthrough statistics and machine learning. Our results reveal potential\nrelationships between certain founder characteristics and success, as well as\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of these characteristics in prediction. This\nframework for integrating ML techniques and LLMs has vast potential for\nimproving startup success prediction, with important implications for VC firms\nseeking to optimize their investment strategies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"c1TGqYVTSWAI773gWG-SJ7fzMIZkPl9wyiVR1nOzkgY","pdfSize":"241898"}
