  "abstract": "  T.C. Burness and S.D. Scott \\cite{3} classified finite groups $G$ such that\nthe number of prime order subgroups of $G$ is greater than $|G|/2-1$. In this\nnote, we study finite groups $G$ whose subgroup graph contains a vertex of\ndegree greater than $|G|/2-1$. The classification given for finite solvable\ngroups extends the work of Burness and Scott.\n",
