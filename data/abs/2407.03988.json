The model describes a vertical\nslice of the ocean with a relative motion between the two surfaces and can be\nthought of as a stochastic variant of the Couette flow. The relative motion of\nthe surfaces is modeled by a Gaussian noise which is coloured in space and\nfractional in time with Hurst parameter greater than 3/4.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"114agT4HzncEX3i8DhoxWIYhAqRKJOOmldmIR-s21MU","pdfSize":"492599"}
