  "abstract": "  A solution is provided to the Bruxelles Problem, a geometric decision problem\noriginally posed in 1825, that asks for a synthetic construction to determine\nwhen ten points in 3-space lie on a quadric surface, a surface given by the\nvanishing of a degree-2 polynomial. The solution constructs four new points\nthat are coplanar precisely when the ten original points lie on a quadric\nsurface. The solution uses only lines constructed through two known points,\nplanes constructed through three known points, and intersections of these\nobjects. The tools involved include an extension of the Area Principle to\nthree-dimensional space, bracket polynomials and the Grassmann-Cayley algebra,\nand von Staudt's results on geometric arithmetic. Many special cases are\ntreated directly, leading to the generic case, where three pairs of the points\ngenerate skew lines and the remaining four points are in general position. A\nkey step in the generic case involves finding a nice basis for the quadrics\nthat pass through six of the ten points, which uses insights derived from\nMacaulay2, a computational algebra package not available in the nineteenth\ncentury.\n",
