Suppose that the action admits a\nmomentum map $\\mu_i$ and let $N_i:=\\mu_i^{-1}(0)$ be a regular level set. When\nthe action of $G$ on $N_i$ is proper and free, the Meyer--Marsden--Weinstein\nquotient $P_i:=N_i/G$ is a K\\\"ahler manifold and $\\pi_i:N_i\\to P_i$ is a\nprincipal fiber bundle with base $P_i$ and characteristic fiber $G$. In this\npaper, we define an almost complex structure for the manifold $N_1\\times N_2$\nand give necessary and sufficient conditions for its integrability. In the\nintegrable case, we find explicit holomorphic charts for $N_1\\times N_2$. As\napplications, we consider a non integrable almost-complex structure on the\nproduct of two complex Stiefel manifolds and the infinite Calabi-Eckmann\nmanifolds $\\mathbb S^{2n+1}\\times S(\\mathcal{H})$, for $n\\geq 1$, where\n$S(\\mathcal{H})$ denotes the unit sphere of an infinite dimensional Hilbert\nspace $\\mathcal{H}$\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"d2Vo9yJHyKMCb8laNLMGWMB13sbSOvtQRiHk4mLPQQw","pdfSize":"140030"}
