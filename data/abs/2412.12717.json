The\nflux rope is crucial in three-dimensional magnetic reconnection theory and are\ncommonly considered to be generated by secondary tearing mode instability. Here\nwe show that the parallel electron flow moving toward the reconnection\ndiffusion region can spontaneously form flux ropes. The electron flows form\nparallel current tubes in the separatrix region where the observational\nparameters suggest the tearing and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities are\nsuppressed. The spontaneously formed flux ropes could indicate the importance\nof electron dynamics in a three-dimensional reconnection region.\n","subjects":["Physics/Space Physics","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WZy1I0MWYsDktfeQFI4s__QTAlBagcjLngmqQl5GavE","pdfSize":"1813660"}
