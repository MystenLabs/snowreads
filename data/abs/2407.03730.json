These two Cepheids present a variation of their period for\nwhich it is possible to calculate an annual rate. This rate equals +1.86 s/yr\nfor RY Cas and -0.81 s/yr for V Lac. Based on these two new O-C diagrams\nneither of them seems to show any association to a binary system.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EZgKwyvtYb4G33_-gKr5UhzEEcnCJMQY7dS-aGhQ1mw","pdfSize":"815091"}
