Combining multivariate calculus, marching cube\nalgorithm, and binary indexed tree data structure, we developed an algorithm\nfor efficient computation of intrinsic volume of any volumetric data recovered\nfrom computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR). We proposed the 30\nconfigurations of volume values based on the polygonal mesh generation method.\nOur algorithm processes the data in scan-line order simultaneously with\nreconstruction algorithm to create a Fenwick tree, ensuring query time much\nfaster and assisting users' edition of slicing or transforming model. We tested\nthe algorithm's accuracy on simple 3D objects (e.g., sphere, cylinder) to\ncomplicated structures (e.g., lungs, cardiac chambers). The result deviated\nwithin $\\pm 0.004 \\text{cm}^3$ and there is still room for further improvement.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Graphics","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9d7RGcBx5Dn1E58PopYWtcVoHqKob7h4A6OLbyLS9v4","pdfSize":"2646349"}
