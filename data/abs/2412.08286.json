  "abstract": "  Bolted joints are critical in engineering for maintaining structural\nintegrity and reliability. Accurate prediction of parameters influencing their\nfunction and behavior is essential for optimal performance. Traditional methods\noften fail to capture the non-linear behavior of bolted joints or require\nsignificant computational resources, limiting accuracy and efficiency. This\nstudy addresses these limitations by combining empirical data with a\nfeed-forward neural network to predict load capacity and friction coefficients.\nLeveraging experimental data and systematic preprocessing, the model\neffectively captures nonlinear relationships, including rescaling output\nvariables to address scale discrepancies, achieving 95.24% predictive accuracy.\nWhile limited dataset size and diversity restrict generalizability, the\nfindings demonstrate the potential of neural networks as a reliable, efficient\nalternative for bolted joint design. Future work will focus on expanding\ndatasets and exploring hybrid modeling techniques to enhance applicability.\n",
