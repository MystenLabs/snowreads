  "abstract": "  Background: African swine fever is among the most devastating viral diseases\nof pigs. Despite nearly a century of research, there is still no safe and\neffective vaccine available. The current situation is that either vaccines are\nsafe but not effective, or they are effective but not safe.Findings: The ASF\nvaccine prepared using the inactivation method with propiolactone provided\n98.6% protection within 100 days after three intranasal immunizations, spaced 7\ndays apart.Conclusions: An inactivated vaccine made from complete African swine\nfever virus particles using propiolactone is safe and effective for controlling\nASF through mucosal immunity.\n",
