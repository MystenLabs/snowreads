On an $\\mathrm{SU}(r)$-bundle of charge $\\kappa$ over the\n4-sphere, we show that the space of all connections with Yang-Mills energy less\nthan $4 \\pi^2 \\left( |\\kappa| + 2 \\right)$ deformation-retracts under\nYang-Mills flow onto the space of instantons, allowing us to simplify the proof\nof Taubes's path-connectedness theorem. On a compact quaternion-K\\\"ahler\nmanifold with positive scalar curvature, we prove that the space of\npseudo-holomorphic connections whose $\\mathfrak{sp}(1)$ curvature component has\nsmall Morrey norm deformation-retracts under Yang-Mills flow onto the space of\ninstantons. On a nontrivial bundle over a compact manifold of general\ndimension, we prove that the infimum of the scale-invariant Morrey norm of\ncurvature is positive.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zhhmVtZSfLQRfKZwVhMpl6SITLK70gsgG_rHSjUJxqk","pdfSize":"583605"}
