Utilizing 18-21 bands of deep NIRCam,\nNIRISS, and HST photometry, we create resolved stellar mass maps and star\nformation rate maps via spectral energy distribution fitting with Dense Basis.\nWe examine their resolved stellar mass and specific star formation rate (sSFR)\nprofiles as a function of galactocentric radius, and find clear evidence for\ninside-out mass assembly. The total $M_\\star$ of the inner 2 kpc regions of the\nprogenitors remain roughly constant ($10^{9.3-9.4}M_\\odot$) at $2<z<5$, while\nthe total $M_\\star$ of the regions beyond 2 kpc increases by 0.8 dex, from\n$10^{7.5}M_\\odot$ to $10^{8.3}M_\\odot$. Additionally, the sSFR of the outer\nregions increase with decreasing redshift, until $z\\sim 2$. The median S\\'ersic\nindex of the MWA progenitors stays nearly constant at $n \\sim 1$ at $2<z<5$,\nwhile the half-mass radii of their stellar mass profiles double. We perform\nadditional morphological measurements on the stellar mass maps via the Gini-M20\nplane and asymmetry parameters. They show that the rate of double-peak mergers\nand disturbances to galaxy structure also increase with redshift, with\n$\\sim50\\%$ of galaxies at $4<z<5$ classified as disturbed, and $\\sim20\\%$\nclassified as ongoing mergers. Overall, the early evolution of MWAs is revealed\nas chaotic, with significant mergers and high SFRs. Mass growth is primarily\ninside-out and galaxies become more disk-like after $z=3$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"O1rfvrUpaLI8JJZkzt8WWa5xRuVY-gf02MrWK44cdLk","pdfSize":"4874589"}
