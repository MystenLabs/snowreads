Addressing this gap,\nwe present GraphMuse, a graph processing framework and library that facilitates\nefficient music graph processing and GNN training for symbolic music tasks.\nCentral to our contribution is a new neighbor sampling technique specifically\ntargeted toward meaningful behavior in musical scores. Additionally, GraphMuse\nintegrates hierarchical modeling elements that augment the expressivity and\ncapabilities of graph networks for musical tasks. Experiments with two specific\nmusical prediction tasks -- pitch spelling and cadence detection -- demonstrate\nsignificant performance improvement over previous methods. Our hope is that\nGraphMuse will lead to a boost in, and standardization of, symbolic music\nprocessing based on graph representations.
