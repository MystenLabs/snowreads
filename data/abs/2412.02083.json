The\nflexibility and scalability of perceptron make it ubiquitous in building\nintelligent systems. Studies have shown the efficacy of a single neuron in\nmaking intelligent decisions. Here, we examined and compared two perceptrons\nwith distinct mechanisms, and developed a quantum version of one of those\nperceptrons. As a part of this modeling, we implemented the quantum circuit for\nan artificial perception, generated a dataset, and simulated the training.\nThrough these experiments, we show that there is an exponential growth\nadvantage and test different qubit versions. Our findings show that this\nquantum model of an individual perceptron can be used as a pattern classifier.\nFor the second type of model, we provide an understanding to design and\nsimulate a spike-dependent quantum perceptron.
