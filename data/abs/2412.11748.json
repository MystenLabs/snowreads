In this work, we\nsystematically characterize the angle-dependence of Brillouin gain coefficients\nin x-cut membrane-suspended TFLN nanowaveguides, taking into account the\nanisotropy of the photoelastic coefficients in lithium niobate. We report a\nBrillouin gain coefficient of 129.5 m$^{-1}$W$^{-1}$ and further demonstrate\nthe Brillouin frequency tuning through variations in either pump frequency or\nchip operating temperature. Based on the suspended TFLN nanowaveguide, by\noptimizing the confinement of both photonic and phononic modes, we have\nachieved a Brillouin amplifier with a record-high gain of 8.5 dB. This result\nnot only validates the feasibility of strong guided Brillouin interaction using\nsuspended TFLN nanowaveguides, but also paves the way for novel on-chip sensing\nand signal processing applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"j8dSbS1t-Gm3NL5pFHUF2ewdmvfwK9lNnWlr7Vsvmm0","pdfSize":"7093553"}
