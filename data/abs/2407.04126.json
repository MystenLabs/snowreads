In applications, this material is in a\npolycrystalline state with grain boundaries (GBs) that can affect ionic\nconductivity. While atomistic modeling provides valuable information on the\nimpact of GBs on Li diffusion, such studies face either high computational cost\n(\\textit{ab initio} methods) or accuracy limitations (classical potentials) as\nchallenges. Here, we develop a quality-level-based active learning scheme for\nefficient and systematic development of \\textit{ab initio}-based\nmachine-learning interatomic potentials, specifically moment tensor potentials\n(MTPs), for large-scale, long-time, and high-accuracy simulations of complex\natomic structures and diffusion mechanisms as encountered in solid\nelectrolytes. Based on this scheme, we obtain MTPs for Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl and\ninvestigate two tilt GBs, $\\Sigma3(1\\bar{1}2)[110]$, $\\Sigma3(\\bar{1}11)[110]$,\nand one twist GB, $\\Sigma5(001)[001]$. All three GBs exhibit low formation\nenergies of less than \\SI{20}{meV/\\angstrom\\textsuperscript{2}}, indicating\ntheir high stability in polycrystalline Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl. Using the MTPs,\ndiffusion coefficients of the anion-ordered and anion-disordered bulk, as well\nas the three GBs, are obtained from molecular dynamics simulations of atomistic\nmodels. At \\SI{300}{\\kelvin}, the GB diffusion coefficients fall between the\nones of the anion-ordered bulk structure (\\SI{0.012e-7}{cm^2/s}, corresponding\nionic conductivity about \\SI{0.2}{mS/cm}) and the anion-disordered bulk\nstructure (\\SI{50}{\\percent} Cl/S-anion disorder; \\SI{2.203e-7}{cm^2/s}, about\n\\SI{29.8}{mS/cm}) of Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl. Experimental data fall between the\nArrhenius-extrapolated diffusion coefficients of the investigated atomic\nstructures.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hclBB8bxrUU4E4rCHYiGkMQ7-imW2ENGa9yKMsFOEIw","pdfSize":"5800458"}
