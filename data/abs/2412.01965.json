The universal energy cascade is\ninvestigated for a stationary and non-stationary incompressible ferrofluid\nturbulent system using exact relations. The findings reveal that under moderate\nmagnetic fields, kinetic and total energy cascades occur at identical rates. As\nthe external magnetic field strength increases, the total energy cascade\nbecomes non-stationary and differs from the kinetic one. However, the cascade's\nuniversal, scale-independent nature remains unaffected. The suppression of\nturbulence in ferrofluids is observable at strong magnetic fields.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dXQtLndloXgVNCJK_lWsIMpbr9WkCa4kqsCickIFkI4","pdfSize":"6943510"}
