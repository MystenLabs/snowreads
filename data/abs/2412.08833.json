  "abstract": "  We present a unified framework that simultaneously addresses the dynamics of\nearly-time cosmic inflation and late-time cosmic acceleration within the\ncontext of a single scalar field non-minimally coupled to gravity. By employing\nan exponential coupling function and a scalar potential with dual asymptotic\nplateaus, our model naturally transitions from inflationary dynamics at small\nfield values to a quintessence-like behavior at large field values. We derive\nthe inflationary predictions for the spectral index ($n_s$) and\ntensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$) in agreement with current observational\nconstraints. For late-time acceleration, the model produces a viable dark\nenergy component with an equation of state $w_\\phi$ approaching $-1$ but\nretaining a measurable deviation that could serve as an observational\nsignature. This work demonstrates that a single theoretical framework can\nreconcile both early inflation and the late-time accelerated expansion of the\nUniverse.\n",
