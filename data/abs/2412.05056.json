  "abstract": "  We have considered a model of a small finite system with internal particles\nand surface degrees of freedom. All the main statistical distributions were\nexplicitly obtained, on a pre thermodynamic limit basis. The concept of\ntemperature or any thermodynamic equations was not used. The distribution of\ncoordinates of a surface element allows the rigorous determination of the\npressure exerted by the internal particles. In this way, we have derived the\nequation of state for a small system with surface. It relates the pressure to\nthe numbers of bulk and surface degrees of freedom, their mean energies and the\nvolume. The mean potential energy of the surface was found to be higher than\nthe mean kinetic energy, per degree of freedom. The obtained equation of state\naccounts for the influence of this excessive surface energy. In the\nthermodynamic limit, the temperature appears and the obtained equation of state\ntransfers to the usual ideal gas one.\n",
