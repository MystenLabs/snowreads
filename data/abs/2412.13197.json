  "abstract": "  Recently, it has been experimentally demonstrated that individual memory\nunits coupled in certain topology can provide the intended performance.\nHowever, experimental or simulation based evaluation of different coupled\nmemory topologies and materials are costly and time consuming. In this paper,\ninspired by Glauber dynamics models in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics,\nwe propose a physically accurate generic mathematical framework for analyzing\nretention times of various coupled memory topologies and materials. We\ndemonstrate efficacy of the proposed framework by deriving closed form\nexpressions for a few popular coupled and uncoupled memory topologies, which\nmatch simulations. Our analysis also offers analytical insights helping us\nestimate the impact of materials and topologies on retention time.\n",
