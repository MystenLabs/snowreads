IVs require\nan instrument, a variable that is (A1) associated with the exposure, (A2) has\nno direct effect on the outcome except through the exposure, and (A3) is not\nrelated to unmeasured confounders. Unfortunately, finding variables that\nsatisfy conditions (A2) or (A3) can be challenging in practice. This paper\nreviews works where instruments may not satisfy conditions (A2) or (A3), which\nwe refer to as invalid instruments. We review identification and inference\nunder different violations of (A2) or (A3), specifically under linear models,\nnon-linear models, and heteroskedatic models. We conclude with an empirical\ncomparison of various methods by re-analyzing the effect of body mass index on\nsystolic blood pressure from the UK Biobank.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZIugvEclsZW0lEaY2Ftjnq7nDAj18RWqRyt7kQVyHrI","pdfSize":"644538"}
