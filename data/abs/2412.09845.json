However, violations of the positivity\nassumption can limit both the generalizability and transportability of\nfindings. To address positivity violations in estimating the average treatment\neffect for a target population, we propose a framework that integrates\ncharacterizing the underrepresented group and performing sensitivity analysis\nfor inference in the original target population. Our approach helps identify\nlimitations in trial sampling and improves the robustness of trial findings for\nreal-world populations. We apply this approach to extend findings from phase IV\ntrials of treatments for opioid use disorder to a real-world population based\non the 2021 Treatment Episode Data Set.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QKJ8I9pe8Z9wbJMUJ4RBL9bd9iR3MrvvD9tXsbN5YSU","pdfSize":"442097"}
