Specifically, in the parameter space, we\nexamine the boundary of the region in which homoclinic points for $X$ exist.\nFor all parameters on that boundary, all intersections of the stable and\nunstable manifold of $X$, apart from $X$, are tangential. We ultimately prove\nthat for such parameters, all possible homoclinic points for $X$ are iterates\nof only two special points $Z$ and $V$. Additionally, we describe the parameter\ncurves that form the boundary and provide explicit equations for several of\nthem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ph808FtHkie37kzz1tTJVBDZMN8yO5y1l3h8n1svkAE","pdfSize":"1739014"}
