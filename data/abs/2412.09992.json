With appropriate\nconstraints on nonlinear characteristics and functional parameters, we\ninitially establish the existence of a uniformly absorbing set by constructing\na Lyapunov function. Subsequently, we employ the contraction mapping principle\nto demonstrate the uniformly asymptotic compactness of the system. Finally,\nunder irrotational conditions, we prove the existence of a uniform attractor\n$\\mathcal{A}_\\Sigma$ in the space $H_c$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"g3GVJQkg5975Ur1sjDLSggymP1O-G-yKHIwDngoa0sM","pdfSize":"252500"}
