We outline\nour approach to spectral classification and discuss the correlation seen\nbetween spectral shape and the detection of HI absorption. We further consider\nthe implications of the observed correlation on the spatial distribution of the\nneutral gas, and on the jet-gas interactions. Our results are evaluated in the\ncontext of the forthcoming, full ASKAP-FLASH survey and other large, untargeted\nsearches of the radio sky.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"3FotTrFwTA2O976KwFTeooCKNCPvM8sbu0zp26u3uuQ","pdfSize":"166431"}
