The mathematical modelling of this phenomena leads to the\ninverse source problem of determining the spatiotemporal vehicle load $F(x,t)$\nin the variable coefficient Euler-Bernoulli equation $\\rho_A(x)u_{tt}+\\mu(x)\nu_{t}+(r(x)u_{xx})_{xx}+(\\kappa(x)u_{xxt})_{xx}=F(x,t)$, $(x,t)\\in\n\\Omega_T:=(0,\\ell)\\times (0,T)$ subject to the \"simply supported\" boundary\nconditions $u(0,t)=(r(x)u_{xx}+(\\kappa(x)u_{xxt})_{x=0}=0$,\n$u(\\ell,t)=(r(x)u_{xx}+(\\kappa(x)u_{xxt})_{x=\\ell}=0$, from the both measured\noutputs: $\\theta_1(t):=u_x(0,t)$ and $\\theta_2(t):=u_x(\\ell,t)$, that is, the\nmeasured boundary slopes. It is shown that the input-output maps $(\\Phi\nF)(t):=u_x(0,t;F)$, $(\\Psi F)(t):=u_x(\\ell,t;F)$, $F \\in \\mathcal{F}\\subset\nL^2(\\Omega_T)$, corresponding to the inverse problem, are compact and Lipschitz\ncontinuous. Then Tikhonov functional $J(F)=\\Vert \\Phi F-\\theta_1\n\\Vert_{L^2(0,T)}^2+\\Vert \\Psi F-\\theta_2 \\Vert_{L^2(0,T)}^2$ is introduced to\nprove the existence of a quasi-solution to the inverse problem. An explicit\ngradient formula for the Fr\\'{e}chet derivative of the Tikhonov functional is\nderived. The Lipschitz continuity of the Fr\\'{e}chet gradient, which guarantees\nthe monotonicity of iterations in gradient methods, has been proven.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"DE1quy7DWy8O9JGTzOjp0E_2U_hgdvcaas44FECJ_u8","pdfSize":"230270"}
