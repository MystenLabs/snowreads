  "abstract": "  A rank $n$ Higgs bundle $(E,\\theta)$ is called generically regular nilpotent\nif $\\theta^n=0$ but $\\theta^{n-1}\\neq 0$. We show that for a generically\nregular nilpotent Higgs bundle, if it admits a harmonic metric, then its graded\nHiggs bundle admits a unique maximal harmonic metric. The proof relies on a\ngeneralization of Kalka-Yang's theorem for prescribed curvature equation over a\nnon-compact hyperbolic surface to a coupled system. As an application, we show\nthat the branched set of a branched minimal disk in $\\mathbb{H}^3$ has to be\nthe critical set of some holomorphic self-map of $\\mathbb{D}$.\n",
