  "abstract": "  This paper investigates the impact of sampling and pretraining using datasets\nwith different image characteristics on the performance of self-supervised\nlearning (SSL) models for object classification. To do this, we sample two\napartment datasets from the Omnidata platform based on modality, luminosity,\nimage size, and camera field of view and use them to pretrain a SimCLR model.\nThe encodings generated from the pretrained model are then transferred to a\nsupervised Resnet-50 model for object classification. Through A/B testing, we\nfind that depth pretrained models are more effective on low resolution images,\nwhile RGB pretrained models perform better on higher resolution images. We also\ndiscover that increasing the luminosity of training images can improve the\nperformance of models on low resolution images without negatively affecting\ntheir performance on higher resolution images.\n",
