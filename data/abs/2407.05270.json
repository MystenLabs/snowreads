The\nobject is self-supporting by means of its chiral current. A conical singularity\nwith deficit angle, identical to that of straight string with the same linear\nmass density, is present at the vorton's core. We find that the metric is akin\nto the electromagnetic $4$-potential of a circular current wire loop,\nillustrating the concept of gravito-electromagnetism. Surprisingly we find that\nthe solution asymptotically mimics a Kerr-like naked singularity with mass\n$M_v=4\\pi R\\mu$ and spin parameter $a=R/2$. Finally, we also simulate the\ngravitational lensing images by solving the corresponding null geodesic\nequations. This reveals interesting properties of the images, such as the\nsimultaneous creation of a minimally distorted source image and its Einstein\nring, as well as the formation of double images of the back side of the ring.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_S58aafiI_gxkgT_F5D6Dg92rWrb75GuSX4HmlUUFig","pdfSize":"9985971"}
