For information-seeking tasks, full context perception is\noften unnecessary, as a query's information needs can dynamically range from\nlocalized details to a global perspective, depending on its complexity.\nHowever, existing methods struggle to adapt effectively to these dynamic\ninformation needs.\n  In the paper, we propose a method for processing long-context\ninformation-seeking tasks via query-guided Activation Refilling (ACRE). ACRE\nconstructs a Bi-layer KV Cache for long contexts, where the layer-1 (L1) cache\ncompactly captures global information, and the layer-2 (L2) cache provides\ndetailed and localized information. ACRE establishes a proxying relationship\nbetween the two caches, allowing the input query to attend to the L1 cache and\ndynamically refill it with relevant entries from the L2 cache. This mechanism\nintegrates global understanding with query-specific local details, thus\nimproving answer decoding. Experiments on a variety of long-context\ninformation-seeking datasets demonstrate ACRE's effectiveness, achieving\nimprovements in both performance and efficiency.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IHByABpAPLKJfXvgCjx6L8qc1XMPSkiQr-Wa-PJMMZE","pdfSize":"2180257"}
