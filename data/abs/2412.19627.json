  "abstract": "  General Relativity famously predicts precession of orbital motions in the\nSchwarzschild metric. In this paper we show that by adding a NUT charge $N =\niM$ the precession vanishes to all orders in $G$ even for rotating black holes.\nMoreover, we conjecture a generalization of the eikonal formula and show that\nthe classical integrable trajectories determine the full quantum amplitude for\nthis black hole, by means of exponentiation of the Post-Minkowskian radial\naction. Several consequences of integrability in self-dual gravity are\ndiscussed.\n",
