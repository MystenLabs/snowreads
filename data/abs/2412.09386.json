In this study, we aim to further\nadvance the segmentation and classification of cardiac magnetic resonance\nimages by introducing a novel deep learning-based approach. Using a multi-stage\nprocess with U-Net and ResNet models for segmentation, followed by Gaussian\nsmoothing, the method improved segmentation accuracy, achieving a Dice\ncoefficient of 0.974 for the left ventricle and 0.947 for the right ventricle.\nFor classification, a cascade of deep learning classifiers was employed to\ndistinguish heart conditions, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myocardial\ninfarction, and dilated cardiomyopathy, achieving an average accuracy of 97.2%.\nThe proposed approach outperformed existing models, enhancing segmentation\naccuracy and classification precision. These advancements show promise for\nclinical applications, though further validation and interpretation across\ndiverse imaging protocols is necessary.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"t1mcTk3ple2dc0qC_6QHRiHcqVHyQxwElq67N2tKo1o","pdfSize":"1201087"}
