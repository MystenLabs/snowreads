The $\\alpha$-stable process, and its exponentially tempered\ncounterpart, the Classical Tempered Stable (CTS) process, are also prominent\nexamples of L\\'evy processes. Simulating these processes is critical for many\napplications, yet it remains computationally challenging, due to their infinite\njump activity. This survey provides an overview of the key properties of these\nobjects offering a roadmap for practitioners. The first part is a review of the\nstability property, sampling algorithms are provided along with numerical\nillustrations. Then CTS processes are presented, with the Baeumer-Meerschaert\nalgorithm for increment simulation, and a computational analysis is provided\nwith numerical illustrations across different time scales.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"txlFBup-Z-HI8UWZzR88KidKnNyifz79r-4qKH_dANM","pdfSize":"970834"}
