In this work, we analyzed the dynamical shadow by extending\nthe concept of the photon sphere to time-dependent spacetimes, incorporating\ninduced, centrifugal, and relativistic forces. We demonstrated that the shadow\ngrows when light loses energy and shrinks when it gains energy, with a\nsurprising result that the shadow remains static when the photon sphere radius\ncoincides with the NEC horizon radius. Our method, assuming a small accretion\nrate, provides a foundation for studying dynamical black holes, offering\ninsights into processes like gravitational collapse, which could make shadow\nevolution detectable and reveal details about black hole formation.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eM_rVnTLrAIAC9zxEjry1qh41oNX4_3Ms2N1JxMZmDg","pdfSize":"646389"}
