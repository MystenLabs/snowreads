This graph-based model enables the learning and propagation of\nhigher-level spatial-temporal contexts to facilitate the semantic labeling of\nlocal regions. We introduce an exemplar-based nonparametric view of contextual\ncues, where the inherent relationships implied by object hypotheses are encoded\non a similarity graph of regions. Contextual relationships learning and\npropagation are performed to estimate the pairwise contexts between all pairs\nof unlabeled local regions. Our algorithm integrates the learned contexts into\na Conditional Random Field (CRF) in the form of pairwise potentials and infers\nthe per-region semantic labels. We evaluate our approach on the challenging\nYouTube-Objects dataset which shows that the proposed contextual relationship\nmodel outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"d3nHRL3i3QCIjzkAQv2Csz3PRBjw4kZEJASyFPse__0","pdfSize":"4992473"}
