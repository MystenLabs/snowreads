Yet,\ncomplex retrieval scenarios like in scientific knowledge bases, need more\nsophisticated access paths. Although each document somewhat contributes to a\ndomain's body of knowledge, the exact structure between keywords, i.e., their\npossible relationships, and the contexts spanned within each single document\nwill be crucial for effective retrieval. Following this logic, individual\ndocuments can be seen as small-scale knowledge graphs on which graph queries\ncan provide focused document retrieval. We implemented a full-fledged\ngraph-based discovery system for the biomedical domain and demonstrated its\nbenefits in the past. Unfortunately, graph-based retrieval methods generally\nfollow an 'exact match' paradigm, which severely hampers search efficiency,\nsince exact match results are hard to rank by relevance. This paper extends our\nexisting discovery system and contributes effective graph-based unsupervised\nranking methods, a new query relaxation paradigm, and ontological rewriting.\nThese extensions improve the system further so that users can retrieve results\nwith higher precision and higher recall due to partial matching and ontological\nrewriting.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dipFI0x1-bgraSIeMDebccwjNMB6ZIRAHiQY7REYAM0","pdfSize":"711808"}
