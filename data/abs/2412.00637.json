We first investigate theoretically the dynamics of the open\nBose-Hubbard chain confined in the superfluid phase induced by a sudden global\nquench on the dissipations and the repulsive interactions using the\nequation-of-motion approach. Using the same analytical approach, we then\ndiscuss the applicability of the quench spectroscopy to non-Hermitian quantum\nlattice models by considering the sudden global quench dynamics of the\nnon-Hermitian transverse-field Ising chain confined in the paramagnetic phase.\nWe finally generalize this spectroscopy method to isolated Hermitian quantum\nlattice models characterized by a quadratic fermionic or bosonic Hamiltonian.\nFor this purpose, we consider the case study of the Hermitian version of the\nlatter one-dimensional lattice model. The investigation is performed\nanalytically for the bosonic and fermionic reformulations while considering for\neach case the equation-of-motion and quasiparticle theoretical approaches.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"y0ro03yGKfpIsedZ8_KenvZcLx4U6hfr1dSSf6k5j8s","pdfSize":"699280"}
