However, their application to directed graphs (digraphs)\npresents unique challenges, primarily due to the inherent asymmetry in node\nrelationships. Traditional GNNs are adept at capturing unidirectional relations\nbut fall short in encoding the mutual path dependencies between nodes, such as\nasymmetrical shortest paths typically found in digraphs. Recognizing this gap,\nwe introduce Commute Graph Neural Networks (CGNN), an approach that seamlessly\nintegrates node-wise commute time into the message passing scheme. The\ncornerstone of CGNN is an efficient method for computing commute time using a\nnewly formulated digraph Laplacian. Commute time information is then integrated\ninto the neighborhood aggregation process, with neighbor contributions weighted\naccording to their respective commute time to the central node in each layer.\nIt enables CGNN to directly capture the mutual, asymmetric relationships in\ndigraphs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6CzZyTOQkg14Xejbrd2SQmChnyZE6tPZR9V-tTEstrM","pdfSize":"691762"}
