  "abstract": "  The standard cosmological model, based on Cold Dark Matter and Dark Energy\n({\\Lambda}CDM), faces several challenges. Among these is the need to adjust the\nscenario to account for he presence of vast voids in the large-scale structure\nof the universe, as well as the early formation of the first stars and\ngalaxies. Additionally, the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the\nuniverse remains an unresolved issue. To address this latter question, Andrei\nSakharov proposed a twin universe model in 1967. Building upon this idea and\nintroducing interactions between these two universe sheets through a bimetric\nmodel, we propose an alternative interpretation of the large-scale structure of\nthe universe, including its voids and the acceleration of cosmic expansion.\n",
