  "abstract": "  Non-Abelian evolution is a landmark in modern theoretical physics. But if\nnon-commutative dynamics has a significant impact in the control of\nentanglement and transport in quantum systems is an open question. Here we\npropose to utilize non-Abelian Thouless pumping in one-dimensional\ndiscrete-time quantum walks in lattices with degenerate Bloch-bands. We show\nhow the interplay of non-commutativity and topology enables geometrically\nprotected quantum coin and shift operators. By composing different non-Abelian\npumping cycles, different classes of tunable protected quantum walks arise.\nSurprisingly, the walks break parity symmetry and generate a dynamic process\ndescribed by a Weyl-like equation. The amount of entanglement can be varied by\nacting on the initial conditions. The asymptotic statistical distribution and\nits features are determined by closed form analytical expression and confirmed\nnumerically.\n",
