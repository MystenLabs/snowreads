  "abstract": "  We examine nonrenormalizable Lorentz- and CPT-violating effective operators\napplied to the quark sector of the Standard Model. Using Drell-Yan events\ncollected by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations, several constraints are\nextracted from time-independent modifications of the cross section on the\n$Z$-boson pole. The sensitivity to time-dependent modifications are also\nestimated by simulating a sidereal-time analysis. Our results suggest a\ndedicated search can improve on constraints from deep inelastic scattering by\nup to three orders in magnitude.\n",
