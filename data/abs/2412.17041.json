While many methods have been developed it is impossible to\nidentify the current state-of-the-art, due to i) varying and small pre-training\ndatasets, ii) varying architectures, and iii) being evaluated on differing\ndownstream datasets. In this paper we bring clarity to this field and lay the\nfoundation for further method advancements: We a) publish the largest publicly\navailable pre-training dataset comprising 114k 3D brain MRI volumes and b)\nbenchmark existing SSL methods under common architectures and c) provide the\ncode of our framework publicly to facilitate rapid adoption and reproduction.\nThis pre-print \\textit{only describes} the dataset contribution (a); Data,\nbenchmark, and codebase will be made available shortly.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AjMVwaM33qDsMggbHtbR8WWmdhHKlZP7eosjKT3sulw","pdfSize":"2991335"}
