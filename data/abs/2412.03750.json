We give necessary and sufficient\nconditions for these modules to be prime and prove a unique factorization\nresult. We also give an explicit formula expressing the module as an\nalternating sum of Weyl modules. Finally, we give an application of our results\nto classical questions in the category $\\mathcal{ O}(\\mathfrak{gl}_r)$.\nSpecifically we apply our results to show that there are a large family of\nnon-regular, non-dominant weights $\\mu$ for which the non-zero Kazhdan-Lusztig\ncoefficients $c_{\\mu, \\nu}$ are $\\pm 1$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"3t6JID6ZMWrIh5FUnLuuRcaI8SP0PFZ7LyplAWu_ocY","pdfSize":"438025"}
