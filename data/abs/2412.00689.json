  "abstract": "  Estimating the location of contact is a primary function of artificial\ntactile sensing apparatuses that perceive the environment through touch.\nExisting contact localization methods use flat geometry and uniform sensor\ndistributions as a simplifying assumption, limiting their ability to be used on\n3D surfaces with variable density sensing arrays. This paper studies contact\nlocalization on an artificial skin embedded with mutual capacitance tactile\nsensors, arranged non-uniformly in an unknown distribution along a semi-conical\n3D geometry. A fully connected neural network is trained to localize the\ntouching points on the embedded tactile sensors. The studied online model\nachieves a localization error of $5.7 \\pm 3.0$ mm. This research contributes a\nversatile tool and robust solution for contact localization that is ambiguous\nin shape and internal sensor distribution.\n",
