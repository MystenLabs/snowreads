  "abstract": "  In recent years, there has been increasing collaboration between the fields\nof quantum computing and high energy physics, including using LHC processes\nsuch as top (anti-)quark pair production to perform high energy tests of\nquantum entanglement. In this proceeding, I will review another interesting\nproperty from quantum computing (\"magic\"), that is needed to make quantum\ncomputers with genuine computational advantage over their classical\ncounterparts. How to make and enhance magic in general quantum systems is an\nopen question, such that new insights are always useful. To this end, I will\nshow that the LHC naturally produces magic top quarks, providing a novel\nplayground for further study in this area.\n",
