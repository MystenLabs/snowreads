We\nprovide a formula for the multiplicity of the powers of $I$ when all the\nprimary ideals of height $h$ in the irredundant reduced primary decomposition\nof $I$ are irreducible. This is a generalization of \\cite[Theorem 1.1]{TV}.\nFurthermore, we present a formula for the multiplicity of powers of special\npowers of monomial ideals that satisfy the aforementioned conditions. Here, for\nan integer $m>0$, the $m$-th special power of a monomial ideal refers to the\nideal generated by the $m$-th powers of all its minimal generators. Finally, we\nexplicitly provide a formula for the multiplicity of powers of special powers\nof edge ideals of vertex-weighted oriented graphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"mOZT0tArfvEEQVSdS4odVDE0olnEwXBVZ3mTJ3rUe-c","pdfSize":"180230"}
