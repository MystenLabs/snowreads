  "abstract": "  The focus of our study in this paper is on the active dynamics and a\nfractional generalized Langevin equation with a memory kernel K(t). The\nFokker-Planck equation is obtained by deriving it from a second-order\ndifferential equation. The joint probability density we obtained enables us to\ncalculate various statistical quantities such as mean squared displacement and\nmean squared velocity in different three-time domains.\n",
