  "abstract": "  In this paper we consider two-dimensional canonical systems with discrete\nspectrum and study their eigenvalue densities. We develop a formula that\ndetermines the Stieltjes transform of the eigenvalue counting function up to\nuniversal multiplicative constants. An explicit criterion is given for the\nresolvents of the model operator to belong to a Schatten-von Neumann class with\nindex 0<p<2, thus giving an answer to the long-standing question which\ncanonical systems have trace class resolvents.\n  For canonical systems with two limit circle endpoints we develop an algorithm\nfor determining the growth of the monodromy matrix up to a small error.\nMoreover, we present examples to illustrate our results, show their sharpness\nand prove an inverse result giving explicit formulae.\n",
