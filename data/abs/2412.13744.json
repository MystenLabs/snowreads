They also permit to\nqualify the microscopic properties of photonic waveguides such as polarization\nmode dispersion, refractive index difference, and chromatic dispersion. In the\nquest for ever-better measurement performance and relevance, we report an\noriginal quantum non-linear interferometer based on a Sagnac configuration\nallowing precise, accurate, self-stabilized, and reproductible optical phase\nmeasurement. The potential of this system is demonstrated through the\nmeasurement of second-order dispersion, namely chromatic dispersion, of a\ncommercial dispersion-shifted fiber at telecommunication wavelength. We assess\nprecision by exhibiting a statistical error of $7.10^{-3}\\, \\%$, showing more\nthat one order of magnitude compares to state-of-the-art measurements.\nAdditionally, the accuracy of the second-order dispersion value is determined\nthrough the measurement of the third-order dispersion, showing a quadratic\nerror as low as 5\\,\\%. Our system promises the development of photonic-based\nsensors enabling the measurements of optical-material properties in a\nuser-friendly manner.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gJeKLAhcI2rdr-tqro76S-fZwgny6GQb1cz_3DHCvW8","pdfSize":"1404026"}
