To face these\nchallenges we propose three alternative realizations of defects in the\nlong-range model. The first consists in introducing an additional parameter in\nthe perturbative RG flow or, equivalently, treating the non-locality of the\nmodel as a perturbation of the local four-dimensional theory. The second is\nbased on the introduction of non-local defect degrees of freedom coupled to the\nbulk and it provides some non-trivial defect CFTs also in the case of a free\nbulk, i.e. for generalized free field theory. The third approach is based on a\nsemiclassical construction of line defects. After finding a non-trivial\nclassical field configuration we consider the fluctuation Lagrangian to obtain\nquantum corrections for the defect theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GcF4Xw8dZ9xHevKmXet_6NW8rKvIaH3Xq6SFuJE2inQ","pdfSize":"1223955"}
