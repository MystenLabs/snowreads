  "abstract": "  Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (MABSA) combines text and images\nto perform sentiment analysis but often struggles with irrelevant or misleading\nvisual information. Existing methodologies typically address either\nsentence-image denoising or aspect-image denoising but fail to comprehensively\ntackle both types of noise. To address these limitations, we propose DualDe, a\nnovel approach comprising two distinct components: the Hybrid Curriculum\nDenoising Module (HCD) and the Aspect-Enhance Denoising Module (AED). The HCD\nmodule enhances sentence-image denoising by incorporating a flexible curriculum\nlearning strategy that prioritizes training on clean data. Concurrently, the\nAED module mitigates aspect-image noise through an aspect-guided attention\nmechanism that filters out noisy visual regions which unrelated to the specific\naspects of interest. Our approach demonstrates effectiveness in addressing both\nsentence-image and aspect-image noise, as evidenced by experimental evaluations\non benchmark datasets.\n",
