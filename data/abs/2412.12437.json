The focus\nof the presented research is on the introduction of a nature-inspired\ncollision-free control for a multi-UAV system considering obstacle avoidance\nmaneuvers. Inspired by the collective behavior of tilapia fish and pigeon, the\npresented framework in this study uses a centralized controller for the optimal\nformation control/recovery, which is defined by probabilistic Lloyd's\nalgorithm, while it uses a distributed controller for the intervehicle\ncollision and obstacle avoidance. Further, the presented framework has been\nextended to the 3D space with 3D maneuvers. Finally, the presented framework\nhas been applied to a multi-UAV system in 2D and 3D scenarios, and obtained\nresults demonstrated the validity of the presented method in the presence of\nbuildings and different types of obstacles.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4claKZjIWXaoc0OxN1LaquTGKoVmgN7K5h1L94ITULQ","pdfSize":"1360913"}
