We characterize the robust security of a restaking network as a\nfunction of the buffer between the costs and profits from attacks. For example,\nour results imply that if attack costs always exceed attack profits by 10\\%,\nthen a sudden loss of .1\\% of the overall stake (e.g., due to a software error)\ncannot result in the ultimate loss of more than 1.1\\% of the overall stake. We\nalso provide local analogs of these overcollateralization conditions and robust\nsecurity guarantees that apply specifically for a target service or coalition\nof services. All of our bounds on worst-case stake loss are the best possible.\nFinally, we bound the maximum-possible length of a cascade of attacks.\n  Our results suggest measures of robustness that could be exposed to the\nparticipants in a restaking protocol. We also suggest polynomial-time\ncomputable sufficient conditions that can proxy for these measures.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hFCCaU5282DuxAr6qDFGv5JZj9aWEAH3-LeJ31KXZAQ","pdfSize":"1261661","objectId":"0x07a1e8b675f9f3de1c57e58081ba19874363c5a46074e92e7a19b1a41aa21fe6","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
