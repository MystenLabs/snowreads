  "abstract": "  We introduce a new method designed for Bayesian inference of the angular\npower spectrum of the Gravitational Wave Background (GWB) anisotropy. This\nscheme works with time-series data and can optionally incorporate the\ncross-correlations between the GWB anisotropy and other cosmological tracers,\nenhancing the significance of Bayesian inference. We employ the realistic LISA\nresponse and noise model to demonstrate the validity of this approach. The\nfindings indicate that, without considering any cross-correlations, the 4-year\nLISA data is insufficient to achieve a significant detection of multipoles.\nHowever, if the anisotropies in the GWB are strongly correlated with the Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMB), the 4-year data can provide unbiased estimates of\nthe quadrupole moment ($\\ell = 2$). This reconstruction process is generic and\nnot restricted to any specific detector, offering a new framework for\nextracting anisotropies in the GWB data from various current and future\ngravitational wave observatories.\n",
