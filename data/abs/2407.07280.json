After determining a\npresentation of such modules, we prove that each integrable module over a\nquantum group is integrable when restricted to an $\\imath$quantum group. As an\napplication, we show that the space of matrix coefficients of all simple\nintegrable modules over an $\\imath$quantum group of finite type with specific\nparameters coincides with Bao-Song's coordinate ring of the $\\imath$quantum\ngroup.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2BpvQW3UVVq6npEpCUHdD4Jvb4q0SD_l3H-Hu9uynLs","pdfSize":"287999"}
