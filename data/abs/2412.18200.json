Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), this\nstudy proposes TCP-LLM, a novel framework leveraging LLMs for TCP applications.\nTCP-LLM utilizes pre-trained knowledge to reduce engineering effort, enhance\ngeneralization, and deliver superior performance across diverse TCP tasks.\nApplied to reducing flow unfairness, adapting congestion control, and\npreventing starvation, TCP-LLM demonstrates significant improvements over TCP\nwith minimal fine-tuning.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ke939l1whDDIoBADUtBc5cvSLGF7tn7Q-SOt1yVxuQM","pdfSize":"1183902"}
