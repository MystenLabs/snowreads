  "abstract": "  We consider a coupling element based on a symmetric superconducting quantum\ninterference device (SQUID) and show that it mediates a two-photon interaction.\nThis and other inductive interactions due to the SQUID can be switched off in\nsitu. We derive the system Hamiltonian for coupled resonator and rf SQUID. The\nrf SQUID dwells in the vicinity of its metastable well holding a number of\nenergy states and acts as an artificial atom. We discuss how the Josephson\nsymmetry breaks owing to magnetic fields in the superconducting loops. We\nassess that the two-photon coupling strength reaches 18 MHz which can exceed\nthe single-photon capacitive interaction in the coupler.\n",
