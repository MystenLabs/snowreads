The\nresulting large data volume poses a challenge for the analysis of the data,\nfrom the estimation of photometric redshifts to the calibration of shape\nmeasurements. We present GalSBI, a model for the galaxy population, to address\nthese challenges. This phenomenological model is constrained by observational\ndata using simulation-based inference (SBI). The $\\texttt{galsbi}$ Python\npackage provides an easy interface to generate catalogs of galaxies based on\nthe GalSBI model, including their photometric properties, and to simulate\nrealistic images of these galaxies using the $\\texttt{UFig}$ package.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"znRZi65dvXWUSA0M_YK8kmQlXYRtgJdW5dSZ6mywv8Y","pdfSize":"7935154"}
