Generative\nartificial intelligence is rapidly becoming an integral part of both science\nand education, offering not only automation of processes but also the dynamic\ncreation of complex, personalized content for educational purposes. With such\nadvancement, educators are now crafting exams, building tutors, creating\nwriting partners for students, and developing an array of other powerful tools\nfor supporting our educational practices and student learning. We share a new\nclass of opportunities for supporting learners and educators through the\ndevelopment of AI-generated simulations of physical phenomena and models. While\nwe are not at the stage of \"Computer: make me a mathematical simulation\ndepicting the quantum wave functions of electrons in the hydrogen atom\", we are\nnot far off.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sTeYbcmU7XJr59Q1Z1Kh836cQk8k-6qMPKy2_s7TqsI","pdfSize":"9520222"}
