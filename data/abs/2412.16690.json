We present a method for verifying $n$-qubit stabilizer states generated\nby quantum computers under noise, leveraging~$n$ observables (i.e., circuit\nmodifications) with multiple measurement shots per observable. The approach\naims at ensuring reliable fidelity assessment by distinguishing correct states\n($1-\\delta$) from incorrect ones ($1-\\epsilon$, where $\\delta < \\epsilon$).\nThis method balances practicality and accuracy, making it well-suited for\nnear-term quantum computer systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Kr8wAGkyIGvi3CdaPsvfmbaeVzLvgy67nMvUhEoiXcE","pdfSize":"150426"}
