Such a function defines a covering\n$\\mathbb R C\\to\\mathbb{RP}^1$. Let $c_1,\\dots,c_r$ be connected components of\n$\\mathbb R C$. M. Kummer and K. Shaw defined the separating semigroup of $C$ as\nthe set of all sequences $(d_1(f),\\dots,d_r(f))$ where $f$ is a separating\nfunction and $d_i(f)$ is the degree of the restriction of $f$ to $c_i$.\n  In the present paper we describe the separating semigroups of all genus 4\ncurves. For the proofs we consider the canonical embedding of $C$ into a\nquadric $X$ in $\\mathbb P^3$ and apply Abel's theorem to 1-forms obtained as\nPoincar\\'e residues at $C$ of certain meromorphic 2-forms on $X$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eQgWRKww2gTPWWuAVhGRC_tHgjBJUxgITpdgBf7tHhU","pdfSize":"181136"}
