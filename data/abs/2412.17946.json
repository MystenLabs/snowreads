We calculate the\nnuclear equation of state for nuclear and dark matter separately, under the\nthermodynamic conditions related to the evolution of supernova remnants. A\nmirrored model is adopted for dark matter, and its effect on remnant matter is\nstudied using a two-fluid scenario. At each stage of the remnant evolution, we\nassume that dark and ordinary matter have the same entropy and lepton fraction,\nand a fixed proportion of dark matter mass fraction is added to the stellar\nmatter to observe its effects on some microscopic and macroscopic properties of\nthe star. We observe that dark matter in the remnant core reduces the remnant's\nmaximum mass, radius, and tidal deformability. Moreover, dark matter heats the\nremnant matter and alters particle distributions, thereby decreasing its\nisospin asymmetry and increasing the sound speed through the matter.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"t62arTwryI4vpd2OMz59X1qcHnuKVUyDBjKKeI1Cs8A","pdfSize":"1536058"}
