In this study, a modified\nversion, which is applicable for indistinguishable particles, is proposed, and\nexplored for both the Bose-Hubbard and the Fermi-Hubbard models. It is found\nfor both Bosons and Fermions that disentanglement can give rise to quantum\nphase transitions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mjYF03JuCtW7tt-5gQWQo3lzWX1ksKUy76oDzTa0PYk","pdfSize":"483123"}
