However, access\nto industrial robots for teaching poses challenges, such as the high cost of\nacquiring these robots, the safety of the operator and the robot, and\ncomplicated training material. This paper proposes two low-cost platforms built\nusing open-source tools like Robot Operating System (ROS) and its latest\nversion ROS 2 to help students learn and test algorithms on remotely connected\nindustrial robots. Universal Robotics (UR5) arm and a custom mobile rover were\ndeployed in different life-size testbeds, a greenhouse, and a warehouse to\ncreate an Autonomous Agricultural Harvester System (AAHS) and an Autonomous\nWarehouse Management System (AWMS). These platforms were deployed for a period\nof 7 months and were tested for their efficacy with 1,433 and 1,312 students,\nrespectively. The hardware used in AAHS and AWMS was controlled remotely for\n160 and 355 hours, respectively, by students over a period of 3 months.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FtUIfoTn5NG3F79-5BbrjnJwbzqJqup77Me8KcRjg_M","pdfSize":"3466295"}
