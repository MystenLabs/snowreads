  "abstract": "  A nondegenerate toric hypersurface of negative Kodaira dimension can be\ncharacterized by the empty Fine interior of its Newton polytope according to\nrecent work by Victor Batyrev, where the Fine interior is the rational\nsubpolytope consisting of all points which have an integral distance of at\nleast 1 to all integral supporting hyperplanes of the Newton polytope.\nMoreover, we get more information in this situation if we can describe how the\nFine interior behaves for dilations of the Newton polytope, e.g. if we can\ndetermine the smallest dilation with a non-empty Fine interior. Therefore, in\nthis article we give a purely combinatorial description of the Fine interiors\nof all dilations of a rational polytope, which allows us in particular to\ncompute this smallest dilation and to classify all lattice 3-polytopes with\nempty Fine interior, for which we have only one point as Fine interior of the\nsmallest dilation with non-empty Fine interior.\n",
