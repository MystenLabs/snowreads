We report\nimproved constraints on Yukawa-type interactions in the $10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}$\nregime using optically levitated dielectric microspheres as test masses. The\nsearch is performed, for the first time, sensing multiple spatial components of\nthe force vector, and with sensitivity improved by a factor of $\\sim 100$ with\nrespect to previous measurements using the same technique. The resulting upper\nlimit on the strength of a hypothetical new force is $10^7$ at a Yukawa range\n$\\lambda\\simeq 5\\;\\mu$m and close to $10^6$ for $\\lambda \\gtrsim 10\\;\\mu$m.\nThis result also advances our efforts to measure gravitational effects using\nmicrometer-size objects, with important implications for embryonic ideas to\ninvestigate the quantum nature of gravity.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"A6oshxUMKe8rwBy2QxaFiYyL1NkVKBwMG8kIbLmj36A","pdfSize":"1175401"}
