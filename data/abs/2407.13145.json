Here, we present an efficient mechanism\nfor achieving magnomechanical chaos, in which the magnomechanical system is\ncoherently driven by a two-tone microwave field consisting of a pump field and\na probe field. Numerical simulations show that the relative phase of the two\ninput fields plays an important role in controlling the appearance of chaotic\nmotion and, more importantly, the threshold power of chaos is reduced by 6\norders of magnitude from watts to microwatts. In addition to providing insight\ninto magnonics nonlinearity, cavity magnomechanical chaos will always be of\ninterest because of its significance both in fundamental physics and potential\napplications ranging from ultra-low threshold chaotic motion to chaos-based\nsecret information processing.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"syeWuo0WLc7bS2nUyEStON1_cLW3J83TmrEVu8jWgYA","pdfSize":"903583"}
