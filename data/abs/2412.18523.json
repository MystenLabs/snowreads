  "abstract": "  In this paper, we study functional type weak approximation of weak solutions\nof stochastic functional differential equations by means of the Euler--Maruyama\nscheme. Under mild assumptions on the coefficients, we provide a quantitative\nerror estimate for the weak approximation in terms of the L\\'evy--Prokhorov\nmetric of probability laws on the path space. The weak error estimate obtained\nin this paper is sharp in the topological and quantitative senses in some\nspecial cases. We apply our main result to ten concrete examples appearing in a\nwide range of science and obtain a weak error estimate for each model. The\nproof of the main result is based on the so-called generalized coupling of\nprobability measures.\n",
