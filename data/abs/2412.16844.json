  "abstract": "  Emergency response services are vital for enhancing public safety by\nsafeguarding the environment, property, and human lives. As frontline members\nof these services, 9-1-1 dispatchers have a direct impact on response times and\nthe overall effectiveness of emergency operations. However, traditional\ndispatcher training methods, which rely on role-playing by experienced\npersonnel, are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often neglect the specific\nneeds of underserved communities. To address these challenges, we introduce\nSim911, the first training simulation for 9-1-1 dispatchers powered by Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs). Sim911 enhances training through three key technical\ninnovations: (1) knowledge construction, which utilizes archived 9-1-1 call\ndata to generate simulations that closely mirror real-world scenarios; (2)\ncontext-aware controlled generation, which employs dynamic prompts and vector\nbases to ensure that LLM behavior aligns with training objectives; and (3)\nvalidation with looped correction, which filters out low-quality responses and\nrefines the system performance.\n",
