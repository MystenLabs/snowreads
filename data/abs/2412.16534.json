  "abstract": "  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence,\nachieving impressive results on diverse data types, including images, videos,\nand texts. However, DNNs still lag behind Gradient Boosting Decision Trees\n(GBDT) on tabular data, a format extensively utilized across various domains.\nIn this paper, we propose DOFEN, short for \\textbf{D}eep \\textbf{O}blivious\n\\textbf{F}orest \\textbf{EN}semble, a novel DNN architecture inspired by\noblivious decision trees. DOFEN constructs relaxed oblivious decision trees\n(rODTs) by randomly combining conditions for each column and further enhances\nperformance with a two-level rODT forest ensembling process. By employing this\napproach, DOFEN achieves state-of-the-art results among DNNs and further\nnarrows the gap between DNNs and tree-based models on the well-recognized\nbenchmark: Tabular Benchmark \\citep{grinsztajn2022tree}, which includes 73\ntotal datasets spanning a wide array of domains. The code of DOFEN is available\nat: \\url{https://github.com/Sinopac-Digital-Technology-Division/DOFEN}.\n",
