However, their responses\noften become verbose or overly formulaic, failing to adequately address the\ndiverse emotional support needs of real-world scenarios. To tackle this\nchallenge, we propose an innovative strategy-enhanced role-playing framework,\ndesigned to simulate authentic emotional support conversations. Specifically,\nour approach unfolds in two steps: (1) Strategy-Enhanced Role-Playing\nInteractions, which involve three pivotal roles -- Seeker, Strategy Counselor,\nand Supporter -- engaging in diverse scenarios to emulate real-world\ninteractions and promote a broader range of dialogues; and (2) Emotional\nSupport Agent Training, achieved through fine-tuning LLMs using our specially\nconstructed dataset. Within this framework, we develop the \\textbf{ServeForEmo}\ndataset, comprising an extensive collection of 3.7K+ multi-turn dialogues and\n62.8K+ utterances. We further present \\textbf{SweetieChat}, an emotional\nsupport agent capable of handling diverse open-domain scenarios. Extensive\nexperiments and human evaluations confirm the framework's effectiveness in\nenhancing emotional support, highlighting its unique ability to provide more\nnuanced and tailored assistance.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ARgVXNEf7TfW7ecHtFHfvFLVC3rtT38HljbF7-pJvUg","pdfSize":"6472034"}
