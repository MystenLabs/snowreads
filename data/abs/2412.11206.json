More specifically, we show that, for any $M>0$, any finite field\n$\\mathbf{F}$, and any definable group $(G,\\cdot)$ in $\\mathbf{F}$ and definable\nsubset $D\\subseteq G$, each of complexity at most $M$, there is a normal\ndefinable subgroup $H\\leqslant G$, of index and complexity $O_M(1)$, such that\nthe following holds: for any cosets $V,W$ of $H$, the bipartite graph\n$(V,W,xy^{-1}\\in D)$ is $O_M(|\\mathbf{F}|^{-1/2})$-quasirandom. Various\nanalogous regularity conditions follow; for example, for any $g\\in G$, the\nFourier coefficient $||\\widehat{1}_{H\\cap Dg}(\\pi)||_{\\mathrm{op}}$ is\n$O_M(|\\mathbf{F}|^{-1/8})$ for every non-trivial irreducible representation\n$\\pi$ of $H$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hI4J5vMlOr6QZ_JGc9zJR59C48ih33Fj0uSO7le5Tts","pdfSize":"457285"}
