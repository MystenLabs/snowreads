{"id":"2412.19969","title":"Superconducting Diode Effect in Double Quantum Dot Device","authors":"Go Takeuchi and Mikio Eto","authorsParsed":[["Takeuchi","Go",""],["Eto","Mikio",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Dec 2024 01:48:54 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-31","timestamp":1735350534000,"abstract":"  Superconducting diode effect (SDE) is theoretically examined in double\nquantum dot coupled to three superconducting leads, $L$, $R1$ and $R2$. Lead\n$L$ is commonly connected to two quantum dots (QD1, QD2) while lead $R1$ ($R2$)\nis connected to QD1 (QD2) only. The phase differences $\\varphi_{1}$ between\nleads $L$ and $R1$ and $\\varphi_{2}$ between leads $L$ and $R2$ are tuned\nindependently. The critical current into lead $R1$ depends on its direction\nunless $\\varphi_{2} = 0$, $\\pi$, which is ascribable to the formation of\nAndreev molecule between the QDs. In the absence of electron-electron\ninteraction $U$ in the QDs, the spectrum of the Andreev bound states forms\nDirac cones in the $\\varphi_{1}-\\varphi_{2}$ plane if the energy levels in the\nQDs are tuned to the Fermi level in the leads. The SDE is enhanced to almost\n30\\% when $\\varphi_{2}$ is set to the value at the Dirac points. In the\npresence of $U$, the SDE is still observed when $U$ is smaller than the\nsuperconducting energy gap in the leads. Our device should be one of the\nminimal models for the SDE since a similar device with a single QD does not\nshow the SDE.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"caUkyVvcldxYPl5WUakjwk--Tl06T-hPm4DphQOiWeQ","pdfSize":"2476992"}
