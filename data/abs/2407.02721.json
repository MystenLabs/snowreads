However, they\noften underperform compared to deterministic neural networks. Utilizing mutual\nlearning can effectively enhance the performance of peer BNNs. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel approach to improve BNNs performance through deep mutual\nlearning. The proposed approaches aim to increase diversity in both network\nparameter distributions and feature distributions, promoting peer networks to\nacquire distinct features that capture different characteristics of the input,\nwhich enhances the effectiveness of mutual learning. Experimental results\ndemonstrate significant improvements in the classification accuracy, negative\nlog-likelihood, and expected calibration error when compared to traditional\nmutual learning for BNNs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qQEAbJQ54BX5OaVgw2rXh1YQ8GOzt9m9oRguSeLisn0","pdfSize":"186229","objectId":"0x19a82cb89ecaf30f82d11592744cf9f5ed1ae63eaaf42b54440eba9ffa2e2809","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
