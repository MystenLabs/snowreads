  "abstract": "  This study sets out to answer one major question: Who thinks better,\nnon-native speakers of English or ChatGPT?, providing evidence from processing\nand interpreting center-embedding English constructions that human brain\nsurpasses ChatGPT, and that ChatGPT cannot be regarded as a theory of language.\nFifteen non-native speakers of English were recruited as participants of the\nstudy. A center-embedding English sentence was presented to both the study\nparticipants and ChatGPT. The study findings unveil that human brain is still\nfar ahead of Large Language Models, specifically ChatGPT, even in the case of\nnon-native speakers of an L2, here English. The study concludes that human\nbrain's ability to process and interpret natural language data is unique and\nthat ChatGPT still lags behind this human unique ability.\n",
