Temporal correlations of the generated photons were confirmed through\ncoincidence measurements. We observed a maximum of 32 kcps, with a coincidence\nto accidental ratio of 17$\\pm$1. To further understand the underlying\nprocesses, we also simulated a generalized FWM event involving the interaction\nbetween an arbitrary frequency comb and a Continuous Wave (CW) pump. Non-linear\ndynamics through the HNLF were modelled using Schr\\\"odinger propagation\nequations, with numerical predictions agreeing with our experimental results.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Bcv7j_n6-jY-Ge89_b16zYcjui4qhaagWGlHFun0Wek","pdfSize":"11129809"}
