Our approach combines keypoint-based method\nwith learnable pose regression through `keypoint-graph', which is a graph\nrepresentation of the keypoints. KGpose first estimates 3D keypoints for each\nobject using an attentional multi-modal feature fusion of RGB and point cloud\nfeatures. These keypoints are estimated from each point of point cloud and\nconverted into a graph representation. The network directly regresses 6D pose\nparameters for each point through a sequence of keypoint-graph embedding and\nlocal graph embedding which are designed with graph convolutions, followed by\nrotation and translation heads. The final pose for each object is selected from\nthe candidates of point-wise predictions. The method achieves competitive\nresults on the benchmark dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model.\nKGpose enables multi-object pose estimation without requiring an extra\nlocalization step, offering a unified and efficient solution for understanding\ngeometric contexts in complex scenes for robotic applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"l4kmsDGFzvN5S3_iv599qAgT-fBAjom7fMyYu-jBznE","pdfSize":"6038447"}
