  "abstract": "  To describe highly heterogeneous systems using the Cahn-Hilliard equation,\nthe standard form of the thermodynamic potential with a constant coefficient in\nthe gradient term and a polynomial of the fourth degree may not be sufficient.\nThe modification of the form of the thermodynamic potential with a polynomial\nof the sixth degree and the quadratic dependence of the coefficient at the\ngradient term is considered. Exact solutions in the form of a moving static\nwave and the conditions of their existence depending on the symmetry of the\npotential are obtained.\n",
