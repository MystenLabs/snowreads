While complete collapse is well-studied and addressed,\ndimensional collapse has only gain attention and addressed in recent years\nmostly using variants of redundancy reduction (aka whitening) techniques. In\nthis paper, we further explore a complementary approach to whitening via\nfeature decoupling for improved representation learning while avoiding\nrepresentation collapse. In particular, we perform feature decoupling by early\npromotion of useful features via careful feature coloring. The coloring\ntechnique is developed based on a Bayesian prior of the augmented data, which\nis inherently encoded for feature decoupling. We show that our proposed\nframework is complementary to the state-of-the-art techniques, while\noutperforming both contrastive and recent non-contrastive methods. We also\nstudy the different effects of coloring approach to formulate it as a general\ncomplementary technique along with other baselines.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LYkQyf45jK1Ski2K77HEJMHatwLDssBwnEybM2NbnnI","pdfSize":"536027"}
