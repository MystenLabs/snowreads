The dataset comprises pairs of finite-time system traces\nand corresponding labels, denoting whether the traces demonstrate specific\ndesired behaviors, e.g. whether the ship follows a safe route or not. Our\nproposed approach leverages decision-tree-based methods to infer Signal\nTemporal Logic classifiers using primitive formulae. We formulate the inference\nprocess as a mixed integer linear programming optimization problem, recursively\ngenerating constraints to determine both data classification and tree\nstructure. Applying a max-flow algorithm on the resultant tree transforms the\nproblem into a global optimization challenge, leading to improved\nclassification rates compared to prior methodologies. Moreover, we introduce a\ntechnique to reduce the number of constraints by exploiting the symmetry\ninherent in STL primitives, which enhances the algorithm's time performance and\ninterpretability. To assess our algorithm's effectiveness and classification\nperformance, we conduct three case studies involving two-class, multi-class,\nand complex formula classification scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KBVkADcEbz0dTeajvpIyynu4MRct2zsG20kXmO-4YME","pdfSize":"1644726"}
