This model consists of the compressible NSF equations of\nfluid coupled with the transport equations of the radiation field propagation.\nAssuming that the initial data are a small perturbation near the equilibrium\nstate, we establish the global well-posedness of classical solutions for this\nmodel by performing the Fourier analysis techniques and employing the delicate\nenergy estimates in frequency spaces. Here, we develop a new method to overcome\na series of difficulties arising from the linear terms $n_1$ in (3.2)$_2$ and\n$n_0$ in (3.3)$_3$ related to the radiation intensity. Furthermore, if the\n$L^1$-norm of the initial data is bounded, we obtain the optimal time decay\nrates of the classical solution at $L^p$-norm $(2\\leq p\\leq \\infty)$. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first result on the global well-posedness of\nthe NSF-$P_1$ approximation model.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"T-JXEkZJLBQgWdVrp3k7foJro2IzVWCnyzDnOw2sTRE","pdfSize":"422691"}
