  "abstract": "  Non-Hermitian systems exhibit a distinctive type of wave propagation, due to\nthe intricate interplay of non-Hermiticity and disorder. Here, we investigate\nthe spreading dynamics in the archetypal non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\\'e model with\nquasiperiodic disorder. We uncover counter-intuitive transport behaviors:\nsubdiffusion with a spreading exponent $\\delta=1/3$ in the localized regime and\ndiffusion with $\\delta=1/2$ in the delocalized regime, in stark contrast to\ntheir Hermitian counterparts (halted vs. ballistic). We then establish a\nunified framework from random-variable perspective to determine the universal\nscaling relations in both regimes for generic disordered non-Hermitian systems.\nAn efficient method is presented to extract the spreading exponents from\nLyapunov exponents. The observed subdiffusive or diffusive transport in our\nmodel stems from Van Hove singularities at the tail of imaginary density of\nstates, as corroborated by Lyapunov-exponent analysis.\n",
