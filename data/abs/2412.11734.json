  "abstract": "  A lot has been said about the vibrational density of states (DoS) in liquids.\nA more recent discussion introduces contradictions with earlier results, and\nhere I briefly review several pieces of evidence from modeling, experiments and\ntheory showing this. I then show that the origin of contradictions often comes\nfrom misinterpreting the nature of excitations in liquids. Classic quadratic\nDoS corresponds to propagating (albeit damped) phonons as in solids and applies\nto any medium at low frequency, whereas the linear DoS comes from overdamped\nmodes, localised particle motions. This has implications for interpreting\nsimulations, experiments and a theory of liquids. I also introduce a new\nmechanism where the exponent of quadratic DoS reduces to close to 1 due to the\nasymmetry of the scattering intensity, reducing the effective phonon frequency.\n",
