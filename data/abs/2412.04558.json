Given the static nature of this task,\nin this paper, we aim to make this task dynamic by incorporating actions. By\ndoing this, we intend to modify the positions or postures of objects in the\nimage to depict different actions while maintaining the visual properties of\nthe objects. To implement this challenging task, we propose a new model that is\nsensitive to action text instructions by learning to recognize contrastive\naction discrepancies. The model training is done on new datasets defined by\nextracting frames from videos that show the visual scenes before and after an\naction. We show substantial improvements in image editing using action-based\ntext instructions and high reasoning capabilities that allow our model to use\nthe input image as a starting scene for an action while generating a new image\nthat shows the final scene of the action.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OzOYKqtMhAjlRx3xtfeI2YYVESeetiVD59tkqe1C9z4","pdfSize":"4045490"}
