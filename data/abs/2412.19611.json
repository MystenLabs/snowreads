  "abstract": "  We explicitly establish that the Kerr metric represents a pair of self-dual\nand anti-self-dual gravitational dyons (Taub-NUT instantons). We show that the\nNewman-Janis algorithm precisely originates from this fact. More generally,\nthis program of understanding four-dimensional black holes as systems of chiral\ndyons extends to Kerr-Newman and Kerr-Taub-NUT solutions as well.\n",
