We investigate stellar halo assembly over\n$0.2 \\leq z \\leq 1.1$ in a mass-complete ($M_{\\star} \\geq 10^{9.5}M_{\\odot}$)\nsample of 242,456 star-forming and 88,421 quiescent galaxies (SFGs and QGs)\nfrom the CLAUDS and HSC-SSP surveys. We extract galaxy rest-frame $g$-band\nsurface brightness ($\\mu_g$) profiles to study faint, extended emission in\ngalaxy outskirts. We examine trends in galaxy assembly by analyzing the median\n$\\mu_g$ profiles in different SFG and QG \\msS ranges with decreasing redshift\nand connecting evolution in galaxy $\\mu_g$ profiles with the underlying stellar\nmass growth in galaxies. Since $z=1.1$, the majority of evolution in the median\n$\\mu_g$ profiles of galaxies ($\\sim$64$\\%$ in SFGs and $\\sim$71$\\%$ in QGs)\noccurs throughout their stellar halo regions (2-10$R_e$). More massive galaxies\nassemble stellar halo material more rapidly at $0.2 \\leq z \\leq 1.1$. Over this\nperiod, QGs grow a larger fraction of their stellar haloes than SFGs at fixed\n$M_{\\star}$ (factor of $\\sim$1.2). Although star formation can account for the\nstellar halo growth observed in low-mass SFGs ($10^{9.5}M_\\odot \\leq M_\\star <\n10^{10.5}M_\\odot$), high-mass SFGs ($M_\\star \\geq 10^{10.5}M_\\odot$) and both\nlow- and high-mass QGs require an additional assembly mechanism. Our results\nsuggest accretion via minor mergers drives additional stellar halo growth in\nthese galaxies. The contribution from accretion is larger in more massive\ngalaxies (over $M_{\\star} \\geq 10^{9.5}M_{\\odot}$), and QGs exhibit larger\nfractional increases to their ex-situ fractions over $0.2 \\leq z \\leq 1.1$ than\nSFGs at fixed $M_{\\star}$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"E5DfK_qW-mn7Cw74wui8gCphNnITS1ztqUJfEGd_4OU","pdfSize":"4119601"}
