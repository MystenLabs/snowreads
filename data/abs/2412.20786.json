  "abstract": "  The classification of finite dimensional Nichols algebras of diagonal type\nplays an important role in the classification of Hopf algebras by the lifting\nmethod of N. Andruskiewitsch and H.-J. Schneider over fields of characteristic\nzero. In this paper, we obtain the classification theorem of all\nfinite-dimensional rank 5, rank 6 and rank 7 Nichols algebras of diagonal type\nover fields of positive characteristic. Weyl groupoids and finite arithmetic\nroot systems are crucial tools to the classification theorem.\n",
