In the present article, we generalise the result of\nKatz under several technical conditions (containing the absolute unramifiedness\nof $F$ at $p$), and construct a $p$-adic Artin $L$-function of\n$d+1+\\delta_{F,p}$ variables, which interpolates critical values of the Artin\n$L$-function associated to a $p$-unramified Artin representation of the\nabsolute Galois group $G_F$. Our construction is an analogue over a CM field of\nGreenberg's construction over a totally real field, but there appear new\ndifficulties which do not matter in Greenberg's case.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JXvUThMU9wTBSxQpC7bHFl1oJvuQ84LQs5yC3PwATuM","pdfSize":"509561"}
