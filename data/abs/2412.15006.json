We\nreview the literature on this latter problem, and present a strategy to solve\nit. For $n \\le 4$, the strategy recovers recently discovered solutions. We\nobtain (i) counting formulas for plethystic coefficients, (ii) new recursive\nformulas for plethysms of Schur functions, and (iii) formulas for the number of\nconstituents of $\\Lambda^n\\text{Sym}^r\\mathbb{C}^2$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NwMOAgNgGx87PaG6FTzOcWGrD-whvphNXxs-JHi0Agg","pdfSize":"556411"}
