{"id":"2407.01655","title":"Interpretation of recently discovered single bottom baryons in the\n  relativistic flux tube model","authors":"Pooja Jakhad, Juhi Oudichhya, Ajay Kumar Rai","authorsParsed":[["Jakhad","Pooja",""],["Oudichhya","Juhi",""],["Rai","Ajay Kumar",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2024 14:06:15 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-03","timestamp":1719842775000,"abstract":"  Following recent experimental progress in the study of bottom baryons, we\nsystematically calculate the mass spectra of $\\Lambda_{b}$, $\\Xi_{b}$,\n$\\Sigma_{b}$, $\\Xi_{b}^{'}$, and $\\Omega_{b}$ baryons with a quark-diquark\npicture in the framework of a relativistic flux tube model with spin-dependent\ninteractions in the j-j coupling scheme. Furthermore, we calculate the strong\ndecay width of bottom baryons decaying into a bottom baryon and a light\npseudoscalar meson. A good agreement is found between the calculated masses and\nthe experimentally available masses of singly bottom baryons. %We interpret\n$\\Sigma_{b}(6097)$ as a $1P(3/2^{-})$ state, $\\Xi_{b}(6100)$ as $1P(1/2^{-})$\nstate of $\\Xi_{b}$ baryon, $\\Xi_{b}(6227)$ as a $1P(1/2^{-})$ or $1P(3/2^{-})$\nstate of $\\Xi_{b}'$ baryon, $\\Xi_{b}(6327)$ as a $1P(3/2^{-})$ state of\n$\\Xi_{b}'$ baryon, and $\\Xi_{b}(6333)$ as a $1P(3/2^{-})$ state of $\\Xi_{b}'$\nbaryon. By analysing both mass spectra and strong decay widths, we interpret\n$\\Sigma_{b}(6097)$ as a $1P(3/2^{-})$ state and $\\Xi_{b}(6100)$ as a\n$1P(1/2^{-})$ state of $\\Xi_{b}$ baryon. The $\\Xi_{b}(6227)$ is identified to\nbe an orbital excitation $1P$ of the $\\Xi_{b}^{'}$ baryon with $J^{P}=3/2^{-}$.\nFurther, we determine $\\Xi_{b}(6327)$ and $\\Xi_{b}(6333)$ as a $1P(3/2^{-})$\nstate and $1P(5/2^{-})$ state, respectively, of $\\Xi_{b}^{'}$ baryon. From the\nobtained mass spectra, we construct the Regge trajectories in the $(J,M^{2})$\nplane, which are found to be essentially linear, parallel, and equidistant. Our\npredictions for higher orbital and radial excited states can help\nexperimentalists identify missing excited states of singly bottom baryons.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LCVFTWHKWRLS9F46Rtj7GLy-ObF1KTBDMSxlQztRkcY","pdfSize":"5792920"}
