This survey provides an overview of the\nevolution, capabilities, and applications of LLM-based data agents,\nhighlighting their role in simplifying complex data tasks and lowering the\nentry barrier for users without related expertise. We explore current trends in\nthe design of LLM-based frameworks, detailing essential features such as\nplanning, reasoning, reflection, multi-agent collaboration, user interface,\nknowledge integration, and system design, which enable agents to address\ndata-centric problems with minimal human intervention. Furthermore, we analyze\nseveral case studies to demonstrate the practical applications of various data\nagents in real-world scenarios. Finally, we identify key challenges and propose\nfuture research directions to advance the development of data agents into\nintelligent statistical analysis software.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Machine Learning","Statistics/Other Statistics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"58fIsdpsufM2jYz5sNRX-9inC4-QILF_At18VBxx_TU","pdfSize":"8512313"}
