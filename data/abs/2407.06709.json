Due to its\ncomplicated setting, prior arts have proposed various measures to evaluate\nmodel performances. However, both theoretical analysis and empirical\nobservations show that a model might perform inconsistently on different\nmeasures. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel measure named Top-K\nPairwise Ranking (TKPR), and a series of analyses show that TKPR is compatible\nwith existing ranking-based measures. In light of this, we further establish an\nempirical surrogate risk minimization framework for TKPR. On one hand, the\nproposed framework enjoys convex surrogate losses with the theoretical support\nof Fisher consistency. On the other hand, we establish a sharp generalization\nbound for the proposed framework based on a novel technique named\ndata-dependent contraction. Finally, empirical results on benchmark datasets\nvalidate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rm9b0wmQgpYPqWJnQVnHiJ1acYNOBMllr9-dh2GrryE","pdfSize":"6942295"}
