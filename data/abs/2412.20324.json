Our proposal to consider a sequence of messages as a seed for\ncoverage-directed greybox fuzzing, to associate each message with the\ncorresponding protocol state, and to maximize the coverage of both the state\nspace and the code was first published in 2020 in a short tool demonstration\npaper. AFLNet was the first code- and state-coverage-guided protocol fuzzer; it\nused the response code as an indicator of the current protocol state. Over the\npast five years, the tool paper has gathered hundreds of citations, the code\nrepository was forked almost 200 times and has seen over thirty pull requests\nfrom practitioners and researchers, and our initial proposal has been improved\nupon in many significant ways. In this paper, we first provide an extended\ndiscussion and a full empirical evaluation of the technical contributions of\nAFLNet and then reflect on the impact that our approach and our tool had in the\npast five years, on both the research and the practice of protocol fuzzing.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"roKlmg1Itxcigwwblx_6qA6eW0yoTlh8YMqUYtKW2p0","pdfSize":"882417"}
