While classical ML\nmethods remain accessible, advanced deep networks are still challenging to\nbuild and train. We introduce two new adaptations and refine two existing ML\nnetworks for generic crystalline quantum materials properties prediction and\noptimization. These new models achieve state-of-the-art performance in\npredicting TQC classification and strong performance in predicting band gaps,\nmagnetic classifications, formation energies, and symmetry group. All networks\neasily generalize to all quantum crystalline materials property predictions. To\nsupport this, full implementations and automated methods for data handling and\nmaterials predictions are provided, facilitating the use of deep ML methods in\nquantum materials science. Finally, dataset error rates are analyzed using an\nensemble model to identify and highlight highly atypical materials for further\ninvestigations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DBzHiNM-IpH6kDe1_kRxkGxTQOIwPS6cMdNk0jtInuY","pdfSize":"4705568","objectId":"0xc9d7748e551e430362a8959ee0e55e5b9e877dea55bea0738d008fa095f21056","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
