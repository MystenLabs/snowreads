  "abstract": "  We introduce a general framework to study the local dynamics of\nnear-parabolic maps using the meromorphic $1$-form introduced by X.~Buff. As a\nsample application of this setup, we prove the following tameness result on\ninvariant curves of near-parabolic maps: Let $g(z)=\\lambda z+O(z^2)$ have a\nnon-degenerate parabolic fixed point at $0$ with multiplier $\\lambda$ a\nprimitive $q$th root of unity, and let $\\gamma: \\, ]-\\infty,0] \\to {\\mathbb\nD}(0,r)$ be a $g^{\\circ q}$-invariant curve landing at $0$ in the sense that\n$g^{\\circ q}(\\gamma(t))=\\gamma(t+1)$ and $\\lim_{t \\to -\\infty} \\gamma(t)=0$.\nTake a sequence $g_n(z)=\\lambda_n z+O(z^2)$ with $|\\lambda_n|\\neq 1$ such that\n$g_n \\to g$ uniformly on ${\\mathbb D}(0,r)$ and suppose each $g_n$ admits a\n$g_n^{\\circ q}$-invariant curve $\\gamma_n: \\, ]-\\infty,0] \\to {\\mathbb C}$ such\nthat $\\gamma_n \\to \\gamma$ uniformly on the fundamental segment $[-1,0]$. If\n$\\lambda_n^q \\to 1$ non-tangentially, then $\\gamma_n$ lands at a repelling\nperiodic point near $0$, and $\\gamma_n \\to \\gamma$ uniformly on $]-\\infty,0]$.\nIn the special case of polynomial maps, this proves Hausdorff continuity of\nexternal rays of a given periodic angle when the associated multipliers\napproach a root of unity non-tangentially.\n",
