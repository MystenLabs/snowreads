One might\nexpect that the latest advances in NLP research in languages like English reach\nsuch a large community. However, NLP advancements in English didn't immediately\nreach Indian languages like Marathi. There were several reasons for this. They\nincluded diversity of scripts used, lack of (publicly available) resources like\ntokenization strategies, high quality datasets \\& benchmarks, and evaluation\nmetrics. In addition to this, the morphologically rich nature of Marathi, made\nNLP tasks challenging. Advances in Neural Network (NN) based models and tools\nsince the early 2000s helped improve this situation and make NLP research more\naccessible. In the past 10 years, significant efforts were made to improve\nlanguage resources for all 22 scheduled languages of India. This paper presents\na broad overview of evolution of NLP research in Indic languages with a focus\non Marathi and state-of-the-art resources and tools available to the research\ncommunity. It also provides an overview of tools \\& techniques associated with\nMarathi NLP tasks.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TPhZbKcsIyEJCNpcuzW5aDA9z7GVPhGYpnPYb6C5w0U","pdfSize":"326070"}
