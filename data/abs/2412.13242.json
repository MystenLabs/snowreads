The early period is referred to as the\nEinstein Static (ES) Universe phase, which characterizes a static phase with\npositive spatial curvature. A stable Einstein static state can serve as a\nsubstitute for BBS, followed by an inflationary period known as the Emergent\nScenario. The initial need has not been fulfilled within the context of General\nRelativity, prompting the investigation of modified theories of gravity. The\ncurrent research aims to find such a solution within the framework of symmetric\nteleparallel gravity, specifically in the trendy $f(Q)$ theories. An analysis\nhas been conducted to investigate stable solutions for both positively and\nnegatively curved spatial FRW universes, in the presence of a perfect fluid, by\nutilizing various torsion-free and curvature-free affine connections.\nAdditionally, we propose a method to facilitate an exit from a stable ES to a\nsubsequent inflationary phase. We demonstrate that $f(Q)$ gravity theories have\nthe ability to accurately depict the emergence of the universe.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YLWoTFdKHsrPlCFL4KJkU3Wighkfpop2YBQQdA77LzU","pdfSize":"971138"}
