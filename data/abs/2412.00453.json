Not many investigations on experimental determinations of deformation\npotentials relating changes in optoelectronic properties of bilayer WSe$_2$\nwith the strain are present in the literature. Our experimental study focuses\non three widely investigated high-symmetry points, K$_{c}$, K$_{v}$, and\nQ$_{c}$, where subscript c (v) refers to the conduction (valence) band, in the\nBrillouin zone of bilayer WSe$_2$. Using local biaxial strains produced by\nnanoparticle stressors, a theoretical model, and by performing the spatially-\nand spectrally-resolved photoluminescence measurements, we determine absolute\ndeformation potential of -5.10 $\\pm$ 0.24 eV for Q$_{c}$-K$_{v}$ indirect\nbandgap and -8.50 $\\pm$ 0.92 eV for K$_{c}$-K$_{v}$ direct bandgap of bilayer\nWSe$_2$. We also show that $\\approx$0.9% biaxial tensile strain is required to\nconvert an indirect bandgap bilayer WSe$_2$ into a direct bandgap\nsemiconductor. Moreover, we also show that a relatively small amount of\nlocalized strain $\\approx$0.4% is required to make a bilayer WSe$_2$ as\noptically bright as an unstrained monolayer WSe$_2$. The bandgap deformation\npotentials measured here will drive advances in flexible electronics, sensors,\nand optoelectronic- and quantum photonic- devices through precise strain\nengineering.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ps3ZE5LxnOXW6bySUY8big6Pdy4_Sih1XEQgDkVwfjw","pdfSize":"616793"}
