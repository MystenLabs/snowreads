  "abstract": "  Traditional electrostatic simulation are meshed-based methods which convert\npartial differential equations into an algebraic system of equations and their\nsolutions are approximated through numerical methods. These methods are time\nconsuming and any changes in their initial or boundary conditions will require\nsolving the numerical problem again. Newer computational methods such as the\nphysics informed neural net (PINN) similarly require re-training when boundary\nconditions changes. In this work, we propose an end-to-end deep learning\napproach to model parameter changes to the boundary conditions. The proposed\nmethod is demonstrated on the test problem of a long air-filled capacitor\nstructure. The proposed approach is compared to plain vanilla deep learning\n(NN) and PINN. It is shown that our method can significantly outperform both NN\nand PINN under dynamic boundary condition as well as retaining its full\ncapability as a forward model.\n",
