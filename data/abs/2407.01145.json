This work reports an extrusion\nprinting method to fabricate high-performance thermoelectric materials with\ncomplex 3D architectures. By integrating high-throughput experimentation and\nBayesian optimization (BO), our approach significantly accelerates the\nsimultaneous search for the optimal ink formulation and printing parameters\nthat deliver high thermoelectric performances while maintaining desired shape\nfidelity. A Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based machine learning model is\nemployed to expeditiously predict thermoelectric power factor as a function of\nink formulation and printing parameters. The printed bismuth antimony telluride\n(BiSbTe)-based thermoelectric materials under the optimized conditions exhibit\nan ultrahigh room temperature zT of 1.3, which is by far the highest in the\nprinted thermoelectric materials. The machine learning-guided ink-based\nprinting strategy can be highly generalizable to a wide range of functional\nmaterials and devices for broad technological applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nacrqq7bA019S99vHt4NEMgHn4_3g7Q56JXFvJTu-0w","pdfSize":"3223324"}
