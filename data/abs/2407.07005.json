The cotriangular Hopf algebras ${}_J\\mathcal{O}(G)_J$ have the same\ncoalgebra structure as $\\mathcal{O}(G)$ but a deformed multiplication. We show\nthat they are involutive $n$-step iterated Hopf Ore extensions of derivation\ntype. The 2-cocycle $J$ has as support a closed subgroup $T$ of $G$, and\n${}_J\\mathcal{O}(G)_J$ is a crossed product $S \\#_{\\sigma}U(\\mathfrak{t})$,\nwhere $\\mathfrak{t}$ is the Lie algebra of $T$ and $S$ is a deformed coideal\nsubalgebra. The simple ${}_J\\mathcal{O}(G)_J$-modules are stratified by a\nfamily of factor algebras ${}_J\\mathcal{O}(Z_g)_J$, parametrised by the double\ncosets $TgT$ of $T$ in $G$. The finite dimensional simple\n${}_J\\mathcal{O}(G)_J$-modules are all 1-dimensional, so form a group $\\Gamma$,\nwhich we prove to be an explicitly determined closed subgroup of $G$. A\nselection of examples illustrate our results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"p2zAnqULFV9vXSPjF_8fCvj-PPOS48zdAUCzDqKb_is","pdfSize":"600107"}
