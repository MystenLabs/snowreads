Our optical reservoir computer consists of 24 physical\nVCSEL nodes. We evaluate the system's memory and solve the 2-bit XOR task and\nthe 3-bit header recognition (HR) task with bit error ratios (BERs) below 1\\,\\%\nand the 2-bit digital-to-analog conversion (DAC) task with a root-mean-square\nerror (RMSE) of 0.067.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Emerging Technologies","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lnCmO_fJr_gdDJw9nM-Hn1EId9BzUn3qHUIEFIESXP4","pdfSize":"1190916"}
