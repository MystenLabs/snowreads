Moreover, Tiep asked\nwhether this can be generalised to $p=2$ or $3$. We answer the Hain--Tiep\nquestion in the affirmative and also prove analogous statements for\n$\\operatorname{SL}_{2}$ and $\\operatorname{GL}_{2}$ over any finite local\nprincipal ideal ring with residue field of odd characteristic.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CeQkWpKTqrNp_F57i2mpXGILQUNdvZiCfhukqq3CI0s","pdfSize":"458429"}
