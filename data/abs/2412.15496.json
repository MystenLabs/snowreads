  "abstract": "  Despite the growing popularity of graph attention mechanisms, their\ntheoretical understanding remains limited. This paper aims to explore the\nconditions under which these mechanisms are effective in node classification\ntasks through the lens of Contextual Stochastic Block Models (CSBMs). Our\ntheoretical analysis reveals that incorporating graph attention mechanisms is\n\\emph{not universally beneficial}. Specifically, by appropriately defining\n\\emph{structure noise} and \\emph{feature noise} in graphs, we show that graph\nattention mechanisms can enhance classification performance when structure\nnoise exceeds feature noise. Conversely, when feature noise predominates,\nsimpler graph convolution operations are more effective. Furthermore, we\nexamine the over-smoothing phenomenon and show that, in the high\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, graph convolutional networks suffer from\nover-smoothing, whereas graph attention mechanisms can effectively resolve this\nissue. Building on these insights, we propose a novel multi-layer Graph\nAttention Network (GAT) architecture that significantly outperforms\nsingle-layer GATs in achieving \\emph{perfect node classification} in CSBMs,\nrelaxing the SNR requirement from $ \\omega(\\sqrt{\\log n}) $ to $\n\\omega(\\sqrt{\\log n} / \\sqrt[3]{n}) $. To our knowledge, this is the first\nstudy to delineate the conditions for perfect node classification using\nmulti-layer GATs. Our theoretical contributions are corroborated by extensive\nexperiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, highlighting the\npractical implications of our findings.\n",
