This position paper\nexplores the role of AI in climate change adaptation and mitigation in Africa.\nIt advocates for a collaborative approach to build capacity, develop\nopen-source data repositories, and create context-aware, robust AI-driven\nclimate solutions that are culturally and contextually relevant.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"n5QOkEG3_FGxeCZxZ3nV1VHJGLm8VlFvP5J27GddeVE","pdfSize":"71868"}
