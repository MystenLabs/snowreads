  "abstract": "  One of the motivations for the development of wirelessly guided untethered\nmagnetic devices (UMDs), such as microrobots and nanorobots, is the continuous\ndemand to manipulate, sort, and assemble micro-objects with high level of\naccuracy and dexterity. UMDs can function as microgrippers or manipulators and\nmove micro-objects with or without direct contact. In this case, the UMDs can\nbe directly teleoperated by an operator using haptic tele-manipulation systems.\nThe aim of this chapter is threefold: first, to provide a mathematical\nframework to design a scaled bilateral tele-manipulation system to achieve\nwireless actuation of micro-objects using magnetically-guided UMDs; second, to\ndemonstrate closed-loop stability based on absolute stability theory; third, to\nprovide experimental case studies performed on haptic devices to manipulate\nmicrorobots and assemble micro-objects. In this chapter, we are concerned with\nsome fundamental concepts of electromagnetics and low-Reynolds number\nhydrodynamics to understand the stability and performance of haptic devices in\nmicro- and nano-manipulation applications.\n",
