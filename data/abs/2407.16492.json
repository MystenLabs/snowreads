Here, we study the spectra of a\n$z = 1.95$ lensed Type Ia supernova SN~Encore for its brightest Image A, taken\n39 days apart. We infer the spectral age with template matching using the\nsupernova identification (SNID) software and find the spectra to be at 29.0\n$\\pm 5.0$ and 37.4 $\\pm 2.8$ rest-frame days post maximum respectively,\nconsistent with separation in the observer frame after accounting for\ntime-dilation. Since SNe~Ia measure dark energy properties by providing\nrelative distances between low- and high-$z$ SNe, it is important to test for\nevolution of spectroscopic properties. Comparing the spectra to composite\nlow-$z$ SN~Ia spectra, we find strong evidence for similarity between the local\nsample of SN~Encore. The line velocities of common SN~Ia spectral lines, Si II\n6355 and Ca II NIR triplet are consistent with the distribution for the low-$z$\nsample as well as other lensed SNe~Ia, e.g. iPTF16geu ($z = 0.409$) and SN~H0pe\n($z = 1.78$). The consistency in SN~Ia spectra across cosmic time demonstrates\nthe utility of using SNe~Ia in the very high-$z$ universe for dark energy\ninference. We also find that the spectra of SN~Encore match the predictions for\nexplosion models very well. With future large samples of lensed SNe~Ia, spectra\nat such late phases will be important to distinguish between different\nexplosion scenarios.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ahg4_ewZchX_ahFotj7zpdFbpiqnVJLTz01pq4m6zTY","pdfSize":"6758668","objectId":"0x2a6d59a47ff015012ef7d09864c288b53bb2947a27e471880b9ad3bf5e539129","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
