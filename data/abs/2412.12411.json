  "abstract": "  We introduce an abstract notion of a 3D-rotation module for a group $G$ that\ndoes not require the module to carry a vector space structure, a priori nor a\nposteriori. Our first result shows that, under an expected irreducibility-like\nassumption, the only finite $G$ with such a module are those already known from\nthe classical setting: $\\operatorname{Alt}(4)$, $\\operatorname{Sym}(4)$, and\n$\\operatorname{Alt}(5)$. Our second result then studies the module structure\nwhen $G = \\operatorname{Alt}(5)$ and shows that, under certain natural\nrestrictions, it is fully determined and generalizes that of the classical\nicosahedral module.\n  We include an application to the recently introduced setting of modules with\nan additive dimension, a general setting allowing for simultaneous treatment of\nclassical representation theory of finite groups as well as representations\nwithin various well-behaved model-theoretic settings such as the $o$-minimal\nand finite Morley rank ones. Leveraging our recognition result for icosahedral\nmodules, we classify the faithful $\\operatorname{Alt}(5)$-modules with additive\ndimension that are dim-connected of dimension $3$ and without $2$-torsion.\n",
