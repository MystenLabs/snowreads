Consequently, we identify the\nbinary observables those can be \"labeled\" perfectly. In this work, we study\nthese problems in the single-shot regime.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4RCgHwc68J5hgmbPxLOGqfnVO6JkHrBvTYMg3ZizyIQ","pdfSize":"672024"}
