The global routing problems that\nwe focus on in this work are based on routing problems that occur in the design\nof substrates in multilayered semiconductor packages. The proposed new method\nis based on machine learning techniques and we show that the proposed method\nsupersedes conventional net ordering techniques based on heuristic score\nfunctions. We perform global routing experiments in multilayered semiconductor\npackage environments in order to illustrate that the routing order based on our\nnew proposed technique outperforms previous methods based on heuristics. Our\napproach of using machine learning for global routing targets specifically the\nnet ordering step which we show in this work can be significantly improved by\ndeep learning.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"puUnwuQzLhdXpipKjamwGOTIzx6w6GKw1ZZR7vl5Lp4","pdfSize":"3562181"}
