  "abstract": "  High-power ultrafast laser sources in the short-wave infrared region are of\ngreat interest for numerous applications, including secondary sources of\nradiation and processing of materials commonly opaque in the near-infrared\nregion. In this wavelength region, direct laser amplification around 2.1-{\\mu}m\nwavelength within the atmospheric transparency window is particularly\nattractive for realizing compact and efficient high-power lasers. However, this\nwavelength region was widely underrepresented in femtosecond laser technology\nso far. Here, we report on a 2.1-{\\mu}m laser system delivering 97-fs pulses\nwith an unprecedented combination of high peak power of 525 MW and high\nrepetition rate of 100 kHz. The amplifier system consists of a mode-locked\noscillator seeding a regenerative amplifier (RA) using the novel broadband\nmaterial Holmium (Ho)-doped CaAlGdO4 (CALGO), operating in the chirped pulse\namplification (CPA) scheme and a nonlinear compression stage based on a\nHerriott-type multi-pass cell (MPC) with bulk material. We demonstrate the\npotential of this unique laser system by generating a micro plasma in ambient\nair, demonstrating its high intensity for future plasma-driven secondary\nsources. This system bridges the gap between conventional 1-to-10 kHz\namplifiers and high-power MHz laser oscillators in this attractive wavelength\nrange.\n",
