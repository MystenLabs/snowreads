By adopting a multi-scale\nperturbative method, we have demonstrated a general rule for the decaying\ncenter-like power law behavior, characterized by an exponent of 1/3 . The\ninvestigation began with a physical question about the higher-order\nnonlinearity in a damping force function, which exhibits birhythmic and\ntrirhythmic behavior under a transition to a decaying center-type solution.\nUsing numerical optimization algorithms, we identified the power law exponent\nfor decaying center-type behavior across various rhythmic conditions. For all\nscenarios, we consistently observed a decaying power law with an exponent of\n1/3 .Our study aims to elucidate their dynamical differences, contributing to\ntheoretical insights and practical applications where distinguishing between\ndifferent types of center-like behaviour is crucial. This key result would be\nbeneficial for studying the multi-rhythmic nature of biological and engineering\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"g6EmX3r6kU2YlYxm4rCsw9w-OhFPzGrkGsKObmIF-yY","pdfSize":"393393"}
