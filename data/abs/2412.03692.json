  "abstract": "  The proxy-SU(3) symmetry predicts, in a parameter-free way, the collective\ndeformation variables beta and gamma in even-even atomic nuclei away from\nclosed shells based on the highest weight irreducible representations (irreps)\nof SU(3) in the relevant proton and neutron shells, which are the most\nsymmetric irreps allowed by the Pauli principle and the short-range nature of\nthe nucleon-nucleon interactions. The special cases in which the use of the\nnext highest weight irrep of SU(3) becomes necessary are pointed out and\nnumerical results are given for several regions of the nuclear chart, which can\nbe used as input for irrep-mixing calculations.\n",
