  "abstract": "  Muon conversion is one of the best probes of charged lepton flavor violation.\nThe experimental limit is soon expected to improve by four orders of magnitude,\nthus calling for precise predictions on the theory side. Equally important are\nprecise predictions for muon decay-in-orbit, the main background for muon\nconversion. While the calculation of electromagnetic corrections to the two\nprocesses above the nuclear scale does not involve significant challenges, it\nbecomes substantially more complex below that scale due to multiple scales,\nbound-state effects and experimental setup. Here, we present a systematic\nframework that addresses these challenges by resorting to a series of effective\nfield theories. Combining Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET), Non-Relativistic\nQED (NRQED), potential NRQED, Soft-Collinear Effective Theory I and II, and\nboosted HQET, we derive a factorization theorem and present the renormalization\ngroup equations. Our framework allows for the proper calculation of precise\npredictions for the rates of the two processes, with crucial implications for\nthe upcoming muon conversion searches. We also provide the most accurate\nprediction of the signal shape for those searches.\n",
