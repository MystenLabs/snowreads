Using proprietary data from a private online spot work\nmatching platform, Timee, it examines trends in key variables such as the\nnumbers of unemployed users, vacancies, hires, and labor market tightness. The\nstudy compares these trends with part-time worker data from the public\nemployment platform, Hello Work. The private platform shows a significant\nmarket expansion from December 2019 to December 2023. Applying a novel\nnonparametric approach, the paper finds greater variability in efficiency and\nhigher elasticity, with elasticity with respect to the number of users\nfluctuating from below 0.7 to above 1.5, and elasticity with respect to the\nnumber of vacancies often exceeding 1.0, which is higher than Hello Work.\nLastly, the study highlights that Tokyo's labor market exhibits higher\nefficiency compared to Osaka and Aichi, while elasticities are similar,\nindicating less geographical heterogeneity of the spot work compared to Hello\nWork.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kv92MQVALMbNS_j_giIfAzmd_7VWN5dbTGQuyAK2ulE","pdfSize":"1415569"}
