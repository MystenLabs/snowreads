  "abstract": "  We present a systematic approach to the kinematics of quantum-reduced loop\ngravity, a model originally proposed by Alesci and Cianfrani as an attempt to\nprobe the physical implications of loop quantum gravity. We implement the\nquantum gauge-fixing procedure underlying quantum-reduced loop gravity by\nintroducing a master constraint operator on the kinematical Hilbert space of\nloop quantum gravity, representing a set of gauge conditions which classically\nconstrain the densitized triad to be diagonal. The standard Hilbert space of\nquantum-reduced loop gravity can be recovered as a space of solutions of the\nmaster constraint operator, while on the other hand the master constraint\napproach provides a useful starting point for considering possible\ngeneralizations of the standard construction. We also examine the quantum\ndynamics of states consisting of a single six-valent node in the\nquantum-reduced framework. We find that the Hamiltonian which governs the\ndynamics of such states bears a close formal resemblance to the Hamiltonian\nconstraint of Bianchi I models in loop quantum cosmology.\n",
