Our method applies a successive shortest paths (SSP)\nalgorithm to a tracking graph defined over a batch of frames. The edge costs in\nthis tracking graph are computed via a message-passing network, a graph neural\nnetwork (GNN) variant. The parameters of the GNN, and hence, the tracker, are\nlearned end-to-end on a training set of example ground-truth tracks and\ndetections. Specifically, learning takes the form of bilevel optimization\nguided by our novel loss function. We evaluate our algorithm on simulated\nscenarios to understand its sensitivity to scenario aspects and model\nhyperparameters. Across varied scenario complexities, our method compares\nfavorably to a strong baseline.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"rahtv08KcrKkmmk9D_zCZ050oH34iW7GQL7_8xtDkow","pdfSize":"925250"}
