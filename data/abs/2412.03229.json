We have shown from symmetry considerations that\nin non-polar chiral systems, bands with specific orbital characters around a\nhigh symmetry point with $D_{2}$ little group may admit a single spin dependent\nterm in the low energy $\\bf{k.p}$ model Hamiltonian that naturally leads to\nPST. Considering a $2D$ plane in the Brillouin zone (BZ), we have further\nargued that in such chiral systems the PST is transpired due to the comparable\nstrengths of the Dresselhaus and Weyl (radial) interaction parameters where the\npresence of these two terms are allowed by the $D{_2}$ symmetry. Finally using\nfirst principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations we have\nidentified that the non-polar chiral compounds Y$_3$TaO$_7$ and AsBr$_3$\ndisplays PST for the conduction band and valence band respectively around the\n$\\Gamma$ point having $D{_2}$ little group and predominantly Ta-$d_{xz}$\norbital character for Y$_3$TaO$_7$ and Br-$p{_x}$ orbital character for\nAsBr$_3$ corroborating our general strategy. Our results for the realisation of\nPST in non-polar chiral systems thereby broaden the class of materials\ndisplaying PST that can be employed for application in spin-orbitronics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KjjRWdZoXGrUVNpbEnoPdqNCJsZxiPaRruog127fKFc","pdfSize":"4174006"}
