This paper provides a\ncomprehensive comparative analysis of six state-of-theart unlearning techniques\napplied to image and text classification tasks. We evaluate their performance,\nefficiency, and compliance with regulatory requirements, highlighting their\nstrengths and limitations in practical scenarios. By systematically analyzing\nthese methods, we aim to provide insights into their applicability,\nchallenges,and tradeoffs, fostering advancements in the field of ethical and\nadaptable machine learning.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"D4MBILCjPdLFTfKO7CDsbfDk_kIf11qUyLNPtjhmFwM","pdfSize":"119234"}
