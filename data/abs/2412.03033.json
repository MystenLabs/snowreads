Utilizing a dual approach, the study engaged in\nprolonged fieldwork, including repeated fortnightly interviews with selected\nhouseholds and a one-time primary survey with a larger sample size. The\nresearch meticulously analyzed the financial lives of these households,\nfocusing on their saving and credit behaviors and assessing the accessibility\nand intensity of usage of financial instruments available to them. Through\nsuitable regression models, the study identified key factors influencing the\nusage of financial instruments among low-income households. Transaction costs,\nconvenience, and financial knowledge emerged as significant determinants\nimpacting both usage decisions and the intensity of usage. The research\nunderscores the importance of addressing demand side factors to ensure\nwidespread financial services usage among low-income groups. Efforts to reduce\ntime costs, enhance product accessibility and liquidity, and augment financial\nliteracy are essential for fostering financial inclusion in unauthorized\ncolonies. The findings highlight the imperative of moving beyond mere financial\naccess towards promoting universal usage to realize the full benefits of\nfinancial inclusion.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"k34jixdG9LywSVpgQIMf_Ji9F3RF8bMPC5jM3IA85kE","pdfSize":"1025379"}
