We give the first explicit proof of this\nclaim by expressing them in terms of \"partition Eisenstein series'', extensions\nof the classical Eisenstein series $E_{2k}(q)$ defined by $$\\lambda=(1^{m_1},\n2^{m_2},\\dots, n^{m_n}) \\vdash n \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\longmapsto \\ \\ \\ \\ \\\nE_{\\lambda}(q):= E_2(q)^{m_1} E_4(q)^{m_2}\\cdots E_{2n}(q)^{m_n}. $$ For\nfunctions $\\phi : \\mathcal{P}\\mapsto \\mathbb{C}$ on partitions, the weight $2n$\npartition Eisenstein trace is $$ \\text{Tr}_n(\\phi;q):=\\sum_{\\lambda \\vdash n}\n\\phi(\\lambda)E_{\\lambda}(q). $$ For all $t$, we prove that\n$U_{2t}(q)=\\text{Tr}_t(\\phi_U;q)$ and $V_{2t}(q)=\\text{Tr}_t(\\phi_V;q),$ where\n$\\phi_U$ and $\\phi_V$ are natural partition weights, giving the first explicit\nquasimodular formulas for these series.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FnLVQtBVIo0K4hcb48K2bKkAB1RfafA35qjX0gob4bU","pdfSize":"187617"}
