We\npresent a 3D re-entrant cavity filter designed for frequency-multiplexed\nreadout of superconducting qubits. The cavity filter is situated out of the\nplane of the qubit circuit and capacitively couples to an array of on-chip\nreadout resonators in a manner that can scale to large qubit arrays. The\nre-entrant cavity functions as a large-linewidth bandpass filter with intrinsic\nPurcell filtering. We demonstrate the concept with a four-qubit multiplexed\ndevice.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TBN0xbUqUZJyHVgD2o7Z2K4CZ0Ag6Nm6fFGPzndFnLQ","pdfSize":"3329671"}
