  "abstract": "  Mutual-visibility sets were motivated by visibility in distributed systems\nand social networks, and intertwine with several classical mathematical areas.\nMonotone properties of the variety of mutual-visibility sets, and restrictions\nof such sets to convex and isometric subgraphs are studied. Dual\nmutual-visibility sets are shown to be intrinsically different from other types\nof mutual-visibility sets. It is proved that for every finite subset $Z$ of\npositive integers there exists a graph $G$ that has a dual mutual-visibility\nset of size $i$ if and only if $i\\in Z\\cup \\{0\\}$, while for the other types of\nmutual-visibility such a set consists of consecutive integers. Visibility\npolynomials are introduced and their properties derived. As a surprise, every\npolynomial with nonnegative integer coefficients and with a constant term $1$\nis a dual visibility polynomial of some graph. Characterizations are given for\ntotal mutual-visibility sets, for graphs with total mutual-visibility number\n$1$, and for sets which are not total mutual-visibility sets, yet every proper\nsubset is such. Along the way an earlier result from the literature is\ncorrected.\n",
