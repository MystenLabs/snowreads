We establish\nexistence and uniqueness of the solution. A maximum principle is proved and\nused to derive uniqueness. Existence is established by providing a stochastic\nrepresentation based on anomalous processes constructed as a time change via\nthe undershooting of an independent subordinator. This leads to general\nnon-stepped processes with intervals of constancy representing a sticky or\ntrapping effect. Our theory allows these intervals to be dependent on the\nimmediately subsequent jump. These processes include scaling limit of suitable\ncoupled continuous time random walks previously studied in applications, in\nparticular in the context of anomalous diffusion and option pricing. Here we\nexploit our general theory to obtain a non-local analog of the Black and\nScholes equation, addressing the problem of determining the seasoned price of a\nderivative security, in case the price fluctuations are described by a process\nwhose jumps are dependent on the previous interval.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MY1N-W1uMLHEpfZbFYUtV02U3TufdQfvFEkEIgTjv78","pdfSize":"857719"}
