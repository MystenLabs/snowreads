We prove\nthat the injective dimension of every unit Frobenius module $M$ in the category\nof unit Frobenius modules is at most\n$\\operatorname{dim}(\\operatorname{Supp}_R(M))+1$. We further show that for unit\nCartier modules the same bound holds over any noetherian $F$-finite ring $A$ of\nprime characteristic $p$. This shows that $\\dim A+1$ is a uniform upper bound\nfor the injective dimension of any unit Cartier module over a noetherian\n$F$-finite ring $A$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"0Io3QQqfr0MpL3qkY9Gw9LOKOX9S7KbPKnY5VRgyOUs","pdfSize":"155792"}
