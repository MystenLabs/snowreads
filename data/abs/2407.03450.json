A smoking gun signal for $\\mu \\rightarrow\ne$ conversion is a monochromatic electron with energy almost equal to the muon\nmass. We show that light new physics can mimic this signature and that it can\nalso lead to electrons above the $\\mu \\rightarrow e$ signal peak. A concrete\nexample of such light new physics is $\\mu^- $-nucleon annihilation into a light\ndark sector, which can produce an energetic $e^-$ as well as $e^+e^-$\nbyproducts. Due to the size of the muon mass, the exotic muon capture process\ncan be kinematically allowed, while the otherwise stringent constraints, e.g.,\nfrom proton decay, are kinematically forbidden. We also discuss other relevant\nconstraints, including those from the stability of nuclei and muon capture in\nthe interior of neutron stars.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bOUAZiEWZP4hepREFupjYVnsrLtikgQZVtlM15tSZQM","pdfSize":"1772444"}
