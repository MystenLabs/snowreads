We model the evolution of liquidity profiles\nas measure-valued processes and characterize their dynamics under continuous\ntrading. Our analysis encompasses two critical aspects of CLMMs: the mechanics\nof concentrated liquidity provision and the strategic behavior of arbitrageurs.\nWe examine three distinct arbitrage models -- myopic, finite-horizon, and\ninfinite-horizon with discounted and ergodic controls -- and derive closed-form\nsolutions for optimal arbitrage strategies under each scenario. Importantly, we\ndemonstrate that the presence of trading fees fundamentally constrains the\nadmissible price processes, as the inclusion of fees precludes the existence of\ndiffusion terms in the price process to avoid infinite fee generation. This\nfinding has significant implications for CLMM design and market efficiency.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance","Quantitative Finance/Trading and Market Microstructure"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qr8NBtmOVX1ZWifAtP48hZtdzUcwSdXkzV6QLyqL3FA","pdfSize":"2152516"}
