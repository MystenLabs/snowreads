Given a filtration of data, the\npersistence barcode tracks the evolution of its homology groups. In this paper,\nwe introduce a new type of barcode, called the harmonic chain barcode, which\ntracks the evolution of harmonic chains. In addition, we show that the harmonic\nchain barcode is stable. Given a filtration of a simplicial complex of size\n$m$, we present an algorithm to compute its harmonic chain barcode in $O(m^3)$\ntime. Consequently, the harmonic chain barcode can enrich the family of\ntopological descriptors in applications where a persistence barcode is\napplicable, such as feature vectorization and machine learning.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computational Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bb-bwfj0BA58e48f2MPGFb7SKz5rnhPl440OsgizpZk","pdfSize":"837223"}
