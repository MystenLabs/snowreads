Standard arguments for its existence hinge on the elimination of\ncertain modes of the electromagnetic field because of the boundary conditions\nin the Casimir cavity. As such, it has been suggested that the ground state\nenergy of the vacuum within the cavity may be reduced compared to the value\noutside. Could this have an effect on physical phenomena within the cavity? We\nstudy this Casimir energy and probe whether the critical temperature $T_c$ of a\nsuperconductor is altered when it is placed in the cavity. We do not detect any\nchange in $T_c$ larger than 12 microKelvin, but theoretically expect a change\non the order of 0.025 microKelvin, roughly 1000 times lower than our achieved\nsensitivity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LZm8G5cYDaAsSP2H_kIT63baCrFfxP3TpO2EmztGzGY","pdfSize":"650049"}
