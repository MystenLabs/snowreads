  "abstract": "  Magnetic relaxation in coordination compounds is largely dominated by the\ninteraction of the spin with phonons. Large zero-field splitting and exchange\ncoupling values have been empirically found to strongly suppress spin\nrelaxation and have been used as the main guideline for designing new molecular\ncompounds. Although a comprehensive understanding of spin-phonon relaxation has\nbeen achieved for mononuclear complexes, only a qualitative picture is\navailable for polynuclear compounds. Here we fill this critical knowledge gap\nby providing a full first-principle description of spin-phonon relaxation in an\nair-stable Co(II) dimer with both large single-ion anisotropy and exchange\ncoupling. Simulations reproduce the experimental relaxation data with excellent\naccuracy and provide a microscopic understanding of Orbach and Raman relaxation\npathways and their dependency on exchange coupling, zero-field splitting, and\nmolecular vibrations. Theory and numerical simulations show that increasing\ncluster nuclearity to just four cobalt units would lead to a complete\nsuppression of Raman relaxation. These results hold a general validity for\nsingle-molecule magnets, providing a deeper understanding of their relaxation\nand revised strategies for their improvement.\n",
