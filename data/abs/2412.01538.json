  "abstract": "  We employ the quasiparticle picture of entanglement evolution to obtain an\neffective description for the out-of-equilibrium Entanglement Hamiltonian at\nthe hydrodynamical scale following quantum quenches in free fermionic systems\nin two or more spatial dimensions. Specifically, we begin by applying\ndimensional reduction techniques in cases where the geometry permits, building\ndirectly on established results from one-dimensional systems. Subsequently, we\ngeneralize the analysis to encompass a wider range of geometries. We obtain\nanalytical expressions for the entanglement Hamiltonian valid at the ballistic\nscale, which reproduce the known quasiparticle picture predictions for the\nRenyi entropies and full counting statistics. We also numerically validate the\nresults with excellent precision by considering quantum quenches from several\ninitial configurations.\n",
