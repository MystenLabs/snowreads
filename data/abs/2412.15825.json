  "abstract": "  It is a well-known conjecture in $\\beta$-models and in their discrete\ncounterpart that, generically, external potentials should be ``off-critical''\n(or, equivalently, ``regular''). Exploiting the connection between minimizing\nmeasures and thin obstacle problems, we give a positive answer to this\nconjecture.\n",
