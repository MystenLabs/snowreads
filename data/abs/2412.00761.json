  "abstract": "  Machine unlearning is gaining increasing attention as a way to remove\nadversarial data poisoning attacks from already trained models and to comply\nwith privacy and AI regulations. The objective is to unlearn the effect of\nundesired data from a trained model while maintaining performance on the\nremaining data. This paper introduces HyperForget, a novel machine unlearning\nframework that leverages hypernetworks - neural networks that generate\nparameters for other networks - to dynamically sample models that lack\nknowledge of targeted data while preserving essential capabilities. Leveraging\ndiffusion models, we implement two Diffusion HyperForget Networks and used them\nto sample unlearned models in Proof-of-Concept experiments. The unlearned\nmodels obtained zero accuracy on the forget set, while preserving good accuracy\non the retain sets, highlighting the potential of HyperForget for dynamic\ntargeted data removal and a promising direction for developing adaptive machine\nunlearning algorithms.\n",
