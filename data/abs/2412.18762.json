Unlike conventional OAM beams with\nhollow-shaped divergence patterns, the new proposed OAM beams provide uniform\nillumination across the target without a central energy void, but keep the\ninherent phase gradient of vortex property. We utilize waveguide slot antennas\nto generate four different modes of these novel OAM beams at X-band frequency.\nFurthermore, these different mode OAM beams are used to illuminate metal\nmodels, and the resulting RCS is compared with that obtained using plane waves.\nThe findings reveal that the novel OAM beams produce significant azimuthal RCS\ndiversity, providing a new approach for the detection of weak and small\ntargets.This study not only reveals the RCS diversity phenomenon based on novel\nOAM beams of different modes but also addresses the issue of energy divergence\nthat hinders traditional OAM beams in long-range detection applications.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computer Science/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"340DYqyaYuo5J8NTlnS1vppsYCOi2knk_ZtEd5roFfo","pdfSize":"4724114"}
