  "abstract": "  We mimic the mechanical response of touch mechanoreceptors by that of a gas\ncavity embedded in an elastic semi-cylinder, as a fingertip analogue. Using\ntribological experiments combined with optical imaging, we measure the dynamics\nand deformation of the cavity as the semi-cylinder is put in static contact or\nslid against model rough surfaces at constant normal force and velocity. We\npropose an elastic model to predict the cavity deformation under normal load\nshowing that membrane mechanical stresses are anisotropic and we discuss its\npossible biological consequences. In friction experiments, we show that the\ncavity shape fluctuations allow for texture discriminations.\n",
