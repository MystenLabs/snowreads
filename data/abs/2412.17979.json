  "abstract": "  PHICOIN (PHI) is a high-performance cryptocurrency based on the Proof-of-Work\n(PoW) mechanism. It aims to provide ordinary users with decentralized\nparticipation opportunities through an improved and innovative mining algorithm\nand fair design principles. PHI addresses the challenges of centralization in\ncryptocurrency mining by enhancing resistance to ASIC and FPGA devices and\npromoting fair participation. This paper outlines the technical specifications,\nmission, and roadmap for PHI, highlighting its potential to become a\nfoundational infrastructure for PoW cryptocurrencies.\n",
