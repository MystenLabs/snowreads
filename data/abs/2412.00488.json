Cleanup\nmethods are essential for robust computation within a VSA. However, cleanup\nmethods for continuous-value encodings are not as effective. In this paper, we\npresent an iterative optimization method to decode and clean up Fourier\nHolographic Reduced Representation (FHRR) vectors that are encoding continuous\nvalues. We combine composite likelihood estimation (CLE) and maximum likelihood\nestimation (MLE) to ensure convergence to the global optimum. We also\ndemonstrate that this method can effectively decode FHRR vectors under\ndifferent noise conditions, and show that it outperforms existing methods.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"AT66wdkQa6-DY_mdKRvA_75pM0Y4FeFng3mpvI7hbxM","pdfSize":"827396"}
