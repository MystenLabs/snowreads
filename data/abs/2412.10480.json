It\nhas been shown that the evolved combined state of such qubits may be either a\nseparable or an entangled state depending on the nature and parameters of the\npotential, although it is impossible to travel from one maximally entangled\nstate to another in the topological space by continuously varying such\nparameters without crossing an intermediate separable state, and vice-versa.\nThe possible theoretical constructs of such interaction potentials required for\nrotating a qubit state through the two angular directions on its Bloch sphere\nare illustrated, and consequently a novel method of qubit phase measurement by\ncopying it to other qubits is explored. Furthermore, the possibility of\nentanglement generation between two qubits by initially violating energy\nconservation while conserving energy at the end is described, and the non-local\nmanipulation of the degree of entanglement is illustrated. Such investigations\non the separability/entanglement between interacting qubits suggest that\nfurther extensive study on the fundamental quantum paradoxes as well as the\nbasic decoherence models are also necessary for advancing the field of quantum\ntechnology in general.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"T4p8bc_gl492kw04dCoZG9SkSqgve2RRH8WA_oE5DrQ","pdfSize":"1078694"}
