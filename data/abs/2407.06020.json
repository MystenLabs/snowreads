Our\nmodel predicts sub-ion-scale reconnection rates significantly higher than those\npertaining to large-scale reconnection, aligning with recent observations and\nsimulations. We apply this reconnection model to the problem of inverse\nmagnetic-energy transfer at sub-ion scales. We derive time-dependent scaling\nlaws for the magnetic energy decay and the typical magnetic structure\ndimensions that differ from those previously found in the MHD regime. These\nscaling laws are validated via two- and three-dimensional simulations,\ndemonstrating that sub-ion scale magnetic fields can reach large, system-size\nscales via successive coalescence.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2bO8R6ytkDtW4lN5QOkbwgP0zQvKSuC0xenos_z-w98","pdfSize":"710338"}
