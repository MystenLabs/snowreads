CIL's success in\ndomains like computer vision inspired our SED-tailored method, addressing the\nunique challenges of diverse and complex audio environments. Our approach\nemploys an independent unsupervised learning framework with a distillation loss\nfunction to integrate new sound classes while preserving the SED model\nconsistency across incremental tasks. We further enhance this framework with a\nsample selection strategy for unlabeled data and a balanced exemplar update\nmechanism, ensuring varied and illustrative sound representations. Evaluating\nvarious continual learning methods on the DCASE 2023 Task 4 dataset, we find\nthat our research offers insights into each method's applicability for\nreal-world SED systems that can have newly added sound classes. The findings\nalso delineate future directions of CIL in dynamic audio settings.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Sound"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QesgFLjG2vAafyz7BMn_uP1zm7P58EgGAwCIDb4PnRI","pdfSize":"578809"}
