  "abstract": "  We systematically investigate $f-$mode oscillations ($\\ell$ = 2) in\nquarkyonic neutron stars with dark matter, employing the Cowling approximation\nwithin the framework of linearized general relativity. The relativistic\nmean-field approach is used to compute various macroscopic properties of\nneutron stars. The analysis focuses on three key free parameters in the model:\ntransition density, QCD confinement scale, and dark matter (DM) Fermi momentum,\nall of which significantly affect the properties of $f-$mode oscillations. The\ninclusion of dark matter in quarkyonic equations of state leads to notable\nvariations in $f-$mode frequencies. Despite these changes, several universal\nrelations among the oscillation properties are found to hold, demonstrating\ntheir robustness in the presence of dark matter.\n",
