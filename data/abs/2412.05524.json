  "abstract": "  The birth mass function of neutron stars encodes rich information about\nsupernova explosions, double star evolution, and properties of matter under\nextreme conditions. To date, it has remained poorly constrained by\nobservations, however. Applying probabilistic corrections to account for mass\naccreted by recycled pulsars in binary systems to mass measurements of 90\nneutron stars, we find that the birth masses of neutron stars can be described\nby a unimodal distribution that smoothly turns on at\n$\\mathbf{\\unit[1.1]{\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}}}$, peaks at $\\mathbf{\\approx\n\\unit[1.27]{\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}}}$, before declining as a steep power law. Such\na ``turn-on\" power-law distribution is strongly favoured against the\nwidely-adopted empirical double-Gaussian model at the $\\mathbf{3\\sigma}$ level.\nThe power-law shape may be inherited from the initial mass function of massive\nstars, but the relative dearth of massive neutron stars implies that single\nstars with initial masses greater than $\\mathbf{\\approx\n\\unit[18]{\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}}}$ do not form neutron stars, in agreement with\nthe absence of massive red supergiant progenitors to supernovae.\n",
