We employ the theory of\nreproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, together with regularization to recover the\nsusceptibility of two- and three-dimensional scattering media. Numerical\nexamples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed reconstruction method.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vAZHgHJ35M-46M8M68gem3pL3NOm6nlsJCCNvPKNK30","pdfSize":"1781068"}
