Starting from a stochastic process\ngiven by a Langevin equation, different drift-diffusion equations can be\nderived depending on the choice of the discretization rule $ 0 \\leq \\alpha \\leq\n1$. We initially study the case of periodic heterogeneous diffusion without\ndrift and we determine a general result for the effective diffusion coefficient\n$D_{{\\it eff}}$, which is valid for any value of $\\alpha$. We study the case of\nperiodic sinusoidal diffusion in detail and we find a relationship with\nLegendre functions. Then, we derive $D_{{\\it eff}}$ for general $\\alpha$ in the\ncase of diffusion with periodic spatial noise and in the presence of a drift\nterm, generalizing the Lifson-Jackson theorem. Our results are illustrated by\nanalytical and numerical calculations on generic periodic choices for drift and\ndiffusion terms.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"fICBaUMLcjv-nbm59fZJAkYBVvO2OG1WYp_q8ddmS9g","pdfSize":"1303242","objectId":"0x6fe8f555aa219037b12b98c25cf7c25a55153a2347013b580edadc4948249697","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
