  "abstract": "  This study investigates the spatio-temporal patterns of Bike Sharing System\n(BSS) usage in six major cities: New York, London, Tokyo, Boston, Chicago and\nWashington D.C. By analyzing data over a 30-day period with comparable climate\nand average temperatures, we explored differences in BSS usage between weekdays\nand weekends in those cities using Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) and rank\ndistribution analysis. Our findings reveal significant temporal differences in\nBSS usage that were commonly observed in all cities, with weekday patterns\ndominated by commute peaks and weekend patterns reflecting recreational\nactivities. Friday emerges as a transitional day, sharing the characteristics\nof both weekdays and weekends. Meanwhile, docking station usage rank\ndistributions show remarkable consistency between weekdays and weekends for\nmost cities, with London being a unique anomaly. This study highlights the\npotential of BSS data to uncover urban mobility patterns and the underlying\nstructures of cities. The results suggest that BSS usage reflects both\nintrinsic user behavior and external influences such as urban planning.\n",
