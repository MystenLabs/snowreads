  "abstract": "  We investigate the phenomenon of entanglement harvesting for a spacetime in\nquantum superposition, using two Unruh-DeWitt detectors interacting with a\nquantum scalar field where the spacetime background is modeled as a\nsuperposition of two quotient Minkowski spaces which are not related by\ndiffeomorphisms. Our results demonstrate that the superposed nature of\nspacetime induces interference effects that can significantly enhance\nentanglement for both twisted and untwisted field. We compute the concurrence,\nwhich quantifies the harvested entanglement, as function of the energy gap of\ndetectors and their separation. We find that it reaches its maximum when we\ncondition the final spacetime superposition state to match the initial\nspacetime state. Notably, for the twisted field, the parameter region without\nentanglement exhibits a significant deviation from that observed in classical\nMinkowski space or a single quotient Minkowski space.\n",
