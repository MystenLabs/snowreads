If this symmetry is not assumed, the result is a new theory, such as\nEinstein's attempted Unified Field Theory or Moffat's Nonsymmetric\nGravitational Theory. Explicitly enforcing the constraint by means of a\nLagrange-multiplier term restores Einstein's field equations, but the\nmultiplier appears as an additional, unconstrained antisymmetric term. We\nbriefly discuss the possible significance of this term with respect to a\nnonvanishing cosmological angular momentum, a sourced spin current, the\nnonsymmetric nature of the Einstein pseudotensor characterizing the\nenergy-momentum of the gravitational field, and possible implications on\nattempts to obtain a quantum theory of gravity.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"i-olCOo2-bY82NdyCyafjtL7QAJojTznwlwRxRwvU1A","pdfSize":"115423"}
