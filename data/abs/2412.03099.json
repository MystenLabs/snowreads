The main result establishes a\ncorrespondence between local formal invariants and jets of meromorphic\nquadratic differentials. This result is then utilized to describe the parameter\nspace of universal isomonodromic deformation of meromorphic\n$\\mathfrak{sl}_2(\\mathbb{C})$-connections over Riemann surfaces.\n  The second part examines the confluence of singularities in a fully general\nsetting, accommodating all forms of degeneracies. It explores the relationship\nbetween the geometry of the unfolded Stokes phenomenon and the horizontal and\nvertical foliations of parametric families of quadratic differentials. The\nlocal moduli space is naturally identified with a specific space of local\nmonodromy and Stokes data, presented as a space of representations of certain\nfundamental groupoids associated with the foliations. This is then used for\nstudying degenerations of isomonodromic deformations in parametric families.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pgTpm4dlVXZrFoB73-jwo6PpcSD_FewXzHiTh1iuRVU","pdfSize":"3481487"}
