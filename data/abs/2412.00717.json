In a setting where there is some uncertainty, we ask\nhow to best select $k$ potential solutions, with the goal of optimizing the\nvalue of the best solution. More formally, given a combinatorial problem $\\Pi$,\na set of value functions $V$ over the solutions of $\\Pi$, and a distribution\n$D$ over $V$, our goal is to select $k$ solutions of $\\Pi$ that maximize or\nminimize the expected value of the {\\em best} of those solutions. For a simple\nexample, consider the classic knapsack problem: given a universe of elements\neach with unit weight and a positive value, the task is to select $r$ elements\nmaximizing the total value. Now suppose that each element's weight comes from a\n(known) distribution. How should we select $k$ different solutions so that one\nof them is likely to yield a high value?\n  In this work, we tackle this basic problem, and generalize it to the setting\nwhere the underlying set system forms a matroid. On the technical side, it is\nclear that the candidate solutions we select must be diverse and\nanti-correlated; however, it is not clear how to do so efficiently. Our main\nresult is a polynomial-time algorithm that constructs a portfolio within a\nconstant factor of the optimal.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"51Uj1apShEIxYBbh3mYDG0ffydhL9V5qweqnK4qEvBg","pdfSize":"530814"}
