  "abstract": "  This study addresses the challenge of predicting electric vehicle (EV)\ncharging profiles in urban locations with limited data. Utilizing a neural\nnetwork architecture, we aim to uncover latent charging profiles influenced by\nspatio-temporal factors. Our model focuses on peak power demand and daily load\nshapes, providing insights into charging behavior. Our results indicate\nsignificant impacts from the type of Basic Administrative Units on predicted\nload curves, which contributes to the understanding and optimization of EV\ncharging infrastructure in urban settings and allows Distribution System\nOperators (DSO) to more efficiently plan EV charging infrastructure expansion.\n",
