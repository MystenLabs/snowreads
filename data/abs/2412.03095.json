This study presents a decentralized\ntracking framework utilizing a Consensus-Based Estimation Filter (CBEF)\nintegrated with the Nearly-Constant-Velocity (NCV) model to predict a moving\ntarget's state. The framework facilitates agents in a network to\ncollaboratively estimate the target's position by sharing local observations\nand achieving consensus despite communication constraints and measurement\nnoise. A saturation-based filtering technique is employed to enhance robustness\nby mitigating the impact of noisy sensor data. Simulation results demonstrate\nthat the proposed method effectively reduces the Mean Squared Estimation Error\n(MSEE) over time, indicating improved estimation accuracy and reliability. The\nfindings underscore the effectiveness of the CBEF in decentralized\nenvironments, highlighting its scalability and resilience in the presence of\nuncertainties.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Multiagent Systems","Computer Science/Robotics","Computer Science/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZZ6risUtQTrQ8V-ESnidG8r1wuYH4cRT3ebueBJAPic","pdfSize":"585623"}
