  "abstract": "  Networks should connect communicating peers, supporting vertical services\nrequirements. The network evolution towards 6G requires native network slicing\ntechniques. Some literature approaches claim network slice realization, but\nthey do not convincingly address the deployment across multiple Autonomous\nSystems. This work investigates the current 6G network slicing landscape,\npresents some gaps, and introduces the concept of the recursive network slicing\nbetween multiple Autonomous Systems, supported by the NASOR approach. This\ninnovative concept supports implementing new network services required by the\n6G vision. This work also sheds light on the 6G requirements for network\nslicing.\n",
