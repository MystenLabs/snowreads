  "abstract": "  The stochastic block model (SBM) is a fundamental tool for community\ndetection in networks, yet the finite-sample performance of inference methods\nremains underexplored. We evaluate key algorithms-spectral methods, variational\ninference, and Gibbs sampling-under varying conditions, including\nsignal-to-noise ratios, heterogeneous community sizes, and multimodality. Our\nresults highlight significant performance variations: spectral methods,\nespecially SCORE, excel in computational efficiency and scalability, while\nGibbs sampling dominates in small, well-separated networks. Variational\nExpectation-Maximization strikes a balance between accuracy and cost in larger\nnetworks but struggles with optimization in highly imbalanced settings. These\nfindings underscore the practical trade-offs among methods and provide\nactionable guidance for algorithm selection in real-world applications. Our\nresults also call for further theoretical investigation in SBMs with complex\nstructures. The code can be found at https://github.com/Toby-X/SBM_computation.\n",
