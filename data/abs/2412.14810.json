However, managing missing data\nremains a significant challenge in real-world applications. We introduce MARIA\n(Multimodal Attention Resilient to Incomplete datA), a novel transformer-based\ndeep learning model designed to address these challenges through an\nintermediate fusion strategy. Unlike conventional approaches that depend on\nimputation, MARIA utilizes a masked self-attention mechanism, which processes\nonly the available data without generating synthetic values. This approach\nenables it to effectively handle incomplete datasets, enhancing robustness and\nminimizing biases introduced by imputation methods. We evaluated MARIA against\n10 state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning models across 8\ndiagnostic and prognostic tasks. The results demonstrate that MARIA outperforms\nexisting methods in terms of performance and resilience to varying levels of\ndata incompleteness, underscoring its potential for critical healthcare\napplications.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"P2tp-vSPftasOXU4PrQ1Lt6z8-nfcsKa_L5-cms75F4","pdfSize":"835656"}
