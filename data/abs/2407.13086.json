In addition, by\nlooking into the asymptotic expansion of the fourth level expected signature of\nthe Brownian loop based at $x\\in M$, one can explicitly reconstruct both\nintrinsic (Ricci curvature) and extrinsic (second fundamental form) curvature\nproperties of $M$ at $x$. As independent interest, we also derive the intrinsic\nPDE for the expected Brownian signature dynamics on $M$ from the perspective of\nthe Eells-Elworthy-Malliavin horizontal lifting.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"NFCbFv7acWX-95nwmu7xGR1YiETxYQTuWI0uhzkJBpw","pdfSize":"939967","objectId":"0x963c675c531ef0e8bf7f4d0f401b8d8b72ab847f757fc23867b7ac5c21e25c7a","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
