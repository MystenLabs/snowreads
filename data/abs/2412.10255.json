  "abstract": "  Animation has gained significant interest in the recent film and TV industry.\nDespite the success of advanced video generation models like Sora, Kling, and\nCogVideoX in generating natural videos, they lack the same effectiveness in\nhandling animation videos. Evaluating animation video generation is also a\ngreat challenge due to its unique artist styles, violating the laws of physics\nand exaggerated motions. In this paper, we present a comprehensive system,\nAniSora, designed for animation video generation, which includes a data\nprocessing pipeline, a controllable generation model, and an evaluation\ndataset. Supported by the data processing pipeline with over 10M high-quality\ndata, the generation model incorporates a spatiotemporal mask module to\nfacilitate key animation production functions such as image-to-video\ngeneration, frame interpolation, and localized image-guided animation. We also\ncollect an evaluation benchmark of 948 various animation videos, the evaluation\non VBench and human double-blind test demonstrates consistency in character and\nmotion, achieving state-of-the-art results in animation video generation. Our\nevaluation benchmark will be publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/bilibili/Index-anisora.\n",
