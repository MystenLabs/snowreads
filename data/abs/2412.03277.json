However, we argue FIDO2\nhas broader potential applications. In this paper, we introduce EAP-FIDO, a\nnovel Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) method for use in IEEE\n802.1X-protected networks. This allows organisations with WPA2/3-Enterprise\nwireless networks or MACSec-enabled wired networks to leverage FIDO2's\npasswordless authentication in compliance with existing standards.\nAdditionally, we provide a comprehensive security and performance analysis to\nsupport the feasibility of this approach.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"8Km0odU3O1EUVr2JGtanC_gAAKBrqrgKLCbE31M22AQ","pdfSize":"1989009"}
