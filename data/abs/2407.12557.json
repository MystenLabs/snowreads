Managing\nthese systems requires robust predictive models for degradation behaviour. This\nstudy focuses on probability-based approaches, particularly Markov chains, for\ntheir ability to associate random variables with degradation. Literature\npredominantly uses homogeneous and inhomogeneous Markov chains for this\npurpose. However, their effectiveness in sewer pipe degradation modelling is\nstill debatable. Some studies support homogeneous Markov chains, while others\nchallenge their utility. We examine this issue using a large-scale sewer\nnetwork in the Netherlands, incorporating historical inspection data. We model\ndegradation with homogeneous discrete and continuous time Markov chains, and\ninhomogeneous-time Markov chains using Gompertz, Weibull, Log-Logistic and\nLog-Normal density functions. Our analysis suggests that, despite their higher\ncomputational requirements, inhomogeneous-time Markov chains are more\nappropriate for modelling the nonlinear stochastic characteristics related to\nsewer pipe degradation, particularly the Gompertz distribution. However, they\npose a risk of over-fitting, necessitating significant improvements in\nparameter inference processes to effectively address this issue.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5ixN2ssCd4ImBXsfCXfi-OvvOzjkTgQP1_rknLF_85U","pdfSize":"1545941"}
