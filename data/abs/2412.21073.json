  "abstract": "  We developed a phase correction method for broadband terahertz time-domain\nspectroscopy in reflection geometry, which allows us to obtain quantitative and\naccurate values for the complex refractive index of materials. The process is\nanalytical, based on the Kramers-Kronig relations, and does not require any\ncomputationally intensive algorithms. We validate it by extracting the\nrefractive index of silicon, obtaining the nominal value with an accuracy\nbetter than 2.5\\% over the 0.25--3.5 THz range, and better than 0.6\\% in the\n1--2 THz range. We use the method to experimentally observe that an undoped\nInSb crystal shows a refractive index of $n<1$ between 1 and 2 THz, in\nproximity to the plasma frequency of the material where, the amplitude of the\ngroup velocity goes as low as 0.08$c$.\n",
