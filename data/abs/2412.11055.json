  "abstract": "  Let $\\tau$ be an uncountable cardinal. The notion of a \\emph{$\\tau$-fine}\ntopological group was introduced in 2021. More recently, H. Zhang et al.\ngeneralized this concept by defining pseudo-$\\tau$-fine topological groups to\nstudy certain factorization properties of continuous functions on topological\ngroups. It is known that $\\tau$-fineness cannot coexist with precompactness in\ntopological groups with uncountable character. In this paper, we investigate\nthis problem further. We prove that, in topological groups with uncountable\npseudocharacter, precompactness can coexist with pseudo-$\\tau$-fineness for\nsome bounded $\\tau$ but pseudocompactness can never.\n",
