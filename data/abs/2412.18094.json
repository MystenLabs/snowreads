  "abstract": "  Advanced three-dimensional (3D) tracking methods are essential for studying\nparticle dynamics across a wide range of complex systems, including multiphase\nflows, environmental and atmospheric sciences, colloidal science, biological\nand medical research, and industrial manufacturing processes. This review\nprovides a comprehensive summary of 3D particle tracking and flow diagnostics\nusing Digital Holography (DH). We begin by introducing the principles of DH,\naccompanied by a detailed discussion on numerical reconstruction. The review\nthen explores various hardware setups used in DH, including inline, off-axis,\nand dual or multiple-view configurations, outlining their advantages and\nlimitations. We also delve into different hologram processing methods,\ncategorized into traditional multi-step, inverse, and machine learning-based\napproaches, providing in-depth insights into their applications for 3D particle\ntracking and flow diagnostics across multiple studies. The review concludes\nwith a discussion on future prospects, emphasizing the significant role of\nmachine learning in enabling accurate DH-based particle tracking and flow\ndiagnostic techniques across diverse fields, such as manufacturing,\nenvironmental monitoring, and biological sciences.\n",
