Using a four-dimensional evaluation model that focuses on 1)\ntechnical content, 2) structural coherence, 3) writing precision, and 4)\nethical integrity, this framework not only standardizes review and publication\nprocesses but also serves as a practical guide for authors in preparing\nhigh-quality manuscripts. Each of these four dimensions cannot be compromised\nfor the sake of another. Following that, we discuss the components of a\nresearch paper adhering to the four-dimensional evaluation model in detail by\nproviding guidelines and principles. By aligning manuscripts with journal\nstandards, reducing review bias, and enhancing transparency, the framework\ncontributes to more reliable and reproducible research results. Moreover, by\nstrengthening cross-disciplinary credibility, improving publication\nconsistency, and fostering public trust in academic literature, this initiative\nis expected to positively influence both research quality and scholarly\npublishing's reputation.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Digital Libraries"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YkT0jNeo6CkixongDrxnKIIIV7vNYbNFjHWvfnB4LrM","pdfSize":"855949"}
