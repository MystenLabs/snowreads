  "abstract": "  This note initiates the study of the Fatou\\,--\\,Julia sets of a complex\nharmonic mapping. Along with some fundamental properties of the Fatou and the\nJulia sets, we observe some contrasting behaviour of these sets as those with\nin case of a holomorphic function. The existence of harmonic mapping with a\nwandering domain is also shown.\n",
