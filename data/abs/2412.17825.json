We conduct this experiment\non the SemEval 2019 task 6, OLID, dataset. First, we utilize pre-trained\nlanguage models to predict the sentiment of each instance. Later we pick the\nmodel that achieved the best performance on the OLID test set, and train it on\nthe augmented OLID set to analyze the performance. Results show that utilizing\nsentiment increases the overall performance of the model.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"HwiaX7uIX78ICHrHUJCkSJGE2HthTEpoL3PImtKK5i0","pdfSize":"450215"}
