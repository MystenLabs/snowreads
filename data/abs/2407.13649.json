By giving a sufficient condition on the initial\ndata and using the nonlinear structure of the compressible Euler equations, we\nshow that the decay rate of the first order transversal derivative of the\nnormalized density is better than that of the same derivative of a free wave,\nprovided that the perturbation arising from the tangential derivatives can be\nproperly controlled for all $t$ by using a bootstrap argument. Based on this\nkey analysis, we construct global exterior solutions in $H^4$ for the broad\nclass of data, with a rather general subclass forming rarefaction at null\ninfinity. Our result does not require smallness on the transversal derivatives\nof classical data, thus applies to data with a total energy of any size.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KPuthd7ZRuKTuuFCpXlnD0liLZXb89wgiqf6RL1A6ss","pdfSize":"1899169"}
