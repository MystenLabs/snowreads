Proposed\nsolutions aim to capture minority perspectives by either modelling annotator\ndisagreements or grouping annotators based on shared metadata, both of which\nface significant challenges. We propose a framework that trains models without\nencoding annotator metadata, extracts latent embeddings informed by annotator\nbehaviour, and creates clusters of similar opinions, that we refer to as\nvoices. Resulting clusters are validated post-hoc via internal and external\nquantitative metrics, as well a qualitative analysis to identify the type of\nvoice that each cluster represents. Our results demonstrate the strong\ngeneralisation capability of our framework, indicated by resulting clusters\nbeing adequately robust, while also capturing minority perspectives based on\ndifferent demographic factors throughout two distinct datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OciJrssCkpLegUQF2xVkANs_LFC1EXZHb0qUf4sIHQM","pdfSize":"958483","objectId":"0x9c7f911f172aea0de54abeb7bd14986f3083924323c3a368dd5a4437dd57a076","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
