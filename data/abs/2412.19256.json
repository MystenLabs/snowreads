However, they have inherent limitations when dealing with large-scale\noff-chain data, dynamic multi-step workflows, and scenarios requiring high\nflexibility or iterative updates. In this paper, we propose the concept of a\n\"Swarm Contract\" (Swarm), a multi-agent mechanism wherein several digital life\nforms (DLF) or Sovereign Agents (SA) collectively handle complex tasks in\nTrusted Execution Environments (TEE). These digital entities are defined as\nautonomous software agents that own their code, state, and possibly on-chain\nassets, while operating free from centralized control.\n  By leveraging a simple multi-signature wallet on-chain, Swarm moves most of\nthe logic off-chain, achieving trust minimization through multi-agent consensus\nrather than a single monolithic on-chain contract. We illustrate these ideas\nwith a lightweight off-chain auction example - minting and selling 10,000\nidentical NFTs - to showcase how off-chain coordination can determine a\nclearing price and finalize distribution, with each step performed collectively\nby multiple agents in TEE. This approach broadens the scope of trustless and\ndecentralized solutions, potentially benefiting DAO governance, multi-modal\ndata processing, and cross-chain interoperability.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uCyO11vp0mP10B3lARRGllr4AM0cnGC2xYlPN39LntM","pdfSize":"85660"}
