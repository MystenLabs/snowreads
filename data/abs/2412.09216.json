However, producing pure\nspin-current in insulating materials remains both challenging and desirable, as\ninsulating states are frequently found in antiferromagnets. Nonlinear\nphotogalvanic effects offer a promising method for generating spin-current in\ninsulators. We here revealed that spin and charge photocurrents in altermagnets\nare protected by spin point group symmetry. Unlike the photocurrents in\nparity-time symmetric materials, where spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induces a\nsignificant charge current, the spin-current in altermagnets can exist as a\npure spin current along specific crystal directions regardless of SOC. We\napplied our predictions using first-principles calculations to several distinct\nmaterials, including wurtzite MnTe and multiferroic BiFeO3. Additionally, we\nelucidated the previously overlooked linear-inject-current mechanism in BiFeO3\ninduced by SOC, which may account for the enhanced bulk photovotaic effect in\nmultiferroics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KL5IJ3ULuJJ2ZY9QCOsQ3G1hqF-GH05QY8DjjwV3H8k","pdfSize":"3255241"}
