Behavioral research provides little insight into\nwhether these applications are effective at alleviating loneliness. We address\nthis question by focusing on AI companions applications designed to provide\nconsumers with synthetic interaction partners. Studies 1 and 2 find suggestive\nevidence that consumers use AI companions to alleviate loneliness, by employing\na novel methodology for fine tuning large language models to detect loneliness\nin conversations and reviews. Study 3 finds that AI companions successfully\nalleviate loneliness on par only with interacting with another person, and more\nthan other activities such watching YouTube videos. Moreover, consumers\nunderestimate the degree to which AI companions improve their loneliness. Study\n4 uses a longitudinal design and finds that an AI companion consistently\nreduces loneliness over the course of a week. Study 5 provides evidence that\nboth the chatbots' performance and, especially, whether it makes users feel\nheard, explain reductions in loneliness. Study 6 provides an additional\nrobustness check for the loneliness alleviating benefits of AI companions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-qDHNuuhDigHHhEi2T7LbFKKnPM5feUVRvDnQJz230E","pdfSize":"1416604"}
