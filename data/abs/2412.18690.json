  "abstract": "  We introduce AgreeMate, a framework for training Large Language Models (LLMs)\nto perform strategic price negotiations through natural language. We apply\nrecent advances to a negotiation setting where two agents (i.e. buyer or\nseller) use natural language to bargain on goods using coarse actions.\nSpecifically, we present the performance of Large Language Models when used as\nagents within a decoupled (modular) bargaining architecture. We demonstrate\nthat using prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and chain-of-thought prompting\nenhances model performance, as defined by novel metrics. We use attention\nprobing to show model attention to semantic relationships between tokens during\nnegotiations.\n",
