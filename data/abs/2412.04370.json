The\nBayesian neural network (BNN) approach not only yields a continuous and smooth\ncalibration function that improves performance relative to the standard\ncalibration but also provides uncertainties on the calibrated energies for each\ntopo-cluster. The results obtained by using a trained BNN are compared to the\nstandard local hadronic calibration and to a calibration provided by training a\ndeep neural network. The uncertainties predicted by the BNN are interpreted in\nthe context of a fractional contribution to the systematic uncertainties of the\ntrained calibration. They are also compared to uncertainty predictions obtained\nfrom an alternative estimator employing repulsive ensembles.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"riUQtuhym9dvQLfp-F8oBx1X1e0oNbCoywhdBsCkqnM","pdfSize":"21973624"}
