However, real-world implementations of radiological AI-based\nsystems are found to provide little to no clinical value. This paper explores\nhow to design AI for clinical usefulness in different contexts. We conducted 19\ndesign sessions and design interventions with 13 radiologists from 7 clinical\nsites in Denmark and Kenya, based on three iterations of a functional AI-based\nprototype. Ten sociotechnical dependencies were identified as crucial for the\ndesign of AI in radiology. We conceptualised four technical dimensions that\nmust be configured to the intended clinical context of use: AI functionality,\nAI medical focus, AI decision threshold, and AI Explainability. We present four\ndesign recommendations on how to address dependencies pertaining to the medical\nknowledge, clinic type, user expertise level, patient context, and user\nsituation that condition the configuration of these technical dimensions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"0A8xI7zM9iTo8rb10yMuMRYB2ZaMhq4oWhYmzJzQFhQ","pdfSize":"21930904"}
