MPM-ParVI simulates\nthe deformation of a deformable body (e.g. a solid or fluid) under external\neffects driven by the target density; transient or steady configuration of the\ndeformable body approximates the target density. The continuum material is\nmodelled as an interacting particle system (IPS) using MPM, each particle\ncarries full physical properties, interacts and evolves following conservation\ndynamics. This easy-to-implement ParVI method offers deterministic sampling and\ninference for a class of probabilistic models such as those encountered in\nBayesian inference (e.g. intractable densities) and generative modelling (e.g.\nscore-based).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Statistics/Computation","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"OWbfynHQfrTDEEKGkfJg4h_CZKLb_D-HyWHvJxQhWdM","pdfSize":"897664"}
