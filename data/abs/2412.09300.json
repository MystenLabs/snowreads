  "abstract": "  This paper explores the behaviour of commuting Jordan derivations over prime\nrings with non-trivial idempotents and demonstrates that they become zero maps.\nFurther, it establishes this result for commuting Jordan higher derivations\nover prime rings under specific conditions. In fact, it introduces commuting\ngeneralized Jordan derivations over rings and establishes that the zero map is\nthe only commuting generalized Jordan derivation over prime rings under certain\nassumptions.\n",
