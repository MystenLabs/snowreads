In fact, it introduces commuting\ngeneralized Jordan derivations over rings and establishes that the zero map is\nthe only commuting generalized Jordan derivation over prime rings under certain\nassumptions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SMaxPyildLoUYs1FjMjR8ihq2iJ2r0cZjWC-oLF2kR8","pdfSize":"142349"}
