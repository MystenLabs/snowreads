While this effect is intuitively utilized in the design and\noptimization of plasmonic antennas, the relation between the magnitude of the\nelectric field and the local curvature of the plasmonic antenna has not been\nyet rigorously established. Here, we provide such a study. We design sets of\nplasmonic antennas that allow to isolate the role of the local curvature from\nother effects influencing the field. The near electric field is inspected by\nelectron energy loss spectroscopy and electrodynamic simulations. We\ndemonstrate the existence of the plasmonic lightning-rod effect and establish\nits quantitative description, showing that its strength is comparable to the\nelectrostatic lightning-rod effect. We also provide a simple phenomenological\nformula for the spatial dependence of the field. Finally, we introduce the\neffective radius of curvature related to the spatial distribution of induced\ncharge in plasmonic antennas, significantly smaller than their geometrical\nradius.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kn9nN21CzkOOwwqwBmN0i95jb6B1oO0Hc6WqxicgWZQ","pdfSize":"1050084"}
