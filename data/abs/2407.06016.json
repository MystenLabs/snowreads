Unlike daytime techniques, which often perform worse in nighttime\nscenes, it is essential for autonomous driving due to insufficient lighting,\nlow illumination, dynamic lighting, shadow effects, and reduced contrast. We\npropose RHRSegNet, implementing a relighting model over a High-Resolution\nNetwork for semantic segmentation. RHRSegNet implements residual convolutional\nfeature learning to handle complex lighting conditions. Our model then feeds\nthe lightened scene feature maps into a high-resolution network for scene\nsegmentation. The network consists of a convolutional producing feature maps\nwith varying resolutions, achieving different levels of resolution through\ndown-sampling and up-sampling. Large nighttime datasets are used for training\nand evaluation, such as NightCity, City-Scape, and Dark-Zurich datasets. Our\nproposed model increases the HRnet segmentation performance by 5% in low-light\nor nighttime images.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"MnfSqsNGp-lJFB0YzWR6u7w1Fe2BCoEmGTxdtO0F0AM","pdfSize":"4961263"}
