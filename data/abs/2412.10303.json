The Density Frame is a\nformulation of relativistic viscous hydrodynamics that is first-order in time,\nrequires no auxiliary fields, and has no non-hydrodynamic modes. We compare our\nresults to QCD kinetic theory simulations and find excellent agreement within\nthe regime of applicability of hydrodynamics. Additionally, the Density Frame\nresults remain well-behaved and robust near the boundary of applicability. We\nalso compare our findings to the second-order-in-time hydrodynamic theory\ndeveloped by Bemfica, Disconzi, Noronha, and Kovtun (BDNK) and a well-known\nM\\\"uller-Israel-Stewart-type hydrodynamics code, MUSIC, which is commonly used\nto simulate heavy-ion collisions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hS8nnngM74TE0-lxeGQcmL7Xm1sSN6Job4d7m7UkrJM","pdfSize":"1282944"}
