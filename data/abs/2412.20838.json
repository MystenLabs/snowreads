  "abstract": "  Accurate segmentation of wind turbine blade (WTB) images is critical for\neffective assessments, as it directly influences the performance of automated\ndamage detection systems. Despite advancements in large universal vision\nmodels, these models often underperform in domain-specific tasks like WTB\nsegmentation. To address this, we extend Intrinsic LoRA for image segmentation,\nand propose a novel dual-space augmentation strategy that integrates both\nimage-level and latent-space augmentations. The image-space augmentation is\nachieved through linear interpolation between image pairs, while the\nlatent-space augmentation is accomplished by introducing a noise-based latent\nprobabilistic model. Our approach significantly boosts segmentation accuracy,\nsurpassing current state-of-the-art methods in WTB image segmentation.\n",
