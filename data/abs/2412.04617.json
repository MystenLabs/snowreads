LSG can be found in building facades,\nimportant landmarks around the world, and every major form of transportation.\nYet, the assembly suffers from unwanted bubbles which are anathema to one of\nthe most important features of glass: optical transparency. In here, we present\nan in-depth study of the reasons behind these bubbles, either during\nhigh-temperature quality control tests or normal glass operating conditions. We\nprovide a physical model for bubble growth that deals with two gases, thermal\neffects on gas solubility and diffusivity, and a time-temperature dependent\nrheology. The model can be extended to n-component bubbles or other materials\nbeyond PVB. By combining experiments and theory, we show that two gases are at\nplay: air trapped in interfacial bubbles in the assembly during lamination and\nwater initially dissolved in the polymer bulk. Both gases work in tandem to\ninduce bubble growth in finished assemblies of LSG provided that (i) the\noriginal bubble nucleus has a critical size and (ii) the polymer relaxes\n(softens) sufficiently enough, especially at elevated temperatures. The latter\nconstraints are relaxed in a condition we termed anomalous air oversaturation\nthat may even trigger a catastrophic, yet beautiful ice flower instability.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zgfgVllq8G_rTCHvw6OYL_eDDKTOfBE7EPElPSfSV1I","pdfSize":"5564921"}
