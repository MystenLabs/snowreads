  "abstract": "  This letter aims to provide sensing capabilities for a potential\neavesdropper, while simultaneously enabling the secure communications with the\nlegitimate users in a cell-free multipleinput multiple-output system with\nlimited fronthaul links. In order to maximize the sensing performance, the\njoint design of fronthaul compression and beamforming is proposed considering\nthe constraints on the finite fronthaul-capacity links and the maximum power\nalong with the worst-case secrecy rate requirements. To this end, we propose an\nalgorithmic solution based on the minorization-maximization method and\nsemidefinite programming relaxation techniques, whose performance superiority\nis verified via simulations compared to the reference schemes such as\ndistributed sensing and random beamforming.\n",
