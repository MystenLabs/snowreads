By classifying the amplitude bases according to the polarization\nconfigurations of massive particles and using their high-energy limit, our\napproach can construct EFT basis in a straightforward way, without need of\nauxiliary fields and tedious basis decomposition. Based on this improved\nmethod, we develop a Mathematica code that can automatically construct the EFT\nbasis for particles of any spin. As applications, the EFT bases up to d=8 are\nexplicitly constructed for dark photons and, for the first time, for spin-3/2\ngravitino like particles.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jbebymmyWltdfrqbCXUeqCygOzMAKghyO99sGY08FPs","pdfSize":"1017581"}
