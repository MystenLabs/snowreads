The\npredominant measure for assessing movement is effective diffusivity, which\npredicts the mean-squared displacement of particles over long time scales. In\nthis work, we consider an alternative analysis regime that focuses on shorter\ntime scales and relies on automated segmentation of paths. Due to intrinsic\nuncertainty in changepoint analysis, we highlight the importance of statistical\nsummaries that are robust with respect to the performance of segmentation\nalgorithms. In contrast to effective diffusivity, which averages over multiple\nbehaviors, we emphasize tools that highlight the different motor-cargo states,\nwith an eye toward identifying biophysical mechanisms that determine emergent\nwhole-cell transport properties. By developing a Markov chain model for noisy,\ncontinuous, piecewise-linear microparticle movement, and associated\nmathematical analysis, we provide insight into a common question posed by\nexperimentalists: how does the choice of observational frame rate affect what\nis inferred about transport properties?\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QDU6_fqz_uC9b0tfokBiIiHDD3iA3Bd6L40wN5f2uS4","pdfSize":"2044846"}
