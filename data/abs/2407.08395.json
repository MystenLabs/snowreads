Many of\nthese parameters are related to single or multiple paddle stroke cycles.\nDetermining on- and offset of these cycles in force sensor signals is usually\nnot straightforward and requires human interaction. This paper explores\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in\nterms of their ability to automatically predict these events. In addition, our\nwork proposes an extension to the recently published SoftED metric for event\ndetection in order to properly assess the model performance on time windows. In\nour results, an RNN based on bidirectional gated recurrent units (BGRUs) turned\nout to be the most suitable model for paddle stroke detection.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QQ12fnkM8gFOUBLLsga6QgGitNErPPqhheHS84CWN8E","pdfSize":"393325","objectId":"0xbdbe0fa08f6c4531450a561488ad5c9e5f89fd526f822126366601a7fea88563","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
