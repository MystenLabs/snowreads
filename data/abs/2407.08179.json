Transparency is crucial, and individuals need\nexplanations to understand decisions, especially for the ones not desired by\nthe user. Ethical and legal considerations require informing individuals of\nchanges in input attribute values (features) that could lead to a desired\noutcome for the user. Our work aims to generate counterfactual explanations by\nconsidering causal dependencies between features. We present the CoGS\n(Counterfactual Generation with s(CASP)) framework that utilizes the\ngoal-directed Answer Set Programming system s(CASP) to generate counterfactuals\nfrom rule-based machine learning models, specifically the FOLD-SE algorithm.\nCoGS computes realistic and causally consistent changes to attribute values\ntaking causal dependencies between them into account. It finds a path from an\nundesired outcome to a desired one using counterfactuals. We present details of\nthe CoGS framework along with its evaluation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"HHwu57pxqMFAjzyS_8s7HuxEhs_IWxlvBbhg9paSubI","pdfSize":"761552"}
