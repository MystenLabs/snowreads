Since Chomsky proposed\ngenerative grammar, many scholars have studied recursion either theoretically\nor empirically. However, by observing children's acquisition of tail recursion\nsequences, we can verify the nativism of language supported by universal\ngrammar and reveal the cognitive mechanism of human brain. To date, our\nunderstanding of children's acquisition path of recursion and influencing\nfactors still remain controversial. This systematic review summarizes the\nresearch of tail recursive sequence by taking possessive recursion and locative\nrecursion as examples, focusing on the experimental methods, acquisition paths,\nand influencing factors of tail recursive sequence. The current behavioural\nexperiments reveal that, the debate about children's performance revolves\naround: 1) Gradual acquisition or synchronous acquisition. 2) symmetry or\nasymmetry between the acquisition of locative recursion sequences and\npossessive recursion sequences. We presume that children can acquire recursion\nquickly in a short period of time thanks to the language acquisition device,\nthough there are also scholars who believe that a third factor also plays a\nrole.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"vZ4IRAkpW0kHZ3JqSNveRJWkXy9VvXJLsBu0WDGlKoA","pdfSize":"1053024"}
