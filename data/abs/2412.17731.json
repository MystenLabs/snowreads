The proposed technique allows to\ndisseminate secure and precise TF signals between two fiber-opticconnected\nlocations, on a critical infrastructure, using both QKD and White Rabbit\ntechnique. This secure exchange allows the secret sharing of time information\nbetween two parties for the synchronization of distant clocks with the highest\nstability and traceable to the Italian time scale. When encrypted, time signals\nwould reveal to a third party no useful information about the synchronization\nstatus, providing a time stability two orders of magnitude worsened.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"MZzGq0iRvc9hT5bLVNkscPL64kN1oORq9EggEEF51pU","pdfSize":"3901473"}
