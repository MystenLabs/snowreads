In this\nwork, I present the same effect in a simple system, the driven underdamped\nBrownian motion. Using linear response theory, I show the appropriate limits\nwhere the Kibble-Zurek mechanism happens. The divergence of the relaxation\ntime, the high-temperature condition in the initial thermal equilibrium state,\na new Kibble-Zurek scaling at sudden processes, and the pausing effect in the\noptimal protocol are presented as consequences.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nvtcZLvpH5dMZyRe-LksWWXLD5XPTT_1Ehsud76oTQU","pdfSize":"307340"}
