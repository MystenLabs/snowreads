Other application domains like autonomous driving, bin picking, or\nsearch and rescue have shown that benchmarking platforms and approaches in\ncompetitive settings can advance their respective research fields, resulting in\nmore applicable systems under real-world conditions. For this paper, we\nanalyzed seven semi-structured, qualitative stakeholder interviews about\noutdoor cleaning, identified current needs as well as limitations, and\nconsidered those results for the development of a benchmarking scenario based\non the previous observations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"CgTXiqa5juzFOEtlyX7uNcTyonFHCmqhnNb0dEa62GY","pdfSize":"2096327"}
