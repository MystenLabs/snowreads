  "abstract": "  We present a numerical study to determine nucleation rates for magnetisation\nreversal within the Ising model (lattice gas model) in the low-temperature\nregime, a domain less explored in previous research. To achieve this, we\nimplemented the N-Fold way algorithm, a well-established method for\nlow-temperature simulations, alongside a novel, highly efficient cluster\nidentification algorithm. Our method can access nucleation rates up to 50\norders of magnitude lower than previously reported results. We examine three\ncases: homogeneous pure system, system with static impurities, and system with\nmobile impurities, where impurities are defined as sites with zero interactions\nwith neighbouring spins (spin value of impurities is set to 0). Classical\nnucleation theory holds across the entire temperature range studied in the\npaper, for both the homogeneous system and the static impurity case. However,\nin the case of mobile impurities, the umbrella sampling technique seems\nineffective at low mobility values. These findings provide valuable insights\ninto nucleation phenomena at low temperatures, contributing to theoretical and\nexperimental understanding.\n",
