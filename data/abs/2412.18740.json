Although the conjecture\nis known to be false in the infinite setting, we show that many interesting\nresults can still be recovered by imposing suitable chain conditions and\nconsidering carefully chosen elements called optimal elements. We use these\nelements to show that the union-closed conjecture holds for both finite and\ninfinite union-closed families such that the cardinality of any chain of sets\nis at most three. We also show that the conjecture holds for all nontrivial\ntopological spaces satisfying the descending chain condition on its open sets.\nNotably, none of those arguments depend on the cardinality of the underlying\nfamily or its universe. Finally, we provide an interesting class of families\nthat satisfy the conclusion of the conjecture but are not necessarily\nunion-closed.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9Psg2op9ehY8JrooiUoVlIKGUnufEFclFg9VMaTRviA","pdfSize":"196233"}
