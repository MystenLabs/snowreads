  "abstract": "  The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a next-generation\nlong-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment aimed at determining the neutrino\nmass hierarchy and the CP-violating phase. The DUNE physics program also\nincludes the detection of astrophysical neutrinos and the search for signatures\nbeyond the Standard Model, such as nucleon decays. DUNE consists of a near\ndetector complex located at Fermilab and four 17 kton Liquid Argon Time\nProjection Chamber (LArTPC) far detector modules to be built 1.5 km underground\nat SURF, approximately 1300 km away. The detectors are exposed to a wideband\nneutrino beam generated by a 1.2 MW proton beam with a planned upgrade to > 2\nMW. Two 770 ton LArTPCs (ProtoDUNEs) have been operated at CERN for over 2\nyears as a testbed for DUNE far detectors and have been optimized to take new\ncosmic and test-beam data in 2024-2025. The DUNE and ProtoDUNE experiments and\nphysics goals, as well as recent progress and results, are presented.\n",
