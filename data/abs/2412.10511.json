We employ\nvarious different techniques, ranging from CNN-RNN to the more advanced\ntransformer-based techniques. Training is carried out on image datasets paired\nwith descriptive captions, and model performance will be evaluated using\nestablished metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, and CIDEr. The project will also\ninvolve experimentation with advanced attention mechanisms, comparisons of\ndifferent architectural choices, and hyperparameter optimization to refine\ncaptioning accuracy and overall system effectiveness.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ImN7Ys4XR7oYiyavlOfy7m5x_5RIckm-F5SHHta815c","pdfSize":"1003955"}
