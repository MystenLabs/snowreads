It is well-known that implicit discretization\nof the time derivative in the momentum equation e.g. using a backward\ndifferentiation formula with explicit handling of the nonlinear term results in\na conditionally stable method. In certain scenarios, employing explicit time\nintegration in the momentum equation can be advantageous, as it avoids the need\nto solve for a system matrix involving each differential operator.\nAdditionally, we will demonstrate that the fully discrete method can be\nexpressed in the form of simple matrix-vector multiplications allowing for\nefficient implementation on modern and highly parallel acceleration hardware.\n  Despite being a common practice in various commercial codes, there is\ncurrently no available literature on error analysis for this scenario. In this\nwork, we conduct a theoretical analysis of both implicit and two explicit\nvariants of the pressure-correction method in a fully discrete setting. We\ndemonstrate to which extend the presented implicit and explicit methods exhibit\nconditional stability. Furthermore, we establish a Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy\n(CFL) type condition for the explicit scheme and show that the explicit variant\ndemonstrate the same asymptotic behavior as the implicit variant when the CFL\ncondition is satisfied.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"cvEFt4UbaW3_H1zcWUmQn97__0otPfCBoGsLrhTydT0","pdfSize":"615035"}
