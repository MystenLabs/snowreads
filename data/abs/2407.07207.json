This duplication of effort\nadds costs and slows the experimentation process. We present instead a\ntechnical demonstration of performing real time, sub-millisecond latency\ncontrol with an adaptive optics system using the high-level Julia programming\nlanguage. This open-source software demonstrates support for multiple cameras,\npixel streaming, and network-transparency distributed computing. Furthermore,\nit is easy to interface it with other programming languages as desired.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9l82k0wx8FgPD9sffe28d2F-M-tI-_PYS0FpNIsnrMM","pdfSize":"1727114"}
