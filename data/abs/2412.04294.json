  "abstract": "  When writing SQL queries, it is often convenient to use correlated\nsubqueries. However, for the database engine, these correlated queries are very\ndifficult to evaluate efficiently. The query optimizer will therefore try to\neliminate the correlations, a process referred to as unnesting.\n  Recent work has introduced a single pass top-down algorithm for unnesting\narbitrary SQL queries. That work did not include a formal proof of correctness,\nthough. In this work we provide the missing formalization by formally defining\nthe operator semantics and proving that the unnesting algorithm is correct.\n",
