In this study, we employ machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD)\nsimulations to investigate the high-temperature thermal properties of thorium\ndioxide, which has a fluorite structure, and lithium oxide, which has an\nanti-fluorite structure. Our results show that MLMD simulations effectively\nreproduce the reported thermal properties of these materials. A central focus\nof this work is the analysis of specific heat anomalies in these materials at\nhigh temperatures, commonly referred to as Bredig, pre-melting, or\n$\\lambda$-transitions. We demonstrate that a local order parameter, analogous\nto those used to describe liquid-liquid transitions in supercooled water and\nliquid silica, can effectively characterize these specific heat anomalies. The\nlocal order parameter identifies two distinct types of defective structures:\nlattice defect-like and liquid-like local structures. Above the transition\ntemperature, liquid-like local structures predominate, and the sub-lattice\ncharacter of mobile atoms disappears.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2R17ZH2YIr2huEL6bvU11fXMgNx6AhytxjVKHWleeqw","pdfSize":"1962617"}
