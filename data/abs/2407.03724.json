Previous research efforts either utilized expert knowledge\nto design flight structures for a specific task or relied on enumeration-based\nalgorithms that required extensive computation to find an optimal one. However,\nboth approaches encounter challenges in accommodating the heterogeneity among\nmodules. Our GA addresses these challenges by incorporating the complexities of\nover-actuation and dynamic properties into its formulation. Additionally, we\nemploy a tree representation and a vector representation to describe flight\nstructures, facilitating efficient crossover operations and fitness evaluations\nwithin the GA framework, respectively. Using cubic modular quadcopters capable\nof functioning as omni-directional thrust generators, we validate that the\nproposed approach can (i) adeptly identify suboptimal configurations ensuring\nover-actuation while ensuring trajectory tracking accuracy and (ii)\nsignificantly reduce computational costs compared to traditional\nenumeration-based methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"bSb0W01tbtmG-a7vPnb9Jvwu9AzYGxdYXRU4klnraqw","pdfSize":"4965471"}
