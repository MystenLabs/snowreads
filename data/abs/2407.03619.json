This\npaper illustrates a fundamental connection between univariate marked Hawkes\nprocesses and multivariate Hawkes processes. Exploiting this connection renders\na framework that can be built upon for expressive and flexible inference on\ndiverse data. Specifically, multivariate unmarked Hawkes representations are\nintroduced as a tool to parameterize univariate marked Hawkes processes. We\nshow that such multivariate representations can asymptotically approximate a\nlarge class of univariate marked Hawkes processes, are stationary given the\napproximated process is stationary, and that resultant conditional intensity\nparameters are identifiable. A simulation study demonstrates the efficacy of\nthis approach, and provides heuristic bounds for error induced by the\nrelatively larger parameter space of multivariate Hawkes processes.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"un_iNtmeWpnmXQq-lL62r5iFQjYh9UhV6fT9fl1Gcfc","pdfSize":"807973"}
