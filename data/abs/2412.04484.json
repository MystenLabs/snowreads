Unlike\nother frontiers of machine learning such as natural language, recommendation\nsystems are responsible for collecting their own data. Simply exploiting\ncurrent knowledge can lead to pernicious feedback loops but naive exploration\ncan detract from user experience and lead to reduced engagement. This\nexploration-exploitation trade-off is exemplified in the classic multi-armed\nbandit problem for which algorithms such as upper confidence bounds (UCB) and\nThompson sampling (TS) demonstrate effective performance. However, there have\nbeen many challenges to scaling these approaches to settings which do not\nexhibit a conjugate prior structure. Recent scalable approaches to uncertainty\nquantification via epinets have enabled efficient approximations of Thompson\nsampling even when the learning model is a complex neural network. In this\npaper, we demonstrate the first application of epinets to an online\nrecommendation system. Our experiments demonstrate improvements in both user\ntraffic and engagement efficiency on the Facebook Reels online video platform.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Information Retrieval","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"O2-5PhH3icXP-DCi2J9_nCCLCRoxqq89Ei4W8k1ZfEo","pdfSize":"1106506"}
