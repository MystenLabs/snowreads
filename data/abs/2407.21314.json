Traditional\nassimilation algorithms often face challenges of high nonlinearity brought by\nboth the physical and observational models. In this work, we propose a novel\ndata-driven assimilation algorithm based on generative models to address such\nconcerns. Our State-Observation Augmented Diffusion (SOAD) model is designed to\nhandle nonlinear physical and observational models more effectively. The\nmarginal posterior associated with SOAD has been derived and then proved to\nmatch the real posterior under mild assumptions, which shows theoretical\nsuperiority over previous score-based assimilation works. Experimental results\nalso indicate that our SOAD model may offer improved accuracy over existing\ndata-driven methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"StfZ4AflkuBAf9GeYC7rQwo4qv-GSV02C3H0Y2PlHos","pdfSize":"24369487","objectId":"0x4435f055ed957d12c3c3285397ee30f894449c54667b28981befedac45109172","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
