The model\nscales well to higher dimensions, allowing the inclusion of a larger number of\nvariables. We develop an efficient Gibbs sampler to estimate the model. We also\npresent an estimator of the deviance information criterion to facilitate model\ncomparison. Finally, we discuss how economically motivated restrictions can be\nadded to the model. Experiments with artificial data show that the model\npossesses good estimation properties. Using real data we highlight the benefits\nof including more variables in the structural analysis. Specifically, we\nidentify a monetary policy shock and provide empirical evidence that prices and\neconomic output respond with a large delay to the monetary policy shock.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"We8bHhHcdAngHC3oCvEgel-VJjUKOk7IWLXr52i-YMw","pdfSize":"827366"}
