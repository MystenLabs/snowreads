For example, individual wave occurrences such as superposition and\ninterference yield markedly divergent outcomes when viewed in detail.\nSimilarly, this study enhances the comprehensive framework of spin-orbit torque\n(SOT) within the hysteresis loop shift measurement by employing the average of\neffective magnetic fields arising from two distinct magnetic reversals. This\napproach facilitates the presentation of a physically descriptive SOT model,\npreviously characterized only by single chirality qualitatively. By integrating\nthis model with established measurement methodologies and theoretical\nparadigms, we advance a theoretical framework based on the magnetic domain-wall\nchirality of individual polarizations and aim to elucidate the phenomena of SOT\nwith clarity. The anticipated outcomes include the rectification of\ninaccuracies in widely employed measurement methodologies and the enhancement\nof our comprehension of the fundamental physics, which are expected to propel\nadvancements in next-generation spintronics materials and devices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HglC8N8mpcY9Taaa8wFQAOj6VlcN-tzY_-ZUCBIy6MA","pdfSize":"2181834"}
