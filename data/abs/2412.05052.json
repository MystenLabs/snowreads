This case describes how a previously trusted system\ncan collapse, how paradoxical the relationship between trust and distrust is,\nand how it interacts with adopting and managing electoral technologies. The\nanalysis stresses how, although being a central component, technology's\ntrustworthiness dialogues with the socio-technical context in which it is\ninserted, for example, underscoring the relevance of public administration in\nsecuring technological environments. Beyond these insights, the research offers\nbroader reflections on trust and distrust in data-driven technologies,\nadvocating for differentiated strategies for building trust versus managing\ndistrust. Overall, this paper contributes to understanding trust dynamics in\ndigital government technologies, with implications for policymaking and\ntechnology adoption strategies.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UsRX6psN6U0rVqVZUN4YWauo13yTwtgKbTUWIkX3beI","pdfSize":"423887"}
