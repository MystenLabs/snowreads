  "abstract": "  We study the energy structures of muonic Ar atoms and find the muon orbital\ncollapses at a critical angular momentum $l_c$ using density-functional theory\n(DFT). The $l_c$ may provide an upper limit for the muon-captured states in\nmuon-Ar collisions. We confirm the existence of this upper limit by calculating\nthe state-specified capture probability using the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger\nequation (TDSE) and a classical trajectory Monte Carlo (CTMC) methods with the\nsingle-active-particle approximation. Modifying the mapping between the\nclassical binding energy and the principal quantum number led to a reasonable\nagreement in the state-specified muon capture probabilities obtained by the\nTDSE and CTMC methods. We also propose a simple method to estimate $l_c$ for\nexotic noble atoms from atomic model potentials. The estimated values agree\nwith those calculated by DFT.\n",
