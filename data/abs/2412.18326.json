  "abstract": "  We presented the rapidity dependence of directed flow ($v_1$) and its slope\n($dv_1/dy$) for $\\pi^\\pm$, $K^\\pm$ and $p(\\bar{p}$) in Au+Au collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7 -- 19.6 GeV from the Beam Energy Scan Phase-II, as well\nas in U+U collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 193 GeV measured by the STAR\nexperiment. The $v_1$ values are reported as a function of rapidity and\ncentrality. Additionally, the $dv_1/dy$ and the charge dependent difference,\n$\\Delta(dv_1/dy)$, of the three identified particles in U+U collisions is\ncompared to those in Au+Au and isobar (Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr) collisions. These\nfindings offer insights into the initial electromagnetic field as well as\nbaryon transport at various system sizes and beam energies.\n",
