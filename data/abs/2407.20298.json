Each $U_j$ involves CNOT gates followed by a single-qubit gate, either\nHadamard $H$ or $HD$, where $D = {\\rm diag}(1,i)$, targeting a specific qubit.\nWe provide an upper limit on the number of CNOT gates based on the nonzero\nentries' positions in $|\\psi\\rangle$. This approach, applied to both state and\nprocess tomography, was tested using the Qiskit simulator.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Tp-E7tRs6Wp1G-vertW9j6iHU5f_YU6YWS6s3kb7KXs","pdfSize":"514027"}
