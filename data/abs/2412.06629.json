We present $\\textsf{PolytopeWalk}$, a new scalable\nPython library designed for uniform sampling over polytopes. The library\nprovides an end-to-end solution, which includes preprocessing algorithms such\nas facial reduction and initialization methods. Six state-of-the-art MCMC\nalgorithms on polytopes are implemented, including the Dikin, Vaidya, and John\nWalk. Additionally, we introduce novel sparse constrained formulations of these\nalgorithms, enabling efficient sampling from sparse polytopes of the form $K_2\n= \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d \\ | \\ Ax = b, x \\succeq_k 0\\}$. This implementation\nmaintains sparsity in $A$, ensuring scalability to high dimensional settings\n$(d > 10^5)$. We demonstrate the improved sampling efficiency and per-iteration\ncost on both Netlib datasets and structured polytopes. $\\textsf{PolytopeWalk}$\nis available at github.com/ethz-randomwalk/polytopewalk with documentation at\npolytopewalk.readthedocs.io .\n","subjects":["Statistics/Computation","Computer Science/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zxPlPY5dDmOwCmW8bNu6aQXxYApRsfZwRagMjPWYRhE","pdfSize":"931455"}
