Along the way, we prove that there are only\nfinitely many K-semistable domains associated to the fibers of a log bounded\nfamily of couples. Under the additional assumption of volume bounded from\nbelow, we show that K-semistable domains are semi-algebraic sets (although not\nnecessarily polytopes). As a consequence, we obtain a finite semi-algebraic\nchamber decomposition for wall crossing of K-moduli spaces. In the case of one\nboundary divisor, this decomposition is an expected finite interval chamber\ndecomposition. As an application of the theory, we prove a comparison theorem\nbetween GIT-stability and K-stability in non-proportional setting when the\ncoefficient of the boundary is sufficiently small.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"24CTHrJNFG5C9P98R2qqqX_gPud6uQBBiEIzMzGD_fA","pdfSize":"786421"}
