  "abstract": "  Reflections are omnipresent tools in quantum algorithms. We consider the task\nof reflecting through the eigenspace of an implementable unitary. Such\nreflections are generally designed using phase estimation or linear combination\nof unitaries. These methods have size and depth that scale favorably with the\ndesired precision and the spectral gap of the unitary. However, they require a\nnumber of ancilla qubits that grows with both parameters. Here, we present a\nsimple algorithm with the same size and depth scaling but requiring only 3\nancilla qubits for all problem instances. As such, this algorithm is expected\nto become the reference method to reflect through eigenspaces of unitaries.\n",
