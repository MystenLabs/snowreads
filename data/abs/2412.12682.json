  "abstract": "  We study the mean field game problem for a nervous system consisting of a\nlarge number of neurons with mean-field interaction. In this system, each\nneuron can modulate its spiking activity by controlling its membrane potential\nto synchronize with others, thereby giving rise to a finite-player game\nproblem. To address this, we first examine the corresponding mean field game\nproblem and characterize the mean field equilibrium by solving a fixed point\nproblem. Subsequently, leveraging the obtained mean field equilibrium, we\nconstruct an approximate Nash equilibrium for the finite-player game as the\nnumber of neurons is large.\n",
