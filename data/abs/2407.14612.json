To accomplish such dynamic motion in a\nhumanoid robot, the robot needs to simultaneously: 1) transfer high kinetic\nenergy to the kicking leg, 2) maintain balance and stability of the entire\nbody, and 3) manage the impact disturbance from the ball during the kicking\nmoment. Prior studies on robotic soccer kicking often prioritized stability,\nleading to overly conservative quasi-static motions. In this work, we present a\nbiomechanics-inspired control framework that leverages trajectory optimization\nand imitation learning to facilitate highly dynamic soccer kicks in humanoid\nrobots. We conducted an in-depth analysis of human soccer kick biomechanics to\nidentify key motion constraints. Based on this understanding, we designed\nkinodynamically feasible trajectories that are then used as a reference in\nimitation learning to develop a robust feedback control policy. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach through a simulation of an anthropomorphic 25\nDoF bipedal humanoid robot, named PresToe, which is equipped with 7 DoF legs,\nincluding a unique actuated toe. Using our framework, PresToe can execute\ndynamic instep kicks, propelling the ball at speeds exceeding 11m/s in full\ndynamics simulation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SoR7dq4Q9ydS6NQgFD3dpOa8jV-BTTi5FFHxDSsJzZU","pdfSize":"2871395"}
