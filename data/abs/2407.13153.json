Although successfully\ncommercialized, cloning-based S2ST systems expose their distributors to\nliabilities when misused by individuals and can infringe on personality rights\nwhen exploited by media organizations. This work proposes a regulated S2ST\nframework called Preset-Voice Matching (PVM). PVM removes cross-lingual voice\ncloning in S2ST by first matching the input voice to a similar prior consenting\nspeaker voice in the target-language. With this separation, PVM avoids cloning\nthe input speaker, ensuring PVM systems comply with regulations and reduce risk\nof misuse. Our results demonstrate PVM can significantly improve S2ST system\nrun-time in multi-speaker settings and the naturalness of S2ST synthesized\nspeech. To our knowledge, PVM is the first explicitly regulated S2ST framework\nleveraging similarly-matched preset-voices for dynamic S2ST tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vOasrFHncjA2aRT8QdET4X1_4VEmd3vrGLqcUHBuGOk","pdfSize":"245004"}
