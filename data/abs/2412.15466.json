As an\napplication, this construction is employed to estimate the average gate\nfidelity of a noisy gate. This work integrates the supermap formalism into gate\ncharacterisation. The construction extends to potential applications in qudit\ntwirling operations and comparisons with unitary two-design applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Z5QM6kvU76v0UM50MMkNeuuZVBce3Y5RWHP6LHS919g","pdfSize":"398452"}
