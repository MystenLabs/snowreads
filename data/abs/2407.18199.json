The transit signal was detected by the TESS mission\nand designated TOI-486.01. The star's position close to the Southern ecliptic\npole allows for almost continuous observations by TESS when it is observing the\nSouthern sky. The host star is an M2.5 dwarf with $V=11.57\\pm0.02$ mag,\n$K=7.030\\pm0.023$ mag, a distance of $15.2156\\pm0.0030$ pc, a mass of\n$0.4193_{-0.0098}^{+0.0095}$ M$_{\\odot}$, a radius of\n$0.4314_{-0.0071}^{+0.0075}$ R$_{\\odot}$, and an effective temperature of\n$3{,}485\\pm140$ K. We validate the planet candidate by ruling out or rendering\nhighly unlikely each of the false positive scenarios, based on archival data\nand ground-based follow-up observations. Validation was facilitated by the host\nstar's small size and high proper motion, of $892.633\\pm0.025$ mas yr$^{-1}$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"o1ivX7qSJ36MoW3Ah87fFIYwPcGyzgajVkRJofsDWQ0","pdfSize":"3063210","objectId":"0xacd5be98e28131e7216c5580ac362bebe26b7ed27cbe09bcec48ed46ceecb4d2","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
