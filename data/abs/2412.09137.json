  "abstract": "  The chapter presents some new approaches to describing the collective\nbehavior of complex systems of mathematical biology based on the evolution\nequations of observables such as open systems. This representation of kinetic\nevolution has looked to be the most direct and mathematically fully consistent\nformulation modeling the collective behavior of biological systems since the\ntraditionally used concept of the state in kinetic theory is more subtle and is\nan implicit characteristic of the populations of living creatures. One of the\nadvantages of the developed approach is the opportunity to construct kinetic\nequations for open complex systems in scaling approximations, involving initial\ncorrelations, in particular, that can characterize the condensed states of\nactive soft matter. An approach is also related to the challenge of a rigorous\nderivation of the non-Markovian kinetic equations from underlying many-entity\ndynamics, which makes it possible to describe the memory effects of the\ncollective behavior of living creatures.\n",
