  "abstract": "  This paper introduces a novel and scalable framework for uncertainty\nestimation and separation with applications in data driven modeling in science\nand engineering tasks where reliable uncertainty quantification is critical.\nLeveraging an ensemble of quantile regression (E-QR) models, our approach\nenhances aleatoric uncertainty estimation while preserving the quality of\nepistemic uncertainty, surpassing competing methods, such as Deep Ensembles\n(DE) and Monte Carlo (MC) dropout. To address challenges in separating\nuncertainty types, we propose an algorithm that iteratively improves separation\nthrough progressive sampling in regions of high uncertainty. Our framework is\nscalable to large datasets and demonstrates superior performance on synthetic\nbenchmarks, offering a robust tool for uncertainty quantification in\ndata-driven applications.\n",
