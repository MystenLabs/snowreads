  "abstract": "  Self-regulated actuators harness material intelligence to enable complex\ndeformations and dynamics, representing a significant advancement in automated\nsoft robotics. However, investigations on self-regulated soft actuators,\nparticularly those using simplified actuation modules such as a unidirectional\nlight beam, remain limited. Here, we present a design paradigm for\nself-regulated actuators based on Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM)\nheterogeneous hydrogel, where self-regulated deformations are actuated by a\nfixed near-infrared laser. By utilizing the different responsiveness of PNIPAM\nhydrogels and those integrated with reduced graphene oxide (rGO), we develop\nthree heterogeneous hydrogel configurations: up-down, side-by-side, and hybrid.\nThese designs enable complex biomimetic deformations in soft hydrogel\nactuators, resembling a bending finger or a flexible industrial manipulator,\nall actuated by a single fixed laser source. These proposed heterogeneous\ndesigns and actuation strategies leverage material intelligence to create soft\nactuators with enhanced autonomy, paving the way for soft automation, adaptive\nsystems, and biomedical applications.\n",
