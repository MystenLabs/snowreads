By applying Fourier\ntransformations to the natural orthogonal oscillator representations of special\nlinear Lie algebras, Luo and the second author (2013) obtained a big family of\ninfinite-dimensional irreducible representations of the algebras on certain\nspaces of homogeneous solutions of the Laplace equation. In this paper, we\nprove that the associated varieties of these irreducible representations are\nthe intersections of explicitly given determinantal varieties. This provides an\nexplicit connection among representation theory, partial differential equations\nand algebraic geometry.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"njw1vmunzkM9ai2IOkNzc-TGwHicF_2Vjy8XbVX0Ot4","pdfSize":"527432"}
