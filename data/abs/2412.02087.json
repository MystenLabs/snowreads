We show that under mild\nassumptions of the degree sequence, the spectral distribution of the normalized\nLaplacian matrix of such random graph converges in distribution to the\nsemicircle distribution as the number of vertices $n\\rightarrow \\infty$. This\nextends work by McKay (1981) and Tran, Vu and Wang (2013) which studied random\nregular graphs ($d_1=d_2=\\cdots=d_n=d$). Furthermore, we extend the assumption\nto show that a slightly more general condition is equivalent to the weak\nconvergence to semicircle distribution. The equivalence is also illustrated by\nnumerical simulations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Qzl9tJxDsomEW7HqdVnjNezzq5R3ccJBH2bwlZ2q63M","pdfSize":"727096"}
