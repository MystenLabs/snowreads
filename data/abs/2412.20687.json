  "abstract": "  The global shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) as a sustainable alternative\nto traditional gasoline-powered cars has triggered a significant rise in the\ndemand for lithium-ion batteries. However, as the adoption of EVs grows, the\nissue of battery disposal and recycling has emerged as a critical challenge.\nThe recycling of EV batteries is essential not only for reducing the\nenvironmental impact of battery waste but also for ensuring the sustainable\nsupply of critical raw materials such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel. This\npaper explores recent innovations in the field of electric vehicle battery\nrecycling, examining advanced techniques such as direct recycling,\nhydrometallurgical processes, and sustainable battery design. It also\nhighlights the role of policy and industry collaboration in improving recycling\ninfrastructure and addressing the economic and environmental challenges\nassociated with battery waste. By focusing on both the technical and regulatory\naspects of EV battery recycling, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive\noverview of the state of the industry and the future outlook for recycling\ntechnologies, ultimately paving the way for a cleaner, more sustainable future\nin transportation.\n",
