  "abstract": "  In this paper, we revisit the Recursive Projection-Aggregation (RPA) decoder,\nof Ye and Abbe (2020), for Reed-Muller (RM) codes. Our main contribution is an\nexplicit upper bound on the probability of incorrect decoding, using the RPA\ndecoder, over a binary symmetric channel (BSC). Importantly, we focus on the\nevents where a single iteration of the RPA decoder, in each recursive call, is\nsufficient for convergence. Key components of our analysis are explicit\nestimates of the probability of incorrect decoding of first-order RM codes\nusing a maximum likelihood (ML) decoder, and estimates of the error\nprobabilities during the aggregation phase of the RPA decoder. Our results\nallow us to show that for RM codes with blocklength $N = 2^m$, the RPA decoder\ncan achieve vanishing error probabilities, in the large blocklength limit, for\nRM orders that grow roughly logarithmically in $m$.\n",
