The focus lies on their influence on critical\nphotovoltaic parameters, including Fill Factor (FF), power conversion\nefficiency (eta), short-circuit current density (Jsc), and open-circuit voltage\n(Voc). Employing advanced simulation tools, we systematically compare the\nperformance of undoped and doped Spiro-OMeTAD structures. Among the examined\ndopants, Li-TFSI exhibits the most pronounced enhancements, significantly\nimproving both FF and efficiency. In contrast, FK209 and tBP yield moderate\ngains in device performance. These results underscore the superior charge\ntransport properties imparted by Li-TFSI doping and its capacity to optimize\nHTM functionality, thereby presenting a promising approach to advancing the\nefficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bq0iszVbVbM0I7vF6ZE-MAKKQeZ4M2frPLMGubUdaxM","pdfSize":"671102"}
