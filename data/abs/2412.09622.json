  "abstract": "  Recent advances in text-to-image customization have enabled high-fidelity,\ncontext-rich generation of personalized images, allowing specific concepts to\nappear in a variety of scenarios. However, current methods struggle with\ncombining multiple personalized models, often leading to attribute entanglement\nor requiring separate training to preserve concept distinctiveness. We present\nLoRACLR, a novel approach for multi-concept image generation that merges\nmultiple LoRA models, each fine-tuned for a distinct concept, into a single,\nunified model without additional individual fine-tuning. LoRACLR uses a\ncontrastive objective to align and merge the weight spaces of these models,\nensuring compatibility while minimizing interference. By enforcing distinct yet\ncohesive representations for each concept, LoRACLR enables efficient, scalable\nmodel composition for high-quality, multi-concept image synthesis. Our results\nhighlight the effectiveness of LoRACLR in accurately merging multiple concepts,\nadvancing the capabilities of personalized image generation.\n",
