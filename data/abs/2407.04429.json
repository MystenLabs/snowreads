This is the approach via the so-called inertia forms or\nTr\\\"{a}gheitsformen. Using clever substitutions, Mertens and Hurwitz gave a\ncriterion, for recognizing such inertia forms, which amounts to a linear system\nfor their numerical coefficients. In this article we explicitly solve this\nlinear system. We do so by identifying a subset of the available equations\nwhich forms a unitriangular system. The key notion we use is that of\ntransversal, i.e., a selection of a monomial term in each of the homogeneous\npolynomials at hand. We need two such transversals which are disjoint and\nextremal, in the sense that they relate to extremizers of a, possibly new,\ndeterminantal inequality for differences of two substochastic matrices. Thanks\nto this notion of extremal pair of transversals, we derive an explicit formula\nfor the coefficients of general multidimensional resultants, as a sum of terms\nmade of a sign times a product of multinomial coefficients, thereby explicitly\nshowing they are integer-valued.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"LkT_A3iPgKj0j7bnsd4vg0dUC04AJtbL1KdaxEdCMrI","pdfSize":"412979"}
