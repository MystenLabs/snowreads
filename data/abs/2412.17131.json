Despite recent advancements,\nthere is limited research addressing hate speech detection in\nDevanagari-scripted languages, where resources and tools are scarce. While\nlarge language models (LLMs) have shown promise in language-related tasks,\ntraditional fine-tuning approaches are often infeasible given the size of the\nmodels. In this paper, we propose a Parameter Efficient Fine tuning (PEFT)\nbased solution for hate speech detection and target identification. We evaluate\nmultiple LLMs on the Devanagari dataset provided by (Thapa et al., 2025), which\ncontains annotated instances in 2 languages - Hindi and Nepali. The results\ndemonstrate the efficacy of our approach in handling Devanagari-scripted\ncontent.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6K8QZEjs8yC69E2h7x0sa4ze56enWjGPiZGcPZTfSqg","pdfSize":"246659"}
