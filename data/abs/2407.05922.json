This is a\nworld of anticipatory technology and contextual computing that uses smart\ndiffused computational processing to create a fine web of computational\nresources that are embedded into the material world. Thus, the historical\ndistinction between the digital and the non-digital becomes increasingly\nblurred, to the extent that to talk about the digital presupposes an\nexperiential disjuncture that makes less and less sense. Indeed, just as the\nideas of online or being online have become anachronistic as a result of our\nalways-on smartphones and tablets and widespread wireless networking\ntechnologies, so too the term digital perhaps assumes a world of the past.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-kXlu4NCJ2epNzGY2AqT4VbL0ZmRo5gFn2RwdR4S7oo","pdfSize":"851682"}
