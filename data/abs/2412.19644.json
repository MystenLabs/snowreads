  "abstract": "  We prove two estimates for the Barban--Davenport--Halberstam type variance of\na general complex sequence in arithmetic progressions. The proofs are\nelementary, and our estimates are capable of yielding an asymptotic for the\nvariance when the sequence is sufficiently nice, and is either somewhat sparse\nor is sufficiently like the integers in its divisibility by small moduli.\n  As a concrete application, we deduce a Barban--Davenport--Halberstam type\nvariance asymptotic for the $y$-smooth numbers less than $x$, on a wide range\nof the parameters. This addresses a question considered by Granville and\nVaughan.\n",
