In the classical case, both the measures and the positive definite\nkernels are scalar valued. But the non-commutative framework (as motivated by\nquantum theory) dictates a setting where instead now both the measures (in the\nform of quantum states), and the positive definite kernels, are operator\nvalued. The non-commutative theory entails a systematic study of positive\noperator valued measures, abbreviated POVMs. And quantum states (normal states)\nare indexed by normalized positive trace-class operators. In the\nnon-commutative theory, the parallel to the commutative/scalar valued theory\nhelps us understand entanglement in quantum information. A further implication\nof our study of the non-commutative framework will entail an interplay between\nthe two cases, scalar valued, vs operator valued.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"02wgihydqfQNXrYUCkbcKYnoBFJkv6OmLc8hCUwfcBc","pdfSize":"203214"}
