We introduce a new model for generating poetry\nin Czech language, based on fine-tuning a pre-trained Large Language Model. We\ndemonstrate that guiding the generation process by explicitly specifying\nstrophe parameters within the poem text strongly improves the effectiveness of\nthe model. We also find that appropriate tokenization is crucial, showing that\ntokenization methods based on syllables or individual characters instead of\nsubwords prove superior in generating poetic strophes. We further enhance the\nresults by introducing \\textit{Forced~generation}, adding explicit\nspecifications of meter and verse parameters at inference time based on the\nalready generated text. We evaluate a range of setups, showing that our\nproposed approach achieves high accuracies in rhyming and metric aspects of\nformal quality of the generated poems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"-eEKOmQDqsZS2KQGipYLkqS1VWVd9Fe3hBvk9dH6lFI","pdfSize":"229191"}
