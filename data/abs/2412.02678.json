Such\noperators lead to the emergence of Background Induced States on top of any\nbackground deviating from the flat spacetime. Quasi-normal modes (QNMs)\ncorresponding to these excitations are analyzed in the present paper with the\nuse of an example of a static nearly Schwarzschild black hole. We mainly target\nmicro-Black Holes, given that they are strongly affected by the details of UV\ncompletion for gravity, while real astrophysical black holes can be well\ndescribed in EFT framework. We find that frequencies of QNMs are deviating from\nthose in a General Relativity setup and, moreover, that the unstable QNMs are\nalso possible. This leads to the necessity of constraints on gravity\nmodifications or lower bounds on masses of the stable micro-Black Holes or\nboth.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NAbkGh1VcAWudSlD0QtmrkUn3FJsnJaM6EJ7ieElPLc","pdfSize":"1456774"}
