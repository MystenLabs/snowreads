We derive a one-dimensional probability distribution of\nvelocities stable under relativistic velocity addition. In a given system, this\nallows identifying distinct physical regimes in terms of the distribution's\nconcavity at the origin and the probability of measuring relativistic\nvelocities. These features provide a protocol to assess the relevance of\nstochastic relativistic effects in actual experiments. As examples, we find\nagreement with previous results about heavy-ion diffusion and show that our\nfindings are consistent with the distribution of momentum deviations observed\nin measurements of antiproton cooling.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5OvEAY5Q2DyyPujzRjL9hx76lvUQburm7x3zvPAhWvY","pdfSize":"2395626"}
