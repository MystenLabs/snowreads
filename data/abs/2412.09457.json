  "abstract": "  We investigate a minimal model of a two-terminal Josephson junction with\nconventional superconducting (SC) leads and a pair of interconnected quantum\ndots in the presence of two Aharonov-Casher (AC) fluxes. The Andreev bound\nstate spectrum features Weyl nodes within a three-dimensional synthetic\nBrillouin zone defined in the space of these AC fluxes and the SC phase\ndifference. The aim is to determine the location and topological charge of\nthese nodes by probing the Berry curvature on closed surfaces that may enclose\nthem. This is achieved by adiabatically varying the superconducting phase\ndifference and AC fluxes along a path on these surfaces and measuring the\nassociated currents. We define the kinematic curvature as the cross product of\na tangent vector along the path and the vector of these currents. In the\nadiabatic regime, the path-averaged kinematic curvature provides a quantized\nresponse equal to the topological charge enclosed by the surface, provided the\npath uniformly and densely covers it.\n",
