We introduce the operad that encodes AsGDer triples, and prove it is a\nKoszul operad. Using its Koszul dual cooperad, we introduce the homotopy\nversion of AsGDer triples. As an application, we construct the AsGDer\ncohomology theory for AsGDer triples, and show that the formal deformation of\nan AsGDer triple is controlled by the AsGDer cohomology.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"yResRpY7X0q2fzkTuRvIEH8ig3t-Inh6K1L2mzA5icM","pdfSize":"335906","objectId":"0xcda1fd94273544c2d691cbb7dd512de2f4f0fef04ddc7cefdcf83ab1385cda64","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
