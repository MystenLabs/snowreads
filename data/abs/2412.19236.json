The\nwell-posedness results are developed with the use of Malliavin calculus, which\nrenders a novel perspective in tackling with the challenging diagonal processes\nwhile contrasts with the existing methods. We also provide a probabilistic\ninterpretation of the classical solutions to the counterpart semi-linear\npartial differential equations through the explicit adapted solutions of\nBSVIEs. Moreover, we formulate with BSVIEs to explicitly characterize\ndynamically optimal mean-variance portfolios for various stochastic investment\nopportunities, with the myopic investment and intertemporal hedging demands\nbeing identified as two diagonal processes of BSVIE solutions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5OMbKr3HYPhJoDaqPXQrmTRyIBMQ_-HcbVm__Boawwg","pdfSize":"472597"}
