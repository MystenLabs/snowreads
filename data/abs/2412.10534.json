As a corollary, we determine the potential locations\nof poles for their corresponding partial $L$-functions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nvpDZ8eUdPsJXTP081rbvCjTmeCLPBYQD-Zqr3Myv0g","pdfSize":"256595"}
