  "abstract": "  With the emergence of new radio telescopes promising larger fields of view at\nlower observation frequencies (e.g., SKA), addressing direction-dependent\neffects (DDE) (e.g., direction-specific beam responses), polarisation leakage,\nand pointing errors has become all the more important. Be it through\nA-projection or otherwise, addressing said effects often requires reliable\nrepresentations of antenna/station beams; yet, these require significant\namounts of computational memory as they are baseline-, frequency-, time-, and\npolarisation-dependent. A novel prototype is reported here to approximate\nantenna beams suitable for SKA-MID using Zernike polynomials. It is shown that\nbeam kernels can be well approximated, paving the way for future optimisations\ntowards facilitating more efficient beam-dependent solutions and approaches to\ntackling the aforementioned challenges, all of which are essential for\nlarge-scale radio telescopes.\n",
