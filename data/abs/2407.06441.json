In a home-like environment, we had\nparticipants perform tasks which were sorted using Hierarchical task analysis\non six major home appliances. From this research we found out that home\nappliances sometimes only provide visual information which causes difficulty in\nsensory processing. Also, interfaces tactile/auditory feedbacks are the same\nmaking it hard for people to recognize which feature is processed. Blind users\ncannot see the provided information so they rely on long-term memory to use\nproducts. This research provides guideline for button, knob and remote control\ninterface for visually impaired users. This information will be helpful for\nproject planners, designers, and developers to create products which are\naccessible by visually impaired people. Some of the features will be applied to\nupcoming home appliance products.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"vGjNqBJXfrARFipAUNyX7ZePSyhPAGlJ1nxkHtmhpcA","pdfSize":"3942238"}
