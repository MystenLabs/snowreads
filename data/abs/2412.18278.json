We demonstrate that leptogenesis can explain the baryon\nasymmetry of the universe already in such a minimal framework, where the\nelectroweak scalar is favored to enhance the baryon asymmetry. Different from\ntraditional leptogenesis, the realization here exploits the thermal behavior of\nleptons at finite temperatures, which is otherwise kinetically forbidden in\nvacuum. We present detailed calculations of the CP asymmetry in the\nSchwinger-Keldysh Closed-Time-Path formalism, and compute the asymmetry\nevolution via the Kadanoff-Baym equation. Such minimal forbidden\nneutrinogenesis establishes a direct link between the baryon asymmetry and the\nCP-violating phase from neutrino mixing, making the scenario a compelling\ntarget in neutrino oscillation experiments. Complementary probes from\ncosmology, flavor physics and colliders are also briefly discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-KHkgglLaCwxe0vlPXGJQ3X2DNe5z_Xd0LugnEier3I","pdfSize":"995229"}
