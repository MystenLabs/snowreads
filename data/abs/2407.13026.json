We achieve this log-gain over the universal\nestimates by applying the Keel-Tao theorem along with improved global kernel\nestimates for microlocalized operators which exploit the geometric assumptions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0QU88F8gbkrGqsUE0mqNYP3qkmnpLa9HuSHfWTW2NdU","pdfSize":"347156","objectId":"0x86733a7804d7d72a4b37bf0e2d70e686514024146faa70e641bc4404e64fcd44","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
