The adjoint representation of this\nalgebra is found to contain $\\mathfrak{su}_{2,2}\\oplus \\mathfrak{u}_{1}\\oplus\n\\mathfrak{su}_{5}$ as a submaximal subalgebra, giving a spectrum of conformal\ngravity with flipped $SU_{5}\\times U_{1}$ GUT. Combining Yang-Mills theory with\nMacDowell-Mansouri gravity over the conformal group is found to recover the\nEinstein-Hilbert action with a cosmological constant. An action for the theory\nis presented, which contains the gauge bosons of gravity and GUT, three\ngenerations of fermions in an efficient manner, and a new Higgs sector. By\nusing the superalgebra for the entire multiplet, the theory gauges a\nnon-supersymmetric subalgebra without introducing superpartners.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"y4at_GD0NfyW9xLhvlBej-u-R2WtJQac1sIRFRN8OMQ","pdfSize":"166597"}
