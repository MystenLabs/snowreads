  "abstract": "  This paper focuses the attention on privacy-preserving identity and access\nmanagement in multiple Cloud environments, which is an annoying problem in the\nmodern big data era. Within this conceptual context, the paper describes\ncontemporaneous models and issues, and put the basis for future solid\nsolutions. Finally, we provide a summary table where we embed an innovative\ntaxonomy of state-of-the-art research proposals in the reference scientific\nfield.\n",
