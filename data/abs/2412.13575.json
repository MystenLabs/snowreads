However, existing methods, including LLMs, rely on rigid outlines\nor lack macro-level planning, making it difficult to achieve both contextual\nconsistency and coherent plot development in long-form story generation. To\naddress this issues, we propose Dynamic Hierarchical Outlining with\nMemory-Enhancement long-form story generation method, named DOME, to generate\nthe long-form story with coherent content and plot. Specifically, the Dynamic\nHierarchical Outline(DHO) mechanism incorporates the novel writing theory into\noutline planning and fuses the plan and writing stages together, improving the\ncoherence of the plot by ensuring the plot completeness and adapting to the\nuncertainty during story generation. A Memory-Enhancement Module (MEM) based on\ntemporal knowledge graphs is introduced to store and access the generated\ncontent, reducing contextual conflicts and improving story coherence. Finally,\nwe propose a Temporal Conflict Analyzer leveraging temporal knowledge graphs to\nautomatically evaluate the contextual consistency of long-form story.\nExperiments demonstrate that DOME significantly improves the fluency,\ncoherence, and overall quality of generated long stories compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"arYUlFHZMt-vlZq2AOGkfx501Bw7Gz7FbWEFKMhXLUk","pdfSize":"1683269"}
