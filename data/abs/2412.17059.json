Using conformal invariance the system can be mapped to CFT\nwith boundary (BCFT). Renyi entropies for spatial intervals in the projected\nstate can then be computed as a function of the location of the quench, either\nusing the replica method, or using twist fields, the latter employing universal\nresults for correlators at large c. We find qualitatively distinct behaviours\nin the two systems. Our replica computations reveal a surprising universal n\ndependence of Renyi entropies which implies that teleportation does occur but\nis not optimal as would be expected because the projector is not especially\ntuned. We also find that the curious n dependence of the Renyi entropies means\nthat the limit to the von Neumann entropy is not straightforward.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"k87v7_F085IB7cjh982g9loAARyQ_jpLKfa6NhdTpWA","pdfSize":"762907"}
