Initial idempotent; 2. Two-sided\nideal; 3. Left ideal basis (otherwise projector, or spinor basis); 4. Matrix\nrepresentations (reps) for basis vectors in Clifford algebras in spinor basis;\n5. General spinor; 6. Spinor in matrix form; 7. Squared hermitian norm of the\nspinor. Earlier in 1998, only the first four items computed by Maple were\npublished by R. Ablamowicz.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UoCKoGeiNV5ti1CNFDL80cpiGiY5WdPvrbcZmPk8zAY","pdfSize":"230349"}
