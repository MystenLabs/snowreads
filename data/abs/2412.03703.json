  "abstract": "  The density of states and differential entropy per particle are analyzed for\nDirac-like electrons in graphene subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field\nand an in-plane electric field. For comparison, the derived density of states\nis contrasted with the well-known case of nonrelativistic electrons in crossed\nmagnetic and electric fields. The study considers ballistic electrons and also\nincludes the effect of small impurity scattering. In the latter case, the limit\nof zero magnetic field and the so-called collapse of Landau levels in graphene\nare examined analytically. By comparing the results with numerical calculations\non graphene ribbons, we demonstrate that the Landau state counting procedure\nmust be modified for Dirac-like electrons, leading to a fields-dependent Landau\nlevel degeneracy factor. Additionally, it is shown that peaks in the\ndifferential entropy arise from the dispersionless surface mode localized at\nthe zigzag edges of the ribbon.\n",
