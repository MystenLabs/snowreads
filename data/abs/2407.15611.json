There isn't a\nuniversally optimal feature selection method applicable to any data\ndistribution, and as a result, the literature consistently endeavors to address\nthis issue. One recent approach in feature selection is termed frequency-based\nfeature selection. However, existing methods in this domain tend to overlook\nfeature values, focusing solely on the distribution in the response variable.\nIn response, this paper introduces the Distance-based Mutual Congestion (DMC)\nas a filter method that considers both the feature values and the distribution\nof observations in the response variable. DMC sorts the features of datasets,\nand the top 5% are retained and clustered by KMeans to mitigate\nmulticollinearity. This is achieved by randomly selecting one feature from each\ncluster. The selected features form the feature space, and the search space for\nthe Genetic Algorithm with Adaptive Rates (GAwAR) will be approximated using\nthis feature space. GAwAR approximates the combination of the top 10 features\nthat maximizes prediction accuracy within a wrapper scheme. To prevent\npremature convergence, GAwAR adaptively updates the crossover and mutation\nrates. The hybrid DMC-GAwAR is applicable to binary classification datasets,\nand experimental results demonstrate its superiority over some recent works.\nThe implementation and corresponding data are available at\nhttps://github.com/hnematzadeh/DMC-GAwAR\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"6toEG35578-1C7ODMmdfA5vhkWKOpY-YDyhlrtqHfdE","pdfSize":"690921"}
