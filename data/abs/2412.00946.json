  "abstract": "  For individuals who are blind or have low vision, tactile maps provide\nessential spatial information but are limited in the amount of data they can\nconvey. Digitally augmented tactile maps enhance these capabilities with audio\nfeedback, thereby combining the tactile feedback provided by the map with an\naudio description of the touched elements. In this context, we explore an\nembodied interaction paradigm to augment tactile maps with conversational\ninteraction based on Large Language Models, thus enabling users to obtain\nanswers to arbitrary questions regarding the map. We analyze the type of\nquestions the users are interested in asking, engineer the Large Language\nModel's prompt to provide reliable answers, and study the resulting system with\na set of 10 participants, evaluating how the users interact with the system,\nits usability, and user experience.\n",
