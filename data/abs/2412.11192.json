In\nrecent years, this field has gained even more attention due to the widespread\nadoption of deep learning models. While these models have achieved impressive\naccuracy in predicting stock behavior, tailoring them to specific scenarios has\nbecome increasingly important. Election Day represents one such critical\nscenario, characterized by intensified market volatility, as the winning\ncandidate's policies significantly impact various economic sectors and\ncompanies. To address this challenge, we propose the Election Day Stock Market\nForecasting (EDSMF) Model. Our approach leverages the contextual capabilities\nof large language models alongside specialized agents designed to analyze the\npolitical and economic consequences of elections. By building on a\nstate-of-the-art architecture, we demonstrate that EDSMF improves the\npredictive performance of the S&P 500 during this uniquely volatile day.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"CffhIVq1Z7ssDcdwevebSlf1ZoJ8X9n9Hqud3qjf0z8","pdfSize":"758223"}
