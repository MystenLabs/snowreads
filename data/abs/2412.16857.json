In this work, we introduce a novel\ntwo-dimensional system that exhibits $g$-wave altermagnetism and undergoes a\nstrain-induced transition from $g$-wave to $d$-wave altermagnetism. This system\ncan be realized in an unconventional monolayer Cairo pentagonal lattice, for\nwhich we present a realistic tight-binding model that incorporates both\nmagnetic and non-magnetic sites. Furthermore, we demonstrate that non-trivial\nband topology can emerge in this system by breaking the symmetry that protects\nthe spin-polarized nodal points. Finally, \\emph{ab initio} calculations on\nseveral candidate materials, such as FeS$_2$ and Nb$_2$FeB$_2$, which exhibit\nsymmetry consistent with the proposed tight-binding Hamiltonian, are also\npresented. These findings open new avenues for exploring spintronic devices\nbased on altermagnetic systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7JTimz-SMjC33efo57AfPEQB19fEUQyQGW63-0ELERs","pdfSize":"9398662"}
