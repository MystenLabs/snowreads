  "abstract": "  We introduce two families of random tridiagonal block matrices for which the\njoint eigenvalue distributions can be computed explicitly. These distributions\nare novel within random matrix theory, and exhibit interactions among\neigenvalue coordinates beyond the typical mean-field log-gas type. Leveraging\nthe matrix models, we go on to describe the point process limits at the edges\nof the spectrum in two ways: through certain random differential operators, and\nalso in terms of coupled systems of diffusions. Along the way we establish\nseveral algebraic identities involving sums of Vandermonde determinant\nproducts.\n",
