  "abstract": "  A Cheeger-Simons triangulation $(K, K')$ of a compact smooth oriented\nRiemannian manifold $M$ gives rise to a Cheeger-Simons model, which defines a\nfinite dimensional differential character group\n$\\mbox{Diff}^{\\bullet}(\\mathscr{CS}(K, K'))$. This group converges to the\nordinary Cheeger-Simons differential character group\n$\\widehat{H}^{\\bullet}(M)$. We introduce a simplicial higher abelian gauge\ntheory based on Cheeger-Simons models and demonstrate that, as the mesh\napproaches zero, the partition function of this theory converges to the one\nproposed by Kelnhofer in \\cite{K2}.\n",
