Free ribbon lemma says that every free\nsphere-link in the 4-sphere is a ribbon sphere-link. Four different proofs of\nFree ribbon lemma are explained. The first proof is done in an earlier paper.\nThe second proof is done by showing that there is an O2-handle basis of a\nribbon surface-link. The third proof is done by removing the commuter relations\nfrom a Wirtinger presentation of a free group, which a paper on another proof\nof Free ribbon lemma complements. The fourth proof is given by the special case\nof the proof of the result that every free surface-link is a ribbon\nsurface-link which is a stabilization of a free ribbon sphere-link. As a\nconsequence, it is shown that a surface-link is a sublink of a free\nsurface-link if and only if it is a stabilization of a ribbon sphere-link.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CCjHlAFqcfLxiEnzzBwhKF_gkJ7yRXtSmjmSyEhLLS4","pdfSize":"134874"}
