  "abstract": "  Optimizing the frequency configuration of qubits and quantum gates in\nsuperconducting quantum chips presents a complex NP-complete optimization\nchallenge. This process is critical for enabling practical control while\nminimizing decoherence and suppressing significant crosstalk. In this paper, we\npropose a neural network-based frequency configuration approach. A trained\nneural network model estimates frequency configuration errors, and an\nintermediate optimization strategy identifies optimal configurations within\nlocalized regions of the chip. The effectiveness of our method is validated\nthrough randomized benchmarking and cross-entropy benchmarking. Furthermore, we\ndesign a crosstalk-aware hardware-efficient ansatz for variational quantum\neigensolvers, achieving improved energy computations.\n",
