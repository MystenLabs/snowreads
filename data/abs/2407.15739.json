In this work, we challenge this constraint and\nextend the domain of this task to general natural images. To this end, we\nintroduce: 1. the ADE-OoD benchmark, which is based on the ADE20k dataset and\nincludes images from diverse domains with a high semantic diversity, and 2. a\nnovel approach that uses Diffusion score matching for OoD detection (DOoD) and\nis robust to the increased semantic diversity. ADE-OoD features indoor and\noutdoor images, defines 150 semantic categories as in-distribution, and\ncontains a variety of OoD objects. For DOoD, we train a diffusion model with an\nMLP architecture on semantic in-distribution embeddings and build on the score\nmatching interpretation to compute pixel-wise OoD scores at inference time. On\ncommon road scene OoD benchmarks, DOoD performs on par or better than the state\nof the art, without using outliers for training or making assumptions about the\ndata domain. On ADE-OoD, DOoD outperforms previous approaches, but leaves much\nroom for future improvements.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"YvXNJco3yQjCFuvbJwG5PmvAzTU8-zpE_92CsiRsIT4","pdfSize":"13152550"}
