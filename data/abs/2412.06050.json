We focus\non two specific issues; 1) the requirements for a fair validation set, and 2)\nthe pitfalls in downsampling DNS data before training. We attempt to shed light\non the impact these issues can have on machine learning and computer vision for\nturbulence. Further, we include statistical and spectral analysis for the\nhomogenous isotropic turbulence from the John Hopkins Turbulence Database, a\nKolmogorov flow, and a Rayleigh-B\\'enard Convection Cell using data generated\nby the authors, to concretely demonstrate these issues.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"GUF-kvVWChGzwjtDxSWcmt5O4la5QF3LKzArsxI4XMk","pdfSize":"3562764"}
