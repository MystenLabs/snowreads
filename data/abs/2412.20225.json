If the state-of-the-art research in Machine and Deep\nLearning for finance has reached interesting results about Credit Scoring\nmodels, usage of such models in a heavily regulated context such as the one in\nbanks has never been done so far. Our work is thus a tentative to challenge the\ncurrent regulatory status-quo and introduce new BASEL 2 and 3 compliant\ntechniques, while still answering the Federal Reserve Bank and the European\nCentral Bank requirements. With the help of Gradient Boosting Machines (mainly\nXGBoost) we challenge an actual model used by BANK A for scoring through the\ndoor Auto Loan applicants. We prove that the usage of such algorithms for\nCredit Scoring models drastically improves performance and default capture\nrate. Furthermore, we leverage the power of Shapley Values to prove that these\nrelatively simple models are not as black-box as the current regulatory system\nthinks they are, and we attempt to explain the model outputs and Credit Scores\nwithin the BANK A Model Design and Validation framework\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Risk Management","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZKW4ttsuxAa8-FnCggl5Khf3zcOHz4kIFq_ylqfSewY","pdfSize":"1218067"}
