In recent years, significant advancements in AI, machine\nlearning, sensor fusion, and\nvehicle-to-everything(V2X)communicationhavepropelledthedevelopmentoffullyautonomous\nvehicles. This paper explores the cutting-edge technologies driving the\nevolution of\nAVs,thechallengesfacedintheirdeployment,andthepotentialsocietal,economic,and\nregulatory impacts. It highlights the key innovations in perception systems,\ndecision-making algorithms, and infrastructure integration, as well as the\nemerging trends towards Level 4 and Level 5 autonomy. The paper also discusses\nfuture directions, including ethical considerations and the roadmap to mass\nadoption of autonomous mobility. Ultimately, the\nintegrationofautonomousvehicles into globaltransportation systems is expected\nto revolutionize urban planning, reduce traffic accidents, and\nsignificantlyloweremissions,pavingthewayforasmarterandmoresustainablefuture.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"kdQwV9ayzn86VdrN5nDp3a_TaWGv6QAVQ3BqTCvc7ic","pdfSize":"328388"}
