  "abstract": "  We study symmetries of quantum circuits with nearest-neighbor U(1) gates\ndiscovering new inhomogeneous screw SU(2) and ${\\rm U}_q({\\rm sl}_2)$\nsymmetries. Despite the model being homogeneous -- all gates are the same --\nsymmetry generators are not. Rather, they exhibit an even-odd staggering and a\nnonzero quasi-momentum, and depend on gate parameters. Such parameter-dependent\nsymmetries can be identified by the Ruelle-Pollicott spectrum of a\nmomentum-resolved truncated propagator. They can be thought of as a\ngeneralization of the standard SU(2) symmetry of the XXZ model that uppon\nintroducing the staggered field splits into a local SU(2) symmetry and a\nnon-local ${\\rm U}_q({\\rm sl}_2)$. Picking an arbitrary U(1) gate and varying\nthe gate duration one will transition through different phases: fractal\nballistic transport, Kardar-Parisi-Zhang superdiffusion at the critical\nmanifold including superdiffusive helix states, and diffusion within which\nthere is also localization. To correctly explain transport the non-local SU(2)\nsymmetries do not matter, while the inhomogeneous local ones that almost\ncommute with the propagator do.\n",
