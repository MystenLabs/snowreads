On the one hand, we characterize the\npositivity of an Hermitian operator by means of a norm condition where the\nfactors of certain pseudo polar decomposition of the operator, are involved. On\nthe other hand, we relate the concept of positive orthogonal decomposition of\nHermitian operators to the notion of proper splittings of operators.\nFurthermore, we present a sufficient condition for the convergence of proper\nsplittings for general bounded linear operators on Hilbert spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mST5oQIBFzNjKm9cQlQtHDwFe4jU2luXOXfuLOl_x-0","pdfSize":"186360"}
