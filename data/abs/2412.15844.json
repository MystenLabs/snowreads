Computer vision applications rely on high-quality datasets, making\ndata curation important. However, data curation is often done ad-hoc and the\nmethods used are rarely published. We present a method for curating large-scale\nimage datasets of invertebrates that contain multiple images of the same taxa\nand/or specimens and have relatively uniform background in the images. Our\napproach is based on extracting feature embeddings with pretrained deep neural\nnetworks, and using these embeddings to find visually most distinct images by\ncomparing their embeddings to the group prototype embedding. Also, we show that\na simple area-based size comparison approach is able to find a lot of common\nerroneous images, such as images containing detached body parts and\nmisclassified samples. In addition to the method, we propose using novel\nmetrics for evaluating human-in-the-loop outlier detection methods. The\nimplementations of the proposed curation methods, as well as a benchmark\ndataset containing annotated erroneous images, are publicly available in\nhttps://github.com/mikkoim/taxonomist-studio.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"INr5Z34cZWKe9WnO4ekLWXNaemAwu6GV0uiHyGsKnjY","pdfSize":"13310504"}
