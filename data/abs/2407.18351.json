However, the gate is unprotected against the propagation\nof ancilla decay errors and hence not fault-tolerant. Here, we propose a CD\ngate scheme with fluxonium as the ancilla, which has been experimentally\ndemonstrated to have a large noise bias and millisecond-level lifetimes. The\nproposed gate is applied cross-resonantly by modulating the external flux of\nthe fluxonium at the frequency of the target oscillator, which requires minimal\nhardware overhead and does not increase sensitivity to decoherence mechanisms\nlike dephasing. We further provide a perturbative description of the gate\nmechanism and identify the error budget. Additionally, we develop an\napproximate procedure for choosing device and gate parameters that optimizes\ngate performance. Following the procedure for multiple sets of fluxonium\nparameters from the literature, we numerically demonstrate CD gates with\nunitary fidelity exceeding 99.9% and gate times of hundreds of nanoseconds.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RzSYWXgWnq13VJDZWjdPmZlbalAz8cU5q7yTFEdVPRg","pdfSize":"1316636"}
