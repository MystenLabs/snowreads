  "abstract": "  We investigate the impact of hyperons and phase transition to quark matter on\nthe structural properties of neutron stars within the four-dimensional\nEinstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity (EGB). We employ the density-dependent\nrelativistic mean-field model (DDME2) for the hadronic phase and the\ndensity-dependent quark mass (DDQM) model for the quark phase to construct\nhadronic and hybrid equations of state (EoSs) that are consistent with the\nastrophysical constraints. The presence of hyperons softens the EoS and with a\nphase transition, the EoS further softens, and the speed of sound squared drops\nto around 0.2 for the maximum mass configuration which lies in the pure quark\nphase. Adjusting the Gaussian-Bonnet coupling constant $\\alpha$ within its\nallowed range results in a decrease in the mass-radius relationship for\nnegative $\\alpha$, and an increase for positive $\\alpha$. In addition,\nfunctions are fitted to the maximum mass and its associated radius as a\nfunction of constant $\\alpha$ to observe its impact on these properties.\n",
