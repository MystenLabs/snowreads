The Arens-Michael envelope of the quantum\nplane is extended up to a Frechet algebra presheaf over its spectrum. The\nobtained ringed space represents the geometry of the quantum plane as a union\nof two irreducible components being copies of the complex plane equipped with\nthe q-topology and the disk topology, respectively. It turns out that the\nFrechet algebra presheaf is commutative modulo its Jacobson radical, which is\ndecomposed into a topological direct sum. The related noncommutative functional\ncalculus problem and the spectral mapping property are solved in terms of the\nnoncommutative Harte spectrum.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ud39Tg-ecl3HSsXeEnzP4IRR0_T-mLpz31jNYB8aD4g","pdfSize":"369764"}
