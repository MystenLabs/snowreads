  "abstract": "  Translating legacy Fortran code into C++ is a crucial step in modernizing\nhigh-performance computing (HPC) applications. However, the scarcity of\nhigh-quality, parallel Fortran-to-C++ datasets and the limited domain-specific\nexpertise in large language models (LLMs) present significant challenges for\nautomated translation. In this paper, we introduce Fortran2CPP, a multi-turn\ndialogue dataset generated by a novel LLM agent-based approach that integrates\na dual-LLM Questioner-Solver module to enhance translation accuracy. Our\ndataset comprises 11.7k dialogues capturing iterative feedback-decision\nworkflows including code translation, compilation, execution, unit testing, and\nerror-fixing. Using this dataset, we fine-tune several open-weight LLMs and\nachieve up to a 3.31x improvement in CodeBLEU scores and a 92\\% increase in\ncompilation success rate, demonstrating enhanced syntactic accuracy and\nfunctional reliability. Our findings highlight the value of dialogue-based LLM\ntraining for complex code translation tasks. The dataset and model have been\nopen-sourced and are available on our public GitHub\nrepository\\footnote{\\url{https://github.com/HPC-Fortran2CPP/Fortran2Cpp}}.\n",
