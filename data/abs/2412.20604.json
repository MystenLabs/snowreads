We solve an open\nproblem in our earlier paper on the existence of second-order Trotter formula\nerror estimation in Jordan-Banach algebras. To illustrate our work, we apply\nour formula to simulate Trotter-factorized spins, and show improvements in the\napproximations. Our approach demonstrates the adaptability of Trotter product\nformulas and estimates to non-associative settings, which offers new insights\ninto the applications of Jordan algebra theory to operator dynamics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QLxti9NAf4a8AQtuLgF2svA-4fFQbkxM3lzzRia3ATY","pdfSize":"831512"}
