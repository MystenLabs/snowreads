Here, we propose a\nnovel strategy for resolving this challenge using graph convolutional proximal\npolicy optimization (GC-PPO). The GC-PPO method can optimally determine how\nmuch power individual buses dispatch to reduce frequency fluctuations across a\npower grid. We demonstrate its efficacy in controlling disturbances by applying\nthe GC-PPO to the power grid of the UK. The performance of GC-PPO is\noutstanding compared to the classical methods. This result highlights the\npromising role of GC-PPO in enhancing the stability and reliability of power\nsystems by switching lines or decentralizing grid topology.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MAjlMBoJ6ofFWoi0-HpMYXuP4343naDspad-SFlRpk8","pdfSize":"1711411"}
