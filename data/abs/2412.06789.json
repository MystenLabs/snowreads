In Part II we address the quantum mechanics of the\nhydrogen atom, testing the correctness and accuracy of the general description.\nThe relation between electron and proton in the atom is described\nsystematically in a construction that is free from analogies or ad-hoc\nderivations and it supersedes conventional Quantum Mechanics (whose equations\nlinked to measurements can be recovered). We briefly discuss why the concept of\nisolation built in Schr\\\"odinger's time evolution is not acceptable and how it\nimmediately results in the well known measurement paradoxes of quantum\nmechanics. We also discuss the epistemic grounds of the development and provide\na criticism of instrumentalism, the leading philosophical perspective behind\nconventional Quantum Mechanics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"btD2a2bPYQgwwKuv5djp8sMU5kt9-vLLTGSFH-x5DF4","pdfSize":"541548"}
