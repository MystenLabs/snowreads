These latter are shared between neighbouring cells,\nwhich gives rise to a globally continuous reconstruction. The semi-discrete\nActive Flux method uses its degrees of freedom to obtain Finite Difference\napproximations to the spatial derivatives which are used in the point value\nupdate. The averages are updated using a quadrature of the flux and making use\nof the point values as quadrature points. The integration in time employs\nstandard Runge-Kutta methods. We show that this generalization of the Active\nFlux method in two and three spatial dimensions is stationarity preserving for\nlinear acoustics on Cartesian grids, and present an analysis of numerical\ndiffusion and stability.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"mpzns6n2VnGswFoWi2i-uYIiZykTv_Z0qhO05RTOuag","pdfSize":"7741985"}
