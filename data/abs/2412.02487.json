Remarkably, in this model, the classical singularity is replaced by\na region where the metric asymptotically approaches a Schwarzschild-de Sitter\none with negative mass. Unlike previously studied spacetime structures, this\nnew quantum-corrected model avoids the presence of Cauchy horizons, potentially\nsuggesting its stability under perturbations. Finally, the covariance of dust\nfield coupling within the effective model is examined.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"n2V5_CJR3bzDtZ9zXUpGylAdP-VnqP9S20mTIMEq_88","pdfSize":"1518488"}
