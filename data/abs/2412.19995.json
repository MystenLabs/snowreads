Therefore, in this paper, a novel\ndistributed SFC provisioning framework is proposed, where the network is\ndivided into several clusters. Each cluster has a dedicated local agent with a\nDRL module to handle the SFC provisioning of demands in that cluster. Also,\nthere is a general agent that can communicate with local agents to handle the\nrequests beyond their capacity. The DRL module of local agents can be applied\nunder different configurations of clusters independent of different numbers of\ndata centers and logical links in each cluster. Simulation results demonstrate\nthat utilizing the proposed distributed framework offers up to 60% improvements\nin the acceptance ratio of service requests in comparison to the centralized\napproach while minimizing the E2E delay of accepted requests.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"FVwKWHJVZ99l5UrjD0KWRa04MB84bYiwueZK_l89r1I","pdfSize":"2967054"}
