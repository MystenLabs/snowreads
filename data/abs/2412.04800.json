  "abstract": "  The high-temperature and high-pressure equations of states (EOSs) of rhenium\nup to 3000 K and 900 GPa are predicted by a recently developed method in the\nframework of statistical ensemble theory with \\textit{ab initio} computational\nprecision. The predicted isothermal EOSs are generally consistent with\nsemi-empirical calculations below 150 GPa and 3000 K. Especially, the predicted\nisobaric EOS at one atmosphere is in good agreement with previous experiments.\nMoreover, the bulk modulus obtained in this work is closer to the experimental\nmeasurements than other theoretical works. Based on our calculations, the\ndisputes between previous experiments are analyzed, and it is expected that the\nEOSs predicted under extreme conditions might be verified in future\nexperiments.\n",
