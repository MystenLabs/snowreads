  "abstract": "  Group field theory is a background-independent approach to quantum gravity\nwhose starting point is the definition of a quantum field theory on an\nauxiliary group manifold (not interpreted as spacetime, but rather as the\nfinite-dimensional configuration space of a single \"atom\" of geometry). Group\nfield theory models can be seen as an extension of matrix and tensor models by\nadditional data, and are traditionally defined through a functional integral\nwhose perturbative expansion generates a sum over discrete geometries. More\nrecently, some efforts have been directed towards formulations of group field\ntheory based on a Hilbert space and operators, in particular in applications to\ncosmology. This is an attempt to review some of these formulations and their\nmain ideas, to disentangle these constructions as much as possible from\napplications and phenomenology, and to put them into a wider context of quantum\ngravity research.\n",
