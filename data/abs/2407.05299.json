We call this idea \"pentagonal algebra\". Few\nexamples of the realisation of this idea are given here, and thus few examples\nof $R$-matrix for the quantum four-simplex equation are presented.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Xo9DdVBUgzYuM-xFmOFyDFlVnznmY20sIqj6IpeWrZY","pdfSize":"239992"}
