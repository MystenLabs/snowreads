A key requirement for\nsuch measures is strict propriety; that probabilities expect themselves to be\nmost accurate. We discuss characterisation results for strictly proper measures\nof accuracy.\n  By making some restrictive assumptions, we present the proof of the\ncharacterisation result of Schervish (1989) in an accessible way. We will also\npresent the characterisation in terms of Bregman divergences and the\nrelationship between the two characterisations.\n  The new contribution of the paper is to show that the Schervish form\ncharacterises proper measures of accuracy for estimates of random variables\nmore generally, by offering a converse to Schervish, Seidenfeld, and Kadane\n(2014, Lemma 1). We also provide a Bregman divergence characterisation in the\nestimates setting, using the close relationship between the two forms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"0Lvsw4OfFP6sTVrxEF03dACCunLMXlCEvN0PUptUYQM","pdfSize":"253189"}
