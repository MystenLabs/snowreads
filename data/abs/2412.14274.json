The Hong-Ou-Mandel\n(HOM) effect, a fundamental two-photon interference phenomenon in quantum\noptics, offers significant potential to extend the applications of VMs beyond\nthe classical regime. Here, we demonstrate the simultaneous generation of all\nfour Bell states by exploiting the HOM interference of VMs. The resulting Bell\nstates exhibit spatially tailored distributions that are determined by the\ninput modes. These results represent a significant step in manipulating HOM\ninterference within structured photons, offering promising avenues for\nhigh-dimensional quantum information processing and in particular\nhigh-dimensional quantum communication, quantum sensing, and advanced photonic\ntechnologies reliant on tailored quantum states of light.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rdVjJ3Ld_Ci1LGfBj7URdlQGuPTf-A93S3pZ2m3rAWc","pdfSize":"4269647"}
