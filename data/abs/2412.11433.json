  "abstract": "  This paper investigates a novel class of mean field games involving a major\nagent and numerous minor agents, where the agents' functionals are recursive\nwith nonlinear backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE)\nrepresentations. We term these games \"recursive major-minor\" (RMM) problems.\nOur RMM modeling is quite general, as it employs empirical (state, control)\naverages to define the weak couplings in both the functionals and dynamics of\nall agents, regardless of their status as major or minor. We construct an\nauxiliary limiting problem of the RMM by a novel unified structural scheme\ncombining a bilateral perturbation with a mixed hierarchical recomposition.\nThis scheme has its own merits as it can be applied to analyze more complex\ncoupling structures than those in the current RMM. Subsequently, we derive the\ncorresponding consistency condition and explore asymptotic RMM equilibria.\nAdditionally, we examine the RMM problem in specific linear-quadratic settings\nfor illustrative purposes.\n",
