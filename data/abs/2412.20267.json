  "abstract": "  Plastic scintillator detectors with three-dimensional granularity and\nsub-nanosecond time resolution offer simultaneous particle tracking,\nidentification, and calorimetry. However, scaling to larger volumes and finer\nsegmentation poses significant challenges in manufacturing and assembly due to\nhigh costs, extensive time, and precision requirements. To address this, the\n3DET R\\&D collaboration has developed an innovative additive manufacturing\napproach, allowing for the monolithic fabrication of three-dimensional granular\nscintillators without the need for additional processing steps. A prototype,\nfeaturing a 5 $\\times$ 5 $\\times$ 5 matrix of optically isolated scintillating\nvoxels integrated with wavelength shifting fibers, was manufactured and tested\nusing cosmic rays and CERN test beams, demonstrating comparable light yield and\nreduced crosstalk compared to traditional methods. The developed additive\nmanufacturing technique offers a viable, time-efficient, and cost-effective\nsolution for producing next-generation scintillator detectors, maintaining high\nperformance regardless of size and geometric complexity.\n",
