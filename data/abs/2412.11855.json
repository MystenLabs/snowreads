The well-known \"declarative vs. procedural\ncontroversy\" is concerned with the choice of utilizing declarations or\nprocedures as the primary mode of knowledge representation. The ongoing debate\nbetween symbolic AI and connectionist AI also revolves around the question of\nwhether knowledge should be represented implicitly (e.g., as parametric\nknowledge in deep learning and large language models) or explicitly (e.g., as\nlogical theories in traditional knowledge representation and reasoning). To\naddress these issues, we propose a general framework to capture various\nknowledge representation formalisms in which we are interested. Within the\nframework, we find a family of universal knowledge representation formalisms,\nand prove that all universal formalisms are recursively isomorphic. Moreover,\nwe show that all pairwise intertranslatable formalisms that admit the padding\nproperty are also recursively isomorphic. These imply that, up to an offline\ncompilation, all universal (or natural and equally expressive) representation\nformalisms are in fact the same, which thus provides a partial answer to the\naforementioned dispute.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Computational Complexity","Computer Science/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UnU_EhXwNqayYFU66vd-k2DZ2cdlmKwRobotqNC-_ko","pdfSize":"211023"}
