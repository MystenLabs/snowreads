  "abstract": "  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet\ntheir scalability raises a critical question: Have we reached the scaling\nceiling? This paper addresses this pivotal question by developing a unified\ntheoretical framework that integrates mathematical and statistical insights to\nexplain the scaling dynamics of LLMs. We present: 1. Central Limit Theorem\n(CLT) for Hidden Representations: We show that noise in hidden representations\nscales inversely with context size, explaining stabilization effects and the\nlimits of context length improvements. 2. Bias-Variance Decomposition: We\ndecompose next-token prediction loss into irreducible entropy, capacity-driven\nbias, and finite sample variance, revealing trade-offs where scaling yields\ndiminishing returns. 3. Emergent SNR Thresholds: By defining signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR), we quantify how capabilities emerge abruptly once SNR surpasses a\nthreshold, offering insights into when scaling becomes less effective. Through\nthis framework, we conclude that while LLMs have not reached an absolute\nscaling ceiling, practical constraints are increasingly prominent: diminishing\nreturns, resource inefficiencies, and data limitations. Future progress will\nrequire a shift from brute-force scaling to innovations in architecture, data\nquality, and training paradigms. This work provides a roadmap for guiding the\nefficient development of next-generation LLMs and advancing the field beyond\ntraditional scaling strategies.\n  Keywords: Large Language Models; Scaling Ceiling; Central Limit Theorem;\nBias-Variance Trade-Off; Signal-to-Noise Ratio; Emergent Capabilities\n",
