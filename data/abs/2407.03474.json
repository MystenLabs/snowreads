This paper seeks to understand the conditions that\nfoster repeated collaboration among women versus men in male-dominated settings\nby examining the critical role of status hierarchies. Using collaboration data\non 8,232,769 computer science research teams, we found that when a woman holds\nthe top-ranking position in a steep status hierarchy, other women on that team\nare more likely than men to collaborate again, as compared to when the\nhierarchy is flat, and compared to when men occupy the top-ranking position. In\nsteep hierarchies, top-ranking women but not top-ranking men foster conditions\nin which junior women are more likely to collaborate again than junior men of\nsimilar status levels. Our research suggests that whereas status hierarchies\nare especially detrimental to repeated collaboration among underrepresented\nindividuals, top-ranking women in steep status hierarchies mitigate these\nnegative impacts between women in male-dominated settings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xJ_D3C2twMmqphAWmkSSqLyJbj94x7ME39EgpipCdwE","pdfSize":"941297"}
