  "abstract": "  Spectral clustering is a popular clustering method. It first maps data into\nthe spectral embedding space and then uses Kmeans to find clusters. However,\nthe two decoupled steps prohibit joint optimization for the optimal solution.\nIn addition, it needs to construct the similarity graph for samples, which\nsuffers from the curse of dimensionality when the data are high-dimensional. To\naddress these two challenges, we introduce \\textbf{D}eep \\textbf{S}pectral\n\\textbf{C}lustering (\\textbf{DSC}), which consists of two main modules: the\nspectral embedding module and the greedy Kmeans module. The former module\nlearns to efficiently embed raw samples into the spectral embedding space using\ndeep neural networks and power iteration. The latter module improves the\ncluster structures of Kmeans on the learned spectral embeddings by a greedy\noptimization strategy, which iteratively reveals the direction of the worst\ncluster structures and optimizes embeddings in this direction. To jointly\noptimize spectral embeddings and clustering, we seamlessly integrate the two\nmodules and optimize them in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results on\nseven real-world datasets demonstrate that DSC achieves state-of-the-art\nclustering performance.\n",
