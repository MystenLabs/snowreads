When a neighbour expresses\nstrong emotions (e.g., fear, anger, excitement) based on a false statement,\nthese emotions can be transmitted to others, especially through interactions on\nsocial media. Therefore, exploring the mechanism that explains how an\nindividuals emotions change under the influence of a neighbours false statement\nis a practically important task. In this work, we systematically examining the\npublics personal, interpersonal, and historical emotional influence based on\nsocial context, content, and emotional based features. The contribution of this\npaper is to build an emotionally infused model called the Emotional based User\nSequential Influence Model(EUSIM) to understand users temporal emotional\npropagation patterns and predict future emotions against false information.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"4PJPj7U20EO10wZ5NYO8TT6m8OfivqnrUPWDFEdU_BY","pdfSize":"513924"}
