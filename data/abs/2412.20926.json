We start by giving a new R-matrix description of\nthe trigonometric Ruijsenaars-Schneider (RS) Hamiltonians and eigenfunctions\nusing the intertwiners of quantum toroidal algebra. We then consider elliptic\ndeformations of the RS system, elucidate how Shiraishi functions appear\nnaturally in the process and relate them to certain special infinite system of\nintertwiners of the algebra. We further show that there are two distinguished\nelliptic deformations, one of which leads to the conventional elliptic RS\nHamiltonians, while the other produces trigonometric Koroteev-Shakirov\nHamiltonians. Along the way we prove the fully noncommutative version of the\n\"noncommutative Jacobi identities\" for affine qq-characters recently introduced\nby Grekov and Nekrasov.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uwLeOfLtdkAgMOo-sGHPIglOjuFLIhaNGK7zyhTZ7pQ","pdfSize":"2884899"}
