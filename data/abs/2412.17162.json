{"id":"2412.17162","title":"Generative Diffusion Modeling: A Practical Handbook","authors":"Zihan Ding, Chi Jin","authorsParsed":[["Ding","Zihan",""],["Jin","Chi",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Dec 2024 21:02:36 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-24","timestamp":1734901356000,"abstract":"  This handbook offers a unified perspective on diffusion models, encompassing\ndiffusion probabilistic models, score-based generative models, consistency\nmodels, rectified flow, and related methods. By standardizing notations and\naligning them with code implementations, it aims to bridge the \"paper-to-code\"\ngap and facilitate robust implementations and fair comparisons. The content\nencompasses the fundamentals of diffusion models, the pre-training process, and\nvarious post-training methods. Post-training techniques include model\ndistillation and reward-based fine-tuning. Designed as a practical guide, it\nemphasizes clarity and usability over theoretical depth, focusing on widely\nadopted approaches in generative modeling with diffusion models.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_K-ah9Kq0J7JNqEN1SDunBc5VwLQQI7po5BBGd0PZZ4","pdfSize":"5758625"}
