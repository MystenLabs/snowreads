  "abstract": "  Second-order topological superconductors host Majorana corner modes (MCMs),\nwhich are confined to specific corners of the system. This spatial restriction\npresents challenges for manipulating and relocating MCMs. We propose a novel\nprotocol for dynamically controlling the movement of time-reversal symmetric\nMCMs in a heterostructure consisting of a 2D Weyl semimetal and a $d$-wave\nsuperconductor. By leveraging the energy asymmetry of topological edge states\nin the 2D Weyl semimetal, the position of MCMs can be effectively tuned via\nchemical potential adjustments. We further introduce a device architecture that\nintegrates multiple heterostructure blocks, each controlled by independent gate\nvoltages, to enable the adiabatic movement and exchange of MCMs. This approach\ndemonstrates a robust mechanism for Majorana manipulation and provides a\nscalable framework for future experimental studies of topological quantum\ncomputation.\n",
