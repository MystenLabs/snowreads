This broad applicability has come about through its design\nas an Open Source ANSI-C toolkit (and Python binary extensions), with\nindependent components to perform each step in the creation of a mosaic and\nwith support for all WCS extensions. This design enables easy integration into\ncustom environments, workflows and pipelines, and is the principal reason for\nits long lifetime. Here we emphasize the growing use of Montage in radio\nastronomy (37 peer-reviewed papers since 2020), and will focus on three\nhigh-profile applications: (1) Analysis of observations made with SKA precursor\nexperiments, such as MeerKAT and the Murchison Wide-field Array, (2) Faraday\ntomography of LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey data (LoTSS-DR2), which explores the\nstructure of the local interstellar medium, and (3) Identification of fast\nradio bursts.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"z63ZNAI7lEHH9XauUy3bbrH8afdCyT8ZY5kfnfR5wcY","pdfSize":"2623095"}
