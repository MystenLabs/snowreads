In the current investigation, we experimentally verify this concept,\nwith the weak gravitational force being changed to the strong Coulomb force.\nThe tests are performed on capacitive cells with the same nanoporous electrodes\nand various electrolyte concentrations. The key characteristic is that the\nnanopore size is only slightly larger than the ion size, less than twice the\nion size. The confinement effect of the nanopore walls plays the role of the\nspontaneously nonequilibrium dimension (SND). At first glance, the capacitive\ncells exhibit \"normal\" charge curves. However, their steady-state ion\ndistribution significantly differs from thermodynamic equilibrium. The measured\npotential difference is nearly an order of magnitude larger than the prediction\nof equilibrium thermodynamics. Such phenomena are in line with the molecular\ndynamics simulations reported in the open literature.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PcqRU83YFimiun91nDJdhjFw1ardWDcez6txBXEp_s4","pdfSize":"1147048"}
