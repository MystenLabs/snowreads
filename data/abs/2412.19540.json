  "abstract": "  Genuinely entangled subspaces (GESs) are valuable resources in quantum\ninformation science. Among these, the three-qubit GHZ-W GES, spanned by the\nthree-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and W states, is a universal and\ncrucial entangled subspace resource for three-qubit systems. In this work, we\ndevelop two adaptive verification strategies, the XZ strategy and the rotation\nstrategy, for the three-qubit GHZ-W GES using local measurements and one-way\nclassical communication. These strategies are experimentally feasible,\nefficient and possess a concise analytical expression for the sample complexity\nof the rotation strategy, which scales approximately as\n$2.248/\\epsilon\\ln(1/\\delta)$, where $\\epsilon$ is the infidelity and\n$1-\\delta$ is the confidence level. Furthermore, we comprehensively analyze the\ntwo-dimensional two-qubit subspaces and classify them into three distinct\ntypes, including unverifiable entangled subspaces, revealing intrinsic\nlimitations in local verification of entangled subspaces.\n",
