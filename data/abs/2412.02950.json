While Visual Odometry (VO)\ncan offer a reasonable estimation of the robot's state, traditional VO methods\nencounter challenges when confronted with dynamic objects in the scene.\nAlternatively, an upward-facing camera can be utilized to track the robot's\nmovement relative to the ceiling, which represents a static and consistent\nspace. We introduce in this paper Ceiling-DSO, a ceiling-vision system based on\nDirect Sparse Odometry (DSO). Unlike other ceiling-vision systems, Ceiling-DSO\ntakes advantage of the versatile formulation of DSO, avoiding assumptions about\nobservable shapes or landmarks on the ceiling. This approach ensures the\nmethod's applicability to various ceiling types. Since no publicly available\ndataset for ceiling-vision exists, we created a custom dataset in a real-world\nscenario and employed it to evaluate our approach. By adjusting DSO parameters,\nwe identified the optimal fit for online pose estimation, resulting in\nacceptable error rates compared to ground truth. We provide in this paper a\nqualitative and quantitative analysis of the obtained results.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Robotics","Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3aXR72e240qJ4gHXDeBo4P8CK7GdbCv0ZfkV7_Q1eHs","pdfSize":"2880033"}
