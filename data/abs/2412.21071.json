  "abstract": "  Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a variational quantum\nalgorithm (VQA) ideal for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors,\nand is highly successful for solving combinatorial optimization problems\n(COPs). It has been observed that the optimal variational parameters obtained\nfrom one instance of a COP can be transferred to another instance, producing\nsufficiently satisfactory solutions for the latter. In this context, a suitable\nmethod for further improving the solution is to fine-tune a subset of the\ntransferred parameters. We numerically explore the role of optimizing\nindividual QAOA layers in improving the approximate solution of the Max-Cut\nproblem after parameter transfer. We also investigate the trade-off between a\ngood approximation and the required optimization time when optimizing\ntransferred QAOA parameters. These studies show that optimizing a subset of\nlayers can be more effective at a lower time-cost compared to optimizing all\nlayers.\n",
