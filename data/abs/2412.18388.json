  "abstract": "  In this paper, we address how to implement T duality to the closed string\ntree cylinder amplitude between a Dp brane and a Dp$'$ brane with $p - p' = 2\n\\,n$. For this, we first compute the closed string tree cylinder amplitude\nbetween these two D branes with common longitudinal and transverse circle\ncompactifications. We then show explicitly how to perform a T duality to this\namplitude along either a longitudinal or a transverse compactified direction to\nboth branes. In the decompactification limit, we show that either the\ncompactified cylinder amplitude or the T dual compactified cylinder one gives\nthe known non-compactified one as expected.\n",
