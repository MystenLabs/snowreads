A combination of three Morse functions are\njoined smoothly to prepare the reference potential. While the regular Morse\nfunction captures the nuclear and Coulomb interactions at short and medium\nranges, an inverse Morse function is chosen to obtain the Coulomb barrier that\narises because of the long-range Coulomb interaction. This reference potential\nis representative of a large family of curves consisting of eight distinct\nmodel parameters and two intermediate points that define the boundaries that\nexist between the three regions. The phase equation is solved using the\nRunge-Kutta 5th order method for the input reference potential to obtain the\nscattering phase shifts at various center of mass energies. The model\nparameters are then adjusted using the genetic algorithm in an iterative\nfashion to minimize the mean square error between the simulated and expected\nphase shift values. Our approach successfully constructed the inverse\npotentials for the resonant f states of the {\\alpha}-3H and {\\alpha}-3He\nsystems, achieving convergence with a minimized mean square error. The\nresonance energies and widths for the {\\alpha}-3H system for the f-5/2 and\nf-7/2 states are determined to be [4.19 (4.14), 1.225 (0.918)] MeV and [2.20\n(2.18), 0.099 (0.069)] MeV, respectively. For the f-5/2 and f-7/2 states of the\n{\\alpha}-3He system, the resonance energies and widths are [5.03 (5.14), 1.6\n(1.2)] MeV and [2.99 (2.98), 0.182(0.175)] MeV, respectively. Our ab-initio\napproach to solve the phase equation utilizing a combination of smoothly joined\nMorse functions effectively captures both short-range nuclear and long-range\nCoulomb interactions, providing an accurate model for nuclear scattering\ninvolving charged particles.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FsEQ2sp61DRmthqTuUf6mnRQl8rB490sV4UtrYDDxTg","pdfSize":"910581"}
