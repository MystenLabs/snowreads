As an alternative, so-called\n\"storyline\" studies investigate the impact of a warmer world on a single,\nspecific weather event. This can be seen as a conditional attribution\nstatement. In this study, we connect conditional to unconditional attribution\nusing Bayes theorem: in essence, the conditional statement is composed of two\nunconditional statements, one based on all available data (event and\nconditions) and one based on the conditions alone. We explore the effects of\nthe conditioning in a simple statistical toy model and a real-world attribution\nof European summer temperatures conditional on blocking. The resulting\nattribution statement is generally strengthened if the conditions are not\naffected by climate change. Conversely, if part of the trend is contained in\nthe conditions, a weaker attribution statement may result.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"MjfUcOAplHVeYLy1CHlYub_M-KwXxlPH-pchF_c1kns","pdfSize":"1444831","objectId":"0x3093da08d45c978dce43fa50a39865ca09642c8fcd303b028d4e4ccd321def8b","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
