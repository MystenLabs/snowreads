We interpret it by means of a\ncomputationally grounded semantics using belief bases. Our language includes\nfive types of modal operators for implicit belief, complete attraction,\ncomplete repulsion, realistic attraction and realistic repulsion. We give an\naxiomatization and show that our operators are not mutually expressible and\nthat they can be combined to represent a large variety of psychological\nconcepts including ambivalence, indifference, being motivated, being\ndemotivated and preference. We present a dynamic extension of the language that\nsupports reasoning about the effects of belief change operations. Finally, we\nprovide a succinct formulation of model checking for our languages and a PSPACE\nmodel checking algorithm relying on a reduction into TQBF. We present some\nexperimental results for the implemented algorithm on computation time in a\nconcrete example.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Logic in Computer Science","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bwNlvQt3t3EioKoi5U5m18RDOck7OmH_2LYfwmk13vw","pdfSize":"242731"}
