This is typically estimated by a scale variation\nprocedure, which has well-known shortcomings. In this work, we propose a simple\nprescription to directly encode the missing higher order terms using theory\nnuisance parameters (TNPs) and estimate the uncertainty by their variation. We\nstudy multiple processes relevant for Large Hadron Collider physics at\nnext-to-leading and next-to-next-to-leading order in perturbation theory,\nobtaining MHOU estimates for differential observables in each case. In cases\nwhere scale variations are well-behaved we are able to replicate their effects\nusing TNPs, while we find significant improvement in cases where scale\nvariation typically underestimates the uncertainty.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UKsQ3qSIqcQE-43Lh5dLoLbxnkHmzvjLxfyfZvlo0dI","pdfSize":"814753"}
