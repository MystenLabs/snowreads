This has motivated the study of thermodynamically inspired approaches to\nground-state preparation that aim to replicate cooling processes via\nimaginary-time evolution. However, synthesizing quantum circuits that\nefficiently implement imaginary-time evolution is itself difficult, with prior\nproposals generally adopting heuristic variational approaches or using deep\nblock encodings. Here, we use the insight that quantum imaginary-time evolution\nis a solution of Brockett's double-bracket flow and synthesize circuits that\nimplement double-bracket flows coherently on the quantum computer. We prove\nthat our Double-Bracket Quantum Imaginary-Time Evolution (DB-QITE) algorithm\ninherits the cooling guarantees of imaginary-time evolution. Concretely, each\nstep is guaranteed to i) decrease the energy of an initial approximate\nground-state by an amount proportion to the energy fluctuations of the initial\nstate and ii) increase the fidelity with the ground-state. Thus DB-QITE\nprovides a means to systematically improve the approximation of a ground-state\nusing shallow circuits.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DjBW5jamL_z0EVRitxZOuKsEhhJUIeVMVdNcvqTjm98","pdfSize":"665684"}
