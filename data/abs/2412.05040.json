  "abstract": "  Mechanisms of emergence and destruction are analyzed, as well as\ncharacteristics of synchronous and asynchronous modes of behavior of ensembles\n(swarms) of interacting mobile agents moving according to chaotic phase\ntrajectories of Rossler and Lorenz systems. The possibility of organizing\nsequential and parallel motion of agents based on the effect of chaotic phase\nsynchronization is demonstrated.\n",
