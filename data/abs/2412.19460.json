A `permanent' change in the radius of the initial circle\nand a shift of its centre is noted at later times, after the pulse is switched\noff. The velocity vector (components and magnitude) undergoes a change too,\nakin to a `velocity kick'. The cause behind this permanent change appears to be\nlinked to the difference between the vector potentials before and after the\nduration of the electric pulse. Further, we show how such vector potentials in\nthe past and future are related through a gauge transformation. In summary, our\nresults suggest a pulse-induced `electromagnetic memory-like effect', which is\nnot quite a `wave memory', but, nevertheless, has similar features within a\nsimple, non-relativistic context.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RAZubVNIfIHBwcZPNJ0IFRlb5MKFpIEv2NlKvAtYOUQ","pdfSize":"413404"}
