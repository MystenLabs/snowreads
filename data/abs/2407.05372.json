Our\nmethod integrates favorable features from mainstream imputation approaches:\noptimal matching, regression imputation, and synthetic control. We impute\ncounterfactual outcomes based on convex combinations of observed outcomes,\ndefined based on an optimal coupling between the treated and control data sets.\nThe optimal coupling problem is considered a convex relaxation to the\ncombinatorial optimal matching problem. We estimate granular-level individual\ntreatment effects while maintaining a desirable aggregate-level summary by\nproperly constraining the coupling. We construct transparent, individual\nconfidence intervals for the estimated counterfactual outcomes. We devise fast\niterative entropic-regularized algorithms to solve the optimal coupling problem\nthat scales favorably when the number of units to match is large. Entropic\nregularization plays a crucial role in both inference and computation; it helps\ncontrol the width of the individual confidence intervals and design fast\noptimization algorithms.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FD2qFQjZXlW9dMpLX66hWY6Np00-ZdPKWIuetp3UyhI","pdfSize":"1206644"}
