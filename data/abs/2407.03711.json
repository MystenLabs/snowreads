Recent Internet of\nThings (IoT) devices and microcontrollers (MCUs), become more and more\nmainstream in everyday activities. In this work we focus on the family of STM32\nMCUs. We propose a novel methodology for CNN deployment on the STM32 family,\nfocusing on power optimization through effective clocking exploration and\nconfiguration and decoupled access-execute convolution kernel execution. Our\napproach is enhanced with optimization of the power consumption through Dynamic\nVoltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) under various latency constraints,\ncomposing an NP-complete optimization problem. We compare our approach against\nthe state-of-the-art TinyEngine inference engine, as well as TinyEngine coupled\nwith power-saving modes of the STM32 MCUs, indicating that we can achieve up to\n25.2% less energy consumption for varying QoS levels.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GYWZVIE6xOWQC-4Qu3po0SlLzQF61n1oCEpahK51KQc","pdfSize":"661889"}
