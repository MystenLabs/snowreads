  "abstract": "  We investigate an improved method to extract nucleon matrix elements from\nlattice 3-point functions using a generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) with\nnucleon and pion-nucleon interpolating fields. Our method avoids the\ncomputation of the costly three-point functions that have pion-nucleon\ninterpolators at both source and sink. We demonstrate that excited state\ncontamination from $N\\pi$ is minimized in nucleon matrix elements of the\nscalar, vector, pseudoscalar, axial, and tensor currents and discuss our\nresults based on a physical-point ensemble with a pion mass value of 131 MeV.\nWe find that the GEVP is most significant for the isovector pseudoscalar and\naxial currents.\n",
