The analysis employs the Tamarin Prover, a\nstate-of-the-art tool for symbolic verification, to evaluate key security\nproperties such as authentication, confidentiality, integrity, mutual\nauthentication, and replay prevention. We model the protocol's components,\nincluding trust relationships, secure channels, and adversary capabilities\nunder the Dolev-Yao model. Verification results confirm the protocol's\nrobustness against common attacks such as message tampering, impersonation, and\nreplay. Additionally, dependency graphs and detailed proofs demonstrate the\nsuccessful enforcement of security properties like voucher authenticity, data\nconfidentiality, and key integrity. The study identifies potential\nenhancements, such as incorporating timestamp-based validity checks and\naugmenting mutual authentication mechanisms to address insider threats and key\nmanagement challenges. This work highlights the advantages and limitations of\nusing the Tamarin Prover for formal security verification and proposes\nstrategies to mitigate scalability and performance constraints in complex\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"fmekpp6lopmCgheoT_h3SqGnuPmnA1WsRSC33TI7xN8","pdfSize":"366839"}
