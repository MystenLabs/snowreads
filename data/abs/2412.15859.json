  "abstract": "  The Python Battery Optimisation and Parameterisation (PyBOP) package provides\nmethods for estimating and optimising battery model parameters, offering both\ndeterministic and stochastic approaches with example workflows to assist users.\nPyBOP enables parameter identification from data for various battery models,\nincluding the electrochemical and equivalent circuit models provided by the\npopular open-source PyBaMM package. Using the same approaches, PyBOP can also\nbe used for design optimisation under user-defined operating conditions across\na variety of model structures and design goals. PyBOP facilitates optimisation\nwith a range of methods, with diagnostics for examining optimiser performance\nand convergence of the cost and corresponding parameters. Identified parameters\ncan be used for prediction, on-line estimation and control, and design\noptimisation, accelerating battery research and development.\n",
