  "abstract": "  Recent $2-4\\sigma$ deviations from the Cosmological Constant $\\Lambda$\nsuggest that dark energy (DE) may be dynamical, based on baryon acoustic\noscillations and full-shape galaxy clustering (FS GC) analyses. This calls for\neven tighter DE constraints to narrow down its true nature. In this Letter, we\nexplore how galaxy intrinsic alignments (IA) can enhance the FS GC-based DE\nconstraints, using Fisher forecasts on various extensions of dynamical DE\nmodels, including scenarios with curvature, massive neutrinos, and modified\ngravity. Incorporating IA improves the DE Figure-of-Merit by $42-57\\%$ and\ntightens the primordial power spectrum amplitude constraints by $17-19\\%$. Our\nfindings highlight IA's potential as a valuable cosmological probe\ncomplementary to GC.\n",
