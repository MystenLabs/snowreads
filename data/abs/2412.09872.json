The statistical methodology for $L_p$-quantile is not only feasible\nbut also straightforward to implement as it represents a specific form of\nM-quantile using $p$-power loss function. In this paper, we introduce the\nconcept of Tail Risk Equivalent Level Transition (TRELT) to capture changes in\ntail risk when we make a risk transition between two $L_p$-quantiles. TRELT is\nmotivated by PELVE in Li and Wang (2023) but for tail risk. As it remains\nunknown in theory how this transition works, we investigate the existence,\nuniqueness, and asymptotic properties of TRELT (as well as dual TRELT) for\n$L_p$-quantiles. In addition, we study the inference methods for TRELT and\nextreme $L_p$-quantiles by using this risk transition, which turns out to be a\nnovel extrapolation method in extreme value theory. The asymptotic properties\nof the proposed estimators are established, and both simulation studies and\nreal data analysis are conducted to demonstrate their empirical performance.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Zz-xFKzJQWwcoSHvb_M0rz0_jXsUJVDLxX5wzgqkTGA","pdfSize":"1007582"}
