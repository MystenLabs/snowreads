This improves upon the original\nSecond Main Theorem for the Askey-Wilson operator due to Chiang and Feng. In\naddition, by taking into account the number of irreducible components of\nhypersurfaces, an Askey-Wilson version of the Truncated Second Main Theorem for\nholomorphic curves into projective space with hypersurfaces located in\n$l$-subgeneral position is obtained.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zNQ6NNiWGGQ0u5rgN-gwZifi0lN73njDtMOw_2Os7z0","pdfSize":"467203"}
