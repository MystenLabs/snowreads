To test the internal consistency of this\nproposal, we analyze the phi4 kink in (1+1) dimensions, an established\ntopological defect with a well-known oscillation spectrum. We introduce an\nemergent gravitational term, h00(x), regulated by a coupling parameter G, under\na linearized regime valid up to G = 0.02. Using numerical methods, including\nthe shooting method and fine-tuning in Mathematica, we solve for both h00(x)\nand kink fluctuations, evaluating the fundamental eigenvalue omega^2. Our\nresults show that, for G <= 0.02, omega^2 remains very close to 1.0, virtually\nunchanged from the case without gravity. This indicates that the adopted\nemergent gravity does not break the topological stability of the phi4 kink,\ndemonstrating the initial robustness of the theory. We discuss the implications\nof these findings, connections to other emergent gravity approaches, and\nextensions to nonlinear regimes, higher-dimensional frameworks, and time\nquantization. While presenting a novel perspective, the theory offers a\ncoherent framework capable of unifying vibrational concepts and topological\nstructures, reinforcing its potential to unify fundamental forces under\nvibrational logic extending to time quantization and the cohesion of\ncosmological and subatomic scales.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ODs5y9LZzkHhnaf6F9-UVHMkYD2ZOB6P_SXcioAnNnM","pdfSize":"412611"}
