We\nintroduce key terms and connect these insights to the field of radiation\noncology by illustrating how noise contributes to errors in clinically relevant\nareas such as contouring. Additionally, we propose practical strategies to\nreduce noise in radiation oncology, such as through judgment aggregation and\nthe use of artificial intelligence tools, building on the principles outlined\nin the book.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ggdr8grbVTEakHSNyF45sx0b4RIGceZ_9jVmWr_wWOg","pdfSize":"375824"}
