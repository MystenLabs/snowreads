{"id":"2412.12193","title":"Interpreting Reactor Antineutrino Anomalies","authors":"Ilham El Atmani","authorsParsed":[["Atmani","Ilham El",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Dec 2024 01:04:34 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-18","timestamp":1734138274000,"abstract":"  The experimental and theoretical research on the physics of massive neutrinos\nis based on the standard paradigm of three-neutrino mixing, which describes the\noscillations of neutrino flavors measured in solar, atmospheric, and\nlong-baseline experiments. However, several anomalies, corresponding to an\n$L/E$ of 1m/MeV, could be interpreted by involving sterile neutrinos, as in the\nReactor Antineutrino Anomaly (RAA) and Gallium anomaly. STEREO was designed to\ninvestigate this conjecture, which could potentially extend the Standard Model\n(SM). The detector provides a comprehensive study of anomalies for a pure\n$^{235}\\text{U} $ antineutrino spectrum, using a Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU)\ncore. We describe an analysis of the full set of data generated by STEREO and\nan accurate prediction of reactor antineutrinos. The measured antineutrino\nenergy spectrum suggests that the anomalies originate from biases in nuclear\nexperimental data used for predictions, while rejecting the hypothesis of a\nlight sterile neutrino. Our result supports the neutrino content of the SM and\nestablishes a new reference for the $^{235}\\text{U}$ antineutrino energy\nspectrum.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iMxrqdxra7n6dV1ye8rQr4lsM2AulMqQHAduYohXL9k","pdfSize":"704317"}
