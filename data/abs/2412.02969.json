Some crucial\nstandards for evaluating non-deductive inferences have been assumed separately\nin those areas, but can actually be justified by a unifying principle.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Other Statistics","Computer Science/Machine Learning","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"3db6fM_psGOqN54Wak2yS-GS8b1DAeVhB9Rz3OSOyqs","pdfSize":"193939"}
