To address this issue, we design a lifelong\nautonomous experiential learning framework based on LLMs to explore whether\nLLMs can imitate human ability for learning and utilizing experience. It\nautonomously learns and accumulates experience through experience transfer and\ninduction, categorizing the types of input questions to select which\naccumulated experience to employ for them. Experimental results on six widely\nused NLP datasets show that our framework performs reliably in each\nintermediate step and effectively improves the performance of GPT-3.5 and\nGPT-4. This validates the feasibility of using LLMs to mimic human experiential\nlearning and application capabilities. Additionally, we provide a detailed\nanalysis of the behavior of our framework at each step.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"D4V-tRz28U-K-JvvSnPqaafqxWgBWvAIwT_N1N0_uzI","pdfSize":"884531"}
