We\ninvestigate the asymptotic behavior of the operator norms ${{\\bf R}_{\\mathbb\nS^{d-1}}}(p\\to q)$ and ${\\bf R}_{\\mathbb S^{d-1}} (p\\to q;\\textrm{rad})$ as the\ndimension $d$ tends to infinity. We further establish a dimension-free endpoint\nStein-Tomas inequality for radial functions, together with the corresponding\nestimate for general functions which we prove with an $O(d^{1/2})$ dependence.\nOur methods rely on a uniform two-sided refinement of Stempak's asymptotic\n$L^p$ estimate of Bessel functions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qRN6yjXefkeh7wLsHkbdFXvopw8IKeIvMZSoLWgV1aw","pdfSize":"254243"}
