Solutions to this problem are categorized into\nincremental and global approaches. Until now, the most popular systems follow\nthe incremental paradigm due to its superior accuracy and robustness, while\nglobal approaches are drastically more scalable and efficient. With this work,\nwe revisit the problem of global SfM and propose GLOMAP as a new\ngeneral-purpose system that outperforms the state of the art in global SfM. In\nterms of accuracy and robustness, we achieve results on-par or superior to\nCOLMAP, the most widely used incremental SfM, while being orders of magnitude\nfaster. We share our system as an open-source implementation at\n{https://github.com/colmap/glomap}.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"o_Z0J-kq1gGqg8PnR-3yIxfGFj23tvl9LTxbiKrA2Ls","pdfSize":"42075439"}
