We extend our previous analysis at $N_t=4$ to finer\nlattices and perform high-precision analyses on large spatial volumes up to the\naspect ratio $LT=N_s/N_t=18$. Higher order terms in the hopping-parameter\nexpansion are incorporated effectively up to 14th order. The numerical results\nshow that the violation of the finite-size scaling becomes more prominent on\nthe finer lattice at a given aspect ratio.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FuxWUDfhGqjRJ_Zp5w5idK2liFwFX2s497VkRd4flOE","pdfSize":"5254476"}
