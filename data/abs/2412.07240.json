The aim is to incorporate spectral differentiation methods\ninto the solution to the Fokker-Planck equation in grid-based state estimation\nroutine, while taking into account the specifics of the field, such as\nprobability density function (PDF) features, moving grid, zero boundary\nconditions, etc. The spectral methods, in general, achieve very fast\nconvergence rate of O(c^N )(O < c < 1) for analytical functions such as the\nprobability density function, where N is the number of grid points. This is\nsignificantly better than the standard finite difference method (or midpoint\nrule used in discrete estimation) typically used in grid-based filter design\nwith convergence rate O( 1 / N^2 ). As consequence, the proposed spectral\nmethod based filter provides better state estimation accuracy with lower number\nof grid points, and thus, with lower computational complexity.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"REQrUz8DfKIeRfxfOF7wCbhPO0_wXH42cCmD4-dDJ5U","pdfSize":"3663523"}
