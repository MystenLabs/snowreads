The stage is being\ndeveloped for use in the Magellan InfraRed Multi-Object Spectrograph, MIRMOS.\nMIRMOS is a very large Nasmyth mounted spectrograph containing a combination of\nrefractive, reflective and diffractive optics mounted on a long cryogenic\noptical bench. The instrument utilizes five science cameras, each having a\ncustom x-y stage to control the in-plane detector position within each camera,\nproviding both dithering capability for improved sampling, and flexure\ncompensation to correct for image motion that results from the gravity variant\noperation of the instrument. Designed to operate at 120~K, the stage will\naccurately control detector position in two orthogonal degrees of freedom, and\nhave manual fine adjustment features to set detector tip, tilt and piston. The\npiezo-driven flexure stage provides high-resolution backlash-free motion of the\ndetector and is very compact along the optical path, keeping camera length to a\nminimum. A magnetoresistive bridge provides position feedback in each degree of\nfreedom, greatly reducing hysteresis, which is common in piezoelectric\nactuators. The system is designed to operate in open loop using a lookup table\nkeyed to the Nasmyth rotator angle for flexure control. Here, the\noptomechanical design of the stage, electrical control system, and current\nperformance results from early prototype efforts are presented and discussed.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"c3wKuioOSBNWi2550l3lL4JEKV0LwnQdYTOQO3Yia18","pdfSize":"2403677","objectId":"0x7ab3a846ce1f13c8c4a3dc1150937e75ac7f52e9a77360a9af94e94b6b47d62d","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
