The\ndilogarithm has a long and rich history since Euler. The most intriguing\nproperty of the function is that it satisfies various functional relations,\nwhich we call dilogarithm identities (DIs). In the 1990s Gliozzi and Tateo\nconjectured a family of DIs based on root systems, which vastly generalize the\nclassic DIs such as Euler's and Abel's identities. On the other hand, the\ncluster algebras are a class of commutative algebras introduced by Fomin and\nZelevinsky around 2000. It turned out that a DI is associated with each period\nin a cluster pattern of cluster algebra theory. In particular, they solve the\nconjecture on the DIs by Gliozzi and Tateo. We employ these DIs as the\nleitmotif and present several proofs, variations, and generalizations of them\nwith various methods and techniques. The quantum DIs are also treated from the\nunified point of view with the classical ones.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TyjTt3GOP8nAwm3dbrwzUkmyyABtU6ahP_S4Jw-0JTM","pdfSize":"1972636"}
