My analysis shows that while both are\npossible, the latter is a more attracting equilibrium under an adaptive\nlearning perspective. I frame the gender identity problem as a modified\n\\textit{battle of the sexes} game, where individuals define their gender\nidentity under pairwise matching motives. From a baseline game-theoretical\nstandpoint, I demonstrate that the binary-only world and the nonbinary-only\nworld are both Nash equilibria in the stage game and are locally stable in the\ninfinitely repeated game. Thus, any state of gender identity could\ntheoretically persist. I then adopt a genetic learning algorithm as an\nequilibrium selection criterion to investigate evolutionary dynamics further\nand provide a rationale for the transition from binary to nonbinary gender\nidentity. Specifically, in a binary-origin world, divergence occurs as\nindividuals identifying as nonbinary gender evolve to become the majority due\nto their higher flexibility in matching outcomes. My framework captures how\nadaptive learning drives identity evolution, offering a parsimonious tool to\nanalyze how diversity and exclusivity emerge in varying economic environments.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"A6oV5GT2F44sVQU2JHiaUmwVUspye6ae3BJjFDse6qk","pdfSize":"601071"}
