Piecewise\nlinear differential systems separated by one or two parallel straight lines\nwith one of the subsystems of type nilpotent center and other subsystems of\ntype linear saddle can have at most two limit cycles and there are systems in\nthese classes having one limit cycle. The limit cycle in particular consists of\nsaddle separatrices of the subsystem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PZCQylhIdTnUFwYh3QfKqLk16yTYvl-22YHuphZMTPA","pdfSize":"1111392"}
