Weakly\nInteracting Massive Particles (WIMPs), which could explain the nature of dark\nmatter, can be captured by celestial bodies like the Sun or Earth, leading to\nenhanced self-annihilation into Standard Model particles including neutrinos\ndetectable by neutrino telescopes such as the IceCube Neutrino Observatory.\nThis article presents a search for muon neutrinos from the center of the Earth\nperformed with 10 years of IceCube data using a track-like event selection. We\nconsidered a number of WIMP annihilation channels\n($\\chi\\chi\\rightarrow\\tau^+\\tau^-$/$W^+W^-$/$b\\bar{b}$) and masses ranging from\n10 GeV to 10 TeV. No significant excess over background due to a dark matter\nsignal was found while the most significant result corresponds to the\nannihilation channel $\\chi\\chi\\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ for the mass\n$m_{\\chi}=250$~GeV with a post-trial significance of $1.06\\sigma$. Our results\nare competitive with previous such searches and direct detection experiments.\nOur upper limits on the spin-independent WIMP scattering are world-leading\namong neutrino telescopes for WIMP masses $m_{\\chi}>100$~GeV.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bqoM-5CvFeikLZlKJN0u2veKOjMTnSAwBQtqjHoKZr8","pdfSize":"2157817"}
