Firstly,\nit establishes new and explicit hypergeometric expressions for type I Hahn\nmultiple orthogonal polynomials. Secondly, applying the residue theorem and the\nMellin transform, the paper derives contour integral representations for\nseveral families of orthogonal polynomials. Specifically, it presents contour\nintegral formulas for both type I and type II multiple orthogonal polynomials\nin the Laguerre of the first kind, Jacobi-Pi\\~neiro, and Hahn families. The\nevaluation of these integrals leads to explicit hypergeometric representations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZKIO93OHVKm1SNPN0Tves3gFzMKZ48pxrgKIurAG5vQ","pdfSize":"364286"}
