  "abstract": "  The power of symbolic computation, as opposed to mere numerical computation,\nis illustrated with efficient algorithms for studying the generalized gambler's\nruin problem in one and two dimensions. We also consider a new generalization\nof the classical gambler's ruin where we add a third step which we call the\nmirror step. In this scenario, we provide closed formulas for the probability\nand expected duration.\n",
