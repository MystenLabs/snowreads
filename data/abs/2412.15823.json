The model has been benchmarked against the former MHD model\nused in MIPS code. A preliminary study of the core density collapse event (CDC)\nobserved in the Large Helical Device (LHD) plasma has been performed using the\nnew model. The equilibrium has been constructed using HINT code for axis\nbeta=4% plasma with a steep pressure gradient, which makes the plasma\npotentially unstable in the LHD. The model can show preliminary characteristics\nof the CDC event. The work is extended to analyze the effect of an external\nheating source on the CDC event. An external heat source centered at the core\nof the plasma triggers the CDC event earlier than the time of spontaneous CDC,\ncaused by the increase in pressure gradient steepness. The amplitude and\ngeometry of the heat source have been observed to have an effect on the MHD\nstability.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pphyESRUI5IRlZ08XgU98FXxq3Bqgr7_A6krzJnWhJI","pdfSize":"8004991"}
