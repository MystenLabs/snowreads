Combining this new method with our previously proposed\nimaging method, PRIISM, the whole process of the self-calibration of radio\ninterferometry is redefined as a single optimization problem with\nregularization. As a result, the gains are corrected, and an image is\nestimated. We tested the new approach with ALMA observation data and found it\nprovides promising results.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HQn3Gxs-jmuBoI-xjq3kySpl33M_l8KKHh-hNpt-X84","pdfSize":"8020674"}
