  "abstract": "  This paper presents ERPA, an innovative Robotic Process Automation (RPA)\nmodel designed to enhance ID data extraction and optimize Optical Character\nRecognition (OCR) tasks within immigration workflows. Traditional RPA solutions\noften face performance limitations when processing large volumes of documents,\nleading to inefficiencies. ERPA addresses these challenges by incorporating\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) to improve the accuracy and clarity of extracted\ntext, effectively handling ambiguous characters and complex structures.\nBenchmark comparisons with leading platforms like UiPath and Automation\nAnywhere demonstrate that ERPA significantly reduces processing times by up to\n94 percent, completing ID data extraction in just 9.94 seconds. These findings\nhighlight ERPA's potential to revolutionize document automation, offering a\nfaster and more reliable alternative to current RPA solutions.\n",
