Flattenicity is a novel event shape observable\nthat is measured in the pseudorapidity intervals covered by the V0 detector,\n$2.8<\\eta<5.1$ and $-3.7<\\eta<-1.7$. According to QCD-inspired phenomenological\nmodels, it shows sensitivity to multiparton interactions and is less affected\nby biases towards larger $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ due to local multiplicity\nfluctuations in the V0 acceptance than multiplicity. The analysis is performed\nin minimum-bias (MB) as well as in high-multiplicity events up to\n$p_{\\mathrm{T}}=20$ GeV/$c$. The event selection requires at least one charged\nparticle produced in the pseudorapidity interval $|\\eta|<1$. The measured\n$p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ distributions, average $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$, kaon-to-pion and\nproton-to-pion particle ratios, presented in this paper, are compared to model\ncalculations using PYTHIA 8 based on color strings and EPOS LHC. The\nmodification of the $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$-spectral shapes in low-flattenicity events\nthat have large event activity with respect to those measured in MB events\ndevelops a pronounced peak at intermediate $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$\n($2<p_{\\mathrm{T}}<8$ GeV/$c$), and approaches the vicinity of unity at higher\n$p_{\\mathrm{T}}$. The results are qualitatively described by PYTHIA, and they\nshow different behavior than those measured as a function of charged-particle\nmultiplicity based on the V0M estimator.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Bi1V8AUWtg3xaWjfQO8ZHt6CSMR3k-BgJPQdnPRM4m0","pdfSize":"1403802","objectId":"0xd3a4d20201600eadc69fd9827b253f83b780f50ae0d2bfa5555aa8abc4e06bbc","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
