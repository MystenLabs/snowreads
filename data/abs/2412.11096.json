  "abstract": "  A puzzling phenomenon, where the measured mass of the $\\psi(4160)$ is pushed\nhigher, presents a challenge to current theoretical models of hadron\nspectroscopy. This study suggests that the issue arises from analyses based on\nthe outdated quenched charmonium spectrum. In the past two decades, the\ndiscovery of new hadronic states has emphasized the importance of the\nunquenched effect. Under the unquenched picture, six vector charmonium\nstates-$\\psi(4040)$, $\\psi(4160)$, $\\psi(4220)$, $\\psi(4380)$, $\\psi(4415)$,\nand $\\psi(4500)$-are identified in the $4 \\sim 4.5$ GeV range, contrasting with\nthe three states predicted in the quenched model. We reevaluate the resonance\nparameters of the $\\psi(4160)$ using the di-muon invariant mass spectrum of\n$B^+ \\to K^+ \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ and unquenched charmonium spectroscopy. Our analysis\nfinds the $\\psi(4160)$ mass at $4145.76 \\pm 4.48$ MeV, indicating previous\noverestimations. This conclusion is supported by analyzing $e^+e^- \\to D_s\n\\bar{D}_s^*$. Our findings have significant implications for both hadron\nspectroscopy and search for new physics signals by $R_K$.\n",
