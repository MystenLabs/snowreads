In particular, we generate a suite of $1000$\naccurate effective field-level bias-based Ly$\\alpha$ forest simulations of\nvolume $V=(1 \\, h^{-1} \\, {\\rm Gpc})^3$ at $z=2$, both in real and redshift\nspace, calibrated upon two fixed-and-paired cosmological hydrodynamic\nsimulations. To measure the BAO, we stack the three-dimensional power spectra\nof the $1000$ different realizations, compute the average, and use a model\naccounting for a proper smooth-peak component decomposition of the power\nspectrum, to fit it via an efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo scheme estimating\nthe covariance matrices directly from the simulations. We report the BAO shift\nparameters to be $\\alpha=0.9969^{+0.0014}_{-0.0014}$ and\n$\\alpha=0.9905^{+0.0027}_{-0.0027}$ in real and redshift space, respectively.\nWe also measure the bias $b_{\\rm lya}$ and the BAO broadening parameter\n$\\Sigma_{\\rm nl}$, finding $b_{\\rm lya}=-0.1786^{+0.0001}_{-0.0001}$ and\n$\\Sigma_{\\rm nl}=3.87^{+0.20}_{-0.20}$ in real space, and $b_{\\rm\nlya}=-0.073^{+0.005}_{-0.004}$ and $\\Sigma_{\\rm nl}=6.55^{+0.23}_{-0.22}$ in\nredshift space. Moreover, we measure the linear Kaiser factor $\\beta_{\\rm\nlya}=1.39^{+0.24}_{-0.18}$ from the isotropic redshift space fit. Overall, we\nfind evidence for a negative shift of the BAO peak at the $\\sim 2.2\\sigma$ and\n$\\sim 3.5\\sigma$ level in real and redshift space, respectively. This work sets\nnew important theoretical constraints on the Ly$\\alpha$ forest BAO scale and\noffers a potential solution to the tension emerging from previous observational\nanalysis, in light of ongoing and upcoming Ly$\\alpha$ forest spectroscopic\nsurveys, such as DESI, PFS, and WEAVE-QSO.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2ypCKsUhvq8gIQ87ZFQkdAAzXzzaRyqdEdKjWgT0bOs","pdfSize":"729153"}
