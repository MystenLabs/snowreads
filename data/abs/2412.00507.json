  "abstract": "  The domain decomposition (DD) nonlinear-manifold reduced-order model (NM-ROM)\nrepresents a computationally efficient method for integrating underlying\nphysics principles into a neural network-based, data-driven approach. Compared\nto linear subspace methods, NM-ROMs offer superior expressivity and enhanced\nreconstruction capabilities, while DD enables cost-effective, parallel training\nof autoencoders by partitioning the domain into algebraic subdomains. In this\nwork, we investigate the scalability of this approach by implementing a\n\"bottom-up\" strategy: training NM-ROMs on smaller domains and subsequently\ndeploying them on larger, composable ones. The application of this method to\nthe two-dimensional time-dependent Burgers' equation shows that extrapolating\nfrom smaller to larger domains is both stable and effective. This approach\nachieves an accuracy of 1% in relative error and provides a remarkable speedup\nof nearly 700 times.\n",
