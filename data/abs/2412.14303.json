  "abstract": "  Top quark pair production in association with a W boson is a rare standard\nmodel process that has proven to be an intriguing puzzle for theorists and\nexperimentalists alike. Recent measurements, performed at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV,\nby both the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at the CERN LHC, find cross section\nvalues that are consistently higher than the latest state-of-the-art theory\npredictions. In this presentation, both experimental and theoretical challenges\nin the pursuit of a better understanding of this process are discussed.\nFurthermore, a framework for a future differential measurement to be performed\nwith the Run 2 CMS data (collected in 2016-2018) is proposed.\n",
