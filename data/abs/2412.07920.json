  "abstract": "  We prove an $L^p$-spectral multiplier theorem under the sharp regularity\ncondition $s > d\\left|1/p - 1/2\\right|$ for sub-Laplacians on M\\'etivier\ngroups. The proof is based on a restriction type estimate which, at first\nsight, seems to be suboptimal for proving sharp spectral multiplier results,\nbut turns out to be surprisingly effective. This is achieved by exploiting the\nstructural property that for any M\\'etivier group the first layer of any\nstratification of its Lie algebra is typically much larger than the second\nlayer, a phenomenon closely related to Radon-Hurwitz numbers.\n",
