Yet, while biological\nsystems are composed of thousands of interacting components, recent\nhigh-throughput experiments show that their response to perturbations is\nsurprisingly low-dimensional: confined to only a few stereotyped changes out of\nthe many possible. Here, we explore a unifying dynamical systems framework -\nsoft modes - to explain and analyze low-dimensionality in biology, from\nmolecules to eco-systems. We argue that this one framework of soft modes makes\nnon-trivial predictions that generalize classic ideas from developmental\nbiology to disparate systems, namely: phenocopying, dual buffering, and global\nepistasis. While some of these predictions have been borne out in experiments,\nwe discuss how soft modes allow for a surprisingly far-reaching and unifying\nframework in which to analyze data from protein biophysics to microbial\necology.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yy6NaR6wicDEA7rc5w42ECIi-XtG3oOqcgBsllITLd4","pdfSize":"17465403"}
