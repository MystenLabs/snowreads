Our method generates pseudo labels by\ntranslating between labeled and unlabeled domains without requiring prior\nannotation in the target domain. We evaluate two pseudo labeling strategies\nacross three image domains increasingly dissimilar from the labeled data,\ndemonstrating their effectiveness. Notably, our method achieves a mean Dice\nscore of $0.736 \\pm 0.005$ on a SEM dataset using the tutoring path, which\ninvolves training a segmentation model on synthetic data created by translating\nthe labeled dataset (TEM) to the target modality (SEM). This approach aims to\naccelerate the annotation process by providing high-quality pseudo labels as a\nstarting point for manual refinement.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nUqrDCP10YYFj65sLeV0sWkYlWSwzSGevuJse8X0eaM","pdfSize":"15953784"}
