Traditional computational approaches often\nstruggle with the voluminous datasets generated by real-time sensor networks,\nand they generally lack the precision needed for accurate traffic prediction\nand efficient system optimization. This research integrates quantum computing\ntechniques to enhance Vehicle Road Cooperation Systems (VRCS). By leveraging\nquantum algorithms, specifically $UU^{\\dagger}$ and variational $UU^{\\dagger}$,\nin conjunction with quantum image encoding methods such as Flexible\nRepresentation of Quantum Images (FRQI) and Novel Enhanced Quantum\nRepresentation (NEQR), we propose an optimized Quantum Neural Network (QNN).\nThis QNN features adjustments in its entangled layer structure and training\nduration to better handle the complexities of traffic data processing.\nEmpirical evaluations on two traffic datasets show that our model achieves\nsuperior classification accuracies of 97.42% and 84.08% and demonstrates\nremarkable robustness in various noise conditions. This study underscores the\npotential of quantum-enhanced 6G solutions in streamlining complex\ntransportation systems, highlighting the pivotal role of quantum technologies\nin advancing intelligent transportation solutions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"r4keTVrqGoiNWBKlfi6EADhHjwZAmnTOQpbLJyuWS9g","pdfSize":"1365754"}
