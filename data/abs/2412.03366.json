These fields,\nintroduced in the companion paper \\cite{ELLV}, generalize the well-known\nfractional Brownian sheet (FBs) by relaxing its tensor-product structure,\nresulting in new self-similar Gaussian fields with stationary rectangular\nincrements that differ from the FBs. We analyze the local regularity properties\nof these fields and introduce a new concept of regularity through the\ndefinition of Weighted Tensorized Besov Spaces. These spaces combine aspects of\nmixed dominating smoothness spaces and hyperbolic Besov spaces, which are\nsimilar in structure to classical Besov spaces. We provide a detailed\ncharacterization of these spaces using Littlewood-Paley theory and hyperbolic\nwavelet analysis.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"P5cx-fbekekAqz716T8LunusmNbO565K0JaF4Y4bG7A","pdfSize":"348556"}
