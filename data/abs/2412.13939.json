To be more specific, the adoption of\ndigital twins in the manufacturing industry relies on integrating technologies\nlike cyber-physical systems, the Industrial Internet of Things, virtualization,\nand advanced manufacturing. The interactions of these technologies give rise to\nnumerous security and privacy vulnerabilities that remain inadequately\nexplored. Towards that end, this paper analyzes the cybersecurity threats of\ndigital twins for advanced manufacturing in the context of data collection,\ndata sharing, machine learning and deep learning, and system-level security and\nprivacy. We also provide several solutions to the threats in those four\ncategories that can help establish more trust in digital twins.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computer Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jCuZEstjOikjYs-yP5BKVDdOjwK64Gqz8oGhyEuSFKQ","pdfSize":"6228749"}
