The links we detect arise via different\nclosure operations on $3$-braids. Examples of our results include that link\nFloer homology detects the Mazur link, that annular Khovanov homology detects\nthe Mazur pattern, and that Khovanov homology detects L6a2 and L9n15. The Mazur\npattern detection result depends on a new bound on the rank of the annular\nKhovanov homology of certain links.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-mmYBiTnJpp4E0JEzXOq9gLFerCTTxSkGPuDdZiKVto","pdfSize":"1320167"}
