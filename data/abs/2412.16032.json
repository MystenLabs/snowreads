  "abstract": "  We present a Python-based framework for event-log prediction in streaming\nmode, enabling predictions while data is being generated by a business process.\nThe framework allows for easy integration of streaming algorithms, including\nlanguage models like n-grams and LSTMs, and for combining these predictors\nusing ensemble methods.\n  Using our framework, we conducted experiments on various well-known\nprocess-mining data sets and compared classical batch with streaming mode.\nThough, in batch mode, LSTMs generally achieve the best performance, there is\noften an n-gram whose accuracy comes very close. Combining basic models in\nensemble methods can even outperform LSTMs. The value of basic models with\nrespect to LSTMs becomes even more apparent in streaming mode, where LSTMs\ngenerally lack accuracy in the early stages of a prediction run, while basic\nmethods make sensible predictions immediately.\n",
