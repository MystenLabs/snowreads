  "abstract": "  The discovery of bilayer nickelate superconductors under high pressure has\nopened a new chapter in high-transition temperature (high-TC)\nsuperconductivity. Here, we report ambient-pressure superconductivity onset\nabove the McMillan limit (40 K) in bilayer nickelate epitaxial ultrathin films.\nThree-unit-cell (3UC) thick La2.85Pr0.15Ni2O7 single-phase-crystalline films\nare grown using the gigantic-oxidative atomic-layer-by-layer epitaxy\n(GOALL-Epitaxy) on SrLaAlO4 substrates. Resistivity measurements and\nmagnetic-field responses indicate onset TC = 45 K. The transition to zero\nresistance exhibits characteristics consistent with a\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)-like behavior, with TBKT = 9 K. Meissner\ndiamagnetic effect is observed at TM = 8.5 K via a mutual inductance setup, in\nagreement with the BKT-like transition. In-plane and out-of-plane critical\nmagnetic fields exhibit anisotropy. Scanning transmission electron microscopy\n(STEM) images and X-ray reciprocal space mappings (RSMs) show that the films\nmaintain a tetragonal phase with coherent epitaxial compressive strain ~2% in\nthe NiO2 planes relative to the bulk. Our findings pave the way for\ncomprehensive investigations of nickelate superconductors under ambient\npressure conditions and for exploring superconductivity at higher transition\ntemperature through strain engineering in heterostructures.\n",
