  "abstract": "  Our aim for the ML Contest for Chip Design with HLS 2024 was to predict the\nvalidity, running latency in the form of cycle counts, utilization rate of BRAM\n(util-BRAM), utilization rate of lookup tables (uti-LUT), utilization rate of\nflip flops (util-FF), and the utilization rate of digital signal processors\n(util-DSP). We used Chain-of-thought techniques with large language models to\nperform classification and regression tasks. Our prediction is that with larger\nmodels reasoning was much improved. We release our prompts and propose a HLS\nbenchmarking task for LLMs.\n",
