Through a formal integration of\nthe governing equations within the inclusions, we establish that the resulting\ninterface conditions are of Wentzell type for the flux jump and Robin type for\nthe flux average. Notably, the flux jump condition is unconventional, involving\na tangential diffusion operator applied to the average of the solution across\nthe interface.\n  The corresponding weak formulation is introduced, offering a framework that\nis readily applicable to finite element discretizations. Extensive numerical\nvalidation highlights the robustness and versatility of the proposed modeling\ntechnique. The results demonstrate its effectiveness in accommodating a wide\nrange of material properties, managing networks of inclusions, and naturally\nhandling fractures with varying apertures -- all without requiring an explicit\ngeometric representation of the fractures.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bw10ZaexpTDUx0Ti2Kz-6bHLEeE8ThAMullw893HnN0","pdfSize":"1094173"}
