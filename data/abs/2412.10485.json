Although notoriously hard to tackle, these properties are crucially\nrelated to the excluded-volume effect and other central features of real\npolymers. Our main purpose will be to study ideal chains (Random Walks) on\nlattice where the ratio between the number of self-intersections and the total\nlength is fixed to some number.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1NF_E72RaNuo4JtNQILFAFTbV7cJwTfwwLn-MANZUPc","pdfSize":"2322551"}
