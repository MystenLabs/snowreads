But due to high intra- and inter-class variability of nuclei\nmorphological and chromatic features, as well as H&E-stains susceptibility to\nartefacts, state-of-the-art algorithms cannot correctly detect and classify\ninstances with the necessary performance. In this work, we hypothesise context\nand attention inductive biases in artificial neural networks (ANNs) could\nincrease the generalization of algorithms for cell nuclei instance segmentation\nand classification. We conduct a thorough survey on context and attention\nmethods for cell nuclei instance segmentation and classification from\nH&E-stained microscopy imaging, while providing a comprehensive discussion of\nthe challenges being tackled with context and attention. Besides, we illustrate\nsome limitations of current approaches and present ideas for future research.\nAs a case study, we extend both a general instance segmentation and\nclassification method (Mask-RCNN) and a tailored cell nuclei instance\nsegmentation and classification model (HoVer-Net) with context- and\nattention-based mechanisms, and do a comparative analysis on a multi-centre\ncolon nuclei identification and counting dataset. Although pathologists rely on\ncontext at multiple levels while paying attention to specific Regions of\nInterest (RoIs) when analysing and annotating WSIs, our findings suggest\ntranslating that domain knowledge into algorithm design is no trivial task, but\nto fully exploit these mechanisms, the scientific understanding of these\nmethods should be addressed.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"54HvZgcHInUeX_gqeWF2UTu6Vg-vgoqIdYGEXNe1Zmw","pdfSize":"3294838"}
