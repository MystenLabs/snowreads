In doing so, we consider both\n$\\Delta_{2}\\cap\\nabla_{2}$-Orlicz growth scenarios and, as a limiting case, $L\n\\log L$-growth. Inspired by Conti & Gmeineder (J Calc Var, 61:215, 2022), the\nproofs of our main results are accomplished by reduction to the case of full\ngradient partial regularity results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1gp1KgD_4xjXs33qkFjFWSXdsXPLAqnCj3vSNZF-_X8","pdfSize":"367260"}
