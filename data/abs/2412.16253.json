  "abstract": "  Generating high-quality 3D digital assets often requires expert knowledge of\ncomplex design tools. We introduce Specialized Generative Primitives, a\ngenerative framework that allows non-expert users to author high-quality 3D\nscenes in a seamless, lightweight, and controllable manner. Each primitive is\nan efficient generative model that captures the distribution of a single\nexemplar from the real world. With our framework, users capture a video of an\nenvironment, which we turn into a high-quality and explicit appearance model\nthanks to 3D Gaussian Splatting. Users then select regions of interest guided\nby semantically-aware features. To create a generative primitive, we adapt\nGenerative Cellular Automata to single-exemplar training and controllable\ngeneration. We decouple the generative task from the appearance model by\noperating on sparse voxels and we recover a high-quality output with a\nsubsequent sparse patch consistency step. Each primitive can be trained within\n10 minutes and used to author new scenes interactively in a fully compositional\nmanner. We showcase interactive sessions where various primitives are extracted\nfrom real-world scenes and controlled to create 3D assets and scenes in a few\nminutes. We also demonstrate additional capabilities of our primitives:\nhandling various 3D representations to control generation, transferring\nappearances, and editing geometries.\n",
