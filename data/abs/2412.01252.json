The discovery of moir\\'e physics in twisted\nheterostructures has further unlocked new possibilities for controlling the\nband structure of tailored semiconductor heterostructures. In parallel, the\nintegration of 2D materials with hybrid photonic structures and ultrafast\nstudies on their optical and spin-valley properties has revealed a wealth of\nnovel physical phenomena. This perspective highlights the recent advances in\nour understanding of light-matter interactions in moir\\'e and 2D systems, with\na particular emphasis on ultrafast processes and the integration of these\nmaterials into photonic platforms. We explore the implications for\noptoelectronics and emerging photonic technologies, positioning 2D materials as\na transformative tool for next-generation devices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TUZWIvNkiEhPYNA8s-6hBe4BJp8qBWLIflILaY0mVeQ","pdfSize":"1084100"}
