The proof is based\non the Agrachev-Sarychev approach in geometric control theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AsyHiFgM3BHuacvwB3F4x-Gsvol-nphaHeTkkuB15Qo","pdfSize":"322807"}
