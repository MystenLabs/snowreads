  "abstract": "  Simultaneous catalytic hydrogen (H2) production and plastic waste degradation\nunder light, known as photoreforming, is a novel approach to green fuel\nproduction and efficient waste management. Here, we use a high-entropy oxide\n(HEO), a new family of catalysts with five or more principal cations in their\nstructure, for plastic degradation and simultaneous H2 production. The HEO\nshows higher activity than that of P25 TiO2, a benchmark photocatalyst, for the\ndegradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics in water. Several\nvaluable products are produced by photoreforming of PET bottles and\nmicroplastics including H2, terephthalate, ethylene glycol and formic acid. The\nhigh activity is attributed to the diverse existence of several cations in the\nHEO lattice, lattice defects, and appropriate charge carrier lifetime. These\nfindings suggest that HEOs possess high potential as new catalysts for\nconcurrent plastic waste conversion and clean H2 production.\n",
