Although the exact quantum system,\nenvironment, and coupling, are not known the nature of the experiments shows a\nmeasurement influenced next measurement. The quantum system senses the\nmeasurement outcome and prepares itself in a state other than the state related\nto the measurement outcome. This triggers an alternation of measurements which\nare indicative of two current carrying states. In case three or more current\ncarrying states are observed, there exists a fixed sequence of states that\ncarry the current. We conclude that memory effects in these systems are\nresponsible for these experimental observations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"DQh420tKcbVdOl5bacVlbKrln4qUwmngEIC6Qd3qoE4","pdfSize":"6075073"}
