  "abstract": "  We prove the existence of small-amplitude periodic traveling waves in dimer\nFermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) lattices without assumptions of physical\nsymmetry. Such lattices are infinite, one-dimensional chains of coupled\nparticles in which the particle masses and/or the potentials of the coupling\nsprings can alternate. Previously, periodic traveling waves were constructed in\na variety of limiting regimes for the symmetric mass and spring dimers, in\nwhich only one kind of material data alternates. The new results discussed here\nremove the symmetry assumptions by exploiting the gradient structure and\ntranslation invariance of the traveling wave problem. Together, these features\neliminate certain solvability conditions that symmetry would otherwise manage\nand facilitate a bifurcation argument involving a two-dimensional kernel.\n",
