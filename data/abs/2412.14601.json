Specifically, we\nconsider a ring homomorphism from the Grothendieck ring of this representation\ncategory to the Verlinde ring and conjecture that every object in the category\nhas a positive image under this map.\n  We prove this conjecture in certain cases where the underlying simple Lie\nalgebra is simply-laced with level 2 or of type $A_1$ at an arbitrary level.\nThe proof employs the close connection between this category and cluster\nalgebras of finite cluster type. As further evidence for the conjecture, we\nshow that for any level, all objects have positive quantum dimensions under the\nassumption that some Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules have positive quantum\ndimensions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AVCmFHjT0Al_9q2EM6cgOC9nHJF6Norwoa-yCT0PO3k","pdfSize":"765616"}
