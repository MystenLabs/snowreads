In this article, we study the renormalized\nversion of the Nelson model with massless bosons in Davies' weak coupling\nlimit. Our main result states that the two-body Coulomb potential emerges as an\neffective pair interaction between the particles, which arises from the\nexchange of virtual excitations of the quantum field.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Qd8W7ATehrAbFP3kJvaE1sY4NQarc_yY2MzrDzFhNJo","pdfSize":"323963"}
