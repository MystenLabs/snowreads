In this paper we realize these representations as isometry\ngroups of patterns of geodesics in the symmetric space $X=SL_3(\\R)/SO(3)$. The\npatterns have the same asymptotic structure as the geodesics in the Farey\ntriangulation, so our construction gives a $2$ parameter family of deformations\nof the Farey triangulation inside $X$. We also describe a bending phenomenon\nassociated to these patterns.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iqJHBXjV-MmoAKDkgoN4Q1P-wPP6gJrzruyepKyuogk","pdfSize":"1118345"}
