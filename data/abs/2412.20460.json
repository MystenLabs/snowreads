In the literature, the breathing\nkagome lattice with nearest-neighbor hopping is often mentioned as an example\nof a two-dimensional second-order topological insulator. Here we show by\nexplicit construction that the corner states of the breathing kagome lattice\ncan be removed by a continuous change of the hopping parameters, without\nbreaking any of the model's symmetries, without closing bulk and boundary gaps,\nand without introducing hopping terms not present in the original model.\nFurthermore, we topologically classify all three-band lattice models with the\nsame crystalline symmetries as the breathing kagome lattice and show that\nthough none of the phases have protected zero-energy corner states, some of the\nphases are obstructed atomic limits which exhibit a filling anomaly.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EmQdFhwzkh3-aqP_KLwc0cpeQWeHKzwd4knzydbkrmw","pdfSize":"1076807"}
