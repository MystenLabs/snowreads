Procedures are usually described by means\nof natural language texts, such as recipes or maintenance manuals, possibly\nspread across different documents and systems, and their interpretation and\nsubsequent execution is often left to the reader. Representing such procedures\nin a Knowledge Graph (KG) can be the basis to build digital tools to support\nthose users who need to apply or execute them. In this paper, we leverage Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) capabilities and propose a prompt engineering approach to\nextract steps, actions, objects, equipment and temporal information from a\ntextual procedure, in order to populate a Procedural KG according to a\npre-defined ontology. We evaluate the KG extraction results by means of a user\nstudy, in order to qualitatively and quantitatively assess the perceived\nquality and usefulness of the LLM-extracted procedural knowledge. We show that\nLLMs can produce outputs of acceptable quality and we assess the subjective\nperception of AI by human evaluators.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QBgkXzMTSIKRk2fmJ7oAzs7EdiIvQT12ODY9QgD6Ucc","pdfSize":"589291"}
