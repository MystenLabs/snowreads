Our system,\nDenseQuest, provides unsupervised selection and ranking capabilities to predict\nthe best dense retriever among a pool of available dense retrievers, tailored\nto an uploaded target collection. DenseQuest implements a number of existing\napproaches, including a recent, highly effective method powered by Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), which requires neither queries nor relevance judgments.\nThe system is designed to be intuitive and easy to use for those information\nretrieval engineers and researchers who need to identify a general-purpose\ndense retrieval model to encode or search a new private target collection. Our\ndemonstration illustrates conceptual architecture and the different use case\nscenarios of the system implemented on the cloud, enabling universal access and\nuse. DenseQuest is available at https://densequest.ielab.io.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"NOy2NGymhySAdDoFYuG-vvGVnggkdYSaoNHXu3rh6Yc","pdfSize":"1518748"}
