In certain\ncases, the non-Abelian Gauss Law constraint can be exactly solved, and the\ngauge invariant subspace embedded onto local spin Hamiltonians for efficient\nquantum simulation. In $(1+1)d$ previous studies of the $SO(3)$ QLM coupled to\nadjoint fermionic matter have been shown to reflect key properties of QCD and\nnuclear physics, including distinct confining/deconfining phases and hadronic\nbound states. We extend the model to $(2+1)d$ dimensions for the first time,\nand report on our initial results. We review the construction of\ngauge-invariant state space for the proposed models, and study the\nsingle-plaquette ground state via exact-diagonalisation. We provide indications\nof a rich phase diagram which shows both spontaneous and explicit chiral\nsymmetry breaking, confinement, and distinct magnetic phases characterised by\ndifferent plaquette expectation values.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Z5oKTL3vsSkiicZ8fbM_eQsyu6_nY_dpYjinokRng5Y","pdfSize":"1131445"}
