We\nprove a direct sum decomposition of the Crouzeix-Raviart space into (a subspace\nof) the conforming companion space and the span of the non-conforming basis\nfunctions.\n  Degrees of freedom are introduced which are bidual to the basis functions and\ngive rise to the definition of a local approximation/interpolation operator. In\ntwo dimensions or for $k=1$, these freedoms can be split into simplex and\n$\\left( d-1\\right) $ dimensional facet integrals in such a way that, in a basis\nrepresentation of Crouzeix-Raviart functions, all coefficients which belong to\nbasis functions related to lower-dimensional faces in the mesh are determined\nby these facet integrals. It will also be shown that such a set of degrees of\nfreedom does \\textbf{not} exist in higher space dimension and $k>1$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"cC5chvGUvBQNC7OWDmD4hZyThZ2npW69OPgxwESqiaQ","pdfSize":"391017"}
