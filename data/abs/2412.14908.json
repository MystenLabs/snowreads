As a key result, we provide a complete\ncharacterization of quadratic maps through a universal construction that can be\ncomputed explicitly. Applications include the classification of quadratic maps\non finite abelian groups, proving the non-existence of polynomial maps of\nhigher degree on perfect groups, establishing stability results for polynomial\nmaps, and presenting a general inverse theorem for the Gowers norm with\nnon-abelian coefficients on perfect groups with bounded commutator width.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FChrP1c4RPGg1yAl-WPN6t---lufHLpBoUR6kLOneLQ","pdfSize":"235657"}
