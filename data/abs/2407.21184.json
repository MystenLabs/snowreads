These DNNs require\nsignificant compute and memory resources for training and inference.\nTraditional computing platforms such as CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs are struggling to\nkeep up with the demands of the increasingly complex and diverse DNNs. Optical\ncomputing represents an exciting new paradigm for light-speed acceleration of\nDNN workloads. In this article, we discuss the fundamentals and\nstate-of-the-art developments in optical computing, with an emphasis on DNN\nacceleration. Various promising approaches are described for engineering\noptical devices, enhancing optical circuits, and designing architectures that\ncan adapt optical computing to a variety of DNN workloads. Novel techniques for\nhardware/software co-design that can intelligently tune and map DNN models to\nimprove performance and energy-efficiency on optical computing platforms across\nhigh performance and resource constrained embedded, edge, and IoT platforms are\nalso discussed. Lastly, several open problems and future directions for\nresearch in this domain are highlighted.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"HoqXqca9_nsqdFbUuNRaKUMZMVREWLkPp4vpc8jrriA","pdfSize":"4117902"}
