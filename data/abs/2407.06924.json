The components of the check algorithm\nare: function call extraction out of the program text, call graph completion\nand finding a lexical order for the function parameters.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xRB5QOWJ2oQPuGuosMwWpnM-b7QPCMVwZGA6unk534c","pdfSize":"224706"}
