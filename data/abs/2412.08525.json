However, limited transport in dissipative open quantum\nsystems is rare due to the lack of many conservation laws. In particular,\nthermal and spin transport in interacting systems under particle dissipation\nare largely unexplored. Here we observe dissipation-induced but limited thermal\nand spin transport through a dissipative one-dimensional junction connecting\ntwo superfluids of unitary Fermi gases. The thermal and spin conductances of\nthe superfluid junction increase sharply with particle dissipation and\nseemingly approach values for a non-dissipative, non-interacting system --\nlimited due to quantum confinement of the junction. This behavior is\nindependent of the dissipation mechanism, being either spin-dependent or\npairwise losses. This work may inform theories on interacting open quantum\nsystems and opens up perspectives for dissipative control of spin and\nthermoelectric transport.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"OpO7b_J0fcwuPg8OL3T-rR9P5TnsAQ1pbdcZA4wGQ-E","pdfSize":"2485576"}
