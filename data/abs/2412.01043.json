In this paper, we\ninvestigate quantum steering for four different types of Bell-like states of\nfermionic modes near the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole. In some\nparameter spaces, the peak of steering asymmetry corresponds to a transition\nfrom two-way to one-way steerability for Bell-like states under the influence\nof the Hawking effect. It is intriguing to find that the fermionic steerability\nof the maximally entangled states experiences sudden death with the Hawking\ntemperature, while the fermionic steerability of the non-maximally entangled\nstates maintains indefinite persistence at infinite Hawking temperature. In\ncontrast to prior research, this finding suggests that quantum steering of\nnon-maximally entangled states is more advantageous than that of maximally\nentangled states for processing quantum tasks in the gravitational background.\nThis surprising result overturns the traditional idea of ``the advantage of\nmaximally entangled steering in the relativistic framework\" and provides a new\nperspective for understanding the Hawking effect of the black hole.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rd-__ZlFVKSdFRYZqWep2yV-r68mbqCzZvA6JnkjuiE","pdfSize":"297807"}
