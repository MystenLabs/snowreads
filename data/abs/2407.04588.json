Van den Heuvel et al. (European J. of Combinatorics, 2017)\nshowed that for a fixed graph $X$, the maximum $r$-th weak coloring number of\n$X$-minor-free graphs is polynomial in $r$. We determine this polynomial up to\na factor of $\\mathcal{O}(r \\log r)$. Moreover, we tie the exponent of the\npolynomial to a structural property of $X$, namely, $2$-treedepth. As a result,\nfor a fixed graph $X$ and an $X$-minor-free graph $G$, we show that\n$\\mathrm{wcol}_r(G)= \\mathcal{O}(r^{\\mathrm{td}(X)-1}\\mathrm{log}\\ r)$, which\nimproves on the bound $\\mathrm{wcol}_r(G) = \\mathcal{O}(r^{g(\\mathrm{td}(X))})$\ngiven by Dujmovi\\'c et al. (SODA, 2024), where $g$ is an exponential function.\nIn the case of planar graphs of bounded treewidth, we show that the maximum\n$r$-th weak coloring number is in $\\mathcal{O}(r^2\\mathrm{log}\\ r$), which is\nbest possible.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"aoc4LlOeqS_AANlojeOg0vP1gmxCo2-eywhFsQTz1Lk","pdfSize":"1506748"}
