We study the\n$P-V$ criticality and thermodynamical stability of the black hole. We obtained\na first-order phase transition, which may be interpreted as the large/small\nblack hole phase transition. Therefore, we obtained a van der Waals behaviour\nand obtained critical points. Finally, we calculate quantum work used to\nresolve the information loss paradox.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"k2VDb_HqnxlEgIiwNM7RH9b4zAJbxLEcjXqPkHdZZ2A","pdfSize":"375521"}
