This study focuses on\neffectively detecting SLI in children using transcripts of spontaneous\nnarratives from 1063 interviews. A three-stage cascading pipeline was proposed\nf. In the first stage, feature extraction and dimensionality reduction of the\ndata are performed using the Random Forest (RF) and Spearman correlation\nmethods. In the second stage, the most predictive variables from the first\nstage are estimated using logistic regression, which is used in the last stage\nto detect SLI in children from transcripts of spontaneous narratives using a\nnearest neighbor classifier. The results revealed an accuracy of 97.13% in\nidentifying SLI, highlighting aspects such as the length of the responses, the\nquality of their utterances, and the complexity of the language. This new\napproach, framed in natural language processing, offers significant benefits to\nthe field of SLI detection by avoiding complex subjective variables and\nfocusing on quantitative metrics directly related to the child's performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-cUdyokuQSwP70rM_93FW9VaA-tcAn4qJ63S3WlDFQU","pdfSize":"445096"}
