Moreover, we obtain the equivalence of the essential\nnormality of a quotient module and the Hilbert-Schmidtness of its associated\nsubmodule in $H^2(\\mathbb D^2)$, in the case that the submodule contains a\ndistinguished homogenous polynomial. As an application, we prove that each\nfinitely generated submodule containing a polynomial is Hilbert-Schmidt, which\npartially gives an affirmative answer to the conjecture of Yang \\cite{Ya3}.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kYBkWWJoZQqOh3X8_eFFV91_lLnQEZR947JIxqDC5Yg","pdfSize":"230524","objectId":"0x2c5be76e8b1ffb7ebacea17f23b9150d4e68c6e251cca7d2dad0bb3e64caeab6","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
