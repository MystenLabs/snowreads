  "abstract": "  This study investigates the molecular-level self-assembly behavior of seven\nfunctionalized diamondoids, examining how diverse substituents influence\nstructural organization, thermal stability, and aggregate morphology. Using a\ncombination of density functional theory for initial geometry optimization and\nmolecular dynamics simulations, we explored radial distribution functions,\nthermal fragmentation temperatures, and radii of gyration for each system. Our\nresults reveal that hydrogen-bonding and polar functional groups (e.g., amino,\nhydroxy) foster well-defined, ordered assemblies, while bulkier or less\ninteractive substituents (e.g., phenyl, methoxy) lead to more open, amorphous\naggregates. Thermal stability strongly depends on substituent chemistry:\ncomplex, bulky groups or heteroatom-rich functionalities confer enhanced\nresistance to fragmentation at high temperatures, whereas simpler groups\ndestabilize the assembly at lower temperatures. Radii of gyration further show\nthat substituent size and polarity can fine-tune cluster compactness. These\nfindings provide critical insights for designing diamondoid-based nanomaterials\nwith tailored structural properties, thermal endurance, and functional\nperformance in advanced technological applications.\n",
