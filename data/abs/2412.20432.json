  "abstract": "  We restrict the computational power of Gurevich's abstract state machines to\nobtain two classes of machine models for generalised computation of sets,\nnamely restricted abstract state machines (RASMs) and restricted abstract state\nmachines with parameters (RASMPs). We derive from each class, a relative\ncomputability relation on sets, which is analogous to the Turing reducibility\nrelation on reals. We then prove that the relative computability relation\nderived from RASMPs is equivalent to relative constructibility.\n",
