The design used a Roger RT\n5880 LZ substrate with a thickness and permittivity of 0.762mm and 1.96,\nrespectively. The antenna was simulated in CST Microwave Studio. As the antenna\nfeed, a quarter-wave transformer was used to provide an impedance match of 50\nohms. To improve the antenna's performance, a Ushaped element was added to the\nground plane. The antenna resonated at 28 GHz frequency, according to\nsimulation data, with a return loss of -21.4 dB, VSWR of 1.18, bandwidth of\n2.026 GHz, and gain of 8.19 dB. The proposed antenna exhibits a performance\nimprovement in terms of gain and bandwidth due to the addition of U-shaped\nelement when benchmarked with existing designs in the literature work\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computer Science/Emerging Technologies","Computer Science/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"cmsM2XKrxUC105hPgj03UeCgE0zMiarNqvLbxIuY4dk","pdfSize":"251197"}
