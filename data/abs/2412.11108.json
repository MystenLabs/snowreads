  "abstract": "  Plug-and-play (PnP) methods are extensively used for solving imaging inverse\nproblems by integrating physical measurement models with pre-trained deep\ndenoisers as priors. Score-based diffusion models (SBMs) have recently emerged\nas a powerful framework for image generation by training deep denoisers to\nrepresent the score of the image prior. While both PnP and SBMs use deep\ndenoisers, the score-based nature of PnP is unexplored in the literature due to\nits distinct origins rooted in proximal optimization. This letter introduces a\nnovel view of PnP as a score-based method, a perspective that enables the\nre-use of powerful SBMs within classical PnP algorithms without retraining. We\npresent a set of mathematical relationships for adapting popular SBMs as priors\nwithin PnP. We show that this approach enables a direct comparison between PnP\nand SBM-based reconstruction methods using the same neural network as the\nprior.
