Recent work of Gaudio, R\\'acz, and Sridhar (COLT\n2022) determined the precise information-theoretic threshold for exact\ncommunity recovery using two correlated graphs; in particular, this showcased\nthe subtle interplay between community recovery and graph matching. Here we\nstudy the natural setting of more than two graphs. The main challenge lies in\nunderstanding how to aggregate information across several graphs when none of\nthe pairwise latent vertex correspondences can be exactly recovered. Our main\nresult derives the precise information-theoretic threshold for exact community\nrecovery using any constant number of correlated graphs, answering a question\nof Gaudio, R\\'acz, and Sridhar (COLT 2022). In particular, for every $K \\geq 3$\nwe uncover and characterize a region of the parameter space where exact\ncommunity recovery is possible using $K$ correlated graphs, even though (1)\nthis is information-theoretically impossible using any $K-1$ of them and (2)\nnone of the latent matchings can be exactly recovered.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Computer Science/Information Theory","Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Social and Information Networks","Mathematics/Information Theory","Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5GXwqAAJKviDN4lHpxfHYcvo7HE4dd8t8JJ2SGKJ_mI","pdfSize":"1457963"}
