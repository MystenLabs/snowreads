To what extent the mechanisms of\nplasticity can be exploited to drive a neural network and make it perform some\nkind of computational task remains unclear. This question, relevant in a\nbioengineering context, can be formulated as a control problem on a\nhigh-dimensional system with strongly constrained and non-linear dynamics. We\npresent a self-contained procedure which, through appropriate spatio-temporal\nstimulations of the neurons, is able to drive rate-based neural networks with\narbitrary initial connectivity towards a desired functional state. We\nillustrate our approach on two different computational tasks: a non-linear\nassociation between multiple input stimulations and activity patterns\n(representing digit images), and the construction of a continuous attractor\nencoding a collective variable in a neural population. Our work thus provides a\nproof of principle for emerging paradigms of in vitro computation based on real\nneurons.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"UIbIL0WMgCbrLlp1WAyne_03zH5akl86JwNm2fAUnME","pdfSize":"4397477"}
