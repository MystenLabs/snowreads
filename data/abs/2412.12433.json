  "abstract": "  Recent works in clustering-based topic models perform well in monolingual\ntopic identification by introducing a pipeline to cluster the contextualized\nrepresentations. However, the pipeline is suboptimal in identifying topics\nacross languages due to the presence of language-dependent dimensions (LDDs)\ngenerated by multilingual language models. To address this issue, we introduce\na novel, SVD-based dimension refinement component into the pipeline of the\nclustering-based topic model. This component effectively neutralizes the\nnegative impact of LDDs, enabling the model to accurately identify topics\nacross languages. Our experiments on three datasets demonstrate that the\nupdated pipeline with the dimension refinement component generally outperforms\nother state-of-the-art cross-lingual topic models.\n",
