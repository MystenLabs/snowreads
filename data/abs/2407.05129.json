This article investigates shear bands and retrogressive\nfailure of geomaterials through a recently formulated\nlarge-deformation-plasticity periporomechanics (PPM) paradigm.\nPeriporomechanics is a nonlocal reformulation of classical poromechanics\nthrough the effective force and peridynamic state concepts. The nonlocal\ndeformation gradient is multiplicatively decomposed into the elastic and\nplastic parts in this large-deformation PPM paradigm. The stabilized\ncorrespondence principle is adopted to implement a classical elastoplastic\nconstitutive model into the new PPM paradigm. We have numerically implemented\nthis large-deformation plasticity PPM paradigm through a Lagrangian meshfree\nmethod in space and an explicit Newmark scheme in time. The implemented PPM\nframework is used to model shear banding and retrogressive slope failure in\nporous media under dry conditions. The numerical results have demonstrated the\nefficacy and robustness of this new PPM paradigm for modeling shear banding and\nretrogressive failure involving large deformation in porous media.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"G4RA4wS3rP3uMcsUgpVzJ3DNk5PMo_BDAPjb5ibMwhc","pdfSize":"2252313"}
