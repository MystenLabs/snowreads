It has led to the release of popular black-box tools\nfor users to upload personal data and receive protected counterparts. In this\nwork, we show such black-box protections can be substantially bypassed if a\nsmall set of unprotected in-distribution data is available. Specifically, an\nadversary can (1) easily acquire (unprotected, protected) pairs by querying the\nblack-box protections with the unprotected dataset; and (2) train a diffusion\nbridge model to build a mapping. This mapping, termed BridgePure, can\neffectively remove the protection from any previously unseen data within the\nsame distribution. Under this threat model, our method demonstrates superior\npurification performance on classification and style mimicry tasks, exposing\ncritical vulnerabilities in black-box data protection.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gEMzRKD9xz_nFBXQREEMlSoejtxIzK4xy33t3aigEsE","pdfSize":"43698667"}
