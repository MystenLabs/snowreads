Our approach differs from existing\nstate-of-the-art methods that are either: (i) object-agnostic, but can only\noperate on individual frames, or (ii) can model space-time dependencies, but\nare only designed to work with a single object category. Our approach is\ngrounded in two core principles. First, general information about similar\nobjects can be leveraged to achieve better performance when there is little\nobject-specific training data. Second, a temporally-proximate context window is\nadvantageous for achieving consistency throughout a sequence. These two\nprinciples allow us to outperform current state-of-the-art methods on per-frame\nand per-sequence metrics for a variety of animal categories. Lastly, we release\na new synthetic dataset containing 3D skeletons and motion sequences for a\nvariety of animal categories.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"s7wBtFTh-FlhxrHD-OEYZEWgOUBv5kDj3IDJIlm1P4M","pdfSize":"4548141"}
