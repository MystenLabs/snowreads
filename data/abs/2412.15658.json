The values of $v_2$ and $v_3$ are measured for\ncharged particles over a wide range of transverse momentum ($p_\\text{T}$),\n1-400 GeV, and Pb+Pb collision centrality, 0-60%, using the scalar product and\nmulti-particle cumulant methods. These methods are sensitive to event-by-event\nfluctuations and non-flow effects in the measurements of azimuthal\nanisotropies. Positive values of $v_2$ are observed up to a $p_{\\text{T}}$ of\napproximately 100 GeV from both methods across all centrality intervals.\nPositive values of $v_3$ are observed up to approximately 25 GeV using both\nmethods, though the application of the three-subevent technique to the\nmulti-particle cumulant method leads to significant changes at the highest\n$p_{\\text{T}}$. At high $p_{\\text{T}}$ ($p_{\\text{T}} \\gtrapprox 10$ GeV),\ncharged particles are dominantly from jet fragmentation. These jets, and hence\nthe measurements presented here, are sensitive to the path-length dependence of\nparton energy loss in the quark-gluon plasma produced in Pb+Pb collisions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LMFl5noPRvpJn0rlx55m3mj1MGs0FGpA5qN4c9bvYHY","pdfSize":"2686131"}
