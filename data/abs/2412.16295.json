If $X$ is Fano, we show that this morphism is surjective.\nThe construction relies on the notion of degree of a quasimap at a base-point,\nwhich we define. We show that a quasimap is determined by its regular extension\nand the degree of each of its basepoints.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xD-ikwzxLWOVkPlR7KeZosxpuJCDoCxwXCK0lXNF7iA","pdfSize":"471079"}
