These algorithms leverage users' past\ninteractions and extensive content libraries to retrieve and rank content that\npersonalizes experiences and boosts engagement. Among various modalities\nthrough which this algorithmically curated content may be delivered, the\nhomepage feed is the most prominent. This paper presents a comprehensive study\nof how prior user interactions influence the content presented on users'\nhomepage feeds across three major platforms: YouTube, Reddit, and X (formerly\nTwitter). We use a series of carefully designed experiments to gather data\ncapable of uncovering the influence of specific user interactions on homepage\ncontent. This study provides insights into the behaviors of the content\ncuration algorithms used by each platform, how they respond to user\ninteractions, and also uncovers evidence of deprioritization of specific\ntopics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"vYY-E8Qx94JziW-pXuLHH4DCiIzLbEbJb5rRpsjuB7Q","pdfSize":"1065998"}
