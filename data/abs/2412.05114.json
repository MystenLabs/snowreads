  "abstract": "  In this technical report, we investigate the predictive performance\ndifferences of a rule-based approach and the GNN architectures NBFNet and A*Net\nwith respect to knowledge graph completion. For the two most common benchmarks,\nwe find that a substantial fraction of the performance difference can be\nexplained by one unique negative pattern on each dataset that is hidden from\nthe rule-based approach. Our findings add a unique perspective on the\nperformance difference of different model classes for knowledge graph\ncompletion: Models can achieve a predictive performance advantage by penalizing\nscores of incorrect facts opposed to providing high scores for correct facts.\n",
