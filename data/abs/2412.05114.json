For the two most common benchmarks,\nwe find that a substantial fraction of the performance difference can be\nexplained by one unique negative pattern on each dataset that is hidden from\nthe rule-based approach. Our findings add a unique perspective on the\nperformance difference of different model classes for knowledge graph\ncompletion: Models can achieve a predictive performance advantage by penalizing\nscores of incorrect facts opposed to providing high scores for correct facts.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EmSgV9yicFFF0mvUwYZ0FoQ42bQ6NuRvHbGSqGzXBz8","pdfSize":"268391"}
