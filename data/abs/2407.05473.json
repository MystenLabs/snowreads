A cell-free network\nstructure, with UAVs connecting to a multiplicity of APs, is therefore ideal in\nterms of resilience. This work proposes a trajectory optimization framework for\na UAV swarm tracking a wildfire while maintaining cell-free connectivity with\nground APs. Such optimization entails a constant repositioning of the\nmultiplicity of UAVs as the fire evolves to ensure that the best possible view\nis acquired and transmitted reliably, while respecting altitude limits,\navoiding collisions, and proceeding to recharge batteries as needed. Given the\ncomplexity and time-varying nature of this multi-UAV trajectory optimization,\nreinforcement learning is leveraged, specifically the twin-delayed deep\ndeterministic policy gradient algorithm. The approach is shown to be highly\neffective for wildfire tracking and coverage and could be likewise applicable\nto survey other natural and man-made phenomena, including weather events,\nearthquakes, or chemical spills.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZRYVddeiXKuxqgi7hFFsa9rmxDtmbx8PnC4tgQcoqEU","pdfSize":"1172263"}
