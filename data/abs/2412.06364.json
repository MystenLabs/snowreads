  "abstract": "  To elucidate the mechanism by which THz radiation non-thermally affects\nliving organisms, the lateral diffusion constants of lipid molecules in the\ncell membranes of HeLa cells were measured using fluorescence recovery after\nphotobleaching under THz wave irradiation (THz-FRAP) at frequencies of 0.10,\n0.29, and 0.48 THz, with power densities ranging from 20 to 89 mW/cm2. The\npotential heating effects of the THz irradiation were eliminated through\ntemperature calibration using an ultrathin thermocouple, allowing for the\ninvestigation of the non-thermal effects of THz radiation. Irradiation at 0.10\nand 0.29 THz induced an increase in diffusion constants at temperatures lower\nthan the cell growth temperature. This suggests that THz irradiation induces\nthe order-disorder phase transition of the cell membrane lipids by affecting\nthe dynamics of bound water molecules. Our findings have important implications\nfor the establishment of safety standards for THz radiation and for the\npotential development of new methods for cell manipulation using THz\nirradiation in the future\n",
