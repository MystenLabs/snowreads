We also use the lowerrank manifold\nadvantage of the latent variables of the latent model to fuse the information\nof the forces between atoms to better maintain the geometric equivariant\nproperties of the molecules. Because there is no need to perform information\nfusion encoding in stages like traditional encoders and decoders, this reduces\nthe amount of calculation in the back-propagation process. The model keeps the\nforces and local constraints of particle bonds in the latent variable space,\nreducing the impact of underfitting on the surface of the network on the large\nposition drift of the particle geometry, so that our model can converge\nearlier. We introduce a distribution control variable in each backward step to\nstrengthen exploration and improve the diversity of generation. In the\nexperiment, the quality of the samples we generated and the convergence speed\nof the model have been significantly improved.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mA9fW4G1co9U44k76NkGqzIpW7E0QxnbchYxlVB1AM4","pdfSize":"2717935"}
