  "abstract": "  Contrastive learning is a prevalent technique in self-supervised vision\nrepresentation learning, typically generating positive pairs by applying two\ndata augmentations to the same image. Designing effective data augmentation\nstrategies is crucial for the success of contrastive learning. Inspired by the\nstory of the blind men and the elephant, we introduce JointCrop and JointBlur.\nThese methods generate more challenging positive pairs by leveraging the joint\ndistribution of the two augmentation parameters, thereby enabling contrastive\nlearning to acquire more effective feature representations. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first effort to explicitly incorporate the joint\ndistribution of two data augmentation parameters into contrastive learning. As\na plug-and-play framework without additional computational overhead, JointCrop\nand JointBlur enhance the performance of SimCLR, BYOL, MoCo v1, MoCo v2, MoCo\nv3, SimSiam, and Dino baselines with notable improvements.\n",
