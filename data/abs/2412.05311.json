Implementing integrated DRC checkers to meet the\nstandard of commercial DRC tools demands extensive human expertise to interpret\nfoundry specifications, analyze layouts, and debug code iteratively. However,\nthis labor-intensive process, requiring to be repeated by every update of\ntechnology nodes, prolongs the turnaround time of designing circuits. In this\npaper, we present DRC-Coder, a multi-agent framework with vision capabilities\nfor automated DRC code generation. By incorporating vision language models and\nlarge language models (LLM), DRC-Coder can effectively process textual, visual,\nand layout information to perform rule interpretation and coding by two\nspecialized LLMs. We also design an auto-evaluation function for LLMs to enable\nDRC code debugging. Experimental results show that targeting on a sub-3nm\ntechnology node for a state-of-the-art standard cell layout tool, DRC-Coder\nachieves perfect F1 score 1.000 in generating DRC codes for meeting the\nstandard of a commercial DRC tool, highly outperforming standard prompting\ntechniques (F1=0.631). DRC-Coder can generate code for each design rule within\nfour minutes on average, which significantly accelerates technology advancement\nand reduces engineering costs.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Hardware Architecture","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"H5kDz3i3maKYOB23TIfs1ZWt3FB7g-Bv9d2Yy9ju4sI","pdfSize":"2080294"}
