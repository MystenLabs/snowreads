However, such a process has yet to\nbe experimentally observed. The HIBEAM/NNBAR program is a proposed two-stage\nexperiment at the European Spallation Source to search for baryon number\nviolation. The program will include high-sensitivity searches for processes\nthat violate baryon number by one or two units: free neutron-antineutron\noscillation via mixing, neutron-antineutron oscillation via regeneration from a\nsterile neutron state and neutron disappearance; the effective process of\nneutron regeneration is also possible. The program can be used to discover and\ncharacterize mixing in the neutron, antineutron and sterile neutron sectors.\nThe experiment addresses topical open questions such as the origins of\nbaryogenesis and the nature of dark matter, and is sensitive to scales of new\nphysics substantially in excess of those available at colliders. A goal of the\nprogram is to open a discovery window to neutron conversion probabilities\n(sensitivities) by up to three orders of magnitude compared with previous\nsearches, which is a rare opportunity. A conceptual design report for NNBAR has\nrecently been published.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8ypdZkOqTjvtZJUUBRndYQ2ur7LxANSkkRpIuaJKTvg","pdfSize":"3730019"}
