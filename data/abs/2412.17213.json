Recent researches highlight\ntheir vulnerability to backdoor attacks in node classification, where GNNs\ntrained on a poisoned graph misclassify a test node only when specific triggers\nare attached. These studies typically focus on single attack categories and use\nadaptive trigger generators to create node-specific triggers. However, adaptive\ntrigger generators typically have a simple structure, limited parameters, and\nlack category-aware graph knowledge, which makes them struggle to handle\nbackdoor attacks across multiple categories as the number of target categories\nincreases. We address this gap by proposing a novel approach for\n\\textbf{E}ffective and \\textbf{U}nnoticeable\n\\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{C}ategory~(EUMC) graph backdoor attacks, leveraging\nsubgraph from the attacked graph as category-aware triggers to precisely\ncontrol the target category. To ensure the effectiveness of our method, we\nconstruct a \\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{C}ategory \\textbf{S}ubgraph\n\\textbf{T}riggers \\textbf{P}ool~(MC-STP) using the subgraphs of the attacked\ngraph as triggers. We then exploit the attachment probability shifts of each\nsubgraph trigger as category-aware priors for target category determination.\nMoreover, we develop a ``select then attach'' strategy that connects suitable\ncategory-aware trigger to attacked nodes for unnoticeability. Extensive\nexperiments across different real-world datasets confirm the efficacy of our\nmethod in conducting multi-category graph backdoor attacks on various GNN\nmodels and defense strategies.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"i4oz8LKkorvJNSOaQ4KPXP5JH9UpPiYUfQuJmTg-Zt0","pdfSize":"7419323"}
