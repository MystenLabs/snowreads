Our approach leverages\ngenerative transformer models and attention-guided deep recurrent neural\nnetworks to accurately identify and detect patterns of malicious behaviors in\nthe early stage of malware execution. By analyzing the sequences of API calls\ninvoked during execution, the proposed approach can classify executable files\n(programs) as malware or benign by predicting their behaviors based on a few\nshots (initial API calls) invoked during execution. EarlyMalDetect can predict\nand reveal what a malware program is going to perform on the target system\nbefore it occurs, which can help to stop it before executing its malicious\npayload and infecting the system. Specifically, EarlyMalDetect relies on a\nfine-tuned transformer model based on API calls which has the potential to\npredict the next API call functions to be used by a malware or benign\nexecutable program. Our extensive experimental evaluations show that the\nproposed approach is highly effective in predicting malware behaviors and can\nbe used as a preventive measure against zero-day threats in Windows systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DfjFQ-yfwFv00pmfgqBw89iaNl3LhgQMIpE-KwTp4cw","pdfSize":"1206958"}
