In contrast to existing methods that rely on an ad hoc\nmodel approximating the nonconvex functions, our approach can work with a\nnonconvex model constructed by the pointwise minimum of finitely many convex\nmodels. The latter can be chosen with reasonable flexibility to better fit the\nunderlying functions' structure. We provide a unifying framework and analysis\ncovering several subclasses of composite optimization problems and show that\nour method computes points satisfying certain necessary optimality conditions,\nwhich we will call model criticality. Depending on the specific model being\nused, our general concept of criticality boils down to standard necessary\noptimality conditions. Numerical experiments on some stochastic\nreliability-based optimization problems illustrate the practical performance of\nthe method.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wE-c3Kj6a-fJefsQ3PPivYRG-L1oiyEyWtWfZOooAi4","pdfSize":"696974"}
