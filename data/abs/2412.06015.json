  "abstract": "  As cyber threats continue to evolve in sophistication and scale, the ability\nto detect anomalous network behavior has become critical for maintaining robust\ncybersecurity defenses. Modern cybersecurity systems face the overwhelming\nchallenge of analyzing billions of daily network interactions to identify\npotential threats, making efficient and accurate anomaly detection algorithms\ncrucial for network defense. This paper investigates the use of variations of\nthe Isolation Forest (iForest) machine learning algorithm for detecting\nanomalies in internet scan data. In particular, it presents the Set-Partitioned\nIsolation Forest (siForest), a novel extension of the iForest method designed\nto detect anomalies in set-structured data. By treating instances such as sets\nof multiple network scans with the same IP address as cohesive units, siForest\neffectively addresses some challenges of analyzing complex, multidimensional\ndatasets. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets simulating diverse\nanomaly scenarios in network traffic demonstrate that siForest has the\npotential to outperform traditional approaches on some types of internet scan\ndata.\n",
