This technique consolidates various\nspin/phonon couplings into a limited number of collective degrees of freedom,\nallowing for a fully quantum mechanical treatment. By precisely factorizing the\nentire system into \"system\" and \"bath\" sub-ensembles, our approach simplifies a\npreviously intractable problem, making it solvable on modest-scale computers.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by studying the spin relaxation\nand dephasing times of the single-molecule qubit \\ce{VOPc(OH)8}, which features\na lone unpaired electron on the central vanadium atom. By using this mode\nprojection method, we are able to perform numerical exact quantum dynamical\ncalculation on this system which allows us to follow the flow of quantum\ninformation from the single spin qubit into the projected phonon degrees of\nfreedom. Our results demonstrate both the utility of the method and suggest how\none can engineer the environment as to further optimize the quantum properties\nof a qubit system.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"poOtNbuCBPeSrNyEPIBGTsQstbf30tqGgTxzU2g1NTs","pdfSize":"5405578"}
