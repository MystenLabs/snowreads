The NMPC combines a\ncontinuous-discrete extended Kalman filter (CD-EKF) with an optimal control\nproblem (OCP) for setpoint tracking. We discretize the OCP using direct\nmultiple shooting. We apply an explicit singly diagonal implicit Runge-Kutta\n(ESDIRK) integration scheme to solve systems of DAEs, both for the one-step\nprediction in the CD-EKF and in each shooting interval of the discretized OCP.\nThe ESDIRK methods use an iterated internal numerical differentiation approach\nfor precise sensitivity computations. These sensitivities are used to provide\naccurate gradient information in the OCP and to efficiently integrate the\ncovariance information in the CD-EKF. Subsequently, we present a simulation\ncase study where we apply the NMPC to a simple alkaline electrolyzer stack\nmodel. We use the NMPC to track a time-varying setpoint for the stack\ntemperature subject to input bound constraints.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rJIW15rp6aPW8lC_7pGVf3dH5OGbjC10w3B1CVwzPZE","pdfSize":"340825"}
