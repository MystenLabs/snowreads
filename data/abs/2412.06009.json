We experimented with a combination\nof embedding models, including Stella, BGE, CDE, and Mpnet, and leveraged\nfine-tuning and reranking for retrieving relevant documents in top ranks. We\nutilized a novel approach, LeSeR, which achieved competitive results with a\nrecall@10 of 0.8201 and map@10 of 0.6655 for retrievals. This work highlights\nthe transformative potential of natural language processing techniques in\nregulatory applications, offering insights into their capabilities for\nimplementing a retrieval augmented generation system while identifying areas\nfor future improvement in robustness and domain adaptation.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Information Retrieval","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"m8w8mrCYsS-aRxsNqeJiFcTY_SBuyAC24dnZ-XMmc2I","pdfSize":"218983"}
