Through an\nanalysis of five diverse application areas -- weather forecasting, chemical\nenergy and force calculations, fluid dynamics, quantum chromodynamics, and\nwireless communication -- we demonstrate that this vulnerability is a broad and\ngeneral characteristic of AI systems. This revelation exposes a hidden risk in\nrelying on neural networks for essential scientific computations, calling\nfurther studies on their reliability and security.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"S3_uWvsGD7C_ASY0E0eTM2cBGC6jCukiBp-HNbLdBWI","pdfSize":"23627970"}
