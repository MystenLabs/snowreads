In this preliminary study, we\napplied FMRIB Software Library commands on T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted\nimages of a single young adult using the Fugaku supercomputer. The tensor-based\nmeasurements and subcortical structure segmentations performed on Fugaku\nsupercomputer were highly consistent with those from conventional systems,\ndemonstrating its reliability and significantly reduced processing time.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oPK5-RBjzqxe3J_gpZ-xeQa_FIvylaRF9vts3pb5rPE","pdfSize":"6583744","objectId":"0x1fde8b730dd3df9ed7cacaf7e51f73c03827b8b439fa27e507c52f24fe9f8213","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
