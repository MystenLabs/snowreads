A significant change has been witnessed in Indian institutional\nactors during the last two decades, with various new private universities being\nset up and several new IITs, NITs, IISERs being established. Therefore, it is\nimportant to identify whether the composition of the list of the top 100\nresearch output producing institutions of India has changed significantly\nduring the recent two decades. This study attempted to analyse the changes\nduring the two 10-year periods (2004-13 and 2014-23). The institutions which\nretain their position within top 100 during both periods are identified, along\nwith the change in their positions. Similarly, institutions that were there in\ntop 100 list during first time period (2004-13) and go out of top 100 list\nduring second time period (2014-23) are also identified. In the same line, the\nnew entrant institutions in the top 100 list during second time period\n(2014-23) are identified too. The results obtained indicate towards an\ninstitutional shift in the contribution to Indian research output.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Digital Libraries"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hawpSFBfCxtdgG53CeJln0dh-0jDIvdTFQXNV-lT19c","pdfSize":"486037"}
