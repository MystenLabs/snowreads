We find\nthat there was strong optical variability present throughout the entire\noutburst period covered by our monitoring, while the average flux remained\nsteady. The optical spectral energy distribution is blue on most dates,\nconsistent with emission from an accretion disc, interspersed by occasional red\nflares, likely due to optically thin synchrotron emission. We find that the\nfractional rms variability has comparable amplitudes in the radio and optical\nbands. This implies that the long-term variability is likely to be due to\naccretion changes, seen at optical wavelengths, that propagate into the jet,\nseen at radio frequencies. We find that the optical flux varies asymmetrically\nabout the orbital period peaking at phase ~0.7, with a modulation amplitude\nthat is the same across all optical wavebands suggesting that reprocessing off\nof the disc, companion star and ablated material is driving the phase\ndependence. The evidence of ablation found in X-ray binaries is vital in\nunderstanding the long term evolution of neutron star X-ray binaries and how\nthey evolve into (potentially isolated) millisecond pulsars.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EAxfpke9-W2S74GyBEtGgi6tplDf60VRkxwmpwO_smE","pdfSize":"1608651"}
