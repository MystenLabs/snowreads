QPA plays an important role\nin signal amplification in ultrafast photonics and quantum light generation.\nThe QPA process has a number of features characterized by the non-Hermitian\nparity-time ($\\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry. In this report, we explore new\ninteraction regimes and uncover multiple $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry phase\ntransitions in such QPA process where transitions are particularly sensitive to\nexternal parameters. In particular, we demonstrate the feasibility of detection\nof $10^{-11}$ inhomogeneities of the doped absorber, which is order of\nmagnitude more sensitive than similar measurements performed in a linear\nabsorption regime. In doing so, we reveal a family of $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry\nphase transitions appearing in the QPA process and provide a novel nonlinear\noptical sensing mechanism for precise optical measurements.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lZOKUG4gIcZHCOnuKGgQ4vZ9z8ewZTg16746OUKRcw8","pdfSize":"8083474"}
