  "abstract": "  Many random flows, including 2D unsteady and stagnation-free 3D steady flows,\nexhibit non-trivial braiding of pathlines as they evolve in time or space. We\nshow that these random flows belong to a pathline braiding \\emph{universality\nclass} that quantitatively links dispersion and chaotic stirring, meaning that\nthe Lyapunov exponent can be estimated from the purely advective transverse\ndispersivity. We verify this quantitative link for both unsteady 2D and steady\n3D random flows. This result uncovers a deep connection between transport and\nmixing over a broad class of random flows.\n",
