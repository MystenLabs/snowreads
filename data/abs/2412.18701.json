  "abstract": "  In this work, we propose a first-order sampling method called the\nMetropolis-adjusted Preconditioned Langevin Algorithm for approximate sampling\nfrom a target distribution whose support is a proper convex subset of\n$\\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Our proposed method is the result of applying a\nMetropolis-Hastings filter to the Markov chain formed by a single step of the\npreconditioned Langevin algorithm with a metric $\\mathscr{G}$, and is motivated\nby the natural gradient descent algorithm for optimisation. We derive\nnon-asymptotic upper bounds for the mixing time of this method for sampling\nfrom target distributions whose potentials are bounded relative to\n$\\mathscr{G}$, and for exponential distributions restricted to the support. Our\nanalysis suggests that if $\\mathscr{G}$ satisfies stronger notions of\nself-concordance introduced in Kook and Vempala (2024), then these mixing time\nupper bounds have a strictly better dependence on the dimension than when is\nmerely self-concordant. We also provide numerical experiments that demonstrates\nthe practicality of our proposed method. Our method is a high-accuracy sampler\ndue to the polylogarithmic dependence on the error tolerance in our mixing time\nupper bounds.\n",
