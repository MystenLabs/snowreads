  "abstract": "  We introduce a novel algorithm for controlling linear time invariant systems\nin a tracking problem. The controller is based on a Gaussian Process (GP) whose\nrealizations satisfy a system of linear ordinary differential equations with\nconstant coefficients. Control inputs for tracking are determined by\nconditioning the prior GP on the setpoints, i.e. control as inference. The\nresulting Model Predictive Control scheme incorporates pointwise soft\nconstraints by introducing virtual setpoints to the posterior Gaussian process.\nWe show theoretically that our controller satisfies asymptotical stability for\nthe optimal control problem by leveraging general results from Bayesian\ninference and demonstrate this result in a numerical example.\n",
