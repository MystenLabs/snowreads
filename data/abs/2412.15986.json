{"id":"2412.15986","title":"Shifting the yield curve for fixed-income and derivatives portfolios","authors":"Michele Leonardo Bianchi, Dario Ruzzi, Anatoli Segura","authorsParsed":[["Bianchi","Michele Leonardo",""],["Ruzzi","Dario",""],["Segura","Anatoli",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Dec 2024 15:31:42 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-23","timestamp":1734708702000,"abstract":"  We use granular regulatory data on euro interest rate swap trades between\nJanuary 2021 and June 2023 to assess whether derivative positions of Italian\nbanks can offset losses on their debt securities holdings should interest rates\nrise unexpectedly. At the aggregate level of the banking system, we find that a\n100-basis-point upward shift of the yield curve increases on average the value\nof swaps by 3.65% of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), compensating in part for the\nlosses of 2.64% and 5.98% of CET1 recorded on debt securities valued at fair\nvalue and amortised cost. Variation exists across institutions, with some bank\nswap positions playing an offsetting role and some exacerbating bond market\nexposures to interest rate risk. Nevertheless, we conclude that, on aggregate,\nItalian banks use swaps as hedging instruments to reduce their interest rate\nexposures, which improves their ability to cope with the recent tightening of\nmonetary policy. Finally, we draw on our swap pricing model to conduct an\nextensive data quality analysis of the transaction-level information available\nto authorities, and we show that the errors in fitting value changes over time\nare significantly lower compared to those in fitting the values themselves.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Portfolio Management","Quantitative Finance/Pricing of Securities","Quantitative Finance/Risk Management"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"uHd5Uh2pY5UQjB1xv5SgB0XD1b2oAjBkOjTQTE259Jc","pdfSize":"826745"}
