  "abstract": "  We present a classical kinetically constrained model of interacting particles\non a triangular ladder, which displays diffusion and jamming and can be treated\nby means of a classical-quantum mapping. Interpreted as a theory of interacting\nfermions, the diffusion coefficient is the inverse of the effective mass of the\nquasiparticles which can be computed using mean-field theory. At a critical\ndensity \\r{ho} = 2/3, the model undergoes a dynamical phase transition in which\nexponentially many configurations become jammed while others remain diffusive.\nThe model can be generalized to two dimensions.\n",
