As such, some people approach\nplatforms like Reddit or Quora for a community-based conversation in an attempt\nto diagnose themselves. In this paper, we unearth what motivates people to\nshare personal health information on these platforms. From an online survey and\nin-depth interviews, we present who this population of users are, and what,\nwhere, and why they are posting. Our evaluation finds that tech-savvy young\nadults are more likely to post on online platforms about potentially sensitive\nor highly specific topics for convenience, fast response, and a sense of\ncommunity. Most importantly, we found that anonymity, distrust of physicians,\nand prior experience with platforms were key factors that affected behavior.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tXv1y83cY8VQnu5Qy1mmBh7Nlhyn9pEUVS14-29IQuE","pdfSize":"557721"}
