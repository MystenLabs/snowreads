  "abstract": "  By pumping energy into a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate it is possible to\ngenerate nonlinear coherent modes representing non-ground-state condensates. A\nBose-condensed system of trapped atoms with nonlinear coherent modes is\nanalogous to a finite-level atom considered in optics which can be excited by\napplying external fields. The excitation of finite-level atoms produces a\nvariety of optical phenomena. In the similar way, the generation of nonlinear\ncoherent modes in a trapped condensate results in many phenomena studied in\nwhat is termed atom optics. For example, there occur such effects as\ninterference patterns, interference current, Rabi oscillations, harmonic\ngeneration, parametric conversion, Ramsey fringes, mode locking, and a dynamic\ntransition between Rabi and Josephson regimes. The possibility of creating\nmesoscopic entangled states of trapped atoms and entanglement production by\natomic states in optical lattices are studied.\n",
