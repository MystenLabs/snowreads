  "abstract": "  In this work, a group theory-based formulation that introduces new classes of\ndihedral-symmetric beams is presented. Our framework leverages the algebraic\nproperties of the dihedral group of rotations and reflections to transform\ninput beams into closed-form families of dihedral-invariant wavefields, which\nwill be referred to as dihedral beams. Each transformation is associated with a\nspecific dihedral group in such a way that each family of dihedral beams\nexhibits the symmetries of its corresponding group. Our approach is inspired by\none of the outcomes of this work: elegant Hermite-Gauss beams can be described\nas a dihedral interference pattern of elegant traveling waves, a new set of\nsolutions to the paraxial equation also developed in this paper. Particularly,\nwhen taking elegant traveling waves as input beams, they transform into elegant\ndihedral beams possessing quasi-crystalline properties and including features\nlike phase singularities, self-healing, and pseudo-nondiffracting propagation,\nas well as containing elegant Hermite and Laguerre-Gauss beams as special\ncases. Our approach can be applied to arbitrary scalar and vector input beams\nand constitutes a general group-theory formulation that can be extended beyond\nthe dihedral group.\n",
