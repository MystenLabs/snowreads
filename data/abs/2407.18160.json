This directly unifies various formulas for Grothendieck polynomials\nin the literature. Our bijection is a generalization of a variant of the\nbijection of Gao and Huang in the unmarked, reduced case.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wQQOyCvA1blZbs2xlj3J8CehG_Qy1o_nj9bGusdY2-k","pdfSize":"358150"}
