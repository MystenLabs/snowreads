As some recent work has been done in these areas, we turn our attention\nto the problem of enumerating the square matrices with entries in\n$\\mathbb{Z}_{p^k}$ that are diagonalizable over $\\mathbb{Z}_{p^k}$. This turns\nout to be significantly more nontrivial than its finite field counterpart due\nto the presence of zero divisors in $\\mathbb{Z}_{p^k}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"e-GzVS9yk2FsGU0x-IHAcSV5lrnXOj4-7uZP5YPapuQ","pdfSize":"607854"}
