Each branch carries a unitary irreducible\nrepresentation of the Poincare group, though an exotic one for the subradiative\nsector. These two branches of solutions are related by an inversion and,\ntogether, span a single representation of the conformal group. While radiative\nmodes are realised in the familiar holographic way (either as boundary data at\nnull infinity or as bulk fields with radiative asymptotic behavior), the whole\ntower of subradiative modes forms an indecomposable representation of the usual\nPoincare group, which can be encoded into a single boundary field living on an\ninterior null cone. Lorentz transformations are realised in both cases as\nconformal transformations of the celestial sphere. The vector space of all\nsubradiative modes carries a unitary representation of a group isomorphic to\nthe Poincare group, where bulk conformal boosts play the role of bulk\ntranslations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uYu_wFmAf5PDj8DEEA-ucwZ7PHOGbexmBIX7cMPY4ng","pdfSize":"450366"}
