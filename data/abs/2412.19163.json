The\nMaster Stability Function (MSF) is a highly elegant and powerful tool for\ncharacterizing the stability of synchronization states. However, a significant\nchallenge lies in determining the MSF for complex dynamical networks driven by\nnonlinear interaction mechanisms. These mechanisms introduce additional\ncomplexity through the intricate connectivity of interacting elements within\nthe network and the intrinsic dynamics, which are governed by nonlinear\nprocesses with diverse parameters and higher dimensionality of systems. Over\nthe past 25 years, extensive research has focused on determining the MSF for\npairwise coupled identical systems with diffusive coupling. Our literature\nsurvey highlights two significant advancements in recent years: the\nconsideration of multilayer networks instead of single-layer networks and the\nextension of MSF analysis to incorporate higher-order interactions alongside\npairwise interactions.\n  In this review article, we revisit the analysis of the MSF for diffusively\npairwise coupled dynamical systems and extend this framework to more general\ncoupling schemes. Furthermore, we systematically derive the MSF for multilayer\ndynamical networks and single-layer coupled systems by incorporating\nhigher-order interactions alongside pairwise interactions. The primary focus of\nour review is on the analytical derivation and numerical computation of the MSF\nfor complex dynamical networks. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the\nMSF in data science, emphasizing its relevance and potential in this rapidly\nevolving field.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zHiU9YBl5sq0wc83Yh8MTlmmZb5RETiDTEXdxe-Wm9g","pdfSize":"822438"}
