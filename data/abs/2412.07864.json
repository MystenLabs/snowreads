We focus on the\n$p$-form theories proposed in \\cite{Broccoli:2021pvv}, which are fully defined\nby \"third-way\" consistent equations of motion. Using the perturbiner method, we\nshow that the unitarity is absent even at the tree level. We then pin down a\nunique modification of the equations of motion that restores unitarity. The\ntrade-off is the reinstatement of an underlying Lagrangian, which we recognize\nas the higher-dimensional generalization of the Freedman-Townsend (FT) model.\nFinally, we discuss conserved currents in third-way theories and show they all\nfollow from parent currents in the FT model. In particular, we point out the\nexistence of a higher-ranked global symmetry, which signals that the FT model\nis compatible with the existence of brane-like charged objects in higher\ndimensions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FWzkyHwL7y_Wp4q83jPzcZrW5TrM5PTVyPJ5gom3I44","pdfSize":"380405"}
