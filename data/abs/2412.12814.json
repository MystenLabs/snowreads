A common way of\naccomplishing that is to use tools to create timelines, which are then\nanalyzed. However, various challenges exist, such as large volumes of data or\ncontamination. While prior research has focused on simplifying timelines, less\nattention has been given to tampering, i.e., the deliberate manipulation of\nevidence, which can lead to errors in interpretation. This article addresses\nthe issue by proposing a framework to assess the tamper resistance of data\nsources used in event reconstruction. We discuss factors affecting data\nresilience, introduce a scoring system for evaluation, and illustrate its\napplication with case studies. This work aims to improve the reliability of\nforensic event reconstruction by considering tamper resistance.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"k6LlwQWVmCn_VJFpk0GhqWm2Ny8yfDZv3-RJX2KdI5c","pdfSize":"185836"}
