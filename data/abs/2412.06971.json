  "abstract": "  We prove that the tropical Abel--Prym map $\\Psi\\colon \\tGa\\to\\Prym(\\tGa/\\Ga)$\nassociated with a free double cover $\\pi\\colon \\tGa\\to \\Ga$ of hyperelliptic\nmetric graphs is harmonic of degree $2$ in accordance with the already\nestablished algebraic result. We then prove a partial converse. Contrary to the\nanalogous algebraic result, when the source graph of the double cover is not\nhyperelliptic, the Abel--Prym map is often not injective.\n  When the source graph is hyperelliptic, we show that the Abel--Prym graph\n$\\Psi(\\tGa)$ is a hyperelliptic metric graph of genus $g_{\\Ga}-1$ whose\nJacobian is isomorphic, as pptav, to the Prym variety of the cover. En route,\n  we count the number of distinct free double covers by hyperelliptic metric\ngraphs.\n",
