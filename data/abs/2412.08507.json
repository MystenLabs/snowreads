These factors, combined with the\nnontransparent nature of black-box Machine Learning models impede\ninterpretability and hinder human comprehension of model behavior. This paper\naddresses these challenges by exploring strategies to enhance interpretability\nthrough white-box approaches, which provide actionable insights into latent\nspace dynamics and model behavior during training. By leveraging human\nintuition and expertise, the proposed framework improves explainability,\nfosters trust, and promotes transparent Human Activity Recognition systems. A\nkey contribution is the proposal of a Human-in-the-Loop framework that enables\ndynamic user interaction with models, facilitating iterative refinements to\nenhance performance and efficiency. Additionally, we investigate the usefulness\nof Large Language Model as an assistance to provide users with guidance for\ninterpreting visualizations, diagnosing issues, and optimizing workflows.\nTogether, these contributions present a scalable and efficient framework for\ndeveloping interpretable and accessible Human Activity Recognition systems.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XhrqzlkL9_0_P2tph_bFFgpgvoK9KK67BiF-Sic5FTw","pdfSize":"1495802"}
