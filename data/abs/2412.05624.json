  "abstract": "  This study examines the shift in the scientific community from X (formerly\nTwitter) to Bluesky, its impact on scientific communication, and consequently\non social metrics (altmetrics). Analyzing 10,174 publications from\nmultidisciplinary and library and information science (LIS) journals in 2024,\nthe results reveal a notable increase in Bluesky activity for multidisciplinary\njournals in November 2024, likely influenced by political and platform changes,\nwith mentions doubling or quadrupling for journals like Nature and Science. In\nLIS, the adoption of Bluesky is more limited and shows significant variations\nacross journals, suggesting discipline-specific adoption patterns. However,\noverall engagement on Bluesky remains significantly lower than on X. While X\ncurrently dominates altmetric mentions, the observed growth on Bluesky suggests\na potential shift in the future, underscoring its emerging role in academic\ndissemination and the challenges of adapting scholarly communication metrics\nacross evolving platforms.\n",
