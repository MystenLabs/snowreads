Inspired by the recent advances in high-performance machine learning\ntechniques, we investigate the application of generative diffusion models to\nsynthesizing test particle trajectories obtained from a turbulent\nmagnetohydrodynamics simulation. We consider velocity increment, spatial\ntransport and curvature statistics, and find excellent agreement with the\nbaseline trajectories for fixed particle energies. Additionally, we consider\ntwo synthetic turbulence models for comparison. Finally, challenges towards an\napplication-ready transport model based on our approach are discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rlhsHA7wN5R77MvkhAbecm10UiTewTHF_ExNZGEf0ks","pdfSize":"3259662"}
