In the cases that the gauge group of the\n4D SYM is $U(N)$ and $Usp(2N)$, the resulting 3D theory is believed to be the\nABJM theory with the Chern-Simons level $k=1$ and $k=2$, respectively. This\nsuggests that the small $S^1$ limit of the superconformal index of these 4D\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYMs is identical to the sphere partition function of the ABJM\ntheories. Using a recently observed relation between the 4D and 3D R-charges\nfor theories with twelve or more supercharges, we explicitly confirm this\nidentity in the Schur limit of the 4D index. Our result provides a direct\nquantitative check of the relation between 4D $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYMs and 3D\n$\\mathcal{N}=8$ ABJM theories.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PMLt_B5K1dguydoOCrJGU9nZpyEmqbG4-jVKaNlhN_U","pdfSize":"234776"}
