{"id":"2412.20684","title":"There are finitely many uniformly most reliable graphs of corank 5","authors":"Pablo Romero","authorsParsed":[["Romero","Pablo",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Dec 2024 03:30:22 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-31","timestamp":1735529422000,"abstract":"  If $G$ is a simple graph and $\\rho\\in[0,1]$, the reliability $R_G(\\rho)$ is\nthe probability of $G$ being connected after each of its edges is removed\nindependently with probability $\\rho$. A simple graph $G$ is a \\emph{uniformly\nmost reliable graph} (UMRG) if $R_G(\\rho)\\geq R_H(\\rho)$ for every\n$\\rho\\in[0,1]$ and every simple graph $H$ on the same number of vertices and\nedges as $G$. Boesch [J.\\ Graph Theory 10 (1986), 339--352] conjectured that,\nif $n$ and $m$ are such that there exists a connected simple graph on $n$\nvertices and $m$ edges, then there also exists a UMRG on the same number of\nvertices and edges. Some counterexamples to Boesch's conjecture were given by\nKelmans, Myrvold et al., and Brown and Cox. It is known that Boesch's\nconjecture holds whenever the corank, defined as $c=m-n+1$, is at most $4$ (and\nthe corresponding UMRGs are fully characterized). Ath and Sobel conjectured\nthat Boesch's conjecture holds whenever the corank $c$ is between $5$ and $8$,\nprovided the number of vertices is at least $2c-2$. In this work, we give an\ninfinite family of counterexamples to Boesch's conjecture of corank $5$. These\nare the first reported counterexamples that attain the minimum possible corank.\nAs a byproduct, the conjecture by Ath and Sobel is disproved.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JOIw3uaWNUK8_yyLtc4PukEw3wrjqZgkCCxJvlIyk9g","pdfSize":"418448"}
