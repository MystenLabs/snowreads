  "abstract": "  The Neutrinos at the Main Injector (NuMI) beamline at Fermilab generates an\nintense muon neutrino beam for the NOvA (NuMI Off-axis $\\nu_e$ Appearance)\nlong-baseline neutrino experiment. Over the years, the NuMI beamline has been\npivotal in advancing neutrino physics, providing invaluable data and insights.\nThis proceeding paper discusses updates and the lessons learned from recent\nexperiences during the beam operations, maintenance, and monitoring of the NuMI\nbeamline. Key topics include the optimization of beam performance and\nchallenges in maintaining beamline stability. The paper aims to share best\npractices and provide a road-map for future beamline projects, including the\nLong-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF).\n",
