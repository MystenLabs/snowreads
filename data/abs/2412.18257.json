The optimization process utilizes\nmeasurement outcomes in the computational basis to construct an objective\nfunction for variational optimization. Two distinct objective functions are\nintroduced in this report. The first is constructed from the probabilities of\n2^N computational basis states. By maximizing the sum of the squared diagonal\nelements of the evolved N-qubit quantum state, this function drives the state\ntoward a diagonal form, with the optimized value corresponding to the purity of\nthe input quantum state. To address the experimental challenges associated with\nmeasuring all 2^N basis states, we propose a second objective function based on\nN single-qubit measurement probabilities. This reduces measurement complexity\nwith exponential growth, enhancing the feasibility of experimental\nimplementation. In both cases, we explore the relationship between measurement\nprobability distributions and the diagonalization of the evolved quantum state.\nNumerical simulations and analytical insights demonstrate that the variational\noptimization effectively transforms the input quantum state into its\ndiagonalized form, offering a practical framework for quantum state\ndiagonalization.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"-hfn04tykj5wGaZ7NGsO-xwVHw7smKlqiTkgkFcdUz8","pdfSize":"1037294"}
