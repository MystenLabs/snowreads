  "abstract": "  We address the challenge of incorporating non-Markovian electronic friction\neffects in quantum-mechanical approximations of dynamical observables. A\ngeneralized Langevin equation (GLE) is formulated for ring-polymer molecular\ndynamics (RPMD) rate calculations, which combines electronic friction with a\ndescription of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) for adsorbates on metal surfaces.\nAn efficient propagation algorithm is introduced that captures both the spatial\ndependence of friction strength and non-Markovian frictional memory. This\nframework is applied to a model of hydrogen diffusing on Cu(111) derived from\nab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations, revealing significant\nalterations in rate constants and tunnelling crossover temperatures due to\nnon-Markovian effects. Our findings explain why previous classical molecular\ndynamics simulations with Markovian friction showed unexpectedly good agreement\nwith experiment, highlighting the critical role of non-Markovian effects in\nfirst-principles atomistic simulations.\n",
