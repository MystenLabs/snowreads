  "abstract": "  Private 5G networks provide enhanced security, a wide range of optimized\nservices through network slicing, reduced latency, and support for many IoT\ndevices in a specific area, all under the owner's full control. Higher security\nand privacy to protect sensitive data is the most significant advantage of\nprivate networks, in e.g., smart hospitals. For long-term sustainability and\ncost-effectiveness of private 5G networks, analyzing and understanding the\nenergy consumption variation holds a greater significance in reaching toward\ngreen private network architecture for 6G. This paper addresses this research\ngap by providing energy profiling of network components using an experimental\nlaboratory setup that mimics real private 5G networks under various network\nconditions, which is a missing aspect in the existing literature.\n",
