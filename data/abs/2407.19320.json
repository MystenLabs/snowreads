Each Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation was run with a\nGPU-native high-fidelity Wall-Modeled Large-Eddy Simulations (WMLES) using a\nCartesian immersed-boundary method using more than 280M cells to ensure the\ngreatest possible accuracy. The dataset contains geometry variants that\nexhibits a wide range of flow characteristics that are representative of those\nobserved on road-cars. The dataset itself contains the 3D time-averaged volume\n& boundary data as well as the geometry and force & moment coefficients. This\npaper discusses the validation of the underlying CFD methods as well as\ncontents and structure of the dataset.
