  "abstract": "  Recent DETR-based methods have advanced the development of Video Instance\nSegmentation (VIS) through transformers' efficiency and capability in modeling\nspatial and temporal information. Despite harvesting remarkable progress,\nexisting works follow asynchronous designs, which model video sequences via\neither video-level queries only or adopting query-sensitive cascade structures,\nresulting in difficulties when handling complex and challenging video\nscenarios. In this work, we analyze the cause of this phenomenon and the\nlimitations of the current solutions, and propose to conduct synchronized\nmodeling via a new framework named SyncVIS. Specifically, SyncVIS explicitly\nintroduces video-level query embeddings and designs two key modules to\nsynchronize video-level query with frame-level query embeddings: a synchronized\nvideo-frame modeling paradigm and a synchronized embedding optimization\nstrategy. The former attempts to promote the mutual learning of frame- and\nvideo-level embeddings with each other and the latter divides large video\nsequences into small clips for easier optimization. Extensive experimental\nevaluations are conducted on the challenging YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021 & 2022,\nand OVIS benchmarks and SyncVIS achieves state-of-the-art results, which\ndemonstrates the effectiveness and generality of the proposed approach. The\ncode is available at https://github.com/rkzheng99/SyncVIS.\n",
