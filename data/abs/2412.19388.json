In order to induce a\nmomentum dissipation, the axionic field solutions are homogeneously distributed\nalong the horizon coordinates of the planar base manifold. We show that,\ndespite the explicit dependence of the scalar field and the metric on the\nprimary hair, this latter does not directly affect the calculation of transport\nproperties. Its influence is indirect, modifying the horizon location, but the\ntransport properties themselves do not explicitly depend on the hair parameter.\nWe take a step further and show that even within a more general class of\nbeyond-Horndeski theories, where the scalar field depends linearly on the hair\nparameter, the scalar hair still has no direct impact on the DC conductivity.\nThis result underscores the robustness of our earlier findings, and seem to\nconfirm that the transport properties remain unaffected by the explicit\npresence of the hair parameter.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cx7rFfZi05tNtlYkNAmXzzjRqj9rKhbrCW9soDWBNqQ","pdfSize":"158194"}
