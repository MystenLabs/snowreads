Our first example is the usual pair of\nfirst order quantifiers (for all / there exists) when individuals are viewed as\nindividual concepts handled by second order deductive rules. Our second example\nis the study of a second order translation of the simplest branching\nquantifier: ``A member of each team and a member of each board of directors\nknow each other\", for which we propose a second order treatment.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Cj5IvARpGeBZMbaYnucZxghNl8PRrH3bSlYe2ve92GA","pdfSize":"1651917"}
