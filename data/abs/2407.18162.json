The modeling\nderivation and corresponding analysis have been addressed in a previous\ncontribution. Building on this foundation, the scope of this study involves\ninvestigating a distributed control problem with the goal of optimizing a\ntracking-type cost functional. This latter aims to minimize the deviation of\ntumor cell location from desired target configurations while penalizing the\ncosts associated with implementing control measures, akin to introducing a\nsuitable medication. Under appropriate mathematical assumptions, we demonstrate\nthat sufficiently regular solutions exhibit continuous dependence on the\ncontrol variable. Furthermore, we establish the existence of optimal controls\nand characterize the first-order necessary optimality conditions through a\nsuitable variational inequality.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QDaxyWKwDI3_L322KQFYf8-MjCyVa3bruI9vA6uFMdc","pdfSize":"437334"}
