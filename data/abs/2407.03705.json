In this\nletter, we propose a learning framework for efficient contact planning in\nreal-time subject to uncertain contact dynamics. We implement our approach for\nthe example task of robot air hockey. Based on a learned stochastic model of\npuck dynamics, we formulate contact planning for shooting actions as a\nstochastic optimal control problem with a chance constraint on hitting the\ngoal. To achieve online re-planning capabilities, we propose to train an\nenergy-based model to generate optimal shooting plans in real time. The\nperformance of the trained policy is validated %in experiments both in\nsimulation and on a real-robot setup. Furthermore, our approach was tested in a\ncompetitive setting as part of the NeurIPS 2023 Robot Air Hockey Challenge.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wEDQJwPho23vWkCopFQqSmUshAHm4sPcNlq9ho7XmuA","pdfSize":"2946222"}
