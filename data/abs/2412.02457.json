To achieve both goals, we employ a mixed-methods approach,\ncombining quantitative data from the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) and\nthe Student Expectations of Learning Analytics Questionnaire (SELAQ) with\nqualitative feedback from a student discussion. Conducted among 25 students\nfrom an engineering school in a Spanish University, the study's data collection\ninvolved a 120-minute workshop. The findings suggest opportunities for\nenhancing the prototype, highlighting the importance of aligning similar\ndigital tools with student needs and preferences for a supportive learning\nenvironment, which can be achieved by leveraging tools such as UEQ and SELAQ.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"EMwIEV8AtK_cnFy5_WYJOA66EmfyMfhdKmdmUl3SHOc","pdfSize":"625665"}
