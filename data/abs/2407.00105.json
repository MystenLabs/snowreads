As the use of medications continues to rise, so does the\nimportance of understanding and mitigating the potential risks associated with\nthem. At present, researchers have turned to data-driven methods to predict\ndrug-side effects. Drug-side effect prediction is a link prediction problem,\nand the related data can be described from various perspectives. To process\nthese kinds of data, a multi-view method, called Multiple Kronecker RLS\nfusion-based link propagation (MKronRLSF-LP), is proposed. MKronRLSF-LP extends\nthe Kron-RLS by finding the consensus partitions and multiple graph Laplacian\nconstraints in the multi-view setting. Both of these multi-view settings\ncontribute to a higher quality result. Extensive experiments have been\nconducted on drug-side effect datasets, and our empirical results provide\nevidence that our approach is effective and robust.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Aj99tTKOgXAEeBwxgmil1z4vI9IR5zEB7mpEayq26BY","pdfSize":"1734014"}
