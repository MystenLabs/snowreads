Each task is characterized by a\ndemand, a profit, and a subpath. Our goal is to select a maximum profit subset\nof tasks such that the total demand of the selected tasks that use each edge\n$e$ is at most the capacity of $e$. Bag-UFP is the generalization of UFP where\ntasks are partitioned into bags, and we are allowed to select at most one task\nper bag. UFP admits a PTAS [Grandoni,M{\\\"o}mke,Wiese'22] but not an EPTAS\n[Wiese'17]. Bag-UFP is APX-hard [Spieksma'99] and the current best\napproximation is $O(\\log n/\\log\\log n)$ [Grandoni,Ingala,Uniyal'15], where $n$\nis the number of tasks.\n  In this paper, we study the mentioned two problems when parameterized by the\nnumber $m$ of edges in the graph, with the goal of designing faster\nparameterized approximation algorithms. We present a parameterized EPTAS for\nBag-UFP, and a substantially faster parameterized EPTAS for UFP (which is an\nFPTAS for $m=O(1)$). We also show that a parameterized FPTAS for UFP (hence for\nBagUFP) does not exist, therefore our results are qualitatively tight.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OXH1TJi4zCx0XK_VI4ZOBDtQj0gqJgnimXrHVCYrb_Y","pdfSize":"421966"}
