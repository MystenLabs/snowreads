  "abstract": "  A simple abelian variety $A$ defined over a number field $k$ is called of\n$\\mathrm{GL}_n$-type if there exists a number field of degree $2\\dim(A)/n$\nwhich is a subalgebra of $\\mathrm{End}^0(A)$. We say that $A$ is genuinely of\n$\\mathrm{GL}_n$-type if its base change $A_{\\overline{k}}$ contains no isogeny\nfactor of $\\mathrm{GL}_m$-type for $m<n$. This generalizes the classical notion\nof abelian variety of $\\mathrm{GL}_2$-type without potential complex\nmultiplication introduced by Ribet. We develop a theory of building blocks,\ninner twists and nebentypes for these varieties. When the center of\n$\\mathrm{End}^0(A)$ is totally real, Chi, Banaszak, Gajda, and Kraso\\'n have\nattached to $A$ a compatible system of Galois representations of degree $n$\nwhich is either symplectic or orthogonal. We extend their results under the\nweaker assumption that the center of $\\mathrm{End}^0(A_{\\overline{k}})$ be\ntotally real. We conclude the article by showing an explicit family of abelian\nfourfolds genuinely of $\\mathrm{GL}_4$-type. This involves the construction of\na family of genus 2 curves defined over a quadratic field whose Jacobian has\ntrivial endomorphism ring and is isogenous to its Galois conjugate.\n",
