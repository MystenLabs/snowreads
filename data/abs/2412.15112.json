For $\\mathcal{G}$ principal or Hausdorff with\n${\\mathcal{G}}^{\\rm{Iso}}\\setminus{\\mathcal{G}}^{(0)}$ discrete, we compute\nHochschild and cyclic homology of $\\mathcal{A}_k(\\mathcal{G})$ in terms of\ngroupoid homology. For any ample Hausdorff groupoid $\\mathcal{G}$, we find that\n$H_*(\\mathcal{G})$ is a direct summand of $HH_*(\\mathcal{A}_k(\\mathcal{G}))$;\nusing this and the Dennis trace we obtain a map\n$\\overline{D}_*:K_*(\\mathcal{A}_k(\\mathcal{G}))\\to H_n(\\mathcal{G},k)$. We\nstudy this map when $\\mathcal{G}$ is the (twisted) Exel-Pardo groupoid\nassociated to a self-similar action of a group $G$ on a graph, and compute\n$HH_*(\\mathcal{A}_k(\\mathcal{G}))$ and $H_*(\\mathcal{G},k)$ in terms of the\nhomology of $G$, and the $K$-theory of $\\mathcal{A}_k(\\mathcal{G})$ in terms of\nthat of $k[G]$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology","Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Operator Algebras","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"GIt_MUegbFdCikjYDWw9c_lkdxsW_fZL4qnAXvjdB80","pdfSize":"701820"}
