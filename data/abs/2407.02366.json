In light of recent advances in\nphotonic quantum technology, it is natural to utilize quantum exponential\nspeedup to scale photonic neural network capabilities. Here we show a\ncombination of classical network layers with trainable continuous variable\nquantum circuits yields hybrid networks with improved trainability and\naccuracy. On a classification task, hybrid networks achieve the same\nperformance when benchmarked against fully classical networks that are twice\nthe size. When the bit precision of the optimized networks is reduced through\nadded noise, the hybrid networks still achieve greater accuracy when evaluated\nat state of the art bit precision. These hybrid quantum classical networks\ndemonstrate a unique route to improve computational capacity of integrated\nphotonic neural networks without increasing the physical network size.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"M89PmX5f6PgsxulnJKmQal6OVqlrU5ohjK6jPwTtk4E","pdfSize":"6034171"}
