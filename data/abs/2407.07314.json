Effectively surveilling illegitimate relay links poses a challenging\nproblem. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can proactively surveil wireless relay\nsystems due to their flexible mobility. This work focuses on maximizing the\neavesdropping rate (ER) of UAVs by jointly optimizing the trajectory and\njamming power. To address this challenge, we propose a new iterative algorithm\nbased on block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation\ntechnologies. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm\nsignificantly enhances the ER through trajectory and jamming power\noptimization.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gYJNIA5w_e3QeZvemR0a4LmjSixBPLESA2NBjJCNhTc","pdfSize":"880949"}
