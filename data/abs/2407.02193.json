The model involves a generalized Caputo derivative in time, and\narises in the mathematical modeling of anomalous diffusion in heterogeneous\nmedia. We prove the unique recovery of a monotone piecewise constant variable\norder and its range for known and unknown media, respectively. The analysis is\nbased on a delicate asymptotic expansion of the Laplace transform of the data\nas $p\\to0$, which is of independent interest.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"CoLgN3Cy2PJXL4yOj0E7-yekAAKce4wnnE3WAwh9vfo","pdfSize":"344110","objectId":"0xe09c4af3ad47eb71e49f929a7166656cd62a3788c5060169edebcd9526894184","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
