  "abstract": "  Let $E$ be an elliptic curve over a quartic field $K$. By the Mordell-Weil\ntheorem, $E(K)$ is a finitely generated group. We determine all the\npossibilities for the torsion group $E(K)_{tor}$ where $K$ ranges over all\nquartic fields $K$ and $E$ ranges over all elliptic curves over $K$. We show\nthat there are no sporadic torsion groups, or in other words, that all torsion\ngroups either do not appear or they appear for infinitely many non-isomorphic\nelliptic curves $E$.\n  Proving this requires showing that numerous modular curves $X_1(m,n)$ have no\nnon-cuspidal degree $4$ points. We deal with almost all the curves using one of\n3 methods: a method for the rank 0 cases requiring no computation; the Hecke\nsieve, a local method requiring computer-assisted computations; and the global\nmethod, an argument for the positive rank cases also requiring no computation.\nWe deal with the handful of remaining cases using ad hoc methods.\n",
