The valuations are classified in terms of their\nbehaviour with respect to dilation using extensions to unbounded polyhedra and\nbasic invariant theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"M2BOVa5G0Oke1k3A0ACPVSOebG9PzK6VqKsWpuswaiI","pdfSize":"549221"}
