  "abstract": "  Generative AI models like GPT-4o and DALL-E 3 are reshaping digital content\ncreation, offering industries tools to generate diverse and sophisticated text\nand images with remarkable creativity and efficiency. This paper examines both\nthe capabilities and challenges of these models within creative workflows.\nWhile they deliver high performance in generating content with creativity,\ndiversity, and technical precision, they also raise significant ethical\nconcerns. Our study addresses two key research questions: (a) how these models\nperform in terms of creativity, diversity, accuracy, and computational\nefficiency, and (b) the ethical risks they present, particularly concerning\nbias, authenticity, and potential misuse. Through a structured series of\nexperiments, we analyze their technical performance and assess the ethical\nimplications of their outputs, revealing that although generative models\nenhance creative processes, they often reflect biases from their training data\nand carry ethical vulnerabilities that require careful oversight. This research\nproposes ethical guidelines to support responsible AI integration into industry\npractices, fostering a balance between innovation and ethical integrity.\n",
