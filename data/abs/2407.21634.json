A merit function is considered, wherein\nthe set of inequality constraints is divided into two groups: one treated with\na logarithmic barrier approach, and another, along with the equality\nconstraints, addressed using a penalization term. This strategy, initially\nproposed in the framework of LOG-DFL [12], is adapted and incorporated into\nSID-PSM [14,15] algorithm, a generalized pattern search method, allowing to\neffectively handle general nonlinear constraints. Under reasonable assumptions\nregarding the smoothness of the functions, convergence is established, without\nany convexity assumptions. Using CUTEst test problems, numerical experiments\ndemonstrate the robustness, efficiency, and overall effectiveness of the\nproposed method, when compared with state-of-art solvers and with the original\nSID-PSM and LOG-DFL implementations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"05spef7BFvFUZFSiKnVjAhyd_P2eHEHtKJ7l_vCtbAo","pdfSize":"849158","objectId":"0x4dca1ab431bc2f9dff692bd6d0e3ce147d75681ca645e78f0f900d37848c5581","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
