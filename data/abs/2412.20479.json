  "abstract": "  We study the soft electric dipole ($E1$) response of deformed halo nuclei\n$^{31}$Ne and $^{37}$Mg using a deformed Woods-Saxon potential, with the\npotential depth adjusted to reproduce empirical separation energy of last\nneutron orbit, i.e., 150 keV for $^{31}$Ne and 220 keV for $^{37}$Mg. The\nconfiguration dependence of the $E1$ strength near the neutron threshold is\npointed out. The halo configurations $[321]3/2$ at $\\beta_2=0.5$ and $[330]1/2$\nat $\\beta_2=0.24$ in $^{31}$Ne contain large amplitudes of halo $p$-shell\norbits, which significantly enhance the threshold strength by several times\ncompared to the non-halo configuration $[202]5/2$ at $\\beta_2=0.32$. In\n$^{37}$Mg, the last neutron configuration is assigned as $[321]1/2$ at a large\ndeformation of $\\beta_2=0.46$, which involves a halo $p$-shell configuration\nthat significantly enhances the soft dipole strength. This enhancement is about\n60\\% larger than that of the $[321]3/2$ configuration in $^{31}$Ne because of\nlarge $p$-shell probability in $^{37}$Mg. Experimental confirmation of the soft\ndipole strength is highly desired to determine the deformation and the\nconfiguration of the last neutron orbits both in $^{31}$Ne and $^{37}$Mg.\n",
