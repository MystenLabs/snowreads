  "abstract": "  We search for transient gamma-ray emission in the energy range from 0.1-300\nGeV using data from the Fermi-LAT telescope in coincidence with magnetar\nflares. For our analysis we look for coincidence with 15 distinct flares from\n11 magnetars using two distinct time windows of $\\pm$ 1 day and $\\pm$ 15 days.\nFor 14 of these flares from 10 magnetars, we do not see any statistically\nsignificant gamma-ray emission. However, we see two gamma-ray flares from one\nmagnetar, namely 1E 1048.1-5937, with combined significance of $5\\sigma$,\nobserved after about 10 days from the peak of the X-ray flare. However, this\nmagnetar is located close to the galactic plane (with galactic latitude of\n-0.52\\degree) and this signal could be caused by contamination due to diffuse\nflux from gamma-ray sources in the galactic plane.\n",
