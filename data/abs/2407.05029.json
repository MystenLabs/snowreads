Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite\ncommunications combined with massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)\ntechnology holds significant promise in offering ubiquitous and seamless\nconnectivity with high data rates. Existing integrated sensing and\ncommunications (ISAC) studies mainly focus on terrestrial systems, while\noperating ISAC in massive MIMO LEO satellite systems is promising to provide\nhigh-capacity communication and flexible sensing ubiquitously. In this paper,\nwe first give an overview of LEO satellite systems and ISAC and consider\nadopting ISAC in the massive MIMO LEO satellite systems. Then, the recent\nresearch advances are presented. A discussion on related challenges and key\nenabling technologies follows. Finally, we point out some open issues and\npromising research directions.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"3FEWMrGSkfum5_j5MHNqUClIZNA55KBbbxykoshTS34","pdfSize":"1640199"}
