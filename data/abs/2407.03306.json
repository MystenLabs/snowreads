This has a canonical duality pairing which we show to be\nnon-degenerate up to homotopy for homotopy $n$-types. As a result this notion\nof duality is reflexive up to homotopy for $n$-types. In particular the same\nproperties hold for $n$-groupoid objects, whose $n$-duals are again\n$n$-groupoids. We study this construction in the context of the Dold-Kan\ncorrespondence and we reformulate the Eilenberg-Zilber theorem, which\nclassically controls monoidality of the Dold-Kan functors, in terms of mapping\ncomplexes. We compute explicitly the 1-dual of a groupoid object and the 2-dual\nof a 2-groupoid object in the category of vector spaces. As the 1-dual of a\ngroupoid object we recover its dual as a $\\mathsf{VB}$ groupoid over the point.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"EdAfbnGYVauImE26kUw6CeqlZPMdFBYcwodvAYcbGBo","pdfSize":"651974"}
