We establish sharp fixed time-time\ndecay estimates for heat semigroups $e^{-t (-\\Delta + a|x|^{-2})}$ in weighted\nLebesgue spaces, which is of independent interest. As an application, we\nestablish:\n  $\\bullet$ Local well-posedness (LWP) in scale subcritical and critical\nweighted Lebesgue spaces.\n  $\\bullet$ Small data global existence in critical weighted Lebesgue spaces.\n  $\\bullet$ Under certain conditions on $\\gamma$ and $\\alpha,$ we show that\nlocal solution cannot be extended to global one for certain initial data in the\nsubcritical regime. Thus, finite time blow-up in the subcritical Lebesgue space\nnorm is exhibited.\n  $\\bullet$ We also demonstrate nonexistence of local positive weak solution\n(and hence failure of LWP) in supercritical case for\n$\\alpha>1+\\frac{2+\\gamma}{d}$ the Fujita exponent. This indicates that\nsubcriticality or criticality are necessary in the first point above.\n  In summary, we establish a sharp dissipative estimate and addresses short and\nlong time behaviors of solutions. In particular, we complement several\nclassical results and shed new light on the dynamics of the considered\nequation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"yPEX1MGHXa5xq3gK7-vBB1z9I37VtaSZIt3wxyWhnao","pdfSize":"408203","objectId":"0x3da6c5271288ea3074d9171b28dc2cd2a723bbe17f9e883c0215b3d75fa95c9c","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
