  "abstract": "  Let $n$-Medvedev's logic $\\mathbf{ML}_n$ be the intuitionistic logic of\nMedvedev frames based on the non-empty subsets of a set of size $n$, which we\ncall $n$-Medvedev frames. While these are tabular logics, after characterizing\n$n$-Medvedev frames using the property of having at least $n$ maximal points,\nwe offer a uniform axiomatization of them through a Gabbay-style rule\ncorresponding to this property. Further properties including compactness,\ndisjunction property, and structural completeness of $\\mathbf{ML}_n$ are\nexplored and compared to those of Medvedev's logic $\\mathbf{ML}$.\n",
