The N-queen problem is a classic problem in combinatorics. We describe a\nvariety of Monte Carlo (MC) methods for counting the number of solutions. In\nparticular, we propose a quantile re-ordering based on the Lorenz curve of a\nsum that is related to counting the number of solutions. We show his approach\nleads to an efficient polynomial-time solution. Other MC methods include\nvertical likelihood Monte Carlo, importance sampling, slice sampling, simulated\nannealing, energy-level sampling, and nested-sampling. Sampling binary matrices\nthat identify the locations of the queens on the board can be done with a\nSwendsen-Wang style algorithm. Our Monte Carlo approach counts the number of\nsolutions in polynomial time.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"JfII-Heg4pTy9qaPhdJnpw261_52DDdRV5PXQJTeKME","pdfSize":"188567","objectId":"0x259ec0090819b1c77b139c8540a1b36c7f276e567e63ed60cccd42900bb3ace0","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
