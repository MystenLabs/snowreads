  "abstract": "  Optimizing neural networks with loss that contain high-dimensional and\nhigh-order differential operators is expensive to evaluate with\nback-propagation due to $\\mathcal{O}(d^{k})$ scaling of the derivative tensor\nsize and the $\\mathcal{O}(2^{k-1}L)$ scaling in the computation graph, where\n$d$ is the dimension of the domain, $L$ is the number of ops in the forward\ncomputation graph, and $k$ is the derivative order. In previous works, the\npolynomial scaling in $d$ was addressed by amortizing the computation over the\noptimization process via randomization. Separately, the exponential scaling in\n$k$ for univariate functions ($d=1$) was addressed with high-order\nauto-differentiation (AD). In this work, we show how to efficiently perform\narbitrary contraction of the derivative tensor of arbitrary order for\nmultivariate functions, by properly constructing the input tangents to\nunivariate high-order AD, which can be used to efficiently randomize any\ndifferential operator. When applied to Physics-Informed Neural Networks\n(PINNs), our method provides >1000$\\times$ speed-up and >30$\\times$ memory\nreduction over randomization with first-order AD, and we can now solve\n\\emph{1-million-dimensional PDEs in 8 minutes on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU}.\nThis work opens the possibility of using high-order differential operators in\nlarge-scale problems.\n",
