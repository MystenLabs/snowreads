  "abstract": "  Motivated to elucidate the nature of quantum phases and their criticality\nwhen entangled with a correlated quantum bath, we study interacting bosons on a\n\"comb lattice\" -- a one-dimensional backbone (system) coupled at its sites to\notherwise independent one-dimensional \"teeth\" chains (bath). We map out the\ncorresponding phase diagram, detailing the nature of the phases and phase\ntransitions. Controlled by the backbone and teeth hopping amplitudes, on-site\ninteraction and chemical potential, phases include a Mott-insulator (MI),\nbackbone (LLb) and teeth (LLp) Luttinger liquids, and the long-range ordered\nincoherent superfluid (iSF). We explore their properties and potential\nrealizations in condensed matter and cold-atom experiments and simulations.\n",
