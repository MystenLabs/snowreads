However, in general, there are\nalmost no theoretical guidelines for its high-performance or optimality. This\npaper focuses on the reservoir computing with the Kuramoto model and\ntheoretically reveals its approximation ability. The main result provides an\nexplicit expression of the dynamics of the Kuramoto reservoir by using the\norder parameters. Thus, the output of the reservoir computing is expressed as a\nlinear combination of the order parameters. As a corollary, sufficient\nconditions on hyperparameters are obtained so that the set of the order\nparameters gives the complete basis of the Lebesgue space. This implies that\nthe Kuramoto reservoir has a universal approximation property. Furthermore, the\nconjecture on {\\it the edge of bifurcation}, which is a generalization of the\nfamous criterion {\\it the edge of chaos} for designing a high-performance\nreservoir, is also discussed from the viewpoint of its approximation ability.\nIt is numerically demonstrated by a prediction task and a transformation task.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"j1KyX6uSljcHctWhM12ZBpJZqKztwaAPym-dVjtEmGk","pdfSize":"3633060","objectId":"0xbfdac67a24b5c97ede80c3710de4dbb2ae8fd6d1125dc50c4097fe2b3b6b166a","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
