This paper deals with operators encountered in an\noperator-theoretic description of metamaterials. First, we introduce an\nindefinite Laplacian and consider it on a compact tubular neighbourhood in\nconstantly curved compact two-dimensional Riemannian ambient manifolds, with\nEuclidean rectangle in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ being present as a special case. As this\noperator is not semi-bounded, standard form-theoretic methods cannot be\napplied. We show that this operator is (essentially) self-adjoint via\nseparation of variables and find its spectral characteristics. We also provide\na new method for obtaining alternative definition of the self-adjoint operator\nin non-critical case via a generalized form representation theorem. The main\nmotivation is existence of essential spectrum in bounded domains.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UReUXCISAUTOLplUJMTmwHoOud0iBo8k2lhXnUSsnxQ","pdfSize":"1701758"}
