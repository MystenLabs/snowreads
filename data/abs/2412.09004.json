  "abstract": "  This paper is concerned with a three-level multi-leader-follower incentive\nStackelberg game with $H_\\infty$ constraint. Based on $H_2/H_\\infty$ control\ntheory, we firstly obtain the worst-case disturbance and the team-optimal\nstrategy by dealing with a nonzero-sum stochastic differential game. The main\nobjective is to establish an incentive Stackelberg strategy set of the\nthree-level hierarchy in which the whole system achieves the top leader's\nteam-optimal solution and attenuates the external disturbance under $H_\\infty$\nconstraint. On the other hand, followers on the bottom two levels in turn\nattain their state feedback Nash equilibrium, ensuring incentive Stackelberg\nstrategies while considering the worst-case disturbance. By convex analysis\ntheory, maximum principle and decoupling technique, the three-level incentive\nStackelberg strategy set is obtained. Finally, a numerical example is given to\nillustrate the existence of the proposed strategy set.\n",
