  "abstract": "  We present JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations of the z=7.152 galaxy system\nB14-65666, as part of the GA-NIFS survey. Line and continuum emission in this\nmassive system (log10(M*/Msol)=9.8+/-0.2) is resolved into two strong cores,\ntwo weaker clumps, and a faint arc, as seen in recent JWST/NIRCam imaging. Our\ndataset contains detections of [OII]3727,3729, [NeIII]3869,3968, Balmer lines\n(HBeta, HGamma, HDelta, HEpsilon, HZeta), [OIII]5007, and weak [OIII]4363. Each\nspectrum is fit with a model that consistently incorporates interstellar medium\nconditions (i.e., electron temperature, T_e, electron density, n_e, and colour\nexcess, E(B-V)). The resulting line fluxes are used to constrain the gas-phase\nmetallicity (~0.3-0.4 solar) and HBeta-based SFR (310+/-40 Msol/yr) for each\nregion. Common line ratio diagrams (O32-R23, R3-R2, Ne3O2-R23) reveal that each\nline-emitting region lies at the intersection of local and high-redshift\ngalaxies, suggesting low ionisation and higher metallicity compared to the\npredominantly lower-mass galaxies studied with the JWST/NIRSpec IFU so far at\nz>5.5. Spaxel-by-spaxel fits reveal evidence for both narrow (FWHM<400 km/s)\nand broad (FWHM >500 km/s) line emission, the latter of which likely represents\ntidal interaction or outflows. Comparison to ALMA [CII]158um and [OIII]88um\ndata shows a similar velocity structure, and optical-far infrared diagnostics\nsuggest regions of high Lyman continuum escape fraction and n_e. This source\nlies on the mass-metallicity relation at z>4, suggesting an evolved nature. The\ntwo core galaxies show contrasting properties (e.g., SFR, M*, gas-phase\nmetallicity), suggesting distinct evolutionary pathways. Combining the NIRSpec\nIFU and ALMA data sets, our analysis opens new windows into the merging system\nB14-65666.\n",
