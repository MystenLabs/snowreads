The model generalizes the Hawkes process by substituting the\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck intensity with a CARMA(p,q) model where the associated state\nprocess is driven by the counting process itself. The proposed model preserves\nthe same degree of tractability as the Hawkes process, but it can reproduce\nmore complex time-dependent structures observed in several market data. The\npaper presents a new model of asset price dynamics based on the CARMA(p,q)\nHawkes model. It is constructed using a compound version of it with a random\njump size that is independent of both the counting and the intensity processes\nand can be employed as the main block for pure jump and (stochastic volatility)\njump-diffusion processes. The numerical results for pricing European options\nillustrate that the new model can replicate the volatility smile observed in\nfinancial markets. Through an empirical analysis, which is presented as a\ncalibration exercise, we highlight the role of higher order autoregressive and\nmoving average parameters in pricing options.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zdhFwAckT-24cpz-SB9w_yMCT2uwKVb76PZl7t8xWdQ","pdfSize":"1262525"}
