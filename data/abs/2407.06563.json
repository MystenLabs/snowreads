Over the past\ndecade, the rapid advancement of photonic technologies and devices has led to\nthe development of a range of novel optical polarizers, opening avenues for\nmany breakthroughs and expanding applications across diverse fields.\nParticularly, two dimensional (2D) materials, known for their atomic thin film\nstructures and unique optical properties, have become attractive for\nimplementing optical polarizers with high performance and new features that\nwere not achievable before. This paper reviews recent progress in 2D material\nbased optical polarizers. First, an overview of key properties of various 2D\nmaterials for realizing optical polarizers is provided. Next, the state of the\nart optical polarizers based on 2D materials, which are categorized into\nspatial light devices, fiber devices, and integrated waveguide devices, are\nreviewed and compared. Finally, we discuss the current challenges of this field\nas well as the exciting opportunities for future technological advances.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eoNE4J_CXEztfb9m_o8X1kx2VvRSRu6FQRfinmMooRw","pdfSize":"3800100"}
