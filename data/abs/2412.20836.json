While\npreviously established as a Galactic SNR, Diprotodon is visible in our new EMU\nand GLEAM radio continuum images at an angular size of 3.33x3.23 deg, much\nlarger than previously measured. At the previously suggested distance of 2.7\nkpc, this implies a diameter of 157x152 pc. This size would qualify Diprotodon\nas the largest known SNR and pushes our estimates of SNR sizes to the upper\nlimits. We investigate the environment in which the SNR is located and examine\nvarious scenarios that might explain such a large and relatively bright SNR\nappearance. We find that Diprotodon is most likely at a much closer distance of\n$\\sim$1 kpc, implying its diameter is 58x56 pc and it is in the radiative\nevolutionary phase. We also present a new Fermi-LAT data analysis that confirms\nthe angular extent of the SNR in gamma-rays. The origin of the high-energy\nemission remains somewhat puzzling, and the scenarios we explore reveal new\npuzzles, given this unexpected and unique observation of a seemingly evolved\nSNR having a hard GeV spectrum with no breaks. We explore both leptonic and\nhadronic scenarios, as well as the possibility that the high-energy emission\narises from the leftover particle population of a historic pulsar wind nebula.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"dJcyAubhpJ3sysB7E9L1ZnKO5PYesLRZDcSRMr4C_jo","pdfSize":"11809721"}
