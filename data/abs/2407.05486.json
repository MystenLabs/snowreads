Our results provide insight\ninto the interaction between stochasticity and biological elements in the\ndynamics of monkeypox transmission. The rigorous mathematical analysis\ndetermines threshold parameters for disease persistence. For the proposed\nmodel, the existence of a unique global almost sure non-negative solution is\nproven. Conditions leading to disease extinction are established. Asymptotic\nproperties of the model are investigated such as the speed of transmission.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gjKzY1D7psohfcTynqaS8J1l9l_ZRlulq6f8dFEJP5Y","pdfSize":"8763327"}
