{"id":"2412.12053","title":"The lack of asymmetry of the Maxwell centroids, and of ocular dominance,\n  in persons with dyslexia","authors":"Albert Le Floch and Guy Ropars","authorsParsed":[["Floch","Albert Le",""],["Ropars","Guy",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2024 18:25:14 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-17","timestamp":1734373514000,"abstract":"  While the existence of an asymmetry between the two Maxwell centroids at the\ncentre of the two foveas recorded using a foveascope, leads to the ocular\ndominance in good readers, the lack of asymmetry in most of the observers with\ndyslexia leads to their non-dominance and their difficulties in reading and\nwriting. Indeed, the lack of asymmetry between the two main roads to the brain,\ni.e. the two optical nerves, leads to perturbations in the brain central\nconnectivity, namely between the two hemispheres inducing too robust\ninterhemispheric visual connections, beyond the critical period of 7-8 years.\nThe symmetrical mirror-connections like b-d (observed for about 60% of children\nwith dyslexia) or the non-symmetrical connections like b-b (35%) induce\nconfusions and duplications in observers with dyslexia but remain erasable\nthanks to pulsed systems (glasses, lamps, screens. . .), using Hebbian\nprocesses in primary cortex synapses. The effect is instantaneous, non-invasive\nand compensates the lack of asymmetry. These systems help most of the observers\nwith dyslexia to overcome their difficulties. The orthoptists and speech\ntherapists can acquire and improve the mechanism to help the children to catch\nup, and perhaps be able to use the foveascope for an early diagnosis with young\nchildren.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wKP4Ez-FSiXl3WMoArkmzpRxPXv4AvbaewV2CqfxijE","pdfSize":"1043590"}
