  "abstract": "  We study the strong approximation of the solutions to singular stochastic\nkinetic equations (also referred to as second-order SDEs) driven by\n$\\alpha$-stable processes, using an Euler-type scheme inspired by [11]. For\nthese equations, the stability index $\\alpha$ lies in the range $(1,2)$, and\nthe drift term exhibits anisotropic $\\beta$-H\\\"older continuity with $\\beta >1\n- \\frac{\\alpha}{2}$. We establish a convergence rate of $(\\frac{1}{2} +\n\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha(1+\\alpha)} \\wedge \\frac{1}{2})$, which aligns with the\nresults in [4] concerning first-order SDEs.\n",
