Such a set exists if\nand only if the graph $G$ is open twin-free and isolate-free; and the minimum\ncardinality of an identifying open code in an open twin-free and isolate-free\ngraph $G$ is denoted by $\\gamma^{{\\rm {\\small IOC}}}(G)$.\n  We study the smallest size of an identifying open code of a graph, in\nrelation with its order and its maximum degree. For $\\Delta$ a fixed integer at\nleast $3$, if $G$ is a connected graph of order $n \\ge 5$ that contains no\n$4$-cycle and is open twin-free with maximum degree bounded above by $\\Delta$,\nthen we show that $\\gamma^{{\\rm {\\small IOC}}}(G) \\le \\left( \\frac{2\\Delta -\n1}{\\Delta} \\right) n$, unless $G$ is obtained from a star $K_{1,\\Delta}$ by\nsubdividing every edge exactly once.\n  Moreover, we show that the bound is best possible by constructing graphs that\nreach the bound.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"COOqdbTFE3UD8V85tnfjgihopnphwHz5E2HcvUK_1tA","pdfSize":"245715","objectId":"0xba7dcf3c40e40f1d2224747ededa2b2ca59a6dd934b0440928ed561633267f14","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
