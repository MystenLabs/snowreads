First, a rapid environment preprocessing method is introduced to\nprovide environmental information for subsequent exploration planning. Then,\nthe whole exploration space is divided into multiple subregion cells, each with\nvarying levels of detail. The subregion cells are capable of decomposition and\nupdating online, effectively characterizing dynamic unknown regions with\nvariable resolution. Finally, the hierarchical planning strategy treats\nsubregions as basic planning units and computes an efficient global coverage\npath. Guided by the global path, the local path that sequentially visits the\nviewpoint set is refined to provide an executable path for the robot. This\nhierarchical planning from coarse to fine steps reduces the complexity of the\nplanning scheme while improving exploration efficiency. The proposed method is\ncompared with state-of-art methods in benchmark environments. Our approach\ndemonstrates superior efficiency in completing exploration while using lower\ncomputational resources.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VIf4-PZr1PZHzGGonUmmJcdvsoL27vYv5G9yJX1xZeA","pdfSize":"2360454"}
