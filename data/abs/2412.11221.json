  "abstract": "  In this article, we investigate the relationship between the shadowing\nproperty of set-valued maps and their associated inverse limit systems. We show\nthat if a set-valued map is expansive and open in the context of set-valued\ndynamics, then certain induced inverse limit systems have the shadowing\nproperty. Additionally, we prove that a continuous set-valued map has the\nshadowing property if and only if some of its induced inverse limit system also\nhas shadowing property. Finally, we establish that the shadowing property of a\nset-valued map is equivalent to the shadowing property of its induced inverse\nset-valued system.\n",
