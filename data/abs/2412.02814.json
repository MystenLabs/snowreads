  "abstract": "  We study the canonical quantization of a massive scalar field on a five\ndimensional, rotating black hole space-time. We focus on the case where the\nspace-time is asymptotically anti-de Sitter and the black hole's two angular\nmomentum parameters are equal. In this situation the geometry possesses\nadditional symmetries which simplify both the mode solutions of the scalar\nfield equation and the stress-energy tensor. When the angular momentum of the\nblack hole is sufficiently small that there is no speed-of-light surface, there\nexists a Killing vector which is time-like in the region exterior to the event\nhorizon. In this case classical superradiance is absent and we construct\nanalogues of the usual Boulware and Hartle-Hawking quantum states for the\nquantum scalar field. We compute the differences in expectation values of the\nsquare of the quantum scalar field operator and the stress-energy tensor\noperator between these two quantum states.\n",
