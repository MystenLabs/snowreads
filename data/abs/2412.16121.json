This study aims to identify which aspects of interaction affect\ncooperation-defection choices. Specifically, we investigate human cooperation\nwithin the Prisoner's Dilemma game, using the Drift-Diffusion Model to describe\nthe decision-making process. We introduce a novel Bayesian model for the\nevolution of the model's parameters based on the nature of interactions\nexperienced with other players. This approach enables us to predict the\nevolution of the population's expected cooperation rate. We successfully\nvalidate our model using an unseen test dataset and apply it to explore three\nstrategic scenarios: co-player manipulation, use of rewards and punishments,\nand time pressure. These results support the potential of our model as a\nfoundational tool for developing and testing strategies aimed at enhancing\ncooperation, ultimately contributing to societal welfare.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"Rm6djI4oVrwLWvozNPKiSOHveb4Lpha0itGWaYXUVWI","pdfSize":"14070173"}
