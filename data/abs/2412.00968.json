Our reconstruction\nalgorithm combines perturbation theory on large scales with a convolutional\nneural network on small scales. We reconstruct the squared potential (that\nsources the non-Gaussian signal) out to $k=0.2\\ h$/Mpc to an accuracy of 99.8%.\nWe cross-correlate this squared potential field with the reconstructed density\nfield and verify that this computationally inexpensive estimator has the same\ninformation content as the full matter bispectrum. As a proof of concept, our\napproach can yield up to a factor of three improvement in the $f_{\\rm NL}$\nconstraints, although it does not yet include the complications of galaxy bias\nor imperfections in the reconstruction. These potential improvements make it a\npromising alternative to current approaches to constraining primordial\nnon-Gaussianity.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"v3LTMAwCBdNCA4B_fnqMaoxqu_T_T9A04W06uze9vvE","pdfSize":"1388957"}
