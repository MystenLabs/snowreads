In the first part of the paper we prove that two\nfinite-dimensional real normed spaces on a finite Gromov-Hausdorff distance are\nisometric to each other. We then study the properties of finite point sets in\nfinite-dimensional normed spaces whose cardinalities exceed the equilateral\ndimension of an ambient space. By means of the obtained results we prove the\nfollowing enhancement of the aforementioned theorem: every finite-dimensional\nnormed space lies on an infinite Gromov-Hausdorff distance from all other\nnon-isometric normed spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"35Z2e0PdZQgNZpNaOGu8cfjCGG7IiinUUzdq1bSP26o","pdfSize":"158079","objectId":"0x24cfc031103dae8d01b5b0ebc5fcb1a84a70c7151c0a82f703989825ccc83488","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
