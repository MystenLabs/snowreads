  "abstract": "  Hyperparameters searches are computationally expensive. This paper studies\nsome general choices of hyperparameters and training methods specifically for\noperator learning. It considers the architectures DeepONets, Fourier neural\noperators and Koopman autoencoders for several differential equations to find\nrobust trends. Some options considered are activation functions, dropout and\nstochastic weight averaging.\n",
