  "abstract": "  Since its foundation in the 1960s, the John D. Fox Superconducting Linear\nAccelerator Laboratory at Florida State University (FSU) pursued research at\nthe forefront of nuclear science. In this contribution, we present recent\nhighlights from nuclear structure and reaction studies conducted at the John D.\nFox Superconducting Linear Accelerator Laboratory, also featuring the general\nexperimental capabilities at the laboratory for particle-$\\gamma$ coincidence\nexperiments. Specifically, we focus on light-ion induced reactions measured\nwith the Super-Enge Split-Pole Spectrograph (SE-SPS) and the CATRiNA neutron\ndetectors, respectively. Some results obtained with the CeBrA demonstrator for\nparticle-$\\gamma$ coincidence experiments at the SE-SPS are presented. A\nhighlight from the first experimental campaigns with the combined\nCLARION2-TRINITY setup, showing that weak reaction channels can be selected, is\ndiscussed as well.\n",
