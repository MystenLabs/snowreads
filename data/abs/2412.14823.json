  "abstract": "  The accidental baryonic symmetry is expected to be broken and required from\nthe observed matter-antimatter asymmetry. The neutron-antineutron oscillating\nsystem is the hallmark of $\\Delta \\mathcal{B} = 2$ models which have the\nbenefits of not inducing proton decay. We study this system in a framework\nallowing the most general couplings to understand how a dark matter candidate\nsuch as the axion may couple to the oscillation. In particular a Rabi resonance\nphenomenon occurs, and this effect is unconstrained for Axion Like Particles\n(ALPs) models. Regarding the QCD axion, its Goldstone nature leads to a robust\nexclusion of the majority of scenarios allowed.\n",
