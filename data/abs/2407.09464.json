As poling periods approach sub-micrometers, backward\nquasi-phase-matching has also been demonstrated, albeit by utilizing pulsed\nlaser drives. The realization of symmetric second harmonic generation,\ncharacterized by counterpropagating pumps, however, has remained elusive\ndespite theoretical predictions. The main challenge lies in achieving strong\nnonlinear coupling with poling period below half the wavelength of the\nsecond-harmonic light. The recent emergence of high-quality ferroelectric\nlithium niobate thin films provides an opportunity for achieving precise domain\ncontrol at submicron dimensions. In this article, we demonstrate reliable\ncontrol of ferroelectric domains in thin film lithium niobate waveguide with a\npoling period down to 370nm, thereby realizing highly efficient continuous-wave\npumped symmetric SHG. This demonstration not only validates the feasibility of\nachieving subwavelength periodic poling on waveguides but also opens new\navenues for leveraging submicron ferroelectric domain structures in integrated\nphotonics and nonlinear optics research.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9358XqB57v2Wa2TmI62bIy755lRwPjXcbYXmURxOARM","pdfSize":"7102578"}
