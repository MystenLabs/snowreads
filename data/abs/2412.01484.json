  "abstract": "  We provide a version of first-order hybrid tense logic with predicate\nabstracts and definite descriptions as the only non-rigid terms. It is\nformalised by means of a tableau calculus working on sat-formulas. A particular\ntheory of DD exploited here is essentially based on the approach of Russell,\nbut with descriptions treated as genuine terms. However, the reductionist\naspect of the Russellian approach is retained in several ways. Moreover, a\nspecial form of tense definite descriptions is formally developed. A\nconstructive proof of the interpolation theorem for this calculus is given,\nwhich is an extension of the result provided by Blackburn and Marx.\n",
