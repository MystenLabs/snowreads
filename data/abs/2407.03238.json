The WS exhibits quantum coherence in the\nenergy eigenbasis at the beginning of a unitary work extraction stage in\npresence of inter-spin anisotropic interaction. We demonstrate that the\nprobability of certain values of stochastic work can be negative, rendering\nitself akin to the quasi-probability distribution found in phase space. This\ncan be attributed to the interference terms facilitated by quantum coherence.\nAdditionally, we establish that coherence can improve the average work in\nfinite time. Subsequently, we compare the work distribution with a standard QOE\noperating between two heat baths. We find that, because of the absence of\nquantum coherence, the probability of stochastic work cannot be negative in a\nstandard QOE.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NDJfUIfTj0iR8drZvJQpX1ApswzAnUNdj-RWJhbQG7g","pdfSize":"555181"}
