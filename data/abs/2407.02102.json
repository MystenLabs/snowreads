Comb.,\nOctober 2023], improving the previous almost linear bound of\n$\\mathrm{O}(n\\log^\\star n)$ [S. Letzter, Separating paths systems of almost\nlinear size, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., to appear], and settling conjectures\nposed by Balogh, Csaba, Martin, and Pluh\\'ar and by Falgas-Ravry, Kittipassorn,\nKor\\'andi, Letzter, and Narayanan.\n  We investigate a natural generalization of these results to subdivisions of\ncliques, showing that every graph admits both a separating system consisting of\n$41n$ edges and cycles, and a separating system consisting of $82 n$ edges and\nsubdivisions of $K_4$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gyIHx3g9dWMkee6cYVX6lK9Af5FOLcq1sEOkdjOWYII","pdfSize":"192437"}
