Our goal is to study the\ndependences of period (frequency) of resonance perturbations and the width of\nthe resonance on mass and orbital eccentricity of perturbing planet and on the\ninitial difference of longitude between test particle and perturbing planet.\nThe main attention is paid to planar restricted three body problem, but some\ncomputations are done for a spatial case.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pkz5l4H4xjPgruRCMw-7sax72RZibIg_XARjq0dtZlY","pdfSize":"485337"}
