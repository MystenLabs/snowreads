For such black holes, an evaporation time of about 1016\nsecs is estimated, indicating that they would survive by far the quark-gluon\nplasma era, namely between 10^-10 and 10^-6 seconds after the big bang. On the\nassumption that the big-bang generated unequal amounts of quark and antiquarks,\nthis suggests that such unbalance might have survived to this day in the form\nof excess antiquark nuggets hidden to all but gravitational interactions. A\nconnection with the saturon picture, whereby minimum viscosity regimes would\nassociate with the onset coherent quantum field structures with maximum storage\nproperties, is also established, along with potential implication for quantum\ncomputing of classical systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XBrmofRhFkJBTSzw0aUI-pxBPm7qw3xnl_H7yVlGDaw","pdfSize":"289036"}
