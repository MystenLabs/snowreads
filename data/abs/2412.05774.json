  "abstract": "  Absolute values of the neutrino mass are not known still now although their\nupper bounds are constrained through several experiments and observations.\nRecent analyses of cosmological observations present severe constraint on the\nsum of neutrino masses. It might suggest an interesting possibility for the\nabsolute values of neutrino mass and their ordering. In this paper, taking it\nas a useful hint, we study possible neutrino models with a zero mass eigenvalue\nfrom a view point of neutrino oscillation data and baryon number asymmetry in\nthe Universe. We focus our study on the seesaw type mass generation by making a\ncertain assumption for origin of right-handed neutrino mass.\n",
