  "abstract": "  One of the fundamental open questions in QFT is what kind of functions appear\nas Feynman integrals. In recent years this question has often been considered\nin a geometric context by interpreting the polynomials that appear in these\nintegrals as defining algebraic varieties. One focal point of the past decade\nhas in particular been the class of Calabi-Yau varieties that arise in some\ntypes of Feynman integrals. A class of manifolds that includes CYs as a special\ncase are varieties of special Fano types. These varieties were originally\nintroduced because the class of CY spaces is not closed under mirror symmetry.\nTheir Hodge structure is of a more general type and the middle cohomology in\nparticular is determined by two integers, the dimension of the manifold and a\ncharge $Q$. In the present paper this class of manifolds is considered in the\ncontext of Feynman integrals.\n",
