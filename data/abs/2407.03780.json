We can apply this result in\nmany settings, in particular obtaining uniqueness of $u$-Gibbs measures for\nevery non-special perturbation of irreducible linear expanding maps of the\ntorus with simple spectrum. This gives new open sets of partially hyperbolic\nsystems displaying a unique $u$-Gibbs measure.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"z6HOUoj-thwnJ8duvl86ctmVhDxSyHHJeJUNfdlKzl8","pdfSize":"525997"}
