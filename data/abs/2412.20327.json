Recently, deep\nlearning-based FVR has gained increased popularity and achieved promising\nperformance. However, the limited size of public vein datasets has caused\noverfitting issues and greatly limits the recognition performance. Although\ntraditional data augmentation can partially alleviate this data shortage issue,\nit cannot capture the real finger posture variations due to the rigid\nlabel-preserving image transformations, bringing limited performance\nimprovement. To address this issue, we propose a novel motion transfer (MT)\nmodel for finger vein image data augmentation via modeling the actual finger\nposture and rotational movements. The proposed model first utilizes a key point\ndetector to extract the key point and pose map of the source and drive finger\nvein images. We then utilize a dense motion module to estimate the motion\noptical flow, which is fed to an image generation module for generating the\nimage with the target pose. Experiments conducted on three public finger vein\ndatabases demonstrate that the proposed motion transfer model can effectively\nimprove recognition accuracy.
