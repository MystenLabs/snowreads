In\nthis paper, we study the pointwise differentials for distributions\ncorresponding to a negative order Sobolev functions. Our main results prove\nBorel regularity, Lusin approximation, rectifiability, and a Rademacher theorem\nfor these pointwise differentials.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3G7oeYsvkxRV5Y4kjYJ4sy25ronXvPDznGs9YJPvmjM","pdfSize":"425259"}
