  "abstract": "  The notion of pointwise differentials for distributions is a way to extract\nlocal information of distributions by rescaling the distribution at a point. In\nthis paper, we study the pointwise differentials for distributions\ncorresponding to a negative order Sobolev functions. Our main results prove\nBorel regularity, Lusin approximation, rectifiability, and a Rademacher theorem\nfor these pointwise differentials.\n",
