  "abstract": "  We present PyAtoms, an interactive open-source software that quickly and\neasily simulates atomic-scale scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images of\ntwo-dimensional (2D) layered materials, moir\\'{e} systems, and superlattices.\nRooted in a Fourier-space description of ideal atomic lattice images, PyAtoms\nis a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) with robust capabilities for\ntuning lattice parameters (lattice constants, strain, number of layers, twist\nangles) and STM imaging parameters (pixels, scan size, scan angle) and provides\ntime estimates for spectroscopic measurements. These capabilities allow users\nto efficiently plan time-consuming STM experiments. We provide an overview of\nPyAtoms' current features, describe its underlying mathematical principles, and\nthen demonstrate simulations of several 2D materials including graphene with\nvariable sub-lattice asymmetry, twisted tri-layer graphene moir\\'{e} systems,\nand charge- and bond-density wave systems (2$H$-NbSe$_2$, 1$T$-TaS$_2$,\nKekul\\'{e}-distorted graphene, K$_{0.3}$MoO$_3$). Finally, we show that PyAtoms\ncan be used as a useful educational tool in entry- and senior-level physics\ncourses.\n",
