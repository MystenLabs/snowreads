The algebraic approach established here also leads us to\nconclude when the gluing of $k$-formal schemes is a $k$-formal scheme. In\naddition, we derive that the gluing of formal schemes is always singular,\nregardless of whether we know the structure of the schemes involved.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"K0wo8Q5G_O4TVEo4oCXIFdsNH-gOABUcxwDUqnIZFD0","pdfSize":"235403"}
