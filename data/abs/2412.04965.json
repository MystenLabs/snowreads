A segment\naccess query finds the segment $(x_1, x_2, y)$ given its $y$-coordinate\n($y$-coordinates of the segments are distinct), a segment selection query finds\nthe $j$th smallest segment (the segment with the $j$th smallest $y$-coordinate)\namong the segments crossing the vertical line for a given $x$-coordinate, and a\nsegment rank query finds the number of segments crossing the vertical line\nthrough $x$-coordinate $i$ with $y$-coordinate at most $y$, for a given $x$ and\n$y$. This problem is a central component in compressed data structures for\npersistent strings supporting random access.\n  Our main result is data structure using $2n\\lg{n} + O(n\\lg{n}/\\lg{\\lg{n}})$\nbits of space and $O(\\lg{n}/\\lg{\\lg{n}})$ query time for all operations. We\nshow that this space bound is optimal up to lower-order terms. We will also\nshow that the query time for segment rank is optimal. The query time for\nsegment selection is also optimal by a previous bound.\n  To obtain our results, we present a novel segment wavelet tree data structure\nof independent interest. This structure is inspired by and extends the classic\nwavelet tree for sequences. This leads to a simple, succinct solution with\n$O(\\log n)$ query times. We then extend this solution to obtain optimal query\ntime. Our space lower bound follows from a simple counting argument, and our\nlower bound for segment rank is obtained by a reduction from 2-dimensional\ncounting.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"AI0t-uQ-S0gZnI6WuOBKVKc_mnLtjz3fF0Br8xJzSc8","pdfSize":"519545"}
