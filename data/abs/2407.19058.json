First, to provide a straightforward\nproof of the Cauchy's invariants (CIs) from the particle relabeling symmetry of\nthe action functional for rotational barotropic flows, using pure geometric\nrelabeling. Second, to emphasize the central role of CIs in the study of\nrotational flows. The first goal is achieved by introducing a new variational\napproach for derivivg invariants from symmetries, which, when applied to the\nLagrangian action of rotational flows, leads to a simple and natural proof of\nCIs. The second goal is clarified by showing that all important conservation\ntheorems of rotational flows, either local or integral, are simple consequences\nof CIs.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1Cb6NtcLTKllzUXFVwTOtRuTej-9drZKvja-aAaurbw","pdfSize":"2047600"}
