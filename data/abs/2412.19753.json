Previously we\nisolated basic classes: powers of prime ultrafilters, and described the pattern\nof an ultrafilter, measuring the quantity of each basic class in a given\nultrafilter. In this paper we define a topology on the set of basic classes\nwhich will allow us to calculate the pattern of the limit of a\n$\\widetilde{\\mid}$-increasing chain of ultrafilters. Using this we characterize\nwhich patterns can actually appear as patterns of an ultrafilter.\n$\\widetilde{\\mid}$ is not antisymmetric; in the respective quotient order we\nidentify singleton classes and consider their patterns.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YkF_QncGLKiERQw0KjorlMx9ScU0Ix46gCLfaBjwIG0","pdfSize":"165184"}
