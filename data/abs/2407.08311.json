Much research has focused\non improving the effectiveness and efficiency of radio frequency fingerprinting\nto maximize its performance in various scenarios and conditions, while little\nresearch examined how to protect devices from being subject to radio\nfingerprinting in the wild.\n  In this paper, we explore a novel point of view. We examine the hostile usage\nof radio frequency fingerprinting, which facilitates the unauthorized tracking\nof wireless devices in the field by malicious entities. We also suggest a\nmethod to sanitize the transmitted signal of its fingerprint using a jammer,\ndeployed on purpose to improve devices' anonymity on the channel while still\nguaranteeing the link's quality of service. Our experimental results and\nsubsequent analysis demonstrate that a friendly jammer can effectively block a\nmalicious eavesdropper from recognizing and tracking a device without affecting\nthe quality of the wireless link, thereby restoring the privacy of the user\nwhen accessing the radio spectrum.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"tgf6l3GwWvkPVIwmrGuxbEHZuKlUFqqS7s44P45hQSA","pdfSize":"1411431"}
