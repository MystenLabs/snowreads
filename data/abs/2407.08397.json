The\nprimary scientific objectives of NOTT include characterizing (i) young\nplanetary systems near the snow line, a critical region for giant planet\nformation, and (ii) nearby main-sequence stars close to the habitable zone,\nwith a focus on detecting exozodiacal dust that could obscure Earth-like\nplanets. In 2023-2024, the final warm optics have been procured and assembled\nin a new laboratory at KU Leuven. First fringes and null measurements were\nobtained using a Gallium Lanthanum Sulfide (GLS) photonic chip that was also\ntested at cryogenic temperatures. In this paper, we present an overall update\nof the NOTT project with a particular focus on the cold mechanical design, the\nfirst results in the laboratory with the final NOTT warm optics, and the\nongoing Asgard integration activities. We also report on other ongoing\nactivities such as the characterization of the photonic chip (GLS, LiNbO3,\nSiO), the development of the exoplanet science case, the design of the\ndispersion control module, and the progress with the self-calibration data\nreduction software.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"UzCocSQunk2S_2p3hODlnqbM0lw1HNw9pkr2qUt6KAw","pdfSize":"3623946"}
