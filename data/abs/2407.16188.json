As an application\nof the theory, we show how purely mechanical driving can produce real photons,\ndepending on the strength and frequency of the periodic coupling rate.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5MbYz0mMe50-uoHzjkwihWNKJ08362xBG6xRhLP4Tfw","pdfSize":"7354557"}
