  "abstract": "  We express holographic thermal correlators using a recurrence relation of\n$\\{a_n\\}$ at $n\\to\\infty$, building on recent advances in the connection\nformula for the Heun equation. We consider two gravitational solutions that\ncorrespond to distinct states in different subsectors of $\\mathcal{N}=4$\nsuper-Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature and density. The first is the\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m-AdS$_5$ black hole, which has finite entropy at zero\ntemperature, and the second is a charged dilatonic black hole in AdS$_5$, which\nhas zero entropy at zero temperature. In both cases, we perturb the system with\na charged scalar field and express the perturbation equation in terms of the\nHeun equation. We find interesting moving patterns of the poles of the\ncorrelators including eigenvalue repulsions. We discuss the relation between\nthe recurrence relation and the Virasoro conformal block as two equivalent\napproaches to write the connection formula for the Heun equation.\n",
