Here, we generally classify Kraus operators and their\neffective non-Hermitian dynamical generators within the 38-fold way, thereby\nestablishing the tenfold classification for symmetry and topology of monitored\nfree fermions. Our classification elucidates the role of topology in\nmeasurement-induced phase transitions and identifies potential topological\nterms in the corresponding nonlinear sigma models. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nthat nontrivial topology in spacetime manifests itself as anomalous boundary\nstates in Lyapunov spectra, such as Lyapunov zero modes and chiral edge modes,\nconstituting the bulk-boundary correspondence in monitored quantum dynamics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zWaY6hXjI88U7LFBH5uE8Imodh6mdF8FTgja4_-xXGc","pdfSize":"2397155"}
