Next to these\ntraditional applications, machine learning methods have also been demonstrated\nto be versatile tools in the analysis of image-like data of quantum phases of\nmatter, e.g. given snapshots of many-body wave functions obtained in ultracold\natom experiments. While local correlation structures in image-like data of\nphysical systems can reliably be detected, identifying phases of matter\ncharacterized by global, non-local structures with interpretable machine\nlearning methods remains a challenge. Here, we introduce the correlator\nTransformer (CoTra), which classifies different phases of matter while at the\nsame time yielding full interpretability in terms of physical correlation\nfunctions. The network's underlying structure is a tailored attention\nmechanism, which learns efficient ways to weigh local and non-local\ncorrelations for a successful classification. We demonstrate the versatility of\nthe CoTra by detecting local order in the Heisenberg antiferromagnet, and show\nthat local gauge constraints in one- and two-dimensional lattice gauge theories\ncan be identified. Furthermore, we establish that the CoTra reliably detects\nnon-local structures in images of correlated fermions in momentum space (Cooper\npairs) and that it can distinguish percolating from non-percolating images.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EklasFjRS93jfZky74Lbp1adXA80coQpF3bLbN0P0Ro","pdfSize":"5440746","objectId":"0xe7afc295f5eaaa956fe4f8ba0dc0e17d524655e919f0fff1255524b59746f6de","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
