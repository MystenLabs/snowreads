Following this scheme we\nderive an analytical expression for the exponentially small bit-flip rate due\nto single photon loss, which shows good agreement with numerical simulations.\nWe also apply our scheme to other perturbations, such as frequency detuning and\nZ gate, and find the corresponding bit-flip rates.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wlDUFAT1yI3BMyhf96sYMwolimtpaH8v9aIKte4bPQ4","pdfSize":"459739"}
