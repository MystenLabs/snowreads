  "abstract": "  In the work \"Generalized approximation spaces generation from\n$\\mathbb{I}_{j}$-neighborhoods and ideals with application to Chikungunya\ndisease, published in \\emph{AIMS Mathematics}, \\textbf{9}(4) (2024),\n10050$-$10077,\" Al-Shami and Hosny introduced a novel approach for generating\ngeneralized neighborhoods through $\\mathbb{I}_{j}$-neighborhoods with ideals,\nsubsequently deriving new methods for generalized approximations based on these\nneighborhoods. However, several errors have been identified in their results,\nconcepts, and methods, along with significant inaccuracies in the provided\nexamples and comparison tables. This paper aims to address and correct these\nerrors, providing counterexamples to illustrate the inaccuracies in the\nproposed results. Furthermore, we correct several flawed proofs and present the\nrevised formulations of these results and concepts. Additionally, we offer\nproperties and clarifications to enhance the understanding of these concepts.\n",
