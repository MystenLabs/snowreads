As Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced to unify\nunderstanding and generation tasks within the textual modality, recent research\nhas shown that tasks from different modalities can also be effectively\nencapsulated within the NTP framework, transforming the multimodal information\ninto tokens and predict the next one given the context. This survey introduces\na comprehensive taxonomy that unifies both understanding and generation within\nmultimodal learning through the lens of NTP. The proposed taxonomy covers five\nkey aspects: Multimodal tokenization, MMNTP model architectures, unified task\nrepresentation, datasets \\& evaluation, and open challenges. This new taxonomy\naims to aid researchers in their exploration of multimodal intelligence.
