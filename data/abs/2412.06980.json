  "abstract": "  The rapid expansion of edge devices and Internet-of-Things (IoT) continues to\nheighten the demand for data transport under limited spectrum resources. The\ngoal-oriented communications (GO-COM), unlike traditional communication systems\ndesigned for bit-level accuracy, prioritizes more critical information for\nspecific application goals at the receiver. To improve the efficiency of\ngenerative learning models for GO-COM, this work introduces a novel\nnoise-restricted diffusion-based GO-COM (Diff-GO$^\\text{n}$) framework for\nreducing bandwidth overhead while preserving the media quality at the receiver.\nSpecifically, we propose an innovative Noise-Restricted Forward Diffusion\n(NR-FD) framework to accelerate model training and reduce the computation\nburden for diffusion-based GO-COMs by leveraging a pre-sampled pseudo-random\nnoise bank (NB). Moreover, we design an early stopping criterion for improving\ncomputational efficiency and convergence speed, allowing high-quality\ngeneration in fewer training steps. Our experimental results demonstrate\nsuperior perceptual quality of data transmission at a reduced bandwidth usage\nand lower computation, making Diff-GO$^\\text{n}$ well-suited for real-time\ncommunications and downstream applications.\n",
