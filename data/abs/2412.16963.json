Many methods represent this structure as a global\nhierarchy, leading to redundant graph structures. To address this,\nincorporating a text-specific local hierarchy is essential. However, existing\napproaches often model this local hierarchy as a sequence, focusing on explicit\nparent-child relationships while ignoring implicit correlations among\nsibling/peer relationships. In this paper, we first integrate local hierarchies\ninto a manual depth-level prompt to capture parent-child relationships. We then\napply Mixup to this hierarchical prompt tuning scheme to improve the latent\ncorrelation within sibling/peer relationships. Notably, we propose a novel\nMixup ratio guided by local hierarchy correlation to effectively capture\nintrinsic correlations. This Local Hierarchy Mixup (LH-Mix) model demonstrates\nremarkable performance across three widely-used datasets.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BlMuVWd0qL2ltVXDYvB7ZoyC_O9cjZvQsBtsss_kfzY","pdfSize":"7293702"}
