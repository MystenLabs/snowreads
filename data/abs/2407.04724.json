This work explores a novel approach by fusing the\nstrengths of likelihood-based and adversarial losses used in generative models.\nAs a result, we propose a likelihood-based generative approach for\nprecipitation downscaling, leveraging the benefits of both methods.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XIqEO5lWqvGiQslNBTEy4CazwN5A0rBcbggNGQ_fmxg","pdfSize":"1304932"}
