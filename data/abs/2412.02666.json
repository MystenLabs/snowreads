We first describe the\nscaling limit of the number of faces along the geodesics. This result enables\nto compare the metric balls for the first passage percolation and the dual\ngraph distance. It also enables to upperbound the diameter of large random\nmaps. Then, we describe the scaling limit of the tree of first passage\npercolation geodesics to the root via a stochastic coalescing flow of pure jump\ndiffusions. This stochastic flow also enables us to construct some random\nmetric spaces which we conjecture to be the scaling limit of random planar maps\nwith high degrees. The main tool in this work is a time-reversal of the uniform\npeeling exploration.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"22d-Pup0Ananh_yZ9tXWHYLDLwOIR3A_QNzaVV47MqM","pdfSize":"1220319"}
