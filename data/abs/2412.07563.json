This approach allows\nus to distinguish different subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT)\nphases and uncover new ones. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate the\npower of this method by identifying strong and weak $Z_2^\\tau\\times Z_2^\\sigma$\nSSPT phases in a tunable tensor network state. Our analysis reveals an\nintrinsic $Z_2$ SSPT phase characterized by its degenerate entanglement\nspectrum. Furthermore, we extend the anomaly indicator to mixed-state density\nmatrices and show that quantum anomalies of subsystem symmetry can persist\nunder both uniform and alternating disorders. This finding establishes a\nconnection between boundary quantum anomalies in pure and mixed states. Our\nwork provides a comprehensive framework for detecting and constructing\ntopological quantum phases protected by subsystem symmetries, offering new\ninsights into these exotic quantum phases.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AMwXfYwXgEzU2NwNBe2gYHErarxEGrvZ2lTYeFKfaTA","pdfSize":"1206471"}
