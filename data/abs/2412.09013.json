  "abstract": "  This study presents a new image super-resolution (SR) technique based on\ndiffusion inversion, aiming at harnessing the rich image priors encapsulated in\nlarge pre-trained diffusion models to improve SR performance. We design a\nPartial noise Prediction strategy to construct an intermediate state of the\ndiffusion model, which serves as the starting sampling point. Central to our\napproach is a deep noise predictor to estimate the optimal noise maps for the\nforward diffusion process. Once trained, this noise predictor can be used to\ninitialize the sampling process partially along the diffusion trajectory,\ngenerating the desirable high-resolution result. Compared to existing\napproaches, our method offers a flexible and efficient sampling mechanism that\nsupports an arbitrary number of sampling steps, ranging from one to five. Even\nwith a single sampling step, our method demonstrates superior or comparable\nperformance to recent state-of-the-art approaches. The code and model are\npublicly available at https://github.com/zsyOAOA/InvSR.\n",
