Without commitment or costly signaling, market failure\ncan occur. Certification intermediaries reduce these frictions by enabling\nsignaling through hard information. This paper focuses on a monopolistic\ncertifier and its impact on equilibrium welfare and certificate design. Key\nfindings show that the certifier provides minimal information, pooling senders\nof varying abilities and leaving low rents for high type senders, which\ntypically disadvantages the receiver. However, when precise information is\ndemanded, the certifier screens the sender perfectly, benefiting the receiver.\nThus, the monopolistic intermediary has an ambiguous effect on market\nefficiency. The results emphasize the importance of high certification\nstandards, which drive low ability senders out of the market. Conditions for\nsuch equilibria are characterized, showing how simple threshold strategies by\nthe receiver induce first-best outcomes. Additionally, the relationship between\nthe characteristics of offered certificates and welfare is identified.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"dLMlisXfL3ojMWhBmcpV3c4vK8mWl5W93Eusdcb9WkI","pdfSize":"434075","objectId":"0x57c4c70018bb8d540378d009c12e4e6db8ad0260a88b519467b5bb714fc75ad9","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
