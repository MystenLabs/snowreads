We use recent developments in the Heun connection\nproblem in black hole perturbation theory arising from Liouville CFT and the\nAGT correspondence. The connection problem is solved perturbatively in an\ninstanton counting parameter, which is controlled in a double-scaling limit\nwhere $\\omega, T \\to 0$ holding $\\omega/T$ fixed. This provides analytic\ncontrol over the emergence of the zero temperature branch cut as a confluent\nlimit of the Heun equation. From the Green's function we extract analytic\nresults for the critical temperature of the holographic superconductor, as well\nas dispersion relations for both gapped and gapless low temperature quasinormal\nmodes. We demonstrate precise agreement with numerics.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ub4V5Z6FT5G4a0-RppS6YLd6bQNLvaA02rVHCY-NT6I","pdfSize":"894505"}
