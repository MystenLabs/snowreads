Even though a high-level comparison between the two approaches in\nterms of their requirements and (dis)advantages is commonly addressed, a closer\ncomparison under similar conditions is not readily available in the literature.\nIn this work, we present a comparison focused on the label topology and\ntraining criterion. We compare two discriminative alignment models with hidden\nMarkov model (HMM) and connectionist temporal classification topology, and two\nfirst-order label context ASR models utilizing factored HMM and strictly\nmonotonic recurrent neural network transducer, respectively. We use different\nmeasurements for the evaluation of the alignment quality, and compare word\nerror rate and real time factor of our best systems. Experiments are conducted\non the LibriSpeech 960h and Switchboard 300h tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UlwE9mLefhRUhQvGa4JAUoJTDmkkwwG5SzCfL7ePrkc","pdfSize":"328712","objectId":"0x255e38b93f49d7b59582d5d36f8437b4a2f26647aeecbddd6b67f1fdf425226b","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
