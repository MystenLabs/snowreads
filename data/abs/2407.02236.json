Five Machine Learning models are built, including Bidirectional\nLSTM, ARIMA, a combination of CNN and LSTM, GRU, and a model built using LSTM\nand GRU algorithms. The models are evaluated using the Mean Absolute Error to\ndetermine their predictive accuracy. Additionally, the paper suggests\nincorporating human intelligence by identifying Superforecasters and tracking\ntheir predictions to anticipate unpredictable shifts or changes in stock prices\n. The predictions made by these users can further enhance the accuracy of stock\nprice predictions when combined with Machine Learning and Natural Language\nProcessing techniques. Predicting the price of any commodity can be a\nsignificant task but predicting the price of a stock in the stock market deals\nwith much more uncertainty. Recognising the limited knowledge and exposure to\nstocks among certain investors, this paper proposes price prediction models\nusing Machine Learning algorithms. In this work, five Machine learning models\nare built using Bidirectional LSTM, ARIMA, a combination of CNN and LSTM, GRU\nand the last one is built using LSTM and GRU algorithms. Later these models are\nassessed using MAE scores to find which model is predicting with the highest\naccuracy. In addition to this, this paper also suggests the use of human\nintelligence to closely predict the shift in price patterns in the stock market\nThe main goal is to identify Superforecasters and track their predictions to\nanticipate unpredictable shifts or changes in stock prices. By leveraging the\ncombined power of Machine Learning and the Human Intelligence, predictive\naccuracy can be significantly increased.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Trading and Market Microstructure","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Yv6Y2Ge-SE-eiPNCDHaArEnbuZ4jcL4jxrGFHyPuUN8","pdfSize":"520803","objectId":"0xae73b6a747a7b9324c3d684f4a0ed7fb2ea21dd04d59c6c3f5f9880091a7f1fc","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
