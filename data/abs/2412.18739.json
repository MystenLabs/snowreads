Recent theoretical study introduces the quantum battery capacity\nthat is defined according to the highest and the lowest energy during the\ncharging and discharging procedures. Here, we present an experimental\nverification of quantum battery capacity and its relationships with other\nquantum characters of battery by using two-photon states. This reveals a\ndistinguished feature of quantum battery capacity and its trade-off\nrelationship with the entropy of the battery state, as well as with measures of\ncoherence and entanglement.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"erw8pUJkYd4uxOn3uOMIGtSDGD9IY4ym5YsGJeibb7s","pdfSize":"1387853"}
