Taking inspiration from a paper by Harary, Hsu and Miller, we find\nan exact formula for the cover number by the graph classes $\\{ G \\mid \\chi(G)\n\\leq f(\\omega(G))\\}$ for an arbitrary non-decreasing function $f$.\n  After this, we establish a chain of inequalities with five cover numbers, the\none by the class $\\{ G \\mid \\chi(G) = \\omega(G)\\}$, by the class of perfect\ngraphs, generalized split graphs, co-unipolar graphs and finally by bipartite\ngraphs. We prove that at each inequality, the difference between the two sides\ncan grow arbitrarily large. We also prove that the cover number by unipolar\ngraphs cannot be expressed in terms of the chromatic or the clique number.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1lARTHiXziOiYtC-ofqOEimPYbWcuo_rNGjslJVxcJ0","pdfSize":"123423"}
