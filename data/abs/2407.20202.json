Such particles are often\nassociated with dark matter, the strong CP problem and the\n$\\left(g-2\\right)_{\\mu}$ anomaly. In this work we investigate limits for masses\nof such particles and their couplings to photons and leptons which can be\nderived from present and future $e^+e^-$ collider experiments and current\n$\\left(g-2\\right)_{l}$ measurements. Our work expands upon previous studies in\nseveral ways, demonstrating that the interplay of both couplings is a decisive\nfactor in this type of analyses.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kVHSyGpUmNd2YP4REFccmlrWvDZZXWu2Wz0y-8yT9e0","pdfSize":"1187637"}
