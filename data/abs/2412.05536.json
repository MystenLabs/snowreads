We developed a pipeline incorporating data\npreprocessing, model inference, and preference-based evaluation, expanding an\ninitial set of 500 clinical cases to 3,000 through controlled augmentation. Our\nmethod combined medical images with clinical observations to generate\nassessments, using Claude 3.5 Sonnet for independent evaluation against\nphysician-authored diagnoses. The results indicated varying performance across\nmodels, with Llama 3.2-90B outperforming human diagnoses in 85.27% of cases. In\ncontrast, specialized vision models like BLIP2 and Llava showed preferences in\n41.36% and 46.77% of cases, respectively. This framework highlights the\npotential of large multimodal models to outperform human diagnostics in certain\ntasks.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FnpNVilQAVFTasjMm0qdP0Hhc_l0mY_etYx0oUvN50U","pdfSize":"852735"}
