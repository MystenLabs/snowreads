  "abstract": "  Guided data visualization systems are highly useful for domain experts to\nhighlight important trends in their large-scale and complex datasets. However,\nmore work is needed to understand the impact of guidance on interpreting data\nvisualizations as well as on the resulting use of visualizations when\ncommunicating insights. We conducted two user studies with domain experts and\nfound that experts benefit from a guided coarse-to-fine structure when using\ndata visualization systems, as this is the same structure in which they\ncommunicate findings.\n",
