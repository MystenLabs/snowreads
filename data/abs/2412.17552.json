  "abstract": "  This study evaluates the performance of TF-IDF weighting, averaged Word2Vec\nembeddings, and BERT embeddings for document similarity scoring across two\ncontrasting textual domains. By analysing cosine similarity scores, the\nmethods' strengths and limitations are highlighted. The findings underscore\nTF-IDF's reliance on lexical overlap and Word2Vec's superior semantic\ngeneralisation, particularly in cross-domain comparisons. BERT demonstrates\nlower performance in challenging domains, likely due to insufficient\ndomainspecific fine-tuning.\n",
