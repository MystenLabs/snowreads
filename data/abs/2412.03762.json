Thus the one-particle state involves in both spin and\ntransversality $t$ (related to chirality), and the spin-spinors are extended to\nthe spin-transverality spinors. The massive spin-$s$ spinors with different\ntransversality can be related by the $SO(5,1)$ symmetry, although the $U(2)$\nLittle group breaks the symmetry explicitly. The three-point massive amplitudes\ncan be fully determined from the $T^\\pm$ and $m$ generators, diagrammatically\ndenoted as the mass insertion and chirality flip, which provide correspondence\nbetween massless ultraviolet and massive chiral-eigenstate amplitudes. Thus the\nmassless on-shell technique can be utilized to construct higher-point tree- and\nloop-level massive amplitudes.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"O21LKLGiFQQjEDmXRk7B68JPbUj6SD_UE_2T-7u0t4M","pdfSize":"662820"}
