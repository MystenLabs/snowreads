  "abstract": "  Dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates are excellent platforms for studying\nsupersolidity, characterized by coexisting density modulation and\nsuperfluidity. The realization of dipolar mixtures opens intriguing new\nscenarios, most remarkably the possibility of realizing a double supersolid,\ncomposed by two interacting superfluids. We analyze the complex excitation\nspectrum of a miscible trapped dipolar Bose mixture, showing that it provides\nkey insights about the double supersolid regime. We show that this regime may\nbe readily probed experimentally by monitoring the appearance of a doublet of\nsuperfluid compressional modes, linked to the different superfluid character of\neach component. Additionally, the dipolar supersolid mixture exhibits a\nnon-trivial spin nature of the dipolar rotons, the Higgs excitation, and the\nlow-lying Goldstone modes. Interestingly, the analysis of the lowest-lying\nmodes allows for monitoring the transition of just one of the components into\nthe incoherent droplet regime, whereas the other remains coherent, highlighting\ntheir disparate superfluid properties.\n",
