  "abstract": "  We give an explicit injective representation of the universal\n$\\mathrm{C}^\\ast$-algebra that is generated by doubly non-commuting isometries.\nThis injectivity allows us to prove that such universal algebras embed\nnaturally into each other and also, when combined with Rieffel's theory of\ndeformation, to show that they are nuclear and to compute their K-theory.\n",
