  "abstract": "  In 2009, R. Siefring introduced a homotopy-invariant generalized intersection\nnumber and singularity index for punctured pseudoholomorphic curves, by adding\ncontributions from curve's asymptotic behavior to the standard intersection\nnumber and singularity index. In this article, we provide a stratification of\nthe moduli space that describes the rate of asymptotic convergence of the\npseudoholomorphic curves. Using this stratification, we provide a more\nintricate characterization of the curves for which these added contribution to\nthe intersection number and singularity index vanishes. In doing so, we prove\nthat the asymptotic contribution to intersection number and singularity index\nvanishes under generic perturbations. This means that in generic situations we\nonly need to consider the usual intersections of the curves.\n",
