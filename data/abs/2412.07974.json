  "abstract": "  We say that a family of $k$-subsets of an $n$-element set is {\\it\nintersecting}, if any two of its sets intersect. In this paper, we study the\nstructure of large intersecting families. Several years ago, Han and Kohayakawa\n(Proc. AMS, 2017), and then Kostochka and Mubayi (Proc. AMS, 2017) obtained\ncertain structural results concerning large intersecting families. In this\npaper, we extend and generalize their results, giving them a conclusive form.\n",
