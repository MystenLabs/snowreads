  "abstract": "  Strong anomalous diffusion is {often} characterized by a piecewise-linear\nspectrum of the moments of displacement.\n  The spectrum is characterized by slopes $\\xi$ and $\\zeta$ for small and large\nmoments, respectively,\n  and by the critical moment $\\alpha$ of the crossover.\n  The exponents $\\xi$ and $\\zeta$ characterize the asymptotic scaling of the\nbulk and the tails of the probability distribution function of displacements,\nrespectively.\n  Here, we adopt asymptotic theory to match the behaviors at intermediate\nscales.\n  The resulting constraint explains how distributions with algebraic tails\nimply strong anomalous diffusion,\n  and it relates $\\alpha$ to the corresponding power law.\n  Our theory provides novel relations between exponents characterizing strong\nanomalous diffusion,\n  and it yields explicit expressions for the leading-order corrections to the\nasymptotic power-law behavior of the moments of displacement.\n  They provide the time scale that must be surpassed to clearly discriminate\nthe leading-order power law from its sub-leading corrections.\n  This insight allows us to point out sources of systematic errors in their\nnumerical estimates.\n  Rather than separately fitting an exponent for each moment we devise a robust\nscheme to determine $\\xi$, $\\zeta$ and $\\alpha$.\n  The findings are supported by numerical and analytical results on five\ndifferent models exhibiting strong anomalous diffusion.\n",
