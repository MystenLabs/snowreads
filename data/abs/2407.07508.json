There are combinatorial studies on the moments of various\ntypes of orthogonal polynomials, including classical orthogonal polynomials,\nLaurent biorthogonal polynomials, and orthogonal polynomials of type \\( R_I \\).\nIn this paper, we study the moments of OPUC from a combinatorial perspective.\nWe provide three path interpretations for them: \\L{}ukasiewicz paths, gentle\nMotzkin paths, and Schr\\\"oder paths. Additionally, using these combinatorial\ninterpretations, we derive explicit formulas for the generalized moments of\nsome examples of OPUC, including the circular Jacobi polynomials and the\nRogers--Szeg\\H{o} polynomials. Furthermore, we introduce several kinds of\ngeneralized linearization coefficients and give combinatorial interpretations\nfor them.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6LjACDUqKci_6JKi6xo4TBDFAXd9BjvXQ_JznNL852I","pdfSize":"350873"}
