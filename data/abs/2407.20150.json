These structures were tied\nto the multiscale structures of star clusters. A similar power-law for the\nmass-size relation of star clusters measured at different scales suggests a\nself-similar structure of star clusters. We used the minimum spanning tree\nmethod to measure the separations between clusters and gas clumps in each\nmassive star-forming region. The separations between clusters, between clumps,\nand between clusters and clumps were comparable, which indicates that the\nevolution from clump to embedded cluster proceeds in isolation and locally, and\ndoes not affect the surrounding objects significantly. By comparing the mass\nfunctions of the ATLASGAL clumps and the identified embedded clusters, we\nconfirm that a constant star formation efficiency of $\\approx$ 0.33 can be a\ntypical value for the ATLASGAL clumps.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dJHZaQj1NNHP091v-bVqzVTsgoZe99Pl-XIt5mKsRkY","pdfSize":"1035496"}
