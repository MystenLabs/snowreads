{"id":"2412.02706","title":"The cosmic timeline implied by the highest redshift quasars","authors":"Fulvio Melia","authorsParsed":[["Melia","Fulvio",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Nov 2024 20:53:07 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-05","timestamp":1732481587000,"abstract":"  The conventional picture of supermassive black-hole growth in the standard\nmodel had already been seriously challenged by the emergence of $\\sim\n10^9\\;M_\\odot$ quasars at $z\\sim 7.5$, conflicting with the predicted formation\nof structure in the early $\\Lambda$CDM Universe. But the most recent {\\it JWST}\ndiscovery of a $\\sim 10^8\\;M_\\odot$ source at $z\\sim 10.1$ argues even more\nstrongly against the possibility that these black holes were created in Pop II\nor III supernovae, followed by Eddington-limited accretion. Attempts at\nresolving this anomaly have largely focused on the formation of seeds via an\nexotic, direct collapse of primordial gas to an initial mass $\\sim\n10^5\\;M_\\odot$ -- a process that has never been seen anywhere in the cosmos.\nOur goal in this {\\it Letter} is to demonstrate that the emergence of these\nblack holes is instead fully consistent with standard astrophysics in the\ncontext of the alternative Friedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker cosmology\nknown as the $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ universe. We show that, while the predicted\nevolution in the standard model is overly compressed, the creation, growth and\nappearance of such high-$z$ quasars fall comfortably within the evolutionary\nhistory in this cosmology, thereby adding considerable observational support to\nthe existing body of evidence favoring it over the standard scenario.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"F_gkVeCJAn2lux01V6jaJ2fGxsygMbLxWd7eJ4k6rEY","pdfSize":"216849"}
