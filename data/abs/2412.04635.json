  "abstract": "  The Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) technique for laser linewidth narrowing is widely\nused by AMO experimentalists. However, achieving a high-performance PDH locking\nrequires substantial engineering experience, which is scattered across\nliterature and often lacks a cohesive control-theory perspective. Excellent\npedagogical papers exist on the theory of the PDH error signal but they rarely\ncover feedback control. General-purpose control theory literature seldom\ndiscuss PDH laser locking specifically. Although excellent PDH review articles\nprovide thorough knowledge and practice on both aspects but they are not\nreader-friendly. We extend prior works by addressing component choice and loop\ntuning using modern tools like a vector network analyzer. We organize\nmultifaceted engineering considerations systematically, grounded in feedback\ncontrol principles. Our target reader is researchers setting up a PDH laser\nlock for the first time; we eschew advanced topics like minimizing residual\namplitude modulation (RAM). Our guidance is illustrated by step-by-step\noptimization of the lock for a 1650 nm ECDL.\n",
