Our approach detects violations of environment safety\nassumptions during the task execution, relaxes the assumptions to admit\nobserved environment behaviors, and acquires new robot skills for task\ncompletion. We demonstrate our approach with a Hello Robot Stretch in a\nfactory-like scenario.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YbLOVgez9nztoOjHsfYXBiZVDAQYb0Qe9Js--tcDR9w","pdfSize":"2498646"}
