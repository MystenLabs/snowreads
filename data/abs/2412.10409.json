  "abstract": "  A method combining denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) with the\nstring method is presented to generate minimum free energy paths between\nmetastable states in molecular systems. It has been demonstrated in recent work\nthat DDPMs at low noise levels can approximate the gradient of the potential of\nmean force, allowing efficient sampling of high-dimensional configurational\nspaces. Building on this insight, it is shown here that DDPM-derived force\nfields accurately generate transition pathways for the analytical Muller-Brown\npotential and for the alanine dipeptide system at some range of noise levels\nfor DDPMs, recovering the transition path and implicitly capturing solvent\neffects in the case of alanine dipeptide.\n",
