  "abstract": "  Automated metrics for Machine Translation have made significant progress,\nwith the goal of replacing expensive and time-consuming human evaluations.\nThese metrics are typically assessed by their correlation with human judgments,\nwhich captures the monotonic relationship between human and metric scores.\nHowever, we argue that it is equally important to ensure that metrics treat all\nsystems fairly and consistently. In this paper, we introduce a method to\nevaluate this aspect.\n",
