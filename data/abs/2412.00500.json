However, this\nprocess has received limited attention due to the scarcity of effective\ncatalysts capable of both plastic degradation and H2 production, such as\ntitanium dioxide (TiO2). In this study, an active catalyst is developed by\nstabilizing the high-pressure orthorhombic phase of TiO2, known as columbite,\nusing a high pressure torsion (HPT) method. This material effectively degrades\npolyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic under light, converting it into\nvaluable organic compounds such as formic acid, terephthalate, glycolic acid,\nand acetic acid. Additionally, it produces a significant amount of H2. The\nfindings show that the high-pressure orthorhombic phase, especially in the\npresence of oxygen vacancies, enhances catalytic H2 production and microplastic\ndegradation by increasing light absorption, reducing electron-hole\nrecombination, and generating hydroxyl radicals. These results highlight the\nsubstantial potential of modified high-pressure TiO2 photocatalysts in\nsimultaneously addressing the plastic waste crisis and the demand for H2 fuel.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"M0QlQ9cgBEBMmlvG5Qz3Gkv7Ex9WSSjTK61jgVLclF0","pdfSize":"1157053"}
