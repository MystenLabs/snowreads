In this work, we explore\nthe potential of improving the capabilities of language models without new\ndata, merely using automated feedback to the validity of their predictions in\narithmetic reasoning (self-training). We find that models can substantially\nimprove in both single-round (offline) and online self-training. In the offline\nsetting, supervised methods are able to deliver gains comparable to preference\noptimization, but in online self-training, preference optimization shows to\nlargely outperform supervised training thanks to superior stability and\nrobustness on unseen types of problems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"B7XfEWV1qzrWNviStQL4-uvAbY2hzEsFRe55Y7feLHg","pdfSize":"434509","objectId":"0x72b0421365b579c06d32f4a3a4c59662bfca9f0c554ff03591784888e3efbf61","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
