We consider\ntwo types of modifications. The first is a phenomenological action based on the\nobservation that LQG tells us that areas of two-surfaces are operators in\nquantum geometry and are bounded from below. This leads us to a string action\nwhich is similar to that of bimetric gravity. We provide formulations of the\nbimetric string for both the Nambu-Goto (second order) and Polyakov (first\norder) formulations. We explore the classical solutions of this action and its\nquantization and relate it to the conventional string solutions.\n  The second is an action in which the background geometry is described in\nterms of the pullback of the connection which describes the bulk geometry to\nthe worldsheet. The resulting action is in the form of a gauged sigma model,\nwhere the spacetime co-ordinates are now vectors which transform under\n$ISO(D,1)$. We find that for the particular case of a constant background\nconnection the action reduces to the bimetric action discussed above. We\ndiscuss classical solutions and quantization strategies for this action and its\nimplications for the broader program of unifying string theory and loop quantum\ngravity.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"wMI752RBvUQru1r2q8jPG8VhuExnmQOXp2PRbYUpwFg","pdfSize":"440325"}
