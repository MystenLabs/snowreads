In this work,\ninspired by the success of message passing on graphs, we propose a synchronous\ndiffusion process which we use as regularisation to achieve smoothness in\nnon-rigid 3D shape matching problems. The intuition of synchronous diffusion is\nthat diffusing the same input function on two different shapes results in\nconsistent outputs. Using different challenging datasets, we demonstrate that\nour novel regularisation can substantially improve the state-of-the-art in\nshape matching, especially in the presence of topological noise.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9WCWw3rwbkt1LPJi2qNQAKVE8Yixev9dDI3qDlF8sRc","pdfSize":"13044163"}
