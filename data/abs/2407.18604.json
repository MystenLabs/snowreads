Essentially, the idea is\nengrafting multidimensional models into Big Data analytics processes to gain\ninto expressive power of the overall discovery task. ClustCube is a\nstate-of-the-art model that combines OLAP and Clustering, thus delving into\npractical and well-understood advantages in the context of real-life\napplications and systems. In this paper, we show how ClustCube can effectively\nand efficiently realizing nice tools for supporting Multidimensional Big Data\nAnalytics, and assess these tools in the context of real-life research\nprojects.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wT7rJzZalJHccMD8ByJIpPmv07f2e9-jmJkY7iJJnyo","pdfSize":"713554"}
