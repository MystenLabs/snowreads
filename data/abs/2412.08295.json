The study employs HNN-extensions as a key tool for decomposing and\nanalysing these algebras.\n  Building on a previous work on Koszul Lie algebras (\"Kurosh theorem for\ncertain Koszul Lie algebras\", S. Blumer), this paper also deals with Bloch-Kato\nLie algebras, which constitute a distinguished subclass of that of Koszul Lie\nalgebras where all subalgebras generated by elements of degree $1$ have a\nquadratic presentation.\n  It is shown that Bloch-Kato Lie algebras satisfy a version of the Levi\ndecomposition theorem and that they satisfy the Toral Rank Conjecture. Two new\nfamilies of such Lie algebras are introduced, including all graded Lie algebras\ngenerated in degree $1$ and defined by two quadratic relations.\n  Throughout the paper, we show many properties of right-angled Artin graded\n(RAAG) Lie algebras, which form a large class of Koszul Lie algebras.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qWfn87SiQv1o07OoEsYk97ojuB-jygiz5mX6xHaKjnM","pdfSize":"361059"}
