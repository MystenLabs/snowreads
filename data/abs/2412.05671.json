These physical properties are\nof paramount importance to understand how stars are born, live, and die in the\nuniverse near and far. This chapter discusses the basic concepts used by\nastronomers to derive key information about stars from the light they emit. We\npresent through a pedagogical approach the methods required for determining\nstellar brightness (apparent and absolute magnitudes), surface temperature (via\nblack-body radiation and spectral classification), and distance (using parallax\nand standard candles). We finally review techniques for estimating stellar mass\nand radius, including the use of binary star systems and stellar evolution\nmodels.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ej8wAa883G3WgNG82PwHmPnyHMHYfjtrHY7bG1qqaoc","pdfSize":"4779597"}
