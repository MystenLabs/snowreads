Transcriptomic profiling provides a\ncomprehensive reflection of phenotypic changes in cellular responses to\nexternal perturbations. In this paper, we propose XTransferCDR, a novel\ngenerative framework designed for feature decoupling and transferable\nrepresentation learning across domains. Given a pair of perturbed expression\nprofiles, our approach decouples the perturbation representations from basal\nstates through domain separation encoders and then cross-transfers them in the\nlatent space. The transferred representations are then used to reconstruct the\ncorresponding perturbed expression profiles via a shared decoder. This\ncross-transfer constraint effectively promotes the learning of transferable\ndrug perturbation representations. We conducted extensive evaluations of our\nmodel on multiple datasets, including single-cell transcriptional responses to\ndrugs and single- and combinatorial genetic perturbations. The experimental\nresults show that XTransferCDR achieved better performance than current\nstate-of-the-art methods, showcasing its potential to advance phenotypic drug\ndiscovery.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PXHMgGo_15nMMt3xiueGlaZgOm2KD1rm2nzODA5iviY","pdfSize":"17332021"}
