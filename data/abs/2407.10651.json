Previous works suggest that such a\nfunction should mimic the target one, but no theoretical evidence is provided.\nThis paper fills both the gaps: it proves that a scaling function reflecting\nthe target one may lead to enhanced approximation accuracy, and it provides a\nuser-independent tool for learning the scaling function by means of\nDiscontinuous Neural Networks ({\\delta}NN), i.e., NNs able to deal with\npossible discontinuities. Numerical evidence supports our claims, as it shows\nthat the key features of the target function can be clearly recovered in the\nlearned scaling function.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KRdg86q-r48AG4V4m2pU_d1ykQ_Ojiq4z3udHx9vIsc","pdfSize":"1752235","objectId":"0x7419eab685c342c6941f0e230b15675936a11223f104c8b1ed43096a61e8fe64","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
