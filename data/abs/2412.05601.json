It relies on a watershed\nsegmentation algorithm to effectively detect magnetic clumps within\nmagnetograms, which are then associated across successive frames to follow the\nmotion of magnetic structures in the photosphere. Here, we study its\nreliability in detecting and tracking features under different noise conditions\nstarting with real-world data observed with SDO/HMI and followed with\nsimulation data obtained from the Bifrost numerical code to better replicate\nthe movements and shape of actual magnetic structures observed in the Sun's\natmosphere within a controlled noise environment.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"saM4get6THgg2DMsIhy2sHyTKnkXweICGvhaTsrifbQ","pdfSize":"317824"}
