  "abstract": "  A matrix is totally positive if all of its minors are positive. This notion\nof positivity coincides with the type A version of Lusztig's more general total\npositivity in reductive real-split algebraic groups. Since skew-symmetric\nmatrices always have nonpositive entries, they are not totally positive in the\nclassical sense. The space of skew-symmetric matrices is an affine chart of the\northogonal Grassmannian $\\mathrm{OGr}(n,2n)$. Thus, we define a skew-symmetric\nmatrix to be totally positive if it lies in the totally positive orthogonal\nGrassmannian. We provide a positivity criterion for these matrices in terms of\na fixed collection of minors, and show that their Pfaffians have a remarkable\nsign pattern. The totally positive orthogonal Grassmannian is a CW cell complex\nand is subdivided into Richardson cells. We introduce a method to determine\nwhich cell a given point belongs to in terms of its associated matroid.\n",
