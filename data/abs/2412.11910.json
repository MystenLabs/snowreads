We study a fixed-target experiment leveraging the neutrino\nbeams and a forward detector pointing at the interaction point of the muon\ncollider. The sensitivity to neutrino self-interactions is analyzed as a\nfeasibility study, focusing on the leptonic scalar $\\phi$ exclusively coupled\nto the Standard Model neutrinos. Our work shows that projections from both the\nmain and forward detectors can enhance the existing limits by two orders of\nmagnitude, surpassing other future experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Y-bTMvl7QLXKjlPpUA1S0gEhu6gQOlNagJoDv_unBJY","pdfSize":"2468267"}
