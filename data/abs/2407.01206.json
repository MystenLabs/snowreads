The walker moves symmetrically apart from\nsome randomly chosen sites where we impose random drift. We prove annealed\nlimit theorems for the time the walk spends in its favourite sites in two\ncases. The first one, in which it is the distribution of the drift that\ndetermines the limiting behaviour of the walk, is a generalization of known\nresults for a random walk in i.i.d. random environment. In the second case a\nnew behaviour appears, caused by the sparsity of the environment.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"V_B_Y6ImAxb3hVlU4UGwYOKQ0zLJkztwrrc7hBcpo6c","pdfSize":"577293"}
