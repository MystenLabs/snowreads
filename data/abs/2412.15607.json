  "abstract": "  Internet of Things (IoT) devices in smart grids enable intelligent energy\nmanagement for grid managers and personalized energy services for consumers.\nInvestigating a smart grid with IoT devices requires a simulation framework\nwith IoT devices modeling. However, there lack comprehensive study on the\nmodeling of IoT devices in smart grids. This paper investigates the IoT device\nmodeling of a thermostatic load and implements the recurrent neural networks\nmodel for short-term load forecasting in this IoT-based thermostatic load. The\nrecurrent neural network structure is leveraged to build a load forecasting\nmodel on temporal correlation. The temporal recurrent neural network layers\nincluding long short-term memory cells are employed to learn the data from both\nthe simulation platform and New South Wales residential datasets. The\nsimulation results are provided for demonstration.\n",
