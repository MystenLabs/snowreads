This implies that ultra-violet\nsearches can be used to investigate ALPs in the multi-eV mass range. We use\narchival data from the Hubble Space Telescope between 110 and 170 nm to\nconstrain ALPs with mass between 14.4-22.2 eV. We consider observations of a\nset of dwarf spheroidal galaxies and galaxy clusters and assume the ALP density\nin these objects to follow their dark matter density. The derived limit on the\nALP-photon coupling $g_{a\\gamma}$ excludes values above $10^{-12}~{\\rm\nGeV}^{-1}$ over the whole mass range and surpasses previous limits by over one\norder of magnitude.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"xbs0ugr5ErbVwqkE_qJZTT1RuqhCeL-cGBU0zneTQXQ","pdfSize":"603706"}
