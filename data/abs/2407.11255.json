The traditional\napproach of stacking refractive lenses to achieve this functionality results in\nan expensive, heavy optical system. Especially for applications in the\nmid-infrared, light weight and compact form factor are required. In this work,\nwe use a meta-optic triplet to demonstrate zoom imaging at mid-wave infrared\nwavelengths. By varying the axial distances between the optics, the meta-optic\ntriplet achieves high quality imaging over a zoom range of 5x, with 50$^\\circ$\nfull field of view in the widest configuration and an aperture of 8 mm. This\ntriplet system demonstrates the potential for meta-optics to reduce\nconventional components in complex and multi-functional imaging systems to\ndramatically thinner and lighter components.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lWyptPe5gZMncJivm0yCe8Hzq3F2qhK_OfcIz4nPIHg","pdfSize":"4412659"}
