Consequently,\nstars with $\\lesssim 8$ solar masses become red giants, while those with\n$\\gtrsim 8$ solar masses evolve into red supergiants. However, the physics\ndriving this extreme expansion is unclear. This letter presents a new mechanism\ngrounded in the instability of stellar envelopes to explain the expansion. If\nthe gravitational energy released by core contraction can trigger the initial\nexpansion to a critical radius where the envelope becomes unstable, the star\nthen continues expanding until stabilizing, thereby becoming a red giant or\nsupergiant. We demonstrate that the envelope instability can explain several\nelusive features in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, such as the Hertzsprung\ngap between the main sequence and the red giant branch, as well as the\ndichotomy of the supergiant populations in red and blue.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"F1YETMspQQAHH1QM3H71tqdoAKoqtnEuRJUiZ3fuqZM","pdfSize":"12738632","objectId":"0x9b086bd96375e31d4ff5d6875eef2550812a5884c1b2f3f6f1747bb147dcb045","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
