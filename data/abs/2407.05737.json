This paper reports a simple geometric model to evaluate the\nvisibility of the effect and its application to published CCD photometry on\nglobular cluster systems of three spiral galaxies, M31, M33, and NGC253. The\ncolor difference of globular cluster systems due to differential reddening was\nconfirmed for M31 and NGC253; however, the data for M33 were insufficient. The\nanalysis reaffirms the currently adopted interpretation that the side on the\nminor axis of the galactic disk, where more conspicuous dust features and\ninterstellar reddening are visible, is the nearer side to us and provides an\nadditional basis for using spiral galaxies with identified spiral windings,\nS-wise or Z-wise, to study the large-scale spin distribution of galaxies in the\nuniverse.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fiFy-IP5tH6VbIGviVzu9jwSDhmOZj4VLSRTKR_F8iQ","pdfSize":"550449"}
