In the formal setting\ninvestigated here, stochastic versions of the Serre-Green- Nagdi, Boussinesq\nand classical shallow water wave models are obtained through an asymptotic\nexpansion, which is similar to the one operated in the deterministic setting.\nHowever, modified advection terms emerge, together with advection noise terms.\nThese terms are well-known features arising from the LU formalism, based on\nmomentum conservation principle.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hTfE2kWMh8jBHi5_2K5Mn2hxMRzD6LlV9ac-tbH6pHQ","pdfSize":"2156666"}
