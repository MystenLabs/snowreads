  "abstract": "  The global food system provides the energy that supports human metabolism,\nwith complex spatial interdependencies between food production, transformation,\nand consumption. Empirical food system data for these global processes are\noften fragmented and inconsistent, with only certain components captured in\nspatially resolved formats. Here we propose a flexible approach to allocating\ncountry-level food system data subnationally. We estimate the spatial patterns\nof food energy production and supply, which we compare to estimates of human\nmetabolism based on average body size. We downscale these rates onto a\none-degree resolution grid with 95 corresponding food types to derive an\ninternally consistent, energy-conserving, and spatially resolved dataset. We\nshow that national food supply varies linearly with metabolism per capita, with\nabout half the variation in food supply explained by metabolic rates. Our data\nprocessing pipeline is openly available and can readily incorporate new inputs\nin order to advance trans-disciplinary food system modeling efforts.\n",
