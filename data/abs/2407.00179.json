We\npropose this as a new standard for data-parallel sci-vis rendering, describe\ntwo different implementations of this paradigm, and use multiple sample\nintegrations into existing apps to show how easy it is to adopt this paradigm,\nand what can be gained from doing so.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zT7k_6ENGBPOvLQIyBWD3BoMFXpnNVenj4afTk75l6Q","pdfSize":"45224714"}
