Conventionally, the focus has been on minimizing error probability\nin quantum state discrimination tasks. However, another criterion known as\nquantum guesswork has emerged as a crucial measure in assessing the\ndistinguishability of non-orthogonal quantum states, when we are allowed to\nquery a sequence of states. In this paper, we generalize well known properties\nin the classical setting that are relevant for the guessing problem.\nSpecifically, we establish the pre and post Data Processing Inequalities. We\nalso derive a more refined lower bound on quantum guesswork.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4P0vGs5BPb38-pId0WaJiJ3k1XEW67TqnWYnerMlcD0","pdfSize":"153162"}
