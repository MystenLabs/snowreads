  "abstract": "  The bilayer structure of recently discovered high-temperature superconducting\nnickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ provides a new platform for investigating\ncorrelation and superconductivity. Starting from a bilayer Hubbard model, we\nshow that there is a molecular Mott insulator limit forming by the bonding band\nowing to Hubbard interaction and large interlayer coupling. This molecular Mott\ninsulator becomes self-doped from electrons transferred to the antibonding\nbands at a weaker interlayer coupling strength. The self-doped molecular Mott\ninsulator is similar to the doped Mott insulator studied in cuprates. We\npropose La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a self-doped molecular Mott insulator, whose\nmolecular Mott limit is formed by two nearly degenerate antisymmetric\n$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. Partial occupation of higher energy\nsymmetric $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital leads to self-doping, which may be responsible\nfor high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.\n",
