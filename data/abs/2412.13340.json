  "abstract": "  We study the problem of fair cake-cutting where each agent receives a\nconnected piece of the cake. A division of the cake is deemed fair if it is\nequitable, which means that all agents derive the same value from their\nassigned piece. Prior work has established the existence of a connected\nequitable division for agents with nonnegative valuations using various\ntechniques. We provide a simple proof of this result using Sperner's lemma. Our\nproof extends known existence results for connected equitable divisions to\nsignificantly more general classes of valuations, including nonnegative\nvaluations with externalities, as well as several interesting subclasses of\ngeneral (possibly negative) valuations.\n",
