The model\nincorporates the interaction between the UAV, UGV, and a winch, allowing for\ndynamic tether adjustments based on the relative motion of the robots. The\naccuracy and reliability of the simulator are assessed through extensive\nexperiments, including comparisons with real-world experiment, to evaluate its\nability to reproduce the complex tether dynamics observed in physical\ndeployments. The results demonstrate that the simulation closely aligns with\nreal-world behavior, particularly in constrained environments where tether\neffects are significant. This work provides a validated tool for studying\ntethered robotic systems, offering valuable insights into their motion dynamics\nand control strategies.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"IMzAm1PO7lEvA5lPXIiq_VBIMJZ2Bv4Dqk319jvaTD0","pdfSize":"4055527"}
