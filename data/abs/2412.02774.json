The impact of shear\nintensity on domain growth is investigated, with a focus on how shear primarily\ndistorts the domains, leading to the formation of anisotropic structures. The\nstructural anisotropy is quantified by evaluating domain sizes along the flow\nand shear direction. The rheological properties of the system is studied in\nterms of shear stress and excess viscosity. At low shear rates, the system\nbehaves like a Newtonian fluid. However, the strong-shear case is marked by a\ntransition characterized by non-Newtonian behavior.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qwCeVLy-bssycz9djTduMnEYE8qDLH2LOgdtTbdLbQQ","pdfSize":"3037136"}
