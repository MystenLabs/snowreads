  "abstract": "  Ordered phases of matter have close connections to computation. Two prominent\nexamples are spin glass order, with wide-ranging applications in machine\nlearning and optimization, and topological order, closely related to quantum\nerror correction. Here, we introduce the concept of topological quantum spin\nglass (TQSG) order which marries these two notions, exhibiting both the complex\nenergy landscapes of spin glasses, and the quantum memory and long-range\nentanglement characteristic of topologically ordered systems. Using techniques\nfrom coding theory and a quantum generalization of Gibbs state decompositions,\nwe show that TQSG order is the low-temperature phase of various quantum LDPC\ncodes on expander graphs, including hypergraph and balanced product codes. Our\nwork introduces a topological analog of spin glasses that preserves quantum\ninformation, opening new avenues for both statistical mechanics and quantum\ncomputer science.\n",
