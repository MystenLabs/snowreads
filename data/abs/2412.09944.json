  "abstract": "  Subradiance shows promising applications in quantum information, yet its\nrealization remains more challenging than superradiance due to the need to\nsuppress various decay channels. This study introduces a state space within a\nsingle-excitation basis with perfect subradiance and genuine multipartite\nquantum entanglement resources for the all-to-all case. Utilizing the quantum\njump operator method, we also provide an analytical derivation of the system's\nsteady final state for any single-excitation initial state. Additionally, we\ndetermine the approximate final state in the quasi-all-to-all coupling\nscenario. As an illustrative example, we evaluate the coupling and dynamical\nproperties of emitters in a photonic crystal slab possessing an ultra-high\nquality bound state in the continuum, thereby validating the efficacy of our\ntheoretical approach. This theoretical framework facilitates the analytical\nprediction of dynamics for long-lived multipartite entanglement while\nelucidating a pathway toward realizing autonomous subradiance in atomic\nsystems.\n",
