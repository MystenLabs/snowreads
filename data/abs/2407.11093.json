We demonstrate the network's\ncapability to perform NFT and INFT for a random mix of NFDM-QAM signals. The\nnetwork transformations (NFT and INFT) exhibit true characteristics of these\ntransformations; they are significantly different for low and high-power input\npulses. The network shows adequate accuracy with an RMSE of 5e-3 for forward\nand 3e-2 for inverse transforms. We further show that the trained network can\nbe used to perform general nonlinear Fourier transforms on arbitrary pulses\nbeyond the training pulse types.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"biegDfsKFUIe_0hQXeJyXssn7PmGV5X0b462ywxdOoI","pdfSize":"1516604"}
