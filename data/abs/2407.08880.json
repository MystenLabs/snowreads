Although many aspects of its theory have been\ninvestigated in linear systems, this phenomenon remains novel in nonlinear\nmodels. In the first step of this paper, we look at the conditions for the\npresence of quasi-skin modes in a semi-infinite, one-dimensional, nonlinear,\nnonreciprocal lattice. In the following phase, we explore the survival time of\nthe quasi-skin mode in a finite nonlinear lattice with open edges. We study the\ndependency of the survival time on the system's parameters and demonstrate how\nthe nonreciprocity of the system affects the survival time. This study\nintroduces a method for achieving a stable localized state in a nonlinear\nfinite lattice.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"o04arXHSvJfJSFzP4MYucCrlkH2LN-STD2Ijq4GNKCs","pdfSize":"1546583","objectId":"0x8149b82dbbda3048553e3c9f674fbc23cb75988993a24b069cb4f500623d7ff2","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
