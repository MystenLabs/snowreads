  "abstract": "  Effect of an oscillatory decay of the charge density in concentrated ionic\nsolutions and ionic liquids on the double-layer capacitance is studied in a\nframework of a mesoscopic theory. Only Coulomb and steric forces between the\nions that are present in all ionic systems are taken into account. We show that\nthe charge oscillations lead to a rescaled distance between the electrode and\nthe virtual monolayer of counterions in the Helmholtz capacitance, and the\nscaling factor depends on the period of the charge oscillations.\n  Our very simple formula for large density of ions and small voltage can serve\nas a reference point for the double layer capacitance in concentrated ionic\nsolutions and ionic liquids, and can help to disentangle the universal and\nspecific contributions to the capacitance in particular systems.\n",
