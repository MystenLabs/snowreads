Inflation is a phase of accelerated expansion of the\nUniverse, preceding the so-called Standard Model of Big Bang cosmology,\nintroduced to solve some shortcomings of this model. It also provides a\nmechanism for the emergence of primordial inhomogeneities by amplification of\ninitial quantum fluctuations. Inflation is followed by a 'reheating' period, in\nwhich most particles are expected to be generated and reach thermal\nequilibrium, setting the stage for the standard Big Bang of cosmology. During a\n'preheating' period, this creation proceeds partly by parametric excitation of\nresonant modes of the matter fields initially in their vacuum, a genuine\nquantum process. The physics of both situations, inflation and preheating, is\nthat of a strong classical field acting on a quantum field to produce entangled\n(quasi-)particles. When the classical source is the space-time metric itself,\nas in inflation, we are in the framework of Quantum Field Theory in Curved\nSpace-time (QFTCS). The evolution of the generated quantum correlations is the\ntopic of this PhD.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"q2icbL_XkVF5nr6gQUL1Ay48sTNzEUoC5dH2IplZ6IY","pdfSize":"10700416"}
