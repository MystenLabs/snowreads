In particular, we discuss a junction\nwhere optical measurements of photon flux are complemented with simultaneous\ntransport measurements of electron currents. Theory of two-dimensional\nspectroscopy in both fluxes is developed employing non-self-consistent\nnonequilibrium Green's function formulation. Theoretical derivations are\nillustrated with numerical simulations within generic junction model.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uYzEnLNkGFmeh-iua4LcKCTGTV4MUsFwsr8rMuTdTYw","pdfSize":"1861258"}
