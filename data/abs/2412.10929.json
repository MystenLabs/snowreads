These experiments are natural meeting point for research fields of\noptical spectroscopy and molecular electronics. We present a pedagogical\ncomparison between perturbation theory expansion of standard nonlinear optical\nspectroscopy and (non-self-consistent) perturbative diagrammatic formulation of\nthe nonequilibrium Green's functions method (NEGF is widely used in molecular\nelectronics) indicating their similarities and differences. Comparing the two\napproaches we argue that optical spectroscopy of open quantum systems has to be\nanalyzed within the more general Green's function formulation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zQQQTZhcdsz0OhSB10xgDF3yZ5iVVvBjrKKwlV1Ben4","pdfSize":"941003"}
