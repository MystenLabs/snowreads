  "abstract": "  Path integral control is an effective method in cancer drug treatment,\nproviding a structured approach to handle the complexities and unpredictability\nof tumor behavior. Utilizing mathematical principles from physics, this\ntechnique optimizes drug delivery in environments influenced by randomness. It\ntakes into account the intricate interactions between cancer cells, healthy\ntissues, and the immune system, as well as factors such as patient-specific\ncharacteristics and tumor diversity. Path integral control offers tailored\nsolutions to these issues, enabling the design of drug dosing regimens that\nenhance therapeutic effectiveness while minimizing side effects. Its\nflexibility makes it a valuable tool in creating personalized, precision-driven\ntherapies, ultimately improving patient outcomes in cancer treatment. In this\npaper we give a review about the current status of path integral control in\ncancer research.\n",
