However, limited\nexpertise and resource constraints often result in inefficiencies during the\nramp-up phase when new products are integrated into production lines. Existing\nmethods often lack structured and tailored solutions to support automation\nengineers in reducing ramp-up time, leading to compromises in quality. This\nresearch investigates whether large-language models (LLMs), combined with\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), can assist in streamlining equipment\nselection in ramp-up planning. We propose a factual-driven copilot integrating\nLLMs with structured and semi-structured knowledge retrieval for three\ncomponent types (robots, feeders and vision systems), providing a guided and\ntraceable state-machine process for decision-making in automation equipment\nselection. The system was demonstrated to an industrial partner, who tested it\non three internal use-cases. Their feedback affirmed its capability to provide\nlogical and actionable recommendations for automation equipment. More\nspecifically, among 22 equipment prompts analyzed, 19 involved selecting the\ncorrect equipment while considering most requirements, and in 6 cases, all\nrequirements were fully met.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Z53pfKTinE3xzrCzmfR0mAg2olHlkr4HSPUu5emkrhM","pdfSize":"323427"}
