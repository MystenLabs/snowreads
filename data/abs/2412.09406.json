  "abstract": "  In this work, we investigate the renormalization of the gauge-invariant\ncomposite operators proposed in \\cite{Dudal:2023jsu} to describe the\n$SU(2)\\times U(1)$ Higgs model from a gauge-invariant perspective. To establish\nthe relationship between the counterterms, we use the Algebraic Renormalization\napproach \\cite{Piguet:1995er}. Therefore, we also derive the set of Ward\nidentities of the model after introducing these composite operators. Using\nthese Ward identities, we demonstrate important exact relations between the\ncorrelation functions of elementary fields and composite fields.\n",
