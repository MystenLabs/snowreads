  "abstract": "  We derive helicity amplitudes for the fully charmed tetraquark states decays\ninto vector meson pair under two types of models, where the one is from quark\nmodel and the other one is from heavy quark effective theory. The angular\ndistributions have been given by the cascade decays $T_{4c}\\to\nJ/\\psi(D_{(s)}^*)+J/\\psi(\\bar{D}_{(s)}^*)$ along with $J/\\psi\\to \\mu^++\\mu^-$\nor $D_{(s)}^*\\to D_{(s)}+\\pi$, showing that spin-0 and spin-2 states can be\ndistinguished. If we assume quantum entanglement as a fundamental principle,\nthere is a strict constraint formula for helicity amplitudes. These findings\nwill assist in experimentally differentiating various spin-parity states,\ndetermining decay widths and hunting for unobserved structures, thereby\nshedding light on the internal properties of double $J/\\psi$ exotic states.\n",
