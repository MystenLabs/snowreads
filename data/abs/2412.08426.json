  "abstract": "  Predicting the evolution of complex systems governed by partial differential\nequations (PDEs) remains challenging, especially for nonlinear, chaotic\nbehaviors. This study introduces Koopman-inspired Fourier Neural Operators\n(kFNO) and Convolutional Neural Networks (kCNN) to learn solution advancement\noperators for flame front instabilities. By transforming data into a\nhigh-dimensional latent space, these models achieve more accurate multi-step\npredictions compared to traditional methods. Benchmarking across one- and\ntwo-dimensional flame front scenarios demonstrates the proposed approaches'\nsuperior performance in short-term accuracy and long-term statistical\nreproduction, offering a promising framework for modeling complex dynamical\nsystems.\n",
