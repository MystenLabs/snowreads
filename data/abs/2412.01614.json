Our main\nresult is a polynomial-time algorithm that solves this task when r and q are\nconstants.\n  We also show how our proof technique gives an algorithm to solve a\ngeneralization of the well-known Directed Steiner Network problem, in which\nconnections between endpoint pairs are required to satisfy modularity\nconstraints on their length. Our algorithm is polynomial when the number of\nendpoint pairs and the modularity constraints on the pairs are constants.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uAsr6JKaCqPgVs9BJD6-o2OIhJgC_UIqrSlp_p17Ry0","pdfSize":"581260"}
