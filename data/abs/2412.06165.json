  "abstract": "  Conservative Contextual Bandits (CCBs) address safety in sequential decision\nmaking by requiring that an agent's policy, along with minimizing regret, also\nsatisfies a safety constraint: the performance is not worse than a baseline\npolicy (e.g., the policy that the company has in production) by more than\n$(1+\\alpha)$ factor. Prior work developed UCB-style algorithms in the\nmulti-armed [Wu et al., 2016] and contextual linear [Kazerouni et al., 2017]\nsettings. However, in practice the cost of the arms is often a non-linear\nfunction, and therefore existing UCB algorithms are ineffective in such\nsettings. In this paper, we consider CCBs beyond the linear case and develop\ntwo algorithms $\\mathtt{C-SquareCB}$ and $\\mathtt{C-FastCB}$, using Inverse Gap\nWeighting (IGW) based exploration and an online regression oracle. We show that\nthe safety constraint is satisfied with high probability and that the regret of\n$\\mathtt{C-SquareCB}$ is sub-linear in horizon $T$, while the regret of\n$\\mathtt{C-FastCB}$ is first-order and is sub-linear in $L^*$, the cumulative\nloss of the optimal policy. Subsequently, we use a neural network for function\napproximation and online gradient descent as the regression oracle to provide\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{KT} + K/\\alpha) $ and $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{KL^*} + K (1 +\n1/\\alpha))$ regret bounds, respectively. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy\nof our algorithms on real-world data and show that they significantly\noutperform the existing baseline while maintaining the performance guarantee.\n",
