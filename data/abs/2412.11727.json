  "abstract": "  The discovery of near-room temperature superconductivity in the lanthanum\nhydride LaH$_{10}$ has revolutionized this field of research. However, the need\nto use diamond anvils for the synthesis of such superconductors severely limits\nthe number of experimental techniques to study these materials. Nuclear\nmagnetic resonance (NMR) is one of the key methods for probing spin systems of\nsuperconductors. In this work, we show how $^1$H NMR measurements can be\nrealized in diamond anvil cells to study high-temperature superconductivity in\nlanthanum polyhydrides at pressures up to 165 GPa. In the newly discovered\nsuperhydride LaH$_{12}$, we observed a pronounced suppression of the $^1$H NMR\nsignal intensity below $\\textit{T$_{c}$(onset)}$ = 260 K in a magnetic field of\n7 T, corresponding to the screening of the radio-frequency pulses. Below the\ncritical temperature of superconductivity, all $^1$H NMR characteristics,\nincluding the spin-lattice relaxation rate $\\textit{1/T$_{1}$T}$, demonstrate\npronounced features, evidencing the bulk nature of the superconducting\ntransition. In zero field, the radio-frequency signal transmission through the\nLaH$_{12}$ sample shows a pronounced drop below $\\textit{T$_{c}$(onset)}$ = 267\nK, confirming the superconducting nature of the transition. A description of\nthe $\\textit{1/T$_{1}$T}$ data with an exponential form allows the estimation\nof the superconducting gap $\\textit{${\\Delta}$(0)}$ lying between 427 and 671 K\n(corresponding to 36.8 to 57.8 meV), and the ratio $\\textit{R$_{\\Delta}$ =\n2${\\Delta}$(0)/k$_B$T$_c$}$ between 3.76 and 5.16 in the synthesized hydride\nsample.\n",
