They can be considered a unique\ninstance of self-supervised learning methods due to their independence from\nlabel annotation. This survey explores the interplay between diffusion models\nand representation learning. It provides an overview of diffusion models'\nessential aspects, including mathematical foundations, popular denoising\nnetwork architectures, and guidance methods. Various approaches related to\ndiffusion models and representation learning are detailed. These include\nframeworks that leverage representations learned from pre-trained diffusion\nmodels for subsequent recognition tasks and methods that utilize advancements\nin representation and self-supervised learning to enhance diffusion models.\nThis survey aims to offer a comprehensive overview of the taxonomy between\ndiffusion models and representation learning, identifying key areas of existing\nconcerns and potential exploration.
