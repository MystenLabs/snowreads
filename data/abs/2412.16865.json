  "abstract": "  Given $A\\subset\\mathbb Z_n^2$, the purpose of this article is to investigate\nwhen is the difference set $\\Delta A$ disjoint with the zero set of the Fourier\ntransform of $A$. In the study of tiles in $\\mathbb Z_n^2$, the author observed\nan interesting phenomenon that if $(A,B)$ is a tiling pair with $|A|=|B|$, then\nsometimes $(A,B)$ is also a spectral pair and vice versa. Moreover, in such\ncases actually one of the components would have universality (i.e., it is the\nuniversal spectrum/tiling complement for its tiling complements/spectra). It\nturns out that the disjointness is the critical property here, and shall be\nanalyzed using the symplectic Fourier transform. Under such configuration it is\nshown that the phenomenon persists either (1) if $A$ is an order $n$ subgroup,\nor (2) if $n$ is a prime number and $A$ complements an order $n$ subgroup, or\n(3) if $n=p^2$, and $A$ complements the non-cyclic order $n$ subgroup.\n",
