We simulate 2D convection in\nthe core at three different stages of evolution of a $5M_{\\odot}$ star, with\nthree different stratifications in helium atop the core. We study the\npropagation of internal gravity waves in the stably-stratified envelope, along\nwith the overshooting length of convective plumes above the convective\nboundary. We find that the stratification in helium in evolved stars hinders\nradial motions and effectively shields the radiative envelope against plume\npenetration. This prevents convective overshooting from being an efficient\nmixing process in the radiative envelope. In addition, internal gravity waves\nare less excited in evolved models compared to the zero-age-main-sequence\nmodel, and are also more damped in the stratified region above the core. As a\nresult, the wave power is several orders of magnitude lower in mid- and\nterminal-main-sequence models compared to zero-age-main-sequence stars.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HHK5hxWeWwWpvneV4DAbaeyx97oxqNGHkZ8dC7cTamA","pdfSize":"4564864"}
