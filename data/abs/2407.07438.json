We see the monotonicity of spectral geometric mean\nand Wasserstein mean on parameters with respect to the near-order and the\nnear-order relationship between the spectral geometric mean and Wasserstein\nmean. Furthermore, the monotonicity of quasi-arithmetic mean on parameters and\nthe convergence of R\\'{e}nyi power mean to the log-Euclidean mean with respect\nto the near-order have been established.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jqKGS5leMmr3H_Ri9vsjHXm9AwF0m3f3W_32FQjPKFY","pdfSize":"205152"}
