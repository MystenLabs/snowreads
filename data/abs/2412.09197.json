  "abstract": "  In this work we deal with analytic families of real planar vector fields\n$\\mathcal{X}_\\lambda$ having a monodromic singularity at the origin for any\n$\\lambda \\in \\Lambda \\subset \\mathbb{R}^p$ and depending analytically on the\nparameters $\\lambda$. There naturally appears the so-called center-focus\nproblem which consists in describing the partition of $\\Lambda$ induced by the\ncenters and the foci at the origin. We give a characterization of the centers\n(degenerated or not) in terms of a specific integral of the cofactor associated\nto a real invariant analytic curve passing through the singularity, which\nalways exists. Several consequences and applications are also stated.\n",
