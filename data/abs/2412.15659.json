In contrast, the nonlinear AHE plays an\nessential role in such system when the uniaxial strain breaks the C3v symmetry\nand eventually results in the nonzero Berry curvature dipole (BCD). We find\nthat not only the magnitude of the AHE but also the nonlinear Hall angle can be\ntuned by the strain. Especially the nonlinear Hall angle exhibits a deep\nrelationship which is analogy to the birefraction phenomenon in optics. It\nactually results from the pseudotensor nature of the BCD moment. Besides the\nordinary positive and negative crystals in optics, there are two more\nbirefraction-like cases corresponding to an imaginary refraction index ratio in\nmonolayer MoS2. Our findings shed lights on the strain controlled electronic\ndevices based on the two-dimensional (2D) materials with BCD.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7gSZShwsRMwWu7HR1DLLlsNob0iOF3pjWt0Iec6Vm_I","pdfSize":"4273642"}
