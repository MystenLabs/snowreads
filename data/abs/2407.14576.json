This topic\ngarnered significant attention in the field of artificial intelligence. In this\nstudy, we investigate the performance of convolutional neural network (CNN) and\nModified VGG16 models for emotion recognition tasks across two datasets:\nFER2013 and AffectNet. Our aim is to measure the effectiveness of these models\nin identifying emotions and their ability to generalize to different and\nbroader datasets. Our findings reveal that both models achieve reasonable\nperformance on the FER2013 dataset, with the Modified VGG16 model demonstrating\nslightly increased accuracy. When evaluated on the Affect-Net dataset,\nperformance declines for both models, with the Modified VGG16 model continuing\nto outperform the CNN. Our study emphasizes the importance of dataset diversity\nin emotion recognition and discusses open problems and future research\ndirections, including the exploration of multi-modal approaches and the\ndevelopment of more comprehensive datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tTMboANjnk3L_a9uy0JrGKBX43OZc0GccghGudl7CaY","pdfSize":"577041"}
