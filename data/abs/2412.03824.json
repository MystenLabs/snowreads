  "abstract": "  Data is essential to train and fine-tune today's frontier artificial\nintelligence (AI) models and to develop future ones. To date, academic, legal,\nand regulatory work has primarily addressed how data can directly harm\nconsumers and creators, such as through privacy breaches, copyright\ninfringements, and bias and discrimination. Our work, instead, focuses on the\ncomparatively neglected question of how data can enable new governance\ncapacities for frontier AI models. This approach for \"frontier data governance\"\nopens up new avenues for monitoring and mitigating risks from advanced AI\nmodels, particularly as they scale and acquire specific dangerous capabilities.\nStill, frontier data governance faces challenges that stem from the fundamental\nproperties of data itself: data is non-rival, often non-excludable, easily\nreplicable, and increasingly synthesizable. Despite these inherent\ndifficulties, we propose a set of policy mechanisms targeting key actors along\nthe data supply chain, including data producers, aggregators, model developers,\nand data vendors. We provide a brief overview of 15 governance mechanisms, of\nwhich we centrally introduce five, underexplored policy recommendations. These\ninclude developing canary tokens to detect unauthorized use for producers;\n(automated) data filtering to remove malicious content for pre-training and\npost-training datasets; mandatory dataset reporting requirements for developers\nand vendors; improved security for datasets and data generation algorithms; and\nknow-your-customer requirements for vendors. By considering data not just as a\nsource of potential harm, but as a critical governance lever, this work aims to\nequip policymakers with a new tool for the governance and regulation of\nfrontier AI models.\n",
