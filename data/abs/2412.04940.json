This is in stark contrast to\nthe loci of Jacobian varieties that possess a pseudoreflection of geometric\norigin, which is empty for any genus greater than 3. In g=6, a distinguished\nexample of Prym varieties with a pseudoreflection is given by intermediate\nJacobians of cubic threefolds that possess an Eckardt point.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XzzmiLbRNMTyYox_kOq0ZlZwb6BgvX7SdNL_1RwBObo","pdfSize":"216504"}
