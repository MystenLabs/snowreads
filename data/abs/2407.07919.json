We derive a way to\npractically calculate the Lyapunov exponent of a one-dimensional system and use\nit to analyze chaotic behavior of the logistic map, comparing the $r$-varying\nLyapunov exponent to the map's bifurcation diagram. Then, we generalize the\nidea of the Lyapunov exponent to an $n$-dimensional system and explore the\nmathematical background behind the analytic calculation of the Lyapunov\nspectrum. We also outline a method to numerically calculate the maximal\nLyapunov exponent using the periodic renormalization of a perturbation vector\nand a method to numerically calculate the entire Lyapunov spectrum using QR\nfactorization. Finally, we apply both these methods to calculate the Lyapunov\nexponents of the H\\'enon map, a multi-dimensional chaotic system.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ULMNjvfnp46pjWifCdhPMazknQCO2227k7Z9rn3rvBo","pdfSize":"2307044"}
