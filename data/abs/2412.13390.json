  "abstract": "  The stability of interconnected linear time-invariant systems using singular\nvalues and the small gain theorem has been studied for many decades. The\nmethods of mu-analysis and synthesis has been extensively developed to provide\nrobustness guarantees for a plant subject to structured perturbations, with\ncomponents in the structured perturbation satisfying a bound on their largest\nsingular value. Recent results on phase-based stability measures have led to a\ncounterpart of the small gain theorem, known as the small phase theorem. To\ndate these phase-based methods have only been used to provide stability\nrobustness measures for unstructured perturbations. In this paper, we define a\nphase robustness metric for multivariable linear time-invariant systems in the\npresence of a structured perturbation. We demonstrate its relationship to a\ncertain class of multiplier functions for integral quadratic constraints, and\nshow that a upper bound can be calculated via a linear matrix inequality\nproblem. When combined with robustness measures from the small gain theorem,\nthe new methods are able provide less conservative robustness metrics than can\nbe obtained via conventional mu-analysis methods.\n",
