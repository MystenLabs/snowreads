  "abstract": "  We present a theoretical model for a coherent terahertz radiation source\nbased on Bose-Einstein condensate of incoherently pumped microcavity photons.\nEnergy relaxation is provided by inelastic photon scattering on a\ntwo-dimensional electron gas in magnetic field. The proposed setup evades the\nstandard lasing mechanisms: neither population inversion nor light wave\namplification is utilized. We study the kinetics of photon condensation and\ndescribe a semiconductor-crystal based device.\n",
