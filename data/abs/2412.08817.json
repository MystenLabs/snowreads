  "abstract": "  We introduce a new erasure decoder that applies to arbitrary quantum LDPC\ncodes. Dubbed the cluster decoder, it generalizes the decomposition idea of\nVertical-Horizontal (VH) decoding introduced by Connelly et al. in 2022. Like\nthe VH decoder, the idea is to first run the peeling decoder and then\npost-process the resulting stopping set. The cluster decoder breaks the\nstopping set into a tree of clusters which can be solved sequentially via\nGaussian Elimination (GE). By allowing clusters of unconstrained size, this\ndecoder achieves maximum-likelihood (ML) performance with reduced complexity\ncompared with full GE. When GE is applied only to clusters whose sizes are less\nthan a constant, the performance is degraded but the complexity becomes linear\nin the block length. Our simulation results show that, for hypergraph product\ncodes, the cluster decoder with constant cluster size achieves near-ML\nperformance similar to VH decoding in the low-erasure-rate regime. For the\ngeneral quantum LDPC codes we studied, the cluster decoder can be used to\nestimate the ML performance curve with reduced complexity over a wide range of\nerasure rates.\n",
