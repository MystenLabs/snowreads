Deep-learning\napproaches avoid discretization and yield numerous successes in robotics and\nautonomy, but at a higher dimensional limit, accuracy falls as sampling becomes\nless efficient. We propose using rapidly generated linear solutions to the\npartial differential equation (PDE) arising in the problem to accelerate and\nimprove learned value functions for guidance in high-dimensional, nonlinear\nproblems. We define two programs that combine supervision of the linear\nsolution with a standard PDE loss. We demonstrate that these programs offer\nimprovements in speed and accuracy in both a 50-D differential game problem and\na 10-D quadrotor control problem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computer Science/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"GwS1S3Ppmf5hq6zV_ZuyeCCUTQAAceaLzVnK8wyJdR4","pdfSize":"3297145"}
