We prove that for any\ntriangle-free graph $F$, \\[ f_{F,K_3}(n) = f_{K_2,K_3}(n)^{1 + o(1)} =\nn^{\\frac{1}{2} + o(1)}.\\] Along the way we give a slight improvement of a\nconstruction of Erd\\H os-Frankl-R\\\"odl for the Brown-Erd\\H os-S\\'os\n$(3r-3,3)$-problem when $r$ is large.\n  In contrast to our result for $K_3$, for any $K_4$-free graph $F$ containing\na cycle, we prove there exists $c_F > 0$ such that $$f_{F,K_4}(n) >\nf_{K_2,K_4}(n)^{1 + c_F} = n^{\\frac{1}{3}+c_F+o(1)}.$$ \\iffalse We also observe\nthat our earlier proof for $F=K_3$ generalizes to $f_{F,K_4}(n) =\nO(\\sqrt{n}\\log n)$ for all $F$ containing a cycle. \\fi\n  For every graph $G$, we prove that there exists $\\varepsilon_G >0$ such that\nwhenever $F$ is a non-empty graph such that $G$ is not contained in any blowup\nof $F$, then $f_{F,G}(n) = O(n^{1-\\varepsilon_G})$.
