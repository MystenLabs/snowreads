  "abstract": "  Energy degeneracy in physical systems may be induced by symmetries of the\nHamiltonian, and the resonance of degeneracy states in carbon nanostructures\ncan effectively enhance the stability of the system. Combining the octet rule,\nwe introduce a parameter-free statistical model to determine the physical\nproperties by lifting the energy degeneracy in carbon nanostructures. This\nmodel offers a direct path to accurately ascertain electron density\ndistributions in quantum systems, akin to how charge density is used in density\nfunctional theory to deduce system properties. Our methodology diverges from\ntraditional quantum mechanics, focusing instead on this unique statistical\nmodel by minimizing bonding free energy to determine the fundamental properties\nof materials. Applied to carbon nanoclusters and graphynes, our model not only\nprecisely predicts bonding energies and electron density without relying on\nexternal parameters, but also enhances the prediction of electronic structures\nthrough bond occupancy numbers, which act as effective hopping integrals. This\ninnovation offers insights into the structural properties and quantum behavior\nof electrons across various dimensions.\n",
