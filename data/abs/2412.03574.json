We develop a method for back-filling\ndata smart meter for up to six missing months for users who have less than one\nyear of smart meter data, ensuring reliable estimates of annual consumption. We\nidentify five distinct electricity consumption user profiles for homes based on\nday, night, and peak usage patterns, highlighting the economic advantages of\nTime-of-Use (ToU) tariffs over fixed tariffs for most users, especially those\nwith higher nighttime consumption. Ultimately, the results of this study\nempowers consumers to manage their energy use effectively and to make informed\nchoices regarding electricity tariff plans.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computers and Society","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"i1-d3fSm3gSRxbMSv3AlBXaVCgjwAL2HN_JOlU4Q--8","pdfSize":"1224179"}
