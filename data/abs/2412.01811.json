  "abstract": "  Let $X$ be a $n$-dimensional smooth projective variety and $L$ be an ample\nCartier divisor on $X$. We conjecture that a very general element of the linear\nsystem $|K_X+(3n+1)L|$ is a hyperbolic algebraic variety. This conjecture holds\nfor some classical varieties: surfaces, products of projective spaces, and\nGrassmannians. In this article, we investigate the conjecture for $X$ a toric\nvariety. We give a positive answer to the conjecture for smooth projective\ntoric varieties. For a Gorenstein toric threefold $X$, we show that $|K_X+9L|$\nis a hyperbolic linear system for any ample Cartier divisor $L$.\n",
