  "abstract": "  Identifying a full basis of operators to a given order is key to the\ngenerality of Effective Field Theory (EFT) and is by now a problem of known\nsolution in terms of the Hilbert series. The present work is concerned with\nhidden symmetry in general and Higgs EFT in particular and {\\it(i)} connects\nthe counting formula presented in [1] in the CCWZ formulation with the linear\nframe and makes this connection explicit in HEFT {\\it (ii)} outlines the\ndifferences in perturbation theory in each frame {\\it (iii)} presents a new\ncounting formula with measure in the full $SU(3)\\times SU(2)\\times U(1)$ group\nfor HEFT and {\\it (iv)} provides a Mathematica code that produces the number of\noperators at the user-specified order in HEFT.\n",
