Despite their effectiveness, these systems exacerbate the longstanding\ncold-start problem in traditional recommender systems, because any number of\nuser groups or item bundles can be formed among users or items. To address this\nissue, we introduce a Consistency and Discrepancy-based graph contrastive\nlearning method for tripartite graph-based Recommendation. This approach\nleverages two novel meta-path-based metrics consistency and discrepancy to\ncapture nuanced, implicit associations between the recommended objects and the\nrecommendees. These metrics, indicative of high-order similarities, can be\nefficiently calculated with infinite graph convolutional networks layers under\na multi-objective optimization framework, using the limit theory of GCN.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"206gKDFaFplMrPNwpfCDSesL8Ch0ZAb0igwBe83iRmM","pdfSize":"1227607"}
