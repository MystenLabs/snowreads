With the emergence of large models,\ntime series foundation models (TSFMs) have exhibited remarkable generalization\ncapabilities, such as zero-shot learning, through large-scale pre-training.\nMeanwhile, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have been widely\nemployed to enhance the performance of foundation models on unseen data,\nallowing models to access to external knowledge. In this paper, we introduce\nTimeRAF, a Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting model that enhance zero-shot time\nseries forecasting through retrieval-augmented techniques. We develop\ncustomized time series knowledge bases that are tailored to the specific\nforecasting tasks. TimeRAF employs an end-to-end learnable retriever to extract\nvaluable information from the knowledge base. Additionally, we propose Channel\nPrompting for knowledge integration, which effectively extracts relevant\ninformation from the retrieved knowledge along the channel dimension. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, showing significant\nimprovement across various domains and datasets.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ca3exnYe0jyubRSj5ZFnXQiSAjIthDDnfbvMFBsk6zk","pdfSize":"7209536"}
