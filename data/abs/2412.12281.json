  "abstract": "  We provide a new proof of the rational splitting of excisive endofunctors of\nspectra as a product of their homogeneous layers independent of rational Tate\nvanishing. We utilise the analogy between endofunctors of spectra and\nequivariant stable homotopy theory and as a consequence, we obtain an algebraic\nmodel for rational excisive functors.\n",
