Then we\ndefine the Fibonacci-Fubini numbers that count the total number of Fibonacci\npartitions of $[n]$. We study the classical properties of this sequence\n(generating function, explicit and Dobi\\'nski-like formula, etc.), we give\ncombinatorial interpretation, and we extensively examine the Fibonacci-Fubini\narithmetic triangle. We give some associate linear recurrence sequences, where\nin some sequences the Stirling numbers of the first and second kinds appear as\nwell.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XigdCT47L-VydqJT0TMfm9j5lkRS8k1__W4liWPPpXE","pdfSize":"238265"}
