Two major\nreasons for this are the large number of gates required for Trotterising\ntime-dependent electronic structure Hamiltonians, as well as discretisation\nerrors heating the state. We show that a recently proposed randomized\nalgorithm, which implements exact adiabatic evolution without heating and with\nfar fewer gates than Trotterisation, can overcome this problem. We develop\nthree methods for measuring the energy of the prepared state in an efficient\nand noise-resilient manner, yielding chemically accurate results on a 4-qubit\nmolecule in the presence of realistic gate noise, without the need for error\nmitigation. These findings suggest that adiabatic approaches to state\npreparation could play a key role in quantum chemistry simulations both in the\nera of noisy as well as error-corrected quantum computers.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IO3vCRkhhVojZSZ8Dc5xbkL8ykN5tOy3u6OIzpr8fUM","pdfSize":"1972691"}
