Our results show that early-fusion closely matches\nthe ground truth for both demographics, achieving the lowest MAEs by\nintegrating each modality's unique characteristics. In contrast, late-fusion\nleads to highly generalized mean scores and higher MAEs. Our findings emphasise\nthe significant potential of early-fusion for accurate and fair applications,\neven in the presence of demographic biases, compared to late-fusion. Future\nresearch could explore alternative fusion strategies and incorporate\nmodality-related fairness constraints to improve fairness.
