By leveraging AI tools,\nresearchers can improve adherence to key exclusion restrictions and in\nparticular ensure the internal validity measures of mental models, which often\nrequire human intervention in the incentive mechanism. We present a case study\ndemonstrating how LLMs can enhance experimental design, participant engagement,\nand the validity of measuring mental models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"HtOaSBLrS4Y-dkOjajmtkcy3RUXjV6Dx77TdQG77CDc","pdfSize":"1074694"}
