Eur. Math. Soc.\n(2024)], we establish the well-posedness of a viscous fluid model satisfying\nthe dynamic law for the contact line \\begin{equation*}\n\\mathscr{W}(\\p_t\\zeta(\\pm\\ell,t))=[\\![\\gamma]\\!]\\mp\\sigma\\frac{\\p_1\\zeta}{(1+|\\p_1\\zeta|^2)^{1/2}}(\\pm\\ell,t)\n\\end{equation*} in 2D domain, where $\\zeta(x_1,t)$ is a free surface with two\ncontact points $\\zeta(\\pm\\ell,t)$, $[\\![\\gamma]\\!]$ and $\\sigma$ are constants\ncharacterizing the solid-fluid-gas free energy, and the increasing\n$\\mathscr{W}$ is the contact point velocity response function. Motivated by the\nenergy-dissipation structure, our construction relies on the construction of a\npressureless weak solution for the coupled velocity and free interface for the\nlinearized problems, via a Galerkin approximation with a time-dependent basis\nand an artificial regularization for the capillary operator.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Mf1nj2fC4_4oMhAnhAJ8ekBF13BDFP1aw1G7iMOY0IA","pdfSize":"968048"}
