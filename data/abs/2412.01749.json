  "abstract": "  Semiconductor-superconductor hybrid devices have been proposed as promising\nplatforms for detecting and analyzing Majorana zero modes, which find\napplications in topological quantum computing. In this work, we solve the\nKohn-Sham Density Functional Theory and Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations to\ndescribe the normal and superconducting properties of a PbTe/Pb\nheterostructure. We resolve a proximity-induced superconducting gap on the PbTe\nside. The hybridization between PbTe and Pb causes the emergence of a soft\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like superconducting gap. We compute the anomalous\ncharge density in real space, estimating its decay length and showing that the\npairing potential is anisotropic, which is a necessary condition for\nunconventional superconductivity. Contrary to the models that predict Majorana\nzero modes in these interfaces, we find a significantly large Schottky barrier\nin the normal state preventing the emergence of zero modes. Our findings\nstrengthen the understanding of the physics governing PbTe/Pb hybrid devices\nand their viability for Majorana zero modes applications.\n",
