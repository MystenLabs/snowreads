We\npresent AstroSpy, a hybrid model that integrates both spectral and image\nfeatures to distinguish real from synthetic astronomical images. Trained on a\nunique dataset of real NASA images and AI-generated fakes (approximately 18k\nsamples), AstroSpy utilizes a dual-pathway architecture to fuse spatial and\nspectral information. This approach enables AstroSpy to achieve superior\nperformance in identifying authentic astronomical images. Extensive evaluations\ndemonstrate AstroSpy's effectiveness and robustness, significantly\noutperforming baseline models in both in-domain and cross-domain tasks,\nhighlighting its potential to combat misinformation in astronomy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"U8INYhqiV0QPdVWCQMoO02bmdwt9pne87uC7rKNeAnE","pdfSize":"7763430"}
