We first review some elementary techniques of VTQFT\nand verify its consistency by showing that it reproduces semiclassical results,\nincluding the Hawking-Page phase transition and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy\nof BTZ blackhole. We then summarize a gauging scheme for non-invertible\nsymmetries referred to as anyon condensation and exhibit that it is applicable\nto VTQFT even though the category of Wilson lines associated with it is not\nstrictly a modular tensor category (MTC). More specifically, it is shown that\nthe partition function of the wormhole factorizes upon condensating the\nso-called diagonal condensable anyon in VTQFT.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"h-EdeAjW7AbnRwddTRg_vdjo6issjmJDB5pNTlVhRKc","pdfSize":"544465"}
