While traditional style transfer methods and modern Denoising\nDiffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) strive to achieve this balance, they\noften struggle to do so without sacrificing either style, content, or sometimes\nboth. This work addresses this challenge by analyzing the ability of DDPMs to\nmaintain content and style equilibrium. We introduce a novel method to identify\nsensitivities within the DDPM attention layers, identifying specific layers\nthat correspond to different stylistic aspects. By directing conditional inputs\nonly to these sensitive layers, our approach enables fine-grained control over\nstyle and content, significantly reducing issues arising from over-constrained\ninputs. Our findings demonstrate that this method enhances recent stylization\ntechniques by better aligning style and content, ultimately improving the\nquality of generated visual content.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Graphics","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"IAhBADTWSN23GoVEf2-bMmJkmi4RFLcJ1dywsmcw8MA","pdfSize":"29747354"}
