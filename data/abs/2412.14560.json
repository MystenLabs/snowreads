  "abstract": "  The main aim of the the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments is to search\nfor exotic particles with masses in the TeV range as predicted by Beyond\nStandard Model (BSM) theories. However, there is no hint of BSM around TeV\nscale so far. Hence, it is possible that the exotic particles are heavier and\nlarger centre of mass energy is needed to observe them. Alternatively, the\nfuture lepton colliders offer a comparatively cleaner environment than the LHC\nwhich is advantageous to detect light exotic particles. Lepton colliders, like\nthe International Linear Collider, provide the opportunity to detect exotic\nparticles at energies below the TeV scale. The Muon Collider, once fully\noperational, will have the capability to observe exotic particles at and beyond\nthe TeV scale. The search for BSM particles typically assumes a minimal\nscenario where only one type of BSM particle couples with the Standard Model\n(SM) sector. But there are theories which involve such interactions of multiple\nBSM particles. Here I discusses a specific model featuring a fermionic\nquintuplet and a scalar quartet that interact before decaying into SM\nparticles. This model yields distinctive signatures characterized by high\nlepton and jet multiplicities, making it a promising candidate for detection at\nfuture lepton colliders.\n",
