  "abstract": "  We investigate the propagation of electromagnetic waves through materials\ndisplaying a non-linear Hall effect. The coupled Maxwell-Boltzmann equations\nfor traveling waves can be mapped onto ordinary differential equations that\nresemble those for the motion of a pendulum. In the weakly non-linear regime\nrelevant for most experiments, we find that the polarization of light displays\na Faraday-like precession of its polarization direction that swings back and\nforth around the direction of Berry dipole vector as the light beam traverses\nthe material. This occurs concomitantly with an oscillation of its degree of\npolarization, with a characteristic frequency that increases linearly with the\nintensity of the traveling wave. These effects could be observed by measuring\nthickness dependent Faraday rotations as well as the emission of lower\nfrequency radiation associated with the polarization oscillations in materials\ndisplaying the non-linear Hall effect.\n",
