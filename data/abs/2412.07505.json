  "abstract": "  We present two explicit expressions for generic singular vectors of type\n$(r,s)$ of the Virasoro algebra. These results follow from the paper of Bauer\net al which presented recursive methods to construct the vectors. The\nexpressions presented here generalise the results of Benoit-Saint Aubin for the\ntype $(1,s)$ singular vectors in two different ways: the first simply solves\nthe recursion through the use of partitions; the second gives explicit formulae\nfor the coefficients in a particular expansion. A Mathematica notebook is\navailable which implements the formulae.\n",
