Learning the intrinsic dynamics from observational\ndata is pivotal for forecasting system behaviors and making informed decisions.\nHowever, existing methods for modeling networked time series often assume known\ntopologies, whereas real-world networks are typically incomplete or inaccurate,\nwith missing or spurious links that hinder precise predictions. Moreover, while\nnetworked time series often originate from diverse topologies, the ability of\nmodels to generalize across topologies has not been systematically evaluated.\nTo address these gaps, we propose a novel framework for learning network\ndynamics directly from observed time-series data, when prior knowledge of graph\ntopology or governing dynamical equations is absent. Our approach leverages\ncontinuous graph neural networks with an attention mechanism to construct a\nlatent topology, enabling accurate reconstruction of future trajectories for\nnetwork states. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic networks\ndemonstrate that our model not only captures dynamics effectively without\ntopology knowledge but also generalizes to unseen time series originating from\ndiverse topologies.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oIE9Ny1QHterwRnS85vpQN6ucAA12ZIczpQhQ9kk1PI","pdfSize":"2461009"}
