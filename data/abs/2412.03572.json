  "abstract": "  Navigation is a fundamental skill of agents with visual-motor capabilities.\nWe introduce a Navigation World Model (NWM), a controllable video generation\nmodel that predicts future visual observations based on past observations and\nnavigation actions. To capture complex environment dynamics, NWM employs a\nConditional Diffusion Transformer (CDiT), trained on a diverse collection of\negocentric videos of both human and robotic agents, and scaled up to 1 billion\nparameters. In familiar environments, NWM can plan navigation trajectories by\nsimulating them and evaluating whether they achieve the desired goal. Unlike\nsupervised navigation policies with fixed behavior, NWM can dynamically\nincorporate constraints during planning. Experiments demonstrate its\neffectiveness in planning trajectories from scratch or by ranking trajectories\nsampled from an external policy. Furthermore, NWM leverages its learned visual\npriors to imagine trajectories in unfamiliar environments from a single input\nimage, making it a flexible and powerful tool for next-generation navigation\nsystems.\n",
