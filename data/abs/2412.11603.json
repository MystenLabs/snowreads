This paper presents the development\nand evaluation of Space Exodus, a task-based role-playing Virtual Reality (VR)\ngame designed to support therapy for children with ID. The game integrates\neveryday life scenarios into an immersive environment to enhance skill\nacquisition and transfer. Functional tests and preliminary experiments\ndemonstrated the system's stability, usability, and adaptability, with 70--80\\%\nof participants demonstrating successful skill transfer to new challenges.\n  Challenges, such as VR discomfort, controller misoperation, and task\ncomplexity, were identified, emphasizing the need for ergonomic improvements\nand adaptive guidance. The results provide empirical evidence supporting VR as\na promising tool in ID therapy. Future work will focus on refining gameplay\nmechanics, enhancing user guidance, and expanding accessibility to broader\npopulations.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction","Computer Science/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"T3e3pHkceOnoQ0lXb2MVb6REsDIHNVULphzVdbgOHJI","pdfSize":"3875001"}
