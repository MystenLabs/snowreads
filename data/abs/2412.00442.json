Blockages\nhave been modeled in the literature so far using tools such as stochastic\ngeometry and random shape theory. Using these tools, in this paper, we\ncharacterize the lengths of the segments in line-of-sight (LOS) and in\nnon-line-of-sight (NLOS) statistically in an urban scenario where buildings\n(with random positions, lengths, and heights) are deployed in parallel\ndirections configuring streets.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"GmzUMfsKs2vurWolxOYllIfQqvbOZ2jc6kOzu9x9n2Q","pdfSize":"801449"}
