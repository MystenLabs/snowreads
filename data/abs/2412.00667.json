The analysis of\nheterogeneous data remains a challenge that requires new ways of thinking about\ncells in quantitative, predictive, and mechanistic ways. We discuss the role of\nmathematical models in the context of cell-fate decision making systems across\nthe tree of life. Complex multi-cellular organisms have been a particular\nfocus, but single celled organisms also have to sense and respond to their\nenvironment. We center our discussion around the idea of design principles\nwhich we can learn from observations and modeling, and exploit in order to\n(re)-design or guide cellular behavior.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Cell Behavior"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"oKVkZD2MNRkHlXj1NOsWFFPUtSRcfunbf0dDXgDendQ","pdfSize":"1745879"}
