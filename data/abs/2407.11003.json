This study examines the impact of LLMs within San\nAntonio's public transit system, leveraging their capabilities in natural\nlanguage processing, data analysis, and real time communication. By utilizing\nGTFS and other public transportation information, the research highlights the\ntransformative potential of LLMs in enhancing route planning, reducing wait\ntimes, and providing personalized travel assistance. Our case study is the city\nof San Antonio as part of a project aiming to demonstrate how LLMs can optimize\nresource allocation, improve passenger satisfaction, and support decision\nmaking processes in transit management. We evaluated LLM responses to questions\nrelated to both information retrieval and also understanding. Ultimately, we\nbelieve that the adoption of LLMs in public transit systems can lead to more\nefficient, responsive, and user-friendly transportation networks, providing a\nmodel for other cities to follow.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NKe76L67PBTTUD39RfadG02Rlrz82b8wxChxxdgfjlg","pdfSize":"486627"}
