Treating the Eulerian velocity field of an invariant\nsolution as a dynamical system, the transport of these passive scalars along\nLagrangian flow trajectories reveals a rich repertoire of different types of\nmotion that can occur, including stagnation points, for which there is no fluid\nmovement, and invariant tori, which obstruct chaotic mixing across the full\nvolume of the plane Couette flow minimal cell. We determine the stability of\nthese stagnation points, along with their stable and unstable manifolds, and\nfind heteroclinic connections between them. These topological features produce\na skeleton that shapes the passive tracer flow for a turbulent fluid, providing\na first step to elucidating Lagrangian particle transport and mixing in\nthree-dimensional Navier-Stokes turbulent flows.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"ah2K0eVCMhFe-LPIVhBo-rqWVVXw-LQykfx3b7UlGxE","pdfSize":"3036221"}
