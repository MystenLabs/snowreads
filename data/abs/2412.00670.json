  "abstract": "  We find the novel class of the supersymmetric deformation of the\n$\\mathbb{CP}^{1}$ $\\sigma$-model and its equivalence with the generalised\nchiral Gross-Neveu. This construction allows the use of field-theoretic\ntechniques and particularly the study of renormalisability and\n$\\beta$-function. Provided approach is useful in finding conformal limits and\nestablishes relation between chiral (GN) and sigma model description\n(geometric), which is explicitly demonstrated for the case of $ \\mathbb{R}\n\\times S^{1} $/Super-Thirring models. We also provide discussion on its\nemergence in $\\mathcal{N}=2$ Liouville and 4-dim Chern-Simons theory.\n",
