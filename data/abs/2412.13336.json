Most of the Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries\nfailed to achieve GTS 2020 -- only 4 out of 40 highest burden countries met the\ngoals. By fitting evolutionary game modeling to the malaria case and\nInsecticide-Treated Nets (ITN) usages data, we identify factors contributing to\nthe GTS 2020 failures of 38 SSA countries. We use optimized projection of our\nmodel to evaluate further the potential achievement of GTS 2025 and 2030\nobjectives and discuss strategies for attaining goals in situations where these\nmilestones seem unattainable. Our findings categorize all 38 countries based on\nthe possibility to achieve their future milestone, either through increased\ncampaigns, or by economic assistance, or through enhancing the efficacy of ITNs\nat minimal expense.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"P24UMmdDHiBPoNZAsX7eIzNAUJNqOjtRHRow3bYdsVs","pdfSize":"5103929"}
