  "abstract": "  We investigate the evolution of initial fractal clusters at 3 kpc from the\nGalactic Center (GC) of the Milky Way and show how red supergiant clusters\n(RSGCs)-like objects, which are considered to be the result of active star\nformation in the Scutum complex, can form by 16 Myr. We find that initial tidal\nfilling and tidal over-filling fractals are shredded by the tidal force, but\nsome substructures can survive as individual subclusters, especially when the\ninitial virial ratio is $\\leq$0.5.These surviving subclusters are weakly mass\nsegregated and show a top-heavy mass function. This implies the possibility\nthat a single substructured star cluster can evolve into multiple `star\nclusters'.\n",
