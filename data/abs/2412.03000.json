Extending the\nfundamental example, $K(x,y) = \\exp(xy)$, $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, of a classical\ntotally positive kernel, the hyperdeterminantal total positivity property of\nthe kernel $K(x_1,\\ldots,x_{2m}) = \\exp(x_1\\cdots x_{2m})$, $x_1,\\ldots,x_{2m}\n\\in \\mathbb{R}$ is established. A hyperdeterminantal Binet-Cauchy argument is\napplied to derive a generalization of Karlin's Basic Composition Formula, from\nwhich several examples of hyperdeterminantal totally positive kernels are\nconstructed. Further generalizations of hyperdeterminantal total positivity by\nmeans of the theory of finite reflection groups are described and some open\nproblems are posed.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"h-S5h5oqz5kfd97hNwhtlw7Acrv4NqJgPyRnP3_GN2E","pdfSize":"470137"}
