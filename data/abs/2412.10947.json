Their models emphasized the critical role of accurate knowledge of\nmarket microstructure and price/information dynamics in optimizing trades to\nminimize execution costs. However, this paper recognizes that perfect initial\nknowledge may not be a realistic assumption for new investors entering the\nmarket. Therefore, this study aims to bridge this gap by proposing an approach\nthat iteratively derives OLS estimates of the market parameters from period to\nperiod. This methodology enables uninformed investors to engage in the market\ndynamically, adjusting their strategies over time based on evolving estimates,\nthus offering a practical solution for navigating the complexities of execution\ncost optimization without perfect initial knowledge.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Trading and Market Microstructure"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"LDrqjkDKHvRyU1hi5W5oxG7VMNG_O8hHXsE0Tk_Sl74","pdfSize":"903918"}
