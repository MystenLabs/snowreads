  "abstract": "  Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) aim at solving classical or quantum\noptimization problems by optimizing parametrized trial states on a quantum\ndevice, based on the outcomes of noisy projective measurements. The associated\noptimization process benefits from an accurate modeling of the cost function\nlandscape using Gaussian Process Models (GPMs), whose performance is critically\naffected by the choice of their kernel. Here we introduce trigonometric\nkernels, inspired by the observation that typical VQA cost functions display\noscillatory behaviour with only few frequencies. Appropriate scores to\nbenchmark the reliability of a GPM are defined, and a systematic comparison\nbetween different kernels is carried out on prototypical problems from quantum\nchemistry and combinatorial optimization. We further introduce RotoGP, a\nsequential line-search optimizer equipped with a GPM, and test how different\nkernels can help mitigate noise and improve optimization convergence. Overall,\nwe observe that the trigonometric kernels show the best performance in most of\nthe cases under study.\n",
