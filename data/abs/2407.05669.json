The larger the discount given to a\nuser, the higher the likelihood of its activation (adopting a new product or\ninnovation), who then attempts to activate its neighboring users, causing a\ncascade effect of influence through the network. Our goal is to devise\nefficient algorithms that assign initial discounts to the network's users to\nmaximize the total number of activated users at the end of the cascade, subject\nto a constraint on the total sum of discounts given. In general, the activation\nlikelihood could be any non-decreasing function of the discount, whereas, our\nfocus lies on the case when the activation likelihood is an affine function of\nthe discount, potentially varying across different users. As this problem is\nshown to be NP-hard, we propose and analyze an efficient (1-1/e)-approximation\nalgorithm. Furthermore, we run experiments on real-world social networks to\nshow the performance and scalability of our method.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"FLH5mvr1eusu6OoeMgOPt7froH2OkDNbZbtc11CyflE","pdfSize":"512047"}
