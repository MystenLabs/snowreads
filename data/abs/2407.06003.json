Initially, GPT\nwas asked to generate demographics of a potential writer of twenty phrases\ncontaining feminine stereotypes and twenty with masculine stereotypes. Results\nshow a strong asymmetry, with stereotypically masculine sentences attributed to\na female more often than vice versa. For example, the sentence \"I love playing\nfotbal! Im practicing with my cosin Michael\" was constantly assigned by ChatGPT\nto a female writer. This phenomenon likely reflects that while initiatives to\nintegrate women in traditionally masculine roles have gained momentum, the\nreverse movement remains relatively underdeveloped. Subsequent experiments\ninvestigate the same issue in high-stakes moral dilemmas. GPT-4 finds it more\nappropriate to abuse a man to prevent a nuclear apocalypse than to abuse a\nwoman. This bias extends to other forms of violence central to the gender\nparity debate (abuse), but not to those less central (torture). Moreover, this\nbias increases in cases of mixed-sex violence for the greater good: GPT-4\nagrees with a woman using violence against a man to prevent a nuclear\napocalypse but disagrees with a man using violence against a woman for the same\npurpose. Finally, these biases are implicit, as they do not emerge when GPT-4\nis directly asked to rank moral violations. These results highlight the\nnecessity of carefully managing inclusivity efforts to prevent unintended\ndiscrimination.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Fc8mq7cf-xQ8QvXvpBcpJVTJz2OqDpUNsIWdZnNioIk","pdfSize":"525937"}
