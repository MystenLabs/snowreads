However, these two\nstages are often considered separately or learned by different paradigms,\nleading to suboptimal clustering performance. In this paper, we propose a\nunified framework, termed graph Cut-guided Maximal Coding Rate Reduction\n(CgMCR$^2$), for jointly learning the structured embeddings and the clustering.\nTo be specific, we attempt to integrate an efficient clustering module into the\nprincipled framework for learning structured representation, in which the\nclustering module is used to provide partition information to guide the\ncluster-wise compression and the learned embeddings is aligned to desired\ngeometric structures in turn to help for yielding more accurate partitions. We\nconduct extensive experiments on both standard and out-of-domain image datasets\nand experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LZ3PwkmoVCaR1p-hWN45rbvLkzIY34WJEzcp5PuwdDQ","pdfSize":"13327268"}
