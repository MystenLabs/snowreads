The analysis is set in the maximal regularity framework\nof UMD Banach spaces. Similar results were proved in an earlier work, based on\nthe consistency analysis of Radau IIA methods. The present error analysis,\nwhich is based on variational techniques, is of independent interest, but the\nmain motivation is that it extends to nonlinear parabolic equations; in\ncontrast to the earlier work. Both autonomous and nonautonomous linear\nequations are considered.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MNDZPbVvnel5MFPXK0mqb6jKKf7EGSH1grfzA_crgkg","pdfSize":"234975","objectId":"0x2e7aac9cc667e2a8f7bf8609b652c2fee6734aa2510819515f546cf816ca76ea","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
