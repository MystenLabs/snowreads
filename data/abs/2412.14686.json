Existing\nmultimodal fake news datasets only provide binary labels of real or fake.\nHowever, real news is alike, while each fake news is fake in its own way. These\ndatasets fail to reflect the mixed nature of various types of multimodal fake\nnews. To bridge the gap, we construct an attributing multi-granularity\nmultimodal fake news detection dataset \\amg, revealing the inherent fake\npattern. Furthermore, we propose a multi-granularity clue alignment model \\our\nto achieve multimodal fake news detection and attribution. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that \\amg is a challenging dataset, and its attribution setting\nopens up new avenues for future research.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"VJX_5s-4bNn685VTLYeyabBUtO8NlTT8RUi4qqKG0VQ","pdfSize":"4690685"}
