We also examine the HDE model and $\\Lambda$CDM with and\nwithout $N_{\\rm eff}$ (effective number of relativistic species) being treated\nas a free parameter. We find that the HDE model can relieve the tensions of\n$H_0$ and $S_8$ to certain degrees. With ``Planck+ACT+BAO+RSD'' datasets, the\nconstraints are $H_0 = 69.70 \\pm 1.39\\ \\mathrm{km\\ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ and $S_8 =\n0.823 \\pm 0.011$ in HDE model, which brings down the Hubble tension down to\n$1.92\\sigma$ confidence level (C.L.) and the $S_8$ tension to $1$-$2\\sigma$\nC.L. By adding the R22 data, their values are improved as $H_0 = 71.86 \\pm 0.93\n\\,\\mathrm{km\\ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ and $S_8 = 0.813 \\pm 0.010$, which further\nbrings the Hubble tension down to $0.85\\sigma$ C.L. and relieves the $S_{8}$\ntension. We also quantify the goodness-of-fit of different models with Akaike\ninformation criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and find\nthat the HDE agrees with the observational data better than the $\\Lambda$CDM\nand other extended models (treating $N_{\\rm eff}$ as free for fitting).\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-VLdlflPzqjJ64P6k2wAG6PzystMlmq9MtutuWiq4r8","pdfSize":"1900422"}
