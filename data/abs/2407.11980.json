As its name suggests, its primary goal is\nto provide a way to quickly and (semi-) automatically detect problems in the\nuser experience of websites and web-based systems. Through a set of Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) models, SERENE detects users' emotions in web pages while\nguaranteeing users' privacy. Its main strength over typical user experience and\nusability evaluation is in the generalizability of its detections. While\ntraditional methods use samples (that may not be representative), SERENE allows\nto tap into data provided by the whole user population. The platform is\navailable at https://serene.ddns.net.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nNsuGUGj9tU1xlqYqSUu94Y2RazvXjJhBIkDZ55S814","pdfSize":"70052"}
