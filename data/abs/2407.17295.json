Our results show the great importance\nof the change in the direction of propagation of the CME in the low corona when\nmodelling CMEs and estimating the time of their arrival at Earth.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"E8vLLXW6m6aBJ3LJ0s7EdMb2C4J8SuPb2kkDo33QI4Y","pdfSize":"12798752"}
