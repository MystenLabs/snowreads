The\nproposed MS-HGNN is a versatile and general architecture that is applicable to\nvarious multi-body dynamic systems and a wide range of dynamics learning\nproblems. We formally prove the morphological-symmetry-equivariant property of\nour MS-HGNN and validate its effectiveness across multiple quadruped robot\nlearning problems using both real-world and simulated data.
