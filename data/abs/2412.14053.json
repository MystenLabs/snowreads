Similar estimates apply to\nManin's conjecture for Fermat hypersurfaces over function fields. Following an\nidea of Pugin, rather than applying analytic methods to estimate the minor\narcs, we treat them as complete exponential sums over finite fields and apply\nresults of Katz, which bound the sum in terms of the dimension of a certain\nsingular locus, which we estimate by tangent space calculations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"S1lRBpY7xilpYikUlJh3U55_F4X-0g0hk8G5GkC_8aA","pdfSize":"502638"}
