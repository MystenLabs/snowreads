  "abstract": "  We derive expressions for the vector and tensor components of the spin\npolarization of massive vector bosons at local thermodynamic equilibrium up to\nsecond order in the space-time gradients of the thermodynamic fields pertaining\nto the canonical stress-energy tensor and spin tensor of the free Proca field.\nA set of Feynman rules is devised to calculate the Wigner function and the\nmatrix-valued spin-dependent distribution (MVSD) functions order by order in\nspace-time gradients. Due to constraints imposed by time-reversal symmetry, the\nleading contribution to spin alignment - defined as the 00-component of the\ntensor polarization - arises from second-order terms in MVSD, for which we\nprovide an analytic formula. We discuss the physical meaning of different\ncontributions to vector and tensor polarization. These formulae provide a\nprediction of a contribution to the spin alignment which can be compared with\nthe observations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.\n",
