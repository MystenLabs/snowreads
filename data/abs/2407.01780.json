EBCs are crucial for protecting SiC-based\nceramic matrix composite components in the hot section of gas turbine engines.\nRecent research has highlighted the potential of rare-earth phosphates as\nbetter EBC materials than third-generation rare-earth silicates for CMAS\ncorrosion resistance. However, the fracture of EBCs under CMAS corrosion during\nservice remains a significant concern. This work investigates the fracture\nbehavior of LuPO4 using mesoscale simulation and experiments. The model uses\nmicrographs taken from fabricated EBC samples for mesoscale fracture\nsimulations. The simulation results are compared with experimental fracture\ntoughness data and validated using statistical tests (p<0.01). The simulation\nresults and experimental observations demonstrate that LuPO4 may exhibit higher\nfracture resistance than Lu2SiO5 rare-earth silicate under similar CMAS\ncorrosion conditions, offering potential insights for future EBC design and\ndevelopment.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Yq6fIx5Mt62DOIwMf857OOG9mQBBK40A7TOxQEtjaGU","pdfSize":"2010382"}
