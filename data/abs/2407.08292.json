In addition to\nthose, an unentangled quantum state can also exhibit nonclassicality, as\nevidenced from notions such as quantum discord and work deficit. Here, we\npropose a general framework to investigate nonclassical correlations in\nmultipartite quantum states. The distinct signatures left on observable\nquantities, depending on whether the sub-parts of a composite system are probed\nseparately or jointly, provide an operational avenue to construct different\nquantifiers that faithfully capture signatures of nonclassicality in quantum\nstates. Along the line we unveil an intriguing phenomenon referred to as\n`nonlocal locking of observable quantities', where the value of an observable\nquantity gets locked in the correlation of a nonclassical state. Our approach\nreduces the experimental demand for verification of nonclassicality in\ncomposite systems and can find applications for enhanced energy storage in\nquantum thermodynamical devices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AkPkZnyDTWkV4oez1-KiXaC5jCRTXvhBOfjR3rzva-0","pdfSize":"1021069"}
