DBD plasma augmentation\nschemes allow for significant performance improvements. However, the\ntransitions to sliding discharge or counter-flow discharge limit their use in\nhigh-power arrays. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the performance of a\nscalable DBD array for two alternating phases of air-exposed electrode\nconfiguration. Plasma emissions, direct thrust, velocity profiles, and power\nconsumption measurements of the DBD array reveal that cross-talk between DBD\nstages can be eliminated to create high-power density actuators. AC\naugmentation of plasma provides additional gains in thrust; however, the\ntransition to sliding and filamentary discharge reveals geometric limits when\nincreasing the array power density. Introducing a segmented electrode with a\nresistor delays the onset of adverse sliding and filamentary discharge,\nallowing it to operate at higher voltage inputs. An optimized four-stage DBD\narray generated thrust > 250 mN/m with a wall jet thickness > 15 mm, enabling a\nbroader range of flow control applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"ZaHTJChfhFiusMlWTy8Nvf0oL37oMOsmqrr-hbXQlfc","pdfSize":"1837132"}
