Furthermore, we generalize\nthe well known nontangential and horocyclic approach regions of the unit circle\nto this new kind of boundary. We also introduce the concept of a composition\nfactor of $k$, of which contractive multipliers are a special case. Using these\nnotions, we obtain a far reaching generalization of the Julia-Carath\\'eodory\ntheorem, stated on an arbitrary set. As an application we prove Julia's lemma\nin this setting and give sufficient conditions for the convergence of iterates\nof some self maps. We also improve the classical theorem on the unit disk for\ncontractive multipliers of standard weighted Dirichlet spaces. Many examples\nand questions are provided for these novel objects of study.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vDatBQayD3vFXc2mjpauvLrWBnLE2OlWIeeNn3pmR78","pdfSize":"283574"}
