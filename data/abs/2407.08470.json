By architectural expansion\nCoT, the proposed model extends its architecture to a 3D format, integrates it\nsmoothly with the base model to utilize the complex contextual information\nfound in MRI scans, emphasizing how elements rely on each other across an\nextended spatial range. The proposed model synchronizes tumor mass\ncharacteristics from CoT, mutually reinforcing feature extraction, facilitating\nthe precise capture of detailed tumor mass structures, including location,\nsize, and boundaries. Several experimental results present the outstanding\nsegmentation performance of the proposed method in comparison to current\nstate-of-the-art approaches, achieving Dice score of 82.0%, 81.5%, 89.0% for\nEnhancing Tumor, Tumor Core and Whole Tumor, respectively, on BraTS2019.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"9G4xMLhedDQsjJPPNWt8n1F2Z4tbMKsUpsS405i9uVY","pdfSize":"1702935","objectId":"0x781c9dfa5cb372a0fee649f3e46fa9fa9ff2c70efd2bb59d336b99bf94af5e01","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
