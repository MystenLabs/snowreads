  "abstract": "  Two main ingredients of current particle physics\n  such as local gauge symmetry and mass generation via the Higgs mechanism\nbeing basic ground of the Standard Model are widely confirmed by\n  experimental data. However, some problems such as neutrino masses, dark\nmatter, baryon asymmetry of Universe have clearly indicated that the Standard\nModel cannot be the ultimate theory of nature. To surpass the mentioned\npuzzles,\n  many extensions of the Standard Model (called beyond Standard Model) have\nbeen proposed. Among beyond Standard Models, the 3-3-1 models have some\nintriguing features and they get wide attention. The pioneer models develop in\nsome directions. In this paper, %some new main versions of the 3-3-1 models and\ntheir consequences are presented.\n",
