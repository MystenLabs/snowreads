Our model draws on the success of\nprevious learning-based feature detection and description methods. To better\nleverage unlabeled data and constrain the model to reproduce relevant\nkeypoints, we integrate a keypoint-based segmentation task. It is trained in a\nself-supervised manner by enforcing segmentation consistency between different\naugmentations of the same image. By incorporating a keypoint augmented\nself-supervised layer, we achieve robust feature extraction across modalities.\nExtensive evaluation on two public datasets and one in-house dataset\ndemonstrates significant improvements in performance for modality-agnostic\nretinal feature alignment.
