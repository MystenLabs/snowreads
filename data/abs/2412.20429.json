  "abstract": "  To improve the cognitive autonomy of humanoid robots, this research proposes\na multi-scenario reasoning architecture to solve the technical shortcomings of\nmulti-modal understanding in this field. It draws on simulation based\nexperimental design that adopts multi-modal synthesis (visual, auditory,\ntactile) and builds a simulator \"Maha\" to perform the experiment. The findings\ndemonstrate the feasibility of this architecture in multimodal data. It\nprovides reference experience for the exploration of cross-modal interaction\nstrategies for humanoid robots in dynamic environments. In addition,\nmulti-scenario reasoning simulates the high-level reasoning mechanism of the\nhuman brain to humanoid robots at the cognitive level. This new concept\npromotes cross-scenario practical task transfer and semantic-driven action\nplanning. It heralds the future development of self-learning and autonomous\nbehavior of humanoid robots in changing scenarios.\n",
