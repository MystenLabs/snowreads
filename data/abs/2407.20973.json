This paper delves into the\nimpact of integrating convexification and domain reduction techniques within\nthe Outer- Approximation method. We propose a refined convexification-based\nOuter-Approximation method alongside a Branch-and-Bound method for both convex\nand nonconvex Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming problems. These methods have\nbeen developed and incorporated into the open-source Mixed-Integer Nonlinear\nDecomposition Toolbox for Pyomo-MindtPy. Comprehensive benchmark tests were\nconducted, validating the effectiveness and reliability of our proposed\nalgorithms. These tests highlight the improvements achieved by incorporating\nconvexification and domain reduction techniques into the Outer-Approximation\nand Branch-and-Bound methods.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"2JCLdA4aVwcWXZtV2cobTrjNFONXmQ_ZbrYDHV-tpn4","pdfSize":"1117280"}
