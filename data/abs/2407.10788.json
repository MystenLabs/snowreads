However, for AGN detected all-sky, the\nphotometry is limited and provided by different projects. This makes the task\nof homogenising the data challenging and is a dramatic drawback for the\nmillions of AGN that wide surveys like SRG/eROSITA will detect. This work aims\nto compute reliable photometric redshifts for X-ray-detected AGN using only one\ndataset that covers a large area: the 10th Data Release of the Imaging Legacy\nSurvey (LS10) for DESI. LS10 provides deep grizW1-W4 forced photometry within\nvarious apertures, thus avoids issues related to the cross-calibration of\nsurveys. We present the results from CircleZ, a machine-learning algorithm\nbased on a Fully Connected Neural Network. CircleZ uses training sample of\n14,000 X-ray-detected AGN and utilizes multi-aperture photometry. The accuracy\nand the fraction of outliers reached in a test sample of 2913 AGN are 0.067 and\n11.6%, respectively. The results are comparable to or better than those\nobtained previously for the same field but with much less effort. We further\ntested the stability of the results by computing the photometric redshifts for\nthe sources detected in CSC2 and Chandra-COSMOS Legacy, reaching comparable\naccuracy as in eFEDS when limiting the magnitude of the counterparts with\nrespect to the depth of LS10. The method applies to fainter samples of AGN\nusing deeper optical data from future surveys (e.g., LSST, Euclid), granted\nLS10-like information on the light distribution beyond a morphological type is\nprovided. With the paper, we release an updated version of the photometric\nredshifts (including errors and probability distribution function) for\neROSITA/eFEDS.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"sF3kFD_pPWX5QpTe9ylcIePYqaKvskAFYiKJXp6PI4E","pdfSize":"9027287"}
