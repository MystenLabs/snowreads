Specifically, we study inflaton\nscattering with its decay product, where the couplings involved in this $2 \\to\n2$ scattering are the same as those in the $1 \\to 3$ graviton Bremsstrahlung\nprocess. We compute the graviton production rate via such $2 \\to 2$ scattering.\nAdditionally, we compare the resulting GW spectrum with that from\nBremsstrahlung as well as that from pure $2 \\to 2$ inflaton scatterings. For\ncompleteness, the GW spectrum from graviton pair production through one-loop\ninduced $1 \\to 2$ inflaton decay is also analyzed. With a systematic comparison\namong the four sources of GWs, we find that $2 \\to 2$ inflaton scattering with\nits decay product can dominate over Bremsstrahlung if the reheating temperature\nis larger than the inflaton mass. Pure inflaton $2 \\to 2$ scattering is\ntypically subdominant compared to Bremsstrahlung except in the high-frequency\ntail. The contribution from one-loop induced $1 \\to 2$ inflaton decay is shown\nto be suppressed compared to Bremsstrahlung and pure inflaton $2 \\to 2$\nscattering.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qmpWjbe4OmfvYZPWfG6xNR2IoZtyW1aqmuO0GtfU7z8","pdfSize":"2641092"}
