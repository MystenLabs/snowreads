  "abstract": "  Using the Metropolis algorithm, we simulate the relaxation process of the\nthree-dimensional kinetic Ising model. Starting from a random initial\nconfiguration, we first present the average equilibration time across the\nentire phase boundary. It is observed that the average equilibration time\nincreases significantly as the temperature decreases far from the critical\ntemperature $T_{\\rm c}$. The average equilibration time along the first-order\nphase transition (1st-PT) line exhibits an ultra-slow relaxation. We also\ninvestigate the dynamic scaling behavior with system sizes, and find that\ndynamic scaling holds not only near $T_{\\rm c}$, but also at $T\\ll T_{\\rm c}$.\nThe dynamic exponent at $T\\ll T_{\\rm c}$ is larger than that near $T_{\\rm c}$.\nAdditionally, we analyze the dynamic scaling of the average autocorrelation\ntime and find that it depends on system size only near $T_{\\rm c}$, while it\nbecomes size-independent both above and below $T_{\\rm c}$. The extremely slow\nrelaxation dynamics observed near the 1st-PT is attributed to the complex\nstructure of the free energy.\n",
