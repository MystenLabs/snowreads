  "abstract": "  These lecture notes cover advanced topics in linear regression, with an\nin-depth exploration of the existence, uniqueness, relations, computation, and\nnon-asymptotic properties of the most prominent estimators in this setting. The\ncovered estimators include least squares, ridgeless, ridge, and lasso. The\ncontent follows a proposition-proof structure, making it suitable for students\nseeking a formal and rigorous understanding of the statistical theory\nunderlying machine learning methods.\n",
