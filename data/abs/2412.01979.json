To address this, we propose a novel framework, FGATT, that\ncombines the Fuzzy Graph Attention Network (FGAT) with the Transformer encoder\nto perform robust and accurate data imputation. FGAT leverages fuzzy rough sets\nand graph attention mechanisms to capture spatial dependencies dynamically,\neven in scenarios where predefined spatial information is unavailable. The\nTransformer encoder is employed to model temporal dependencies, utilizing its\nself-attention mechanism to focus on significant time-series patterns. A\nself-adaptive graph construction method is introduced to enable dynamic\nconnectivity learning, ensuring the framework's applicability to a wide range\nof wireless datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods in imputation accuracy and robustness,\nparticularly in scenarios with substantial missing data. The proposed model is\nwell-suited for applications in wireless sensor networks and IoT environments,\nwhere data integrity is critical.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Information Retrieval","Computer Science/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CNIaD0y_VvE5lBqeTZ6oLL4CJEZ01YoHXBr6PSyztDQ","pdfSize":"1435333"}
