  "abstract": "  Categorical symmetries have recently been shown to generalize the\nclassification of phases of matter, significantly broadening the traditional\nLandau paradigm. To test these predictions, we propose a simple spin chain\nmodel that encompasses all gapped phases and second-order phase transitions\ngoverned by the categorical symmetry $\\mathsf{Rep}(D_8)$. This model not only\ncaptures the essential features of non-invertible phases but is also\nstraightforward enough to enable practical realization. Specifically, we\noutline an implementation using neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezer\narrays. Employing a dual-species setup and Rydberg blockade, we propose a\ndigital simulation approach that can efficiently implement the many-body\nevolution in several nontrivial quantum phases.\n",
