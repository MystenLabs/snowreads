These rationality criteria are analogous to the\nnecessary and sufficient criteria for finite-type solutions to be periodic.\nHowever, in contrast to the periodic case, they are not in themselves\nsufficient for Durham conditions to be satisfied on both boundary components:\ncertain additional criteria must also be satisfied at 4 specific points of the\nspectral curve. Nevertheless, in the special case where the Durham conditions\nimposed on the two boundary components are complementary to one another in a\nsense that we will clarify, these rationality criteria are, indeed, sufficient.\nThis study is a necessary preliminary for any general construction of\nfinite-type solutions of the elliptic sinh-Gordon equation subject to Durham\nboundary conditions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AJgB-QJ0fO_ZIgEKjPRvXSigfck5xsLB5ZWbkBymC5o","pdfSize":"364260"}
