Using a reversible Turing machine interpreter, we show that\nthe first Futamura and inversion projections can produce not only functionally\nbut also textually equivalent programs. The construction of the interpreter in\na reversible flowchart language is shown in full. Insights are provided on the\npractical interplay between reversible interpreters, program inverters, and\npartial evaluators. We conclude that both projections must be included in the\nprogram transformation toolbox.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Programming Languages","Computer Science/Formal Languages and Automata Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4QtboKT0icKLH0XgjnVu6jcFb4ulLKZkqzsfQi6piBE","pdfSize":"566194"}
