In this article, we show a similar result through a more direct\napproach relying on the original Brooks/Buser-Sarnak surfaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FtU7wI2gXqfWGlx8sdn6cuv_PVsTEBLZIGhfUEW30XI","pdfSize":"134926"}
