  "abstract": "  Let $F$ be a non-Archimedean local field of characteristic zero and\n$G=\\GL(2,F)$. Let $n\\geq 2$ be a positive integer and\n$\\widetilde{G}=\\widetilde{\\GL}(2,F)$ be the $n$-fold metaplectic cover of $G$.\nLet $\\pi$ be an irreducible smooth representation of $G$ and $\\pi^{\\vee}$ be\nthe contragredient of $\\pi$. Let $\\tau$ be an involutive anti-automorphism of\n$G$ satisfying $\\pi^{\\tau}\\simeq \\pi^{\\vee}$. In this case, we say that $\\tau$\nis a dualizing involution. A well known theorem of Gelfand and Kazhdan says\nthat the standard involution $\\tau$ on $G$ is a dualizing involution. In this\npaper, we show that any lift of the standard involution to $\\widetilde{G}$ is a\ndualizing involution if and only if $n=2$.\n",
