As such, they provide a scheme to study the no boundary proposal,\nspecifically the nothing to something transition and compute relevant\nobservables using high performance computing (HPC). Following recent advances,\nwhere stochastic algorithms (Markov Chain Monte Carlo-MCMC) were used, we\nemploy Generative Flow Networks, a newly developed machine learning algorithm\nto compute the expectation value of the dihedral angle for a 4-simplex and\ncompare the results with previous works.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"j1yanua0xQqzc_e-pbP21g1EawAEtcINtM7JpMKSN44","pdfSize":"930773"}
