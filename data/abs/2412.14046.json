  "abstract": "  A search for exotic decays of the 125 GeV Higgs boson into a pair of new\nspin-0 particles, $H \\to aa$, where one decays into a photon pair and the other\ninto a $\\tau$-lepton pair, is presented. Both $\\tau$-leptons are reconstructed\nin the hadronic decay modes using a dedicated tagger for collimated\n$\\tau$-lepton pairs. The search uses 140 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision\ndata at a centre-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV recorded between 2015 and\n2018 by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. The search is\nperformed in the mass range of the $a$ boson between 10 GeV and 60 GeV. No\nsignificant excess of events is observed above the Standard Model background\nexpectation. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the branching\nratio of the Higgs boson to the $\\gamma\\gamma\\tau\\tau$ final state,\n$\\mathcal{B}(H\\to aa\\to \\gamma\\gamma\\tau\\tau)$, ranging from 0.2% to 2%,\ndepending on the $a$-boson mass hypothesis.\n",
