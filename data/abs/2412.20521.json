While some characteristics, like color, are visible, others, such as\nSoluble Solid Content (SSC), or sugar content measured in degrees Brix\n({\\deg}Brix), require specific tools. SSC is a key quality factor that\ncorrelates with ripeness, but lacks a direct causal relationship with color.\nHyperspectral cameras can estimate SSC with high accuracy under controlled\nlaboratory conditions, but their practicality in field environments is limited.\nThis study investigates the potential of simple RGB sensors under uncontrolled\nlighting to estimate SSC and color, enabling cost-effective, robot-assisted\nharvesting. Over the 2021 and 2022 summer seasons, we collected grape images\nwith corresponding SSC and color labels to evaluate algorithmic solutions for\nSSC estimation on embedded devices commonly used in robotics and smartphones.\nOur results demonstrate that SSC can be estimated from visual appearance with\nhuman-like performance. We propose computationally efficient histogram-based\nmethods for resource-constrained robots and deep learning approaches for more\ncomplex applications.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"poTkLk7dXQo_TpL4ZbpZ4H2cCdTz5tOcLMEWXJRbebw","pdfSize":"5995238"}
