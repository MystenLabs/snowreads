Specifically, we characterize viscosity solutions to the\n$p$-Laplace equation $\\Delta_p u:=\\nabla\\cdot(|\\nabla u|^{p-2} \\nabla u) = f$\nwith a nontrivial right-hand side $f$, through novel asymptotic mean value\nformulas. While asymptotic mean value formulas for the homogeneous case ($f =\n0$) have been previously established, leveraging the normalization\n$\\Delta_p^{\\text{N}}u:=|\\nabla u|^{2-p} \\Delta_p u = 0$, which yields the\n1-homogeneous normalized $p$-Laplacian, such normalization is not applicable\nwhen $f \\neq 0$. Furthermore, the mean value formulas introduced here motivate,\nfor the first time in the literature, a game-theoretical approach for\nnon-homogeneous $p$-Laplace equations. We also analyze the existence,\nuniqueness, and convergence of the game values, which are solutions to a\ndynamic programming principle derived from the mean value property.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uMbyW19O0xHp-0mMYcucwauSuciMIfRwZPGOz8grA3U","pdfSize":"437012"}
