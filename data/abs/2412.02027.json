This paper shows a complete UV realization of a\nsecluded WIMP dark matter model with an extra Abelian gauge symmetry that\nincludes two-component dark matter candidates, where the dark matter conversion\nprocess plays a significant role in determining the relic density in the\nUniverse. The model contains two new unstable mediators: a dark Higgs and a\ndark photon. It generates Dirac neutrino masses and can be tested in future\ndirect detection experiments of dark matter. The model is also compatible with\ncosmological and theoretical constraints, including the branching ratio of\nStandard model particles into invisible, Big Bang nucleosynthesis restrictions,\nand the number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the early Universe, even\nwithout kinetic mixing.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"aadChBonTqvHx9GN0UMMX8049G6LqJ2qOBud9Uv6UEc","pdfSize":"1881577"}
