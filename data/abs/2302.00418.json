Contrary to popular beliefs, we find that small deployments (less\nthan 40 validators) can benefit from the small storage footprint of BLS\nmulti-signatures while larger deployments should favor EdDSA to improve\nperformance. As an independent contribution, we present a novel way for\ncommittee-based consensus protocols to verify BLS multi-signed certificates by\nmanipulating the aggregated public key using pre-computed values.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Z-dbgtn9vGSsMrPmnNNR0kSdFmF3n-R8Tr5fU6Ehkj8","pdfSize":"424576"}
