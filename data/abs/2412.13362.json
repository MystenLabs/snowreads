Specifically, we first show\nthat, on the one hand, it is possible to observe any possible values of\ncoskewness among symmetric random variables but zero pairwise correlations of\nthese variables. On the other hand, it is also possible to have zero coskewness\nand any level of correlation. Second, we generalize this result to the case of\narbitrary marginal distributions showing the absence of a general link between\nrank correlation and standardized rank coskewness.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Economics/Theoretical Economics","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"V7_4GGdT_OHBfUezv63GIH6mS9xyozeJSrewAX5VMXU","pdfSize":"495639"}
