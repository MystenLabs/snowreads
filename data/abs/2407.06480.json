It provides a unique opportunity to probe the\ncorrelation between the polarized quark and antiquark in the strongly coupled\nquark-gluon plasma (sQGP) produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions,\nopening a new window to explore the properties of sQGP. In addition, spin\nalignments of vector mesons have also been observed in other high-energy\nparticle collisions such as $e^+e^-$ annihilations at high energies where\nhadron production is dominated by quark fragmentation mechanism. The results\nobtained are quite different from those obtained in heavy ion collisions where\nquark coalescence/combination mechanism dominates suggesting strong dependence\non hadronization mechanisms. So comprehensive studies in different\nhadronization processes are needed. In this article, we present a brief review\nof theoretical and experimental advances in the study of vector meson's spin\nalignments in a variety of high-energy particle collisions, with emphasis on\nhadronization mechanisms.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uODU7eWMC1exVsFPqWeUl9CPjwf0BHEGPe0fPv6Cotk","pdfSize":"4007522"}
