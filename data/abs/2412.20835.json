  "abstract": "  In this paper, we present a constructive generalization of metric and uniform\nspaces by introducing a new class of spaces, called cover spaces. These spaces\nform a topological concrete category with a full reflective subcategory of\ncomplete spaces. This subcategory is closely related to a particular\nsubcategory of locales, offering an alternative approach to localic completion.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate how this framework provides simple constructive\ndefinitions of compact spaces, uniform convergence, and limits of nets.\n",
