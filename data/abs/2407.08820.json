We characterize the graphs whose associated\nmatching polytopes are Gorenstein, and then prove that all Gorenstein matching\npolytopes possess the integer decomposition property. As a special case study,\nwe examine the matching polytopes of wheel graphs and show that they are not\nGorenstein, but do possess the integer decomposition property.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UEnNv2clfNJQKph5KmTtDNepXqD1n3xLcUqmpVX29Ko","pdfSize":"270969"}
