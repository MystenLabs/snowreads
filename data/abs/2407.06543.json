Such concept drifts\ndegrade the model's prediction performance, and therefore we require methods to\novercome these issues. The initial step is to identify concept drifts and have\na training method in place to recover the model's performance. Most concept\ndrift detection methods work on detecting concept drifts and signalling the\nrequirement to retrain the model. However, in real-world cases, there could be\nconcept drifts that recur over a period of time. In this paper, we present an\nunsupervised method based on Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN) to detect\nconcept drifts and identify whether a specific concept drift occurred in the\npast. Our method reduces the time and data the model requires to get up to\nspeed for recurring drifts. Our key results indicate that our proposed model\ncan outperform the current state-of-the-art models in most datasets. We also\ntest our method on a real-world use case from astrophysics, where we detect the\nbow shock and magnetopause crossings with better results than the existing\nmethods in the domain.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"l5Mes6uXwgYPkW7rfLmSGsqsKpv9_dk-h3HzT9xPuxQ","pdfSize":"174520"}
