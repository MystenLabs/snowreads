Our results for the $1s$-$2p_{1/2}$ transition for\nthe hydrogen isoelectronic sequence show that the perturbed-orbital part of the\nself-energy correction provides the dominant contribution, accounting for\napproximately 99\\% of the total correction for this transition. Detailed\ncalculations were performed for $ns$-$n'p$ and $np$-$n'd$ transitions in H-like\ncaesium. We conclude that the perturbed-orbital part remains dominant also for\nother $ns$-$n'p$ transitions, whereas for the $np$-$n'd$ matrix elements this\ndominance no longer holds. Consequently, the self-energy corrections for the\n$np$-$n'd$ one-electron matrix elements cannot be well reproduced by means of\neffective QED operators constructed for energy levels.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Id9KtTficR7Di7x-hGsIWLJ_wAkEV62HnrtsF2dbh7Y","pdfSize":"625335"}
