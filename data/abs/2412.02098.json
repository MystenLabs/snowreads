  "abstract": "  We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of a groundstate fermionic many\nbody gas subjected to a quench between parameter regimes of a topologically\nnontrivial Hamiltonian. By focusing on the role of the chiral edge states\ninherent to the system, we calculate the many body overlap and show that the\ncharacteristic monotonic decay of the orthogonality catastrophe with increasing\nsystem size is notably altered. Specifically, we demonstrate that the dynamics\nare governed not solely by the total particle number but rather by the number\nof occupied single particle edge states. This behavior is further explained\nthrough an analysis of the full work probability distribution, providing a\ndeeper understanding of the system's dynamics.\n",
