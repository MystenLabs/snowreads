However, when any digital image is sent electronically or captured\nvia camera, it is likely to get corrupted or degraded by the available of\ndegradation factors. To eradicate this problem, several image denoising\nalgorithms have been proposed in the literature focusing on robust, low-cost\nand fast techniques to improve output performance. Consequently, in this\nresearch project, an earnest effort has been made to study various image\ndenoising algorithms. A specific focus is given to the start-of-the-art\ntechniques namely: NL-means, K-SVD, and BM3D. The standard images, natural\nimages, texture images, synthetic images, and images from other datasets have\nbeen tested via these algorithms, and a detailed set of convincing results have\nbeen provided for efficient comparison.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jKeTvvHlP7_QSDCBxjeHtmYDfd2CL576w1ah7Vxl2sw","pdfSize":"5404888"}
