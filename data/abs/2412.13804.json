Identification of such\nclustering in cosmic-ray data would provide important evidence for possible\nexistence of ultra-high-energy (UHE) photons and could potentially help\nidentify their sources. We present an analysis method to search for space-time\nclustering of ultra-high-energy extensive air showers, namely the stacking\nmethod, which combines a time-clustering algorithm with an unbinned likelihood\nstudy. In addition, to enhance the capability to discriminate between signal\n(photon-initiated events) and background (hadron-initiated) events, we apply a\nphoton tag. This involves using relevant probability distribution functions to\nclassify each event as more likely to be either a photon or a hadron. We\ndemonstrate that the stacking method can effectively distinguish between events\ninitiated by photons and those initiated by hadrons (background). The number of\nphoton events in a data sample, as well as the flare(s) duration can also be\nretrieved correctly. The stacking method with a photon tag requires only a few\nevents to identify a photon flare. This method can be used to search for the\ncosmic ray sources and/or improve limits on the fluxes of UHE photons.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"ezlSYrUboG7y6X143uM3gJTuEjaTK6HyKmGKPkr-RaE","pdfSize":"790611"}
