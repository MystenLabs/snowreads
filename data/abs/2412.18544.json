Recent work showing LLM forecasters rapidly\napproaching human-level performance begs the question: how can we benchmark and\nevaluate these forecasters instantaneously? Following the consistency check\nframework, we measure the performance of forecasters in terms of the\nconsistency of their predictions on different logically-related questions. We\npropose a new, general consistency metric based on arbitrage: for example, if a\nforecasting AI illogically predicts that both the Democratic and Republican\nparties have 60% probability of winning the 2024 US presidential election, an\narbitrageur can trade against the forecaster's predictions and make a profit.\nWe build an automated evaluation system that generates a set of base questions,\ninstantiates consistency checks from these questions, elicits the predictions\nof the forecaster, and measures the consistency of the predictions. We then\nbuild a standard, proper-scoring-rule forecasting benchmark, and show that our\n(instantaneous) consistency metrics correlate with LLM forecasters' ground\ntruth Brier scores (which are only known in the future). We also release a\nconsistency benchmark that resolves in 2028, providing a long-term evaluation\ntool for forecasting.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Computation and Language","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-sIeAaFbmhEE_39V1Sz9O29jVIPWrBShbMr_PkGDWNY","pdfSize":"1475465"}
