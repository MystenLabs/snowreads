More precisely, this paper establishes the upper semi-continuity\nof the entropy map in the following two cases:\n  (1) if a sequence of invariant measures has only positive Lyapunov exponents\nalong a sub-bundle and non-positive Lyapunov exponents along another\nsub-bundle, then the upper limit of their metric entropies is less than or\nequal to the entropy of the limiting measure; (2) if an invariant measure has\npositive Lyapunov exponents along a sub-bundle and non-positive Lyapunov\nexponents along another sub-bundle, then the entropy map is upper\nsemi-continuous at this measure.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"olmyscbQs5_6pnt_SqnYWs3OZsfkiAk-QMuoUgMrDw0","pdfSize":"219363"}
