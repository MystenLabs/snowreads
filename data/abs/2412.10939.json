Through an analysis of\ncase studies in language modelling, behavioural testing, and multi-modal\nalignment, this study identifies a significant gap between the ideas of\nhuman-centricity and actual practices. Key issues include misalignment with\nhuman-centred design principles, the reduction of human factors to mere\nbenchmarks, and insufficient consideration of real-world impacts. The\ndiscussion explores whether Human-Centric NLP embodies true human-centred\ndesign, emphasising the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and ethical\nconsiderations. The paper advocates for a redefinition of Human-Centric NLP,\nurging a broader focus on real-world utility and societal implications to\nensure that language technologies genuinely serve and empower users.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computers and Society","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"k-nMp2XE7J1OiLz5Tqz-ws14y0GFttSuDMdIK15JN3s","pdfSize":"143756"}
