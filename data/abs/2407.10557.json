We prove several results regarding their\nanalyticity, shapes and asymptotics, and we introduce the associated L\\'evy\nprocesses as well as their main properties. We study the behaviour of these\nprocesses under change of measure, their simulations and the structure of their\nsample paths, and we introduce a stock market model constructed by means of\nexponential BGIG processes. Based on real market data, we show that this model\nis easy to calibrate thanks notably to idiosyncratic properties of BGIG\ndistributions, and that it is well suited to Monte Carlo and Fourier option\npricing.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"62xy_03cGKPzWez95tK1NOIVPZvhLAbcG8OjkQzASCI","pdfSize":"1416893","objectId":"0x217ca5242533b1e84ab8e33cbbb69d5c1e8f7eaa4168b7ee172e1f2d3c6dc880","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
