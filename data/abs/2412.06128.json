To address these issues, a\ncomprehensive traffic management program has been introduced, aimed at\nenhancing the regulation and control of traffic flow, thereby ensuring faster\nand safer travel. By leveraging data collected from various regions, tailored\ntraffic management strategies can be implemented to meet the specific needs of\ndifferent city sectors. This approach involves continuous monitoring of traffic\nconditions and the application of targeted interventions to mitigate congestion\nand improve overall traffic efficiency. A case study in Tehran exemplifies the\napplication of this program. A designated section of the city's traffic network\nis being utilized to test the program's efficacy. The objective is to assess\nits practical effectiveness under real-world conditions and refine the program\nbased on empirical findings. This initiative aims to provide a robust solution\nto Tehran's traffic challenges, contributing to improved traffic management and\nenhanced safety.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0m-h5GeT-eNIXCcmU0VizRsrodtc_sdKOqTUXi7IqCk","pdfSize":"366937"}
