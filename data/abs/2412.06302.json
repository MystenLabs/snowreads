These new bosons $\\phi$ and $Z'$ naturally appear in models\nwith a new $U(1)$ gauge symmetry which is spontaneously broken and introduced\nin various new physics scenarios. The branching ratio of $Z \\to Z' \\phi \\to Z'\nZ' Z'$ can be larger than $10^{-12}$, which gives $O(1)$ events at Tera-Z\nexperiments, when a product of $g_X^{}$ (new gauge coupling) and $\\zeta$\n($Z$-$Z'$ mixing) is larger than around $10^{-6}$. We find that the search for\n$Z \\to Z'Z'Z'$ can significantly improve the current bound on a kinetic mixing\nparameter $\\epsilon$ in the dark photon case, where $\\epsilon \\gtrsim 10^{-6}$\nwith $g_X^{}={\\cal O}(1)$ can be explored at Tera-Z experiments. We also show\nthat a sufficiently large number of events with multi-lepton plus hadronic jets\ncan be obtained in benchmark points, which cannot be realized by the usual\ndecay of Z in the standard model.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ioNgeHH7xpzXG2sFsbiQeuO6MAH_Ju2KtAaw2eR9pZk","pdfSize":"709338"}
