SNOLAB is also host to existing\nfacilities, or plans to host future projects, that can enhance sensitivity to\nthese neutrinos. These detectors, together with others worldwide both in\nexistence and planned, will provide insights to a variety of different models\nusing neutrinos from the next galactic supernova.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"DGfy6JVzBD1A1hHem-2gFTafcDyIG3AMeUve94ifLIs","pdfSize":"2775734"}
