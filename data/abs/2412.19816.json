But how far back does this tradition really extend? Our survey\nof the literature to date has revealed a long history of scintillating\nobservations, beginning with the oral traditions of Indigenous peoples from\naround the globe, encompassing the works of the Ancient Greeks and Renaissance\nscholars, and continuing right through into modern optics, astronomy and space\nscience. We outline here the major steps that humanity has taken along this\njourney, using scintillation as a tool for predicting first terrestrial, and\nthen space weather without ever having to leave the ground.\n","subjects":["Physics/Space Physics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"P-9sETOeha-XG7pLadHCX0QoYn0t9TiiNC_Hia22xT8","pdfSize":"1389443"}
