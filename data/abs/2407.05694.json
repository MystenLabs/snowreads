However, in order to grapple with whether these\nthresholds will achieve anything, we must first understand how they came to be.\nTo do so, we need to engage with a decades-old debate at the heart of computer\nscience progress, namely, is bigger always better? Does a certain inflection\npoint of compute result in changes to the risk profile of a model? Hence, this\nessay may be of interest not only to policymakers and the wider public but also\nto computer scientists interested in understanding the role of compute in\nunlocking breakthroughs. This discussion is timely given the wide adoption of\ncompute thresholds in both the White House Executive Orders on AI Safety (EO)\nand the EU AI Act to identify more risky systems. A key conclusion of this\nessay is that compute thresholds, as currently implemented, are shortsighted\nand likely to fail to mitigate risk. The relationship between compute and risk\nis highly uncertain and rapidly changing. Relying upon compute thresholds\noverestimates our ability to predict what abilities emerge at different scales.\nThis essay ends with recommendations for a better way forward.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"ZC6YxwL-MlHsT76KONz63YUm_921fSIHJ_8n2qvG2cI","pdfSize":"3694793"}
