Our\ntreatment establishes the functional equation for algebraic $p$-adic\n$L$-functions (which are given in terms of characteristic ideals of Selmer\ngroups, which arise as the cohomology of appropriately defined Selmer complexes\nin degree $2$). This is achieved by recovering the characteristic ideal as the\ndeterminant of the said Selmer complex, once we prove (under suitable but\nrather mild) hypotheses that the Selmer complex in question is perfect with\namplitude $[1,2]$, and its cohomology is concentrated in degree-2. The\nperfectness of these Selmer complexes turns out to be a delicate problem, and\nthe required properties require a study of Tamagawa factors in families, which\nmay be of independent interest.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"a7L-aJ8TAzUaoxrmk3lv7Jav2X6xyFtY-eTpNyn1U4w","pdfSize":"698863"}
