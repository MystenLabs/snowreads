  "abstract": "  Eigenfunctions expansion for discrete symplectic systems on a finite discrete\ninterval is established in the case of a general linear dependence on the\nspectral parameter as a significant generalization of the Expansion theorem\ngiven by Bohner, Do\\v{s}l\\'{y} and Kratz in [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 361\n(2009), 3109--3123]. Subsequently, an integral representation of the\nWeyl--Titchmarsh $M({\\lambda})$-function is derived explicitly by using a\nsuitable spectral function and a possible extension to the half-line case is\ndiscussed. The main results are illustrated by several examples.\n",
