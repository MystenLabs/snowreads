Condition (1) is known for metric manifolds satisfying\nthe LLC condition by work of Basso--Marti--Wenger, while (3) is known for\nmetric surfaces by work of Ntalampekos--Romney.\n  We prove that for metric manifolds with finite Nagata dimension, all three\nconditions are equivalent and that without assuming finite Nagata dimension,\n(1) implies (2) and (3) implies (1). As a corollary we obtain a generalization\nof the approximation result of Ntalampekos--Romney to metric manifolds of\ndimension $n\\ge 2$, which have the LLC property and finite Nagata dimension.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"7-iuAKfxmFyeMXaSjPjhJaIvq4QbSxa6Dbk5N7jjWow","pdfSize":"346387"}
