However,\nsuch development has also brought challenges to network optimizations. Thanks\nto the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recent years, tools\nincluding Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) have been developed and applied\nin various fields including networking, and have shown their effectiveness.\nTaking one step further, the integration of knowledge graphs into RAG\nframeworks further enhanced the performance of RAG in networking applications\nsuch as Intent-Driven Networks (IDNs) and spectrum knowledge maps by providing\nmore contextually relevant responses through more accurate retrieval of related\nnetwork information. This paper introduces the RAG framework that integrates\nknowledge graphs in its database and explores such framework's application in\nnetworking. We begin by exploring RAG's applications in networking and the\nlimitations of conventional RAG and present the advantages that knowledge\ngraphs' structured knowledge representation brings to the retrieval and\ngeneration processes. Next, we propose a detailed GraphRAG-based framework for\nnetworking, including a step-by-step tutorial on its construction. Our\nevaluation through a case study on channel gain prediction demonstrates\nGraphRAG's enhanced capability in generating accurate, contextually rich\nresponses, surpassing traditional RAG models. Finally, we discuss key future\ndirections for applying knowledge-graphs-empowered RAG frameworks in\nnetworking, including robust updates, mitigation of hallucination, and enhanced\nsecurity measures for networking applications.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xD7X5kX2znaMe9x5j1tK7Wl158iNCYujqcHtcU8lL3Y","pdfSize":"5283679"}
