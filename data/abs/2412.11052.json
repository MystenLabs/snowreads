We show that consistent field equations can be\nobtained through the dimensional reduction of the higher-spin extension of\nself-dual Yang-Mills theory, which itself is a truncation of chiral higher-spin\ngravity in four dimensions. The resulting electromagnetic field satisfies the\nBogomolny equation, and the interaction is non-minimal with the gyromagnetic\nratio given by $g=1/s$, where $s$ is the spin. As a by-product, we obtain a new\nLagrangian for free massive higher-spin fields in $3d$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rb6-AICO5Q8ywG41WtrUATJnbpD4sY5Mh_pIvYdh-ec","pdfSize":"297094"}
