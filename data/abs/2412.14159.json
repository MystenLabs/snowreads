Strong lensing\nmakes this possible when two or more images of the lensed GW source are\nobserved, as each image essentially allows the observer to see the GW source\nfrom different directional lines-of-sight. If the GW source is moving relative\nto the lens and observer, the observed GW signal from one image will therefore\ngenerally appear blue- or redshifted compared to GW signal from the other\nimage. This velocity induced differential Doppler shift gives rise to an\nobservable GW phase shift between the GW signals from the different images,\nwhich provides a rare glimpse into the relative motion of GW sources and their\nhost environment across redshift. We illustrate that detecting such GW phase\nshifts is within reach of next-generation ground-based detectors such as\nEinstein Telescope, that is expected to detect $\\sim$hundreds of lensed GW\nmergers per year. This opens up completely new ways of inferring the\nenvironment of GW sources, as well as studying cosmological velocity flows\nacross redshift.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"izkCfRhC0G3oNBpZB1cM3TDh21vVVmfSTUKtCZv4R_U","pdfSize":"1848449"}
