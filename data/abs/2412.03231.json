  "abstract": "  This paper is part of a series of articles in which we reproduce the\nstatements regarding the abstract six-functor formalism developed by Liu-Zheng.\nIn this paper, we prove a theorem, which is an $\\infty$-categorical version for\ndefining the exceptional pushforward functor in an abstract-six functor\nformalism. The article describes specific combinatorial simplicial sets related\nto compactifications and pullback squares. This theorem plays a key role in\nconstructing the abstract six-functor formalism, which will be discussed in the\nforthcoming article.\n",
