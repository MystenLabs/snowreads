The insurer's\nsurplus process is modeled approximately by a drifted Brownian motion, and the\nfinancial market is comprised of a risk-free asset and a risky asset with its\nprice depicted by Heston's stochastic volatility (SV) model. Within a game\ntheory framework, a strict verification theorem is formulated to delineate the\nequilibrium reinsurance and investment strategies as well as the corresponding\nvalue function. Furthermore, through solving the pseudo Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman\n(HJB) system, semi-analytical formulations for the equilibrium reinsurance and\ninvestment strategies and the associated value function are obtained under the\nexponential utility. Additionally, several numerical experiments are carried\nout to demonstrate the characteristics of the equilibrium reinsurance and\ninvestment strategies.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BjH0NCYtJOr-2CRmeTf9Yo8a4aOkPFWAxyQyr_gXO9w","pdfSize":"848729"}
