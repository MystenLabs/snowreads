We\ninvestigate differently sized, but identically charged particles with nearly\nidentical interactions between all species in highly dilute suspensions.\nDifferent short-time self-diffusion coefficients induce, mediated by\nelectrostatic interactions, a coupling of both self and collective dynamics of\ndifferently sized particles: The long-time self-diffusion coefficients of a\nlarger species are increased by the presence of a more mobile, smaller species\nand vice versa. Similar coupling effects are observed in collective dynamics\nwhere in addition to the time constant of intermediate scattering function's\ninitial decay its functional form, quantified by exponents of a stretched\nexponential decay, are influenced by the presence of a differently sized\nspecies. We provide a systematic analysis of coupling effects in dependence on\nthe ratio of sizes, number densities, and the strength of electrostatic\ninteractions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mWnktXUXo1N0JPPB93SttEzVJdH5J_3RVvPxAHoUktI","pdfSize":"375825"}
