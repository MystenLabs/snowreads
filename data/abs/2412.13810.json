Our framework is able to assess the\nimpact of generated CAD commands on geometry and adapts subsequent actions\nbased on the evolving state of the CAD design. We consider a wide range of\nCAD-specific tools including Python libraries, modules of the FreeCAD Python\nAPI, helpful routines, rendering functions and other specialized modules. We\nevaluate our method on multiple CAD benchmarks and qualitatively demonstrate\nthe potential of tool-augmented VLLMs as generic CAD task solvers across\ndiverse CAD workflows.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"KSIvupL0JVp8_1fJM_xB0JC4CXQHWGF7OIZvzy6E8sw","pdfSize":"7208569"}
