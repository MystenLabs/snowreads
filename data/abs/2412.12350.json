A robust feature\nset is integrated combining momentum-based indicators, fundamental factors, and\nanalyst recommendations. Using various statistical tests for feature selection,\nthe strategy identifies key drivers of equity performance and ranks stocks to\nbuild a balanced portfolio of long and short positions. Portfolio construction\nmethods, including equally weighted, risk parity, and minimum variance\nbeta-neutral approaches, were evaluated through rigorous backtesting. Risk\nparity demonstrated superior performance with a higher Sharpe ratio, lower\nbeta, and smaller maximum drawdown compared to the Standard and Poor's 500\nindex. Risk parity's market neutrality, combined with its ability to maintain\nsteady returns and mitigate large drawdowns, makes it a suitable approach for\nmanaging significant capital in equity markets.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Trading and Market Microstructure"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EdzjiRCL4Q7lKR7zPxHiefG-itn_OhxrO0_PoLOyPyk","pdfSize":"711686"}
