The yielding solid Earth due to the force has been\nthought to be a prolate ellipsoid since the time of Lord Kelvin, yet the\nellipsoid's geometry such as semi-major axis's length, semi-minor axis's\nlength, and oblateness remains unresolved. Additionally, the tidal displacement\nof solid Earth is conventionally resolved through a combination of expanded\npotential equations and given Earth model. Here we present a geometric model in\nwhich both the ellipsoid's geometry and the tidal displacement of solid Earth\ncan be resolved through a rotating ellipse with respect to the Moon (Sun). We\ntest the geometric model using 23-year gravity data from 22 superconducting\ngravimeter (SG) stations and compare it with the current model recommended by\nthe IERS (International Earth Rotation System) conventions (2010), the average\nRoot Mean Square (RMS) deviation of the gravity change yielded by the geometric\nmodel against observation is 6.47 {\\mu}Gal (equivalent to 2.07 cm), while that\nyielded by the current model is 30.77{\\mu}Gal (equivalent to 9.85 cm). The\ngeometric model represents a significant advance in understanding and\npredicting solid Earth tide, and will greatly contribute to many application\nfields such as geodesy, geophysics, astronomy, and oceanography.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"gxyinMCstZSpTekmKGPIB6_vL796X_ePGqMbFbX-sAg","pdfSize":"1216701"}
