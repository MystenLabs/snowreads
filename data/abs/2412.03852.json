  "abstract": "  In this paper, we build some ergodic theorems involving function $\\Omega$,\nwhere $\\Omega(n)$ denotes the number of prime factors of a natural number $n$\ncounted with multiplicities. As a combinatorial application, it is shown that\nfor any $k\\in \\mathbb{N}$ and every $A\\subset \\mathbb{N}$ with positive upper\nBanach density, there are $a,d\\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that\n$$a,a+d,\\ldots,a+kd,a+\\Omega(d)\\in A.$$\n",
