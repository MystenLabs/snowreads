With recent advances in producing\nhigh-brightness electron beams via laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA), the\nmethod has also been applied to evaluate emittance in this new regime [1-3]. In\nthis work, we explore the limitations of the method in inferring the emittance\nand beam waist of LWFA electron beams, showing that the technique becomes\ninaccurate for small emittance values.\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XjLfwa8dIgJkXAdwHfRORGnOsbVnQotTrcadMtf8M-k","pdfSize":"3366097"}
