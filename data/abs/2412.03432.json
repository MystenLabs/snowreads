  "abstract": "  Numerous observations on astrophysical and cosmological scales can be\ninterpreted to mean that, in addition to the familiar kind of matter well\ndescribed by the standard model of elementary particle physics, there exists\nDark Matter (DM). The fundamental properties of the elementary particles which\nmake up the DM e.g. particle mass, spin, couplings etc are currently being\nobservationally constrained. In particular, if DM particles have spin zero,\nthere exist recent constraints which suggest a lower limit on its mass which is\noften a couple of orders of magnitude larger than $10^{-22}$ eV. In this talk,\nwe will (a) argue that these limits are based on the assumption that the self\ncoupling of the spinless DM particles is negligible, and, (b) show how some of\nthese lower limits will get modified in the presence of incredibly feeble self\ninteractions.\n",
