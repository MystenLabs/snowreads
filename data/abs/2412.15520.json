  "abstract": "  A recently proposed scheme utilizing local noise addition and matrix masking\nenables data collection while protecting individual privacy from all parties,\nincluding the central data manager. Statistical analysis of such\nprivacy-preserved data is particularly challenging for nonlinear models like\nlogistic regression. By leveraging a relationship between logistic regression\nand linear regression estimators, we propose the first valid statistical\nanalysis method for logistic regression under this setting. Theoretical\nanalysis of the proposed estimators confirmed its validity under an asymptotic\nframework with increasing noise magnitude to account for strict privacy\nrequirements. Simulations and real data analyses demonstrate the superiority of\nthe proposed estimators over naive logistic regression methods on\nprivacy-preserved data sets.\n",
