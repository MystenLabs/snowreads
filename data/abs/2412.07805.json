This paper aims to reduce the memory\nfootprint of these computations. It presents a new construction, the distilled\nVietoris Rips filtration, and proves that its persistent homology is isomorphic\nto that of standard Vietoris Rips. The distilled complex is constructed using a\ndiscrete Morse vector field defined on the reduced Vietoris Rips complex. The\nalgorithm for building and reducing the distilled filtration boundary matrix is\nhighly parallelisable and memory efficient. It can be implemented for point\nclouds in any metric space given the pairwise distance matrix.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XynI0DL48Ojnj1ShvMLBxd03fmlkanpvalIgutLJD_4","pdfSize":"506457"}
