I.e we wish to find\ncrystals with negative formation energy, if it turns out that these structures\nare very anisotropic that would be an indication of brittleness (as a ductile\nmaterial will generally be homogeneous). We'll do this by exploiting the\nadvantage that ab initio simulations (done using Quantum ESPRESSO (opEn-Source\nPackage for Research in Electronic Structure, Simulation, and Optimization)\ngive full control over defining the crystal: We'll tell exactly where we want\nto have every atom, and with DFT we'll calculate the internal energy that\ncorresponds to such a crystal. The whole project is open source on github and\nas we haven't found the answer yet, everyone who is interested is welcome to\ncontribute.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VtdZtth6BNElEtKTWQoSemeLwp9vlDE-VyUAOg3Wg3o","pdfSize":"2469238"}
