As the Dolbeault complex in\ncomplex analysis, the Dirac complex resolving several Dirac operators plays the\nfundamental role to investigate monogenic functions. Although the spaces in the\nDirac complex are complicated irreducible modules of ${\\rm GL}(k),$ we give a\nsimple characterization of the first four spaces, which allows us to write down\nfirst three operators in the Dirac complex explicitly and to show this part to\nbe an elliptic complex. Then the PDE method can be applied to obtain solutions\nto the non-homogeneous several Dirac equations under the compatibility\ncondition, which implies the Hartogs' phenomenon for monogenic functions.\nMoreover, we find the boundary version of several Dirac operators and introduce\nthe notion of a tangentially monogenic function, corresponding to tangential\nCauchy-Riemann operator and CR functions in several complex variables, and\nestablish the Hartogs-Bochner extension for tangentially monogenic functions on\nthe boundary of a domain.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4PZjAPqeenp8Gby9tTBpvS2NEIV51Vyv7KBj1AdKrnE","pdfSize":"367938"}
