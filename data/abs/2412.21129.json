Originally proposed in a paper\nby Yang, this problem was further examined by Debruyne and Tenenbaum for weight\nfunctions taking positive integer values. We establish an asymptotic formula\nfor this generating series in a broader context, which notably can be used for\nthe class of multiplicative functions. Moreover, we employ a classical result\nby Montgomery-Vaughan to estimate exponential sums with additive coefficients,\nsupported on minor arcs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nMOQcXC2tRhC3vQioKKPwy1cC5Q2KfnamZ4bhIz4slE","pdfSize":"415707"}
