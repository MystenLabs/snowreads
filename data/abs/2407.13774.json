Many\nhave attempted to take the corollary as the third law, but two counterexamples\nhas been constructed explicitly. We present a theorem that the vanishing of\nheat capacity as the third law implies an existence of singular systems, and\ntwo known counterexamples are illustrations of the theorem.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HMwBXXnpqPTDiRl-N8NhG5cEJymzq9oAn1ikBcFA6P8","pdfSize":"84144"}
