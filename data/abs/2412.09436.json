This approach utilizes a general formalism to analyze the evolution\nof Gaussian states of a quantized field, in the Schrodinger picture in the\npresence of a background electric field. We numerically solve the resulting\nnonlinear equations using initial data that consists of a Gaussian scalar field\nstate. This provides a self-consistent semiclassical evolution incorporating\nthe non-perturbative backreaction from particle production. We study the\ntime-dependent particle content, current density, and electric field, which are\ndefined in terms of the concept of instantaneous eigenstates, and describe how\nthey capture the time evolution of the quantized field modes. We then compare\nthe results with and without backreaction in flat and cosmological de Sitter\nspacetime, finding that the backreaction significantly alters particle\nproduction in both cases.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"3gGQF1uqzyB_xvJCusWS-Fw_HZb6XD0Zu_Sn9wsFsFo","pdfSize":"1094731"}
