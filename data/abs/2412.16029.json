This extends the result of Buyalo, Dranishnikov and\nSchroeder in which they prove that a hyperbolic group quasiisometrically embeds\ninto a product of binary trees. Inspired by Buyalo, Dranishnikov and\nSchroeder's Alice's Diary, we develop a general theory of diaries and linear\nstatistics. These notions provide a framework by which one can take a\nquasiisometric embedding of a metric space into a product of infinite-valence\ntrees and upgrade it to a quasiisometric embedding into a product of binary\ntrees.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-2o9NGRUEeM4gupPA-mC88odTXroRqAxZ733bivKTuE","pdfSize":"937489"}
