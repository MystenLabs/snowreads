Traditional predictive modeling\ntools frequently have difficulty acquiring sufficient and diverse data because\nhealthcare institutions have privacy rules in place. In our study, we modeled\nthis problem as an empirical graph where nodes are the hospitals. This modeling\napproach facilitates collaborative model training by modeling decentralized\ndata sources from different hospitals without extracting sensitive data outside\nof hospitals. A local model is trained on a node (hospital) by aiming the\ngeneralized total variation minimization (GTVMin). Moreover, we implemented and\ncompared two different federated learning optimization algorithms named\nfederated stochastic gradient descent (FedSGD) and federated averaging\n(FedAVG). Our results show that federated learning enables accurate prediction\nof hospital LOS while addressing privacy concerns without extracting data\noutside healthcare institutions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"EhVkZsvkv2jfCRjcexwbkmNvIiNYkf4CiytoMW7PwDk","pdfSize":"363375","objectId":"0x5877d60e870ca9b8e01354b71c1be5981982135bc23a30351be1e7d9bd8ae49b","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
