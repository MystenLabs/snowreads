Digitized historical\nobservations are used to build a database of individual magnetic plage regions\nfrom 1923 to 1985. The regions are selected by thresholding in Ca II K synoptic\nmaps, with polarities constrained using Mount Wilson Observatory sunspot\nmeasurements. The resulting data show weak evidence for tilt quenching, but\nmuch stronger evidence for latitude-quenching. Further, we use proxy\nobservations of the polar field from faculae to construct a best-fit surface\nflux transport model driven by our database of emerging regions. A better fit\nis obtained when the sunspot measurements are used, compared to a reference\nmodel where all polarities are filled using Hale's Law. The optimization\nsuggests clearly that the \"dynamo effectivity range\" of the Sun during this\nperiod should be less than 10 degrees; this is also consistent with latitude\nquenching being dominant over tilt quenching.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"B5w_8n6BGEtMPtNHJCUOkqMBO5TLBqkKgLy9SCfEfPk","pdfSize":"3699805"}
