Despite being spoken\nby over 30 million people, Yoruba has been severely underrepresented in NLP\nresearch and applications. We detail our methodology for creating this dataset,\nwhich includes careful source selection, automated quality control, and\nrigorous data cleaning processes. The Yankari dataset comprises 51,407\ndocuments from 13 diverse sources, totaling over 30 million tokens. Our\napproach focuses on ethical data collection practices, avoiding problematic\nsources and addressing issues prevalent in existing datasets. We provide\nthorough automated evaluations of the dataset, demonstrating its quality\ncompared to existing resources. The Yankari dataset represents a significant\nadvancement in Yoruba language resources, providing a foundation for developing\nmore accurate NLP models, supporting comparative linguistic studies, and\ncontributing to the digital accessibility of the Yoruba language.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UA7LpPzQtsF3HBGXlpSLvKUKpBARfDPN6J8jAMhzsxo","pdfSize":"99733"}
