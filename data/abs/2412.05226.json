  "abstract": "  Two hallmarks of quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement are the\nensemble-level conservation of the expectation value of the measured observable\n$A$ and the eventual, inevitable collapse of the system into some eigenstate of\n$A$. This requires that $A$ commutes with $H$, the system's Hamiltonian. In\nwhat we term \"non-QND\" measurement, $A$ does not commute with $H$ and these two\ncharacteristics clearly cannot be present as the system's dynamics prevent\n$\\langle A \\rangle$ from reaching a stable value. However, in this paper we\nfind that under non-QND conditions, QND-like behavior can still arise, but is\nseen in the behavior of a secondary observable we call $B$, with the condition\nthat $B$ commutes with both $A$ and $H$. In such cases, the expectation value\nof $B$ is conserved and the system at least partially collapses with respect to\neigenstates of $B$. We show as an example how this surprising result applies to\na Heisenberg chain, where we demonstrate that local measurements on a single\nsite can reveal information about the entire system.\n",
