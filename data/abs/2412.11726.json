  "abstract": "  The study of some parametric integrals is presented with a combined approach\nof analytical development, the usage of a Computed Algebra System (CAS) and of\nthe Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. The methodology for the solution\nincludes a) an analytical investigation for the study of the parametric\nintegral, b) computations with a CAS of the integral for specific values of the\nparameter, c) investigation of the connection between the integral and special\nfunctions or classical numbers, and d) derivation of a general algorithm for\nthe complete computation of the parametric integral. The central example of the\npaper is the parametric integral \\begin{equation*} \\label{the general integral}\nI_{n}^{(p)}=\\int_0^{\\pi /4} x^p \\tan^n x\\; dx, \\end{equation*} The work reveals\na connection of this parametric integral with Catalan numbers.\n",
