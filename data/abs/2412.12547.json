  "abstract": "  Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have played an increasingly important role in\nmilitary operations and social life. Among all application scenarios,\nmulti-target tracking tasks accomplished by UAV swarms have received extensive\nattention. However, when UAVs use radar to track targets, the tracking\nperformance can be severely compromised by jammers. To track targets in the\npresence of jammers, UAVs can use passive radar to position the jammer. This\npaper proposes a system where a UAV swarm selects the radar's active or passive\nwork mode to track multiple differently located and potentially jammer-carrying\ntargets. After presenting the optimization problem and proving its solving\ndifficulty, we use a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm to solve this\ncontrol problem. We also propose a mechanism based on simulated annealing\nalgorithm to avoid cases where UAV actions violate constraints. Simulation\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.\n",
