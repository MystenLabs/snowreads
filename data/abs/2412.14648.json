An optimization was\nperformed using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) implemented in MATLAB, targeting the\nmaximization of the realized gain in the end-fire direction. Three primary\nexcitation schemes were evaluated: the conventional optimization to achieve\nsuperdirectivity (signal magnitude and phase angle), phase-only optimization,\nand uniform excitation (characterized by equal amplitude and no phase shift).\nThe results show that by carefully optimizing both the signal magnitudes and\nphase angles, the array could achieve a substantial improvement in realized\ngain. Phase-only optimization provided a competitive realized gain with only\nminor reductions compared to conventional optimization, suggesting that\noptimizing the signal phase alone can be an effective strategy in practical\nimplementations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"uqHeI4UyPTtywhXA_udruoGPOlwmsQ_eRMD-_WPf1jQ","pdfSize":"348638"}
