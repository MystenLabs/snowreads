  "abstract": "  As an update to our previously performed Bayesian inference analyses of the\nneutron star matter equation-of-state and related quantities, the additional\nimpact of the recently published NICER data of PSR J0437-4751 is examined.\nIncluding the mass and radius distributions of this pulsar in our data base\nresults in modest shifts from previously inferred median posterior values of\nradii $R$ and central densities $n_c$ for representative $1.4\\,M_\\odot$ and\n$2.1\\,M_\\odot$ neutron stars: radii are reduced by about $0.2-0.3$ km to values\nof $R_{1.4} = 12.1\\pm 0.5$ km and $R_{2.1} = 11.9^{+0.5}_{-0.6}$ km (at the\n68\\% level); central densities increase slightly to values of\n$n_c(1.4\\,M_\\odot)/n_0 = 2.8\\pm 0.3$ and $n_c(2.1\\,M_\\odot)/n_0 =\n3.8_{-0.7}^{+0.6}$ (in units of equilibrium nuclear matter density, $n_0 =\n0.16$ fm$^{-3}$), i.e., they still fall below five times nuclear saturation\ndensity at the 68\\% level. As a further significant result, the evidence\nestablished by analyzing Bayes factors for a negative trace anomaly measure,\n$\\Delta = 1/3-P/\\varepsilon < 0$, inside heavy neutron stars is raised to\nstrong.\n",
