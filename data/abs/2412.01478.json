  "abstract": "  We present the discovery of the fourth persistent radio source (PRS)\nassociated with a fast radio burst (FRB). Following previous indications of a\ncandidate PRS associated with FRB20240114A, we performed deep VLBA observations\nat 5 GHz to test the presence of a compact radio source within the uncertainty\nposition of this FRB ($\\pm$200 mas). We detect a component $\\sim$50 mas\nnorthwards the nominal position provided by the PRECISE collaboration. The\ncorresponding radio luminosity, together with the Faraday rotation measure\nprovided by previous observations of the FRB, locate this PRS in the expected\nregion of the $L$ vs |RM| relation for the nebular model, further supporting\nit. The comparison of the measured flux density with the values collected at\nlower frequency by previous studies indicates a possible steepening of the\nradio spectrum in the 1-5 GHz range. Optical observations performed with the\nLBT could reveal that the FRB and its PRS lie at $\\sim$1 kpc from the centre of\nthe host galaxy, which is a dwarf sub-solar metallicity starburst galaxy with\nSFR $\\sim 1 M_\\odot\\;\\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ and stellar mass $M\\sim10^8 M_\\odot$.\n",
