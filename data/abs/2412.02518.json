  "abstract": "  The solar radiative zone spin down problem is treated without internal\ngravity waves, IGW. The shear-only model of the Reynolds stresses adopted thus\nfar in all calculations, is substituted by a shear vorticity model. The latter\ncomponent is shown to play a role analogous to the IGW and with a similar time\nscale of about 107years.\n",
