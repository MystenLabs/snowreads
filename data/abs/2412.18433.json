Neutrino flavour oscillation experiments are insensitive to Majorana\nphases, which leads to using the PMNS matrix with only one phase to describe\nflavour transitions. In this paper, we point out one feature of such choice\nthat is commonly ignored: when neutrinos propagate in matter, the reduced\nunitary matrix PMNS does not properly diagonalize the neutrino system. We\npresent some numerical calculations and analytical estimations to illustrate\nsuch statement, and discuss some scenarios where this effect can be probed.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"FMpRtYc4K8AHdBezHKIorMf6EgywNpRjIihZRXHgN9s","pdfSize":"331349"}
