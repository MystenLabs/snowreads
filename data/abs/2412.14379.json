Current state-of-the-art detectors\ntypically rely on either two-stage or one-stage approaches, often employing\nAnchor-based strategies, which can result in computationally expensive\noperations due to the redundant number of generated anchors during training. In\ncontrast, Anchor-free mechanisms offer faster processing but suffer from a\nreduction in the number of training samples, potentially impacting detection\naccuracy. To address these limitations, we propose the Hybrid-Anchor Rotation\nDetector (HA-RDet), which combines the advantages of both anchor-based and\nanchor-free schemes for oriented object detection. By utilizing only one preset\nanchor for each location on the feature maps and refining these anchors with\nour Orientation-Aware Convolution technique, HA-RDet achieves competitive\naccuracies, including 75.41 mAP on DOTA-v1, 65.3 mAP on DIOR-R, and 90.2 mAP on\nHRSC2016, against current anchor-based state-of-the-art methods, while\nsignificantly reducing computational resources.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"k8yc8RpCkFJK_2YPItodm84scmFaEWp9XQiyuV9eReA","pdfSize":"1570695"}
