Apart from that, a development environment was set up by\ninstalling TensorFlow, OpenCV and Python. Through exploratory data analysis\n(EDA), significant insights into the distribution and interactions of dataset\nfeatures were obtained, which are crucial for evaluating various cyberthreats.\nThe construction and evaluation of logistic regression and support vector\nmachine (SVM) models revealed that the SVM model outperforms logistic\nregression in accuracy. The paper delves into the intricacies of data\npreprocessing, EDA, and model development, offering valuable insights into\nnetwork protection and cyberthreat response.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"xC_bBx1ZE2iZFSbX4dZhHy9p6aCnt68KvYhLyJemj9g","pdfSize":"570077"}
