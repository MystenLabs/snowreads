However, the\nmathematical foundations of these ODEs, particularly the singular HiPPO-LegS\n(Legendre Scaled) ODE, and their corresponding numerical discretizations remain\nunexplored. In this work, we fill this gap by establishing that HiPPO-LegS ODE\nis well-posed despite its singularity, albeit without the freedom of arbitrary\ninitial conditions, and by establishing convergence of the associated numerical\ndiscretization schemes for Riemann-integrable input functions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HekNEm2aOWEIwy8ZFvOhFrbrMIAonybuQZW-E9sJpIE","pdfSize":"222520"}
