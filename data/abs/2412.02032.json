Spatially selective delivery to cells that is simultaneously precise,\nconsistent, and non-destructive remains challenging using conventional\nstate-of-the-art techniques. Here, we introduce a carrier-free method for\nspatiotemporal delivery of fluorescently labeled cargo into both adherent and\nsuspension cells using carbon-black-embedded polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)\nsubstrates irradiated by nanosecond laser pulses. This low-cost, biocompatible\nmaterial, coupled with an optical approach, enables scalable, spatially\nselective, and sequential delivery of multiple cargo molecules, including\nFITC-dextran and siRNA, to a broad range of cells. Notably, we achieved siRNA\ndelivery into the cytoplasm of hard-to-transfect K562 cells with 45%\nefficiency, while maintaining nearly 100% cell viability.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"49cO9TVUo30f7ox-JzbHdNRG5C08lHPfRldeCV-r4d4","pdfSize":"8639711"}
