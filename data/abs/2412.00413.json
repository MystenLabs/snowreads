  "abstract": "  In this article, we investigate the large-time behavior of small solutions to\na system of one-dimensional cubic nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equations with two\ncomponents. In previous studies, a structural condition on the nonlinearity has\nbeen employed to guarantee the existence of a coercive, mass-type conserved\nquantity. We identify a new class of systems that do not satisfy such a\ncondition and thus lack a coercive conserved quantity. Nonetheless, we\nestablish the global existence and describe the large-time behavior for small\nsolutions in this class. In this setting, the asymptotic profile is described\nin terms of solutions to the corresponding system of ordinary differential\nequations (ODEs). A key element of our analysis is the use of a quartic\nconserved quantity associated with the ODE system. Moreover, for a specific\nexample within this class, we solve the ODE system explicitly, showing that the\nasymptotic behavior is expressed using Jacobi elliptic functions.\n",
