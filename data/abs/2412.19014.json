  "abstract": "  This paper investigates a novel structure of stratified L-convex groups,\ndefined as groups possessing stratified L-convex structures, in which the group\noperations are L-convexity-preserving mappings. It is verified that stratified\nL-convex groups serve as objects, while L-convexity-preserving group\nhomomorphisms serve as morphisms, together forming a concrete category, denoted\nas SLCG. As a specific instance of SLCG (i.e., when L=2), the category of\nconvex groups, denoted as CG, is also defined. We show that CG can be embedded\nwithin SLCG as a reflective subcategory. In addition, we demonstrate that SLCG\npossesses well-defined characterizations, localization properties, and initial\nand final structures, establishing it as a topological category over groups.\n",
