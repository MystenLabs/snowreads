Models and\ntheoretical considerations indicate that the runaway greenhouse on Earth-like\nexoplanets is generally accompanied by a dramatic increase in atmospheric\nH$_2$O and CO$_2$, which might be observed with the upcoming generation of\nspace telescopes. If an active biosphere extends the habitable timespan of\nexoplanets similarly to Earth, observing the atmospheric spectra of exoplanets\nnear the inner edge of the habitable zone could then give insights into whether\nthe planet is inhabited. Here, we explore this idea for Earth-like stagnant-lid\nplanets. We find that while for a reduced mantle, a surface biosphere extends\nthe habitable timespan of the planet by about 1 Gyr, for more oxidising\nconditions, the biologically enhanced rate of weathering becomes increasingly\ncompensated for by an increased supply rate of CO$_2$ to the atmosphere.\nObservationally, the resulting difference in atmospheric CO$_2$ near the inner\nedge of the habitable zone is clearly distinguishable between biotic planets\nwith active weathering and abiotic planets that have experienced a runaway\ngreenhouse. For an efficient hydrological cycle, the increased bioproductivity\nalso leads to a CH$_4$ biosignature observable with JWST. As the planet becomes\nuninhabitable, the H$_2$O infrared absorption bands dominate, but the\n4.3-micron CO$_2$ band remains a clear window into the CO$_2$ abundances. In\nsummary, while the effect of life on the carbonate-silicate cycle leaves a\nrecord in the atmospheric spectrum of Earth-like stagnant-lid planets, future\nwork is needed especially to determine the tectonic state and composition of\nexoplanets and to push forward the development of the next generation of space\ntelescopes.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PAtJK1YI45XvU3RfYdU8gCVAD599ZiQ9iHhc1OXdusE","pdfSize":"9920151"}
