We prove the result by exhibiting a long-time Ricci\nflow solution with faster than $1/t$ curvature decay, which allows us to shift\nthe limiting contradiction argument to time infinity and thus obtain an\nexplicit bound on the size of the gap.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VZTD9FkwQf-9B1nO936zz5FPIzOAfzo1poVXbllP5Ko","pdfSize":"359653"}
