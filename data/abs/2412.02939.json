The\nnonlinear Hall effect, characterized by a nonlinear scaling of Hall voltage\nwith longitudinal current, has been explored to reveal the Berry curvature and\nquantum metric related physics. In this work, we extend the study of nonlinear\ntransport to spin and valley degrees of freedom. Using bilayer graphene devices\nwith Fe3GeTe2 contacts, we observe a second-order nonlinear spin current\nexhibiting spin valve-like behaviors. By tracking magnetic moment precession\nunder an in-plane magnetic field, we identify a significantly enhanced critical\nmagnetic field required for in-plane rotation, suggesting out-of-plane valley\npolarization induced by ferromagnetic proximity. These findings offer deep\ninsights into the interplay of valley and spin in second-order nonlinear\ntransport, opening avenues for promising device applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kgCl2GxG5zP78Ta_Sg6Or_xEjmlylEXPXkb68VSyl8c","pdfSize":"5168254"}
