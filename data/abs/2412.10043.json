The coil was produced using PCB technology to provide mechanical\nstability and easy integration close to the magnetic sensors. The transducer\ndesign strategy relies on an inverse boundary element method, which has been\nefficiently adapted to produce optimal multilayer PCB coils subjected to\ndifferent geometrical and performance constraints. The resulting coil\ntransducer was simulated and experimentally validated under realistic\nconditions where the payload is magnetically shielded from low-frequency\nfluctuations by using a three-layer cylindrical mu-metal enclosure. The results\nshow that the specific transducer coil proposed efficiently produces stable\nmagnetic conditions for adequate validation of the magnetic diagnostic system\nwhile providing reduced power dissipation and optimal mechanical stability.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"60jixXNiZ4S2eVssmiSkAYPglEzgs-tPQs0tSz0hFdc","pdfSize":"10874138"}
