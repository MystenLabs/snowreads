{"id":"2412.15258","title":"DisEmbed: Transforming Disease Understanding through Embeddings","authors":"Salman Faroz","authorsParsed":[["Faroz","Salman",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2024 12:04:22 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-12-23","timestamp":1734350662000,"abstract":"  The medical domain is vast and diverse, with many existing embedding models\nfocused on general healthcare applications. However, these models often\nstruggle to capture a deep understanding of diseases due to their broad\ngeneralization across the entire medical field. To address this gap, I present\nDisEmbed, a disease-focused embedding model. DisEmbed is trained on a synthetic\ndataset specifically curated to include disease descriptions, symptoms, and\ndisease-related Q\\&A pairs, making it uniquely suited for disease-related\ntasks. For evaluation, I benchmarked DisEmbed against existing medical models\nusing disease-specific datasets and the triplet evaluation method. My results\ndemonstrate that DisEmbed outperforms other models, particularly in identifying\ndisease-related contexts and distinguishing between similar diseases. This\nmakes DisEmbed highly valuable for disease-specific use cases, including\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) tasks, where its performance is\nparticularly robust.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"e7BP07MP6dN0jXH2w7n1Ve9shL0ZpQY8YEPoGalmdPU","pdfSize":"292749"}
