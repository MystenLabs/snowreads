  "abstract": "  We generalize the notion of rapid decay property for a group $G$ to pairs of\ngroups $(G,H)$ where $H$ is a finitely generated subgroup of $G$, where\ntypically the subgroup $H$ does not have rapid decay. We deduce some\nisomorphisms in $K$-theory, and investigate relatively spectral injections in\nthe reduced group $C^*$-algebra. Rapid decay property for the pair $(G,H)$ also\ngives a lower bound for the probability of return to $H$ of symmetric random\nwalks on $G$.\n",
