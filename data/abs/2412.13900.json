In this work, we\nleverage fiber-coupled devices, which encompass fibered photon pair-sources and\noff-the-shelf optics, to demonstrate Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. We employ two\ndistinct single photon sources, namely an heralded single-photon source and a\nweak coherent laser source, both operating asynchronously in continuous-wave\nregime. We record two-photon coincidences, showing a state-of-art visibility of\n91.9(5)\\%. This work, compliant with telecom technology provides realistic\nbackbones for establishing long-range communication based on quantum\nteleportation in hybrid quantum networks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EXadKYpNNpk2UomnLbggOjcsoYU8R7npEdUU0WCCZgI","pdfSize":"778755"}
