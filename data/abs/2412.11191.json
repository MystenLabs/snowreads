We show that in the Cohen model of set\ntheory ZFC there is no embedding of the product $(c_0(2^\\omega))^{\\mathbb{N}}$\nof infinitely many copies of the abelian C*-algebra $c_0(2^\\omega)$ into\n$\\mathcal{Q}(\\ell_2)$ (while $c_0(2^\\omega)$ always embeds into\n$\\mathcal{Q}(\\ell_2)$). This enlarges the collection of the known examples due\nto Vaccaro and to McKenney and Vignati of abelian algebras, asymptotic sequence\nalgebras, reduced products and coronas of stabilizations which consistently do\nnot embed into the Calkin algebra. As in the Cohen model the rigidity of\nquotient structures fails in general, our methods do not rely on these rigidity\nphenomena as is the case of most examples mentioned above. The results should\nbe considered in the context of the result of Farah, Hirshberg and Vignati\nwhich says that consistently all C*-algebras of density up to $2^\\omega$ do\nembed into $\\mathcal{Q}(\\ell_2)$. In particular, the algebra\n$(c_0(2^\\omega))^{\\mathbb{N}}$ consistently embeds into the Calkin algebra as\nwell.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras","Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_GB4jmS8ne3REj3DnIuTqlJayLs-eYVyhHnk4d4hOEo","pdfSize":"277561"}
