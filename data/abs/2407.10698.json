Using a dataset primarily composed of wide-field imaging\nfrom the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) and supplemented by additional photometric\nand spectroscopic resources, we searched ~ 70% of the sky area probability for\ntransient phenomena, and discovered 6 counterpart candidates. One especially\npromising candidate - AT 2023aagj - exhibited temporally varying asymmetric\ncomponents in spectral broad line regions, a feature potentially indicative of\nan off-center event such as a BBH merger. This represents the first live search\nand multiwavelength, photometric, and spectroscopic monitoring of a GW BBH\noptical counterpart candidate in the disk of an AGN.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"G83dzl1UFCJSicqpoGtMqQa8uDXFId8SbD7zraCejpM","pdfSize":"8584024","objectId":"0xaac64790d56f24d0302e07fbb4e365089da95ab362869c81d1a405147df4f0f5","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
