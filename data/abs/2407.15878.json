Specifically, we utilize an\nensemble model built on transfer learning algorithms to forecast wildfires. The\nkey focus is on understanding the significance of weather sequences, human\nactivities, and specific weather parameters in wildfire prediction. The study\nencounters challenges in acquiring real-time data for training the network,\nespecially in Moroccan wildlands. The future work intends to develop a global\nmodel capable of processing multichannel, multidimensional, and unformatted\ndata sources to enhance our understanding of the future entropy of surface\ntiles.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"7EM05w67LNOG-A5TAZl6NXXuR4Ay9I0QrFg7Tshw4tk","pdfSize":"111217"}
