  "abstract": "  We derive constraints on dimension-six light-quark dipole operators within\nthe Standard Model (SM) effective field theory, based on measurements of $Z$\nproduction at SLC and LEP, as well as $Z$+jet production at the LHC. Our new\nconstraints exclude the parameter space that could potentially explain the\nobserved discrepancy between theoretical predictions and experimental data for\nthe Lam-Tung relation. With these updated limits, we model-independently\ndetermine the maximum possible influence that beyond-SM contributions could\nhave on the angular coefficients $A_0$ and $A_2$, which enter the Lam-Tung\nrelation.\n",
