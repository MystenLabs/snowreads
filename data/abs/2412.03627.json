According to Bhavale and Waphare, if a dismantlable\nlattice of nullity k contains r reducible elements then 2 $\\leq$ r $\\leq$ 2k.\nIn 2003 Pawar and Waphare counted all non-isomorphic lattices with equal number\nof elements and edges, which are precisely the lattices of nullity one.\nRecently, Bhavale and Aware counted all non-isomorphic lattices on n elements\nhaving nullity up to two. Bhavale and Aware also counted all non-isomorphic\nlattices on n elements, containing up to three reducible elements, having\nnullity k $\\geq$ 2. In this paper, we count up to isomorphism the class of all\nlattices on n elements containing four comparable reducible elements, and\nhaving nullity three.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"uqgNq-1MDDTERSbwKcsnYYeymB1Q1AtbfyOHHESzsGc","pdfSize":"339021"}
