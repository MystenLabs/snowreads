  "abstract": "  Quantum information processing comprises physical processes, which obey the\nquantum speed limit (QSL): high speed requires strong driving. Single-qubit\ngates using Rabi oscillation, which is based on the rotating wave approximation\n(RWA), satisfy this bound in the form that the gate time $T$ is inversely\nproportional to the Rabi frequency $\\Omega$, characterizing the driving\nstrength. However, if the gate time is comparable or shorter than the qubit\nperiod $T_{0} \\equiv 2\\pi / \\omega_{0}$, the RWA actually breaks down since the\nRabi frequency has to be large compared to the qubit frequency $\\omega_{0}$ due\nto the QSL, which is given as $T \\gtrsim \\pi/\\Omega$. We show that it is\npossible to construct a universal set of single-qubit gates at this\nstrong-coupling and ultrafast regime, by adjusting the central frequency\n$\\omega$ and the Rabi frequency $\\Omega$ of the driving pulse. We observe a\ntransition in the scaling behavior of the central frequency from the long-gate\ntime regime ($T \\gg T_{0}$) to the short-gate time ($T \\ll T_{0}$) regime. In\nthe former, the central frequency is nearly resonant to the qubit, i.e.,\n$\\omega \\simeq \\omega_{0}$, whereas in the latter, the central frequency is\ninversely proportional to the gate time, i.e., $\\omega \\sim \\pi/T$. We identify\nthe transition gate time at which the scaling exponent $n$ of the optimal\ncentral frequency $\\omega \\sim T^{n}$ changes from $n=0$ to $n=-1$.\n",
