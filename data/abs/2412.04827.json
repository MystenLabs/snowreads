  "abstract": "  In this paper, we present PanoDreamer, a novel method for producing a\ncoherent 360$^\\circ$ 3D scene from a single input image. Unlike existing\nmethods that generate the scene sequentially, we frame the problem as\nsingle-image panorama and depth estimation. Once the coherent panoramic image\nand its corresponding depth are obtained, the scene can be reconstructed by\ninpainting the small occluded regions and projecting them into 3D space. Our\nkey contribution is formulating single-image panorama and depth estimation as\ntwo optimization tasks and introducing alternating minimization strategies to\neffectively solve their objectives. We demonstrate that our approach\noutperforms existing techniques in single-image 360$^\\circ$ scene\nreconstruction in terms of consistency and overall quality.\n",
