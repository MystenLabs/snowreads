We calculate the\nquantum cohomology ring of $Y$ and obtain Quantum Chevalley formulas for the\nSchubert type subvarieties. The famous Dubrovin's Conjecture relating the\nquantum cohomology and the derived category is verified for $Y$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"eLYiBxDZdcVA89f6gdPHAn5zDzfeLYUTErX3669NWvA","pdfSize":"365404"}
