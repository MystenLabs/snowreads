In this paper, we consider the question of the\nexistence of an extremal function for the Delsarte extremal problem. In\nparticular, we show that there exists an extremal function for the Delsarte\nproblem when $\\Omega$ is closed, extending previously known existence results\nto a larger class of functions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4sMXw4DEBgp-XXHUdcly9E2JKMAQE_S6dRQ1XdNLXPA","pdfSize":"161729"}
