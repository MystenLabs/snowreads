Inflation is characterized by two parameters,\nthe vacuum expectation value and the mass parameter of the phase mode, which\ngive rise to a variety of inflationary structures. We categorize the potential\ntrajectories of the two inflaton fields and determine the parameter regions\nconsistent with current observational data. Furthermore, we examine the\nreheating process through the inflaton decay to right-handed neutrinos and the\nsubsequent lepton number generation within these parameter regions. Our finding\nsuggests that the existence of multiple fields can significantly alter the\npossibilities for inflaton oscillations and reheating.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5debNqcSiJrmMnTFgdxWu1ckyfZiZhVhCuFQCU5RhK8","pdfSize":"2110740"}
