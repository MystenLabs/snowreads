The spectrum forms\nclusters of size $O(1/k)$ around the sequence of natural numbers\n$k=1,2,\\ldots$, and we compute the first three terms in the asymptotic\ndistribution of the eigenvalues within the clusters, as $k\\to\\infty$ (band\ninvariants). There are two independent aspects of the proof. The first is a\nstudy of the Berezin symbol of the Dirichlet to Neumann operator, which arises\nafter one applies the averaging method. The second is the use of a symbolic\ncalculus of Berezin-Toeplitz operators on the manifold of closed geodesics of\nthe sphere.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GtPJUHcNUqeAvvN3M9AsLorpSYC0Q0bwP8OvDKkKIWg","pdfSize":"466878"}
