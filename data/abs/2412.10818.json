  "abstract": "  LaNiGa2 is a time-reversal symmetry breaking superconductor with symmetry\nprotected band crossings, making it an ideal platform for investigating the\ninterplay between unconventional superconductivity and electronic structure\ntopology. Here we present a transport study of LaNiGa2 under pressure. The\napplication of pressure to LaNiGa2 induces a significant enhancement of the\nsuperconducting transition temperature Tc at a pressure of 7 GPa. In contrast,\npowder X-ray diffraction (XRD) results show no evidence of structural phase\ntransitions up to 26.3 GPa. Moreover, the ratio of band diffusivity shows a\nsudden increase at around 7 GPa, suggesting possible pressure-induced changes\nin the electronic structure that are closely linked to the evolution of\nsuperconductivity.\n",
