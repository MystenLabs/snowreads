In this note we extend Rudnick's approach to show convergence to the\nGaussian Unitary Ensemble for twisted Laplacians which break time-reversal\nsymmetry, and to the Gaussian Symplectic Ensemble for Dirac operators. This\naddresses a question of Naud, who obtained analogous results for twisted\nLaplacians on high genus random covers of a fixed compact surface.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Spectral Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZneEpIGsx-ROU9b7l6MY4rrmEP9Xj_OvZGNLRqFK0uU","pdfSize":"207748"}
