When spinning fast enough, the optical\nforces produced by this structured light saddle generate a dynamically stable\nequilibrium point capable of trapping nanoparticles in a high vacuum, akin to a\nPaul trap but with its unique characteristics. We analyze the stability\nconditions and center-of-mass motion, dynamics and cooling of a nanoparticle\nlevitated in the optical saddle trap. We expect the optical saddle to find\napplications in levitated optomechanics experiments requiring fast parametric\nmodulation and inverted squeezing potential landscapes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eNCs4XvZl9UjBQflcnK8mGyzLP5e8yhXohpEUhw0EaY","pdfSize":"2434815","objectId":"0xf54b7654e9bf716becab467619863f13e46271727fa26799417267d665f15de9","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
