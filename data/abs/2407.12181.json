The algebraic\nresult which underlies the construction is the existence of a relative modular\nstructure on the non-finite, non-semisimple category of weight modules for the\nquantum group. We prove a Verlinde formula which allows for the computation of\ndimensions and Euler characteristics of topological field theory state spaces\nof unmarked surfaces. When $r$ is congruent to $\\pm 1$ or $\\pm 2$ modulo $8$,\nwe relate the resulting $3$-manifold invariants with physicists'\n$\\widehat{Z}$-invariants associated to $\\mathfrak{osp}(1 \\vert 2)$. Finally, we\nestablish a relation between $\\widehat{Z}$-invariants associated to\n$\\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ and $\\mathfrak{osp}(1 \\vert 2)$ which was conjectured in the\nphysics literature.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ASuULd5wfL-bPnVCgtmdIYIOcLf2N2nwOFm58b2viD0","pdfSize":"1883631"}
