  "abstract": "  Working over a field of characteristic zero, we give structure theorems for\nall grade three licci ideals and their minimal free resolutions. In particular,\nwe completely classify such ideals up to deformation. The descriptions of their\nresolutions extend earlier results by Buchsbaum-Eisenbud, Brown, and Sanchez.\nOur primary tool is the theory of higher structure maps originating from the\nstudy of generic free resolutions of length three.\n",
