  "abstract": "  This paper introduces the human-like embodied AI interviewer which integrates\nandroid robots equipped with advanced conversational capabilities, including\nattentive listening, conversational repairs, and user fluency adaptation.\nMoreover, it can analyze and present results post-interview. We conducted a\nreal-world case study at SIGDIAL 2024 with 42 participants, of whom 69%\nreported positive experiences. This study demonstrated the system's\neffectiveness in conducting interviews just like a human and marked the first\nemployment of such a system at an international conference. The demonstration\nvideo is available at https://youtu.be/jCuw9g99KuE.\n",
