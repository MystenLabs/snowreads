The relationships among relativistic torque, the center of mass,\nand the center of inertia for a spinning particle are clarified. We show that\nspin precession is accompanied by orbital angular momentum precession, and\npresent examples of the resulting out-of-plane motion.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"W9q2k-rJliZXVlVq_Y1J9Sk0imHOL9Vwr8L8aaB-dTI","pdfSize":"707897"}
