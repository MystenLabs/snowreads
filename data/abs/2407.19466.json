The\nvelocity fields obtained from both methods are quantitatively consistent. Two\ndistinct regions exist in the granular flow: the surface flow layer and the\nstatic flow regime associated with the rigid rotation near the bottom. The\nthickness of the surface flow layer increases with the drum diameter and shows\na slight dependence on the angular velocity of the rotating drum. Scaling laws\nfor the velocity profile and the surface layer thickness are derived\nanalytically based on the continuum model. The validity of the scaling laws is\nconfirmed numerically.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4oSI8vLUtwwGoUpz6sDsB3SaGG77QtXjazbVs3pz7UE","pdfSize":"571397"}
