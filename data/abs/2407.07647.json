In settings such as this, the preferred\nanalysis techniques are the g-methods, however these require the untestable\nassumption of no unmeasured confounding. Instrumental variable analyses can\nminimise bias through unmeasured confounding. Of these methods, the Two Stage\nLeast Squares technique is one of the most well used in Econometrics, but it\nhas not been fully extended, and evaluated, in full time-varying settings. This\npaper proposes a robust two stage least squares method for the econometric\nevaluation of time-varying treatment. Using a simulation study we found that,\nunlike standard two stage least squares, it performs relatively well across a\nwide range of circumstances, including model misspecification. It compares well\nwith recent time-varying instrument approaches via g-estimation. We illustrate\nthe methods in an evaluation of treatment intensification for Type-2 Diabetes\nMellitus, exploring the exogeneity in prescribing preferences to operationalise\na time-varying instrument.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5VtffiOgc63u0Og3_6eJ841DqDEKKVdvGAS8xY3E2ew","pdfSize":"412123"}
