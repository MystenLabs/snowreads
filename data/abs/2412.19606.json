In this paper, we propose 1) a novel module called Residual\nRelationship Attention (RRA) that leverages the relationships between images\nwithin each training batch to effectively integrate visual feature vectors of\nbatch images and 2) a novel technique called Relationship Position Encoding\n(RPE), which encodes the positions of relationships between original images in\na batch and effectively preserves the relationship information between images\nwithin the batch. Additionally, we design a novel framework, namely\nRelationship Batch Integration (RBI), which utilizes RRA in conjunction with\nRPE, allowing the discernment of vital visual features that may remain elusive\nwhen examining a singular image representative of a particular class. Through\nextensive experiments, our proposed method demonstrates significant\nimprovements in the accuracy of different fine-grained classifiers, with an\naverage increase of $(+2.78\\%)$ and $(+3.83\\%)$ on the CUB200-2011 and Stanford\nDog datasets, respectively, while achieving a state-of-the-art results\n$(95.79\\%)$ on the Stanford Dog dataset. Despite not achieving the same level\nof improvement as in fine-grained image classification, our method still\ndemonstrates its prowess in leveraging general image classification by\nattaining a state-of-the-art result of $(93.71\\%)$ on the Tiny-Imagenet\ndataset. Furthermore, our method serves as a plug-in refinement module and can\nbe easily integrated into different networks.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ljKMSUwDIBd30Ke_3UokAB5WyEIekH9pQEjICqDjUmo","pdfSize":"6621352"}
