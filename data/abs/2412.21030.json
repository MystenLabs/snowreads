  "abstract": "  This paper proposes the use of iterative transfer learning applied to deep\nlearning models for side-channel attacks. Currently, most of the side-channel\nattack methods train a model for each individual byte, without considering the\ncorrelation between bytes. However, since the models' parameters for attacking\ndifferent bytes may be similar, we can leverage transfer learning, meaning that\nwe first train the model for one of the key bytes, then use the trained model\nas a pretrained model for the remaining bytes. This technique can be applied\niteratively, a process known as iterative transfer learning. Experimental\nresults show that when using thermal or power consumption map images as input,\nand multilayer perceptron or convolutional neural network as the model, our\nmethod improves average performance, especially when the amount of data is\ninsufficient.\n",
