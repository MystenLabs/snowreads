DVC involves the\nautomatic captioning and localization of untrimmed videos. Several studies\nhighlight the challenges of DVC and introduce improved methods utilizing prior\nknowledge, such as pre-training and external memory. In this research, we\npropose a model that leverages the prior knowledge of human-oriented\nhierarchical compact memory inspired by human memory hierarchy and cognition.\nTo mimic human-like memory recall, we construct a hierarchical memory and a\nhierarchical memory reading module. We build an efficient hierarchical compact\nmemory by employing clustering of memory events and summarization using large\nlanguage models. Comparative experiments demonstrate that this hierarchical\nmemory recall process improves the performance of DVC by achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance on YouCook2 and ViTT datasets.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"2Kcxv9E49UKNzCyUWN6BwI2twmu2nQfekXspnCW8jTs","pdfSize":"1787914"}
