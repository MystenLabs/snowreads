Kicks from supernova\nexplosions or the dynamical ejection of stars from clusters can account for the\nrunaway genesis. We have used Gaia DR3 data to study the velocity distribution\nof massive O and Be stars from the GOSC and BeSS catalogs and identify runaway\nstars using a 2D-velocity method. We have discovered 42 new runaways from GOSC\nand 47 from BeSS, among a total of 106 and 69 runaways found within these\ncatalogs, respectively. These numbers imply a percentage of runaways of ~25%\nfor O-type stars ~5% for Be-type stars. The higher percentages and higher\nvelocities found for O-type compared to Be-type runaways suggest that the\ndynamical ejection scenario is more likely than the supernova explosion\nscenario. We have also performed multi-wavelength studies of our runaways. We\nhave used WISE infrared images to discover 13 new stellar bow shocks around the\nrunaway stars. We have also conducted VLA radio observations of some of these\nbow shocks. Finally, our runaway stars include six X-ray binaries and one\ngamma-ray binary, implying that new such systems could be found by conducting\ndetailed multi-wavelength studies. In this work we report on this ongoing\nproject to find new runaway stars, study their interaction with the ISM and\nsearch for high-energy binary systems.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nPVrWHSNkV47N0_Lvgkx8LnOYIqQA7gTPqNuW-1gDBc","pdfSize":"7053932"}
