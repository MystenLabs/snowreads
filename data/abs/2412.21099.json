  "abstract": "  State-space models are popular models in econometrics. Recently, these models\nhave gained some popularity in the actuarial literature. The best known\nstate-space models are of Kalman-filter type. These models are so-called\nparameter-driven because the observations do not impact the state-space\ndynamics. A second less well-known class of state-space models are so-called\nobservation-driven state-space models where the state-space dynamics is also\nimpacted by the actual observations. A typical example is the Poisson-Gamma\nobservation-driven state-space model for counts data. This Poisson-Gamma model\nis fully analytically tractable. The goal of this paper is to develop a Gamma-\nGamma observation-driven state-space model for claim size modeling. We provide\nfully tractable versions of Gamma-Gamma observation-driven state-space models,\nand these versions extend the work of Smith and Miller (1986) by allowing for a\nfully flexible variance behavior. Additionally, we demonstrate that the\nproposed model aligns with evolutionary credibility, a methodology in insurance\nthat dynamically adjusts premium rates over time using evolving data.\n",
