Based on the comprehensive analysis of the pulse\nproperties in both bright GRB~160625B and GRB~160509A, for the first time, we\nidentify evidences of particle acceleration by relativistic magnetic\nreconnection from the evolutionary behavior of the two spectral breaks ($E_{\\rm\np}$ and $E_{\\rm cut}$). Meanwhile, the adiabatic cooling process of the\nemitting particles in the magnetic reconnection regions produces a relation\nbetween the spectral index and the flux. We also discuss the physics behind\nspectral energy correlations. Finally, we argue that the identification of an\nanticorrelation between $E_{\\rm cut}$ and $L_{\\rm iso}$ may opens a new avenue\nfor diagnostics of the physics of the particle acceleration and radiation in a\nvariety of astrophysical sources.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0teOH4WxYGa_QX4DRWTV3dxRBkc2JgIgTOjhZOIXwx8","pdfSize":"1042534"}
