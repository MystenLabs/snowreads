This paper develops\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for the efficient points in a sum of sets\nof alternatives to be identical to the efficient points in one of the summands.\nSome of the conditions cover both finite and infinite sets; others are shown to\nhold only for finite sets. A theorem with useful implications for multiple\nobjective optimization is obtained as a corollary of our findings. Examples are\nprovided that illustrate these results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"l1aikAkuUQ-YUoEnd-H6hH30AqXeAfiFkPO4YBP5tqI","pdfSize":"287410"}
