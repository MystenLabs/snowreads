This extension enables\nsimultaneous determination of parton distribution functions (PDFs) and new\nphysics parameters within the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field\nTheory (SMEFT). The functionalities of the code are illustrated in a\nsensitivity study, where a simultaneous determination of the PDFs, top quark\nmass and the couplings of selected dimension-6 SMEFT operators is addressed\nusing projections for measurements of top quark-antiquark pair production at\nthe High-Luminosity LHC. The importance of considering all the correlations of\nthe parton distributions, top quark mass and the EFT parameters in a\nsimultaneous QCD+SMEFT analysis is demonstrated. This work serves as a new\nplatform for simultaneous extraction of the PDFs and the SM/SMEFT parameters\nbased on xFitter.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Jqfe9A6ZkOw5WaQw_ZQTequViJ5tNhuvN3Wgq2X_SRQ","pdfSize":"1009673"}
