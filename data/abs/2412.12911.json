  "abstract": "  Collisionless shocks are complex nonlinear structures that are not yet fully\nunderstood. In particular, the interaction between these shocks and the\nparticles they accelerate remains elusive. Based on an instability analysis\nthat relates the shock width to the spectrum of the accelerated particle and\nthe shock density ratio, we find that the acceleration process could come to an\nend when the fraction of accelerated upstream particles reaches about 30\\%.\nOnly unmagnetized shocks are considered.\n",
