However, previous TTA methods have not systematically explored audio\nevent relation modeling, nor have they proposed frameworks to enhance this\ncapability. In this work, we systematically study audio event relation modeling\nin TTA generation models. We first establish a benchmark for this task by: 1.\nproposing a comprehensive relation corpus covering all potential relations in\nreal-world scenarios; 2. introducing a new audio event corpus encompassing\ncommonly heard audios; and 3. proposing new evaluation metrics to assess audio\nevent relation modeling from various perspectives. Furthermore, we propose a\nfinetuning framework to enhance existing TTA models ability to model audio\nevents relation.
