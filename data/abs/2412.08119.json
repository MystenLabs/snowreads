  "abstract": "  Two-dimensional (2D) lithium-decorated materials have emerged as a\nsignificant area of study since the prediction of superconductivity in\nlithium-decorated graphene at temperatures around 8.1 K, with experimental\nevidence observed at Tc = 5.9 K. Following earlier studies, this paper focuses\non the hexagonal Janus MoSeLi monolayer as a promising candidate for\nLi-decorated 2D materials. Our research reveals that lithium substitution on a\nselenium layer of MoSe2 can produce a hexagonal Janus MoSeLi monolayer, which\nexhibits metallic behavior with potential phonon-mediated superconductivity\nwith a critical temperature Tc of 4.5 K. Additionally, by solving the\nanisotropic gap equations derived from Migdal-Eliashberg theory, we found that\nthe Janus MoSeLi monolayer exhibits two-gap superconductivity. This finding\nunderscores the potential of hexagonal Janus MoSeLi as a significant\nLi-decorated 2D material for exploring two-dimensional superconductivity and\nsets the stage for further investigations into new families of Janus\ntransition-metal chalcogenides.\n",
