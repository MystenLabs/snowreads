Under appropriate geometric conditions we show how to\nconstruct closed curves which are boundaries of overtwisted disks. We introduce\nthe concept of contact Jacobi curve, and prove sharp lower bounds of the\nso-called tightness radius (from a Reeb orbit) in terms of Schwarzian\nderivative bounds. We also prove similar, but non-sharp, comparison theorems in\nterms of sub-Riemannian canonical curvature bounds. We apply our results to\nK-contact sub-Riemannian manifolds. In this setting, we prove a contact\nanalogue of the celebrated Cartan-Hadamard theorem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HTv0lkhQZOC-yfwz9qTIYv2C0ht50Uzopmnbok0VvrI","pdfSize":"590327"}
