In this kinematic regime, the\ntransverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) factorization framework is required,\npromoting the long-distance matrix elements (LDMEs) of NRQCD to the so-called\nTMD shape functions (TMDShFs), which encode both the soft gluon radiation and\nthe formation of the heavy-quark bound state. In this work, we apply an\neffective-field theory approach (combining NRQCD and SCET) to the photon-gluon\nfusion process in inclusive $J/\\psi$ leptoproduction. We derive a factorization\ntheorem for the cross section in terms of TMDShFs, compute these quantities at\nnext-to-leading order, establish their evolution, and study their matching onto\nthe corresponding LDMEs in the high-transverse-momentum region. Our results are\nparticularly relevant to the Electron-Ion Collider, where $J/\\psi$\nleptoproduction can be used to probe gluon transverse-momentum-dependent parton\ndistribution functions (gluon TMDPDFs).\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TXku_P-AfaGKyBuk6bAW8bn8lmgfw6Z_iXVn4Yk83EU","pdfSize":"864154"}
