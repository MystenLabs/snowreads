In 1984,\nFrankl and Pach initiated the study of this fundamental problem and provided an\nupper bound $\\binom{n}{d}$ via an elegant algebraic proof. Surprisingly, in\n2007, Mubayi and Zhao showed that when $n$ is sufficiently large and $d$ is a\nprime power, the Frankl-Pach upper bound is not tight. They also remarked that\ntheir method requires $d$ to be a prime power, and asked for new ideas to\nimprove the Frankl-Pach upper bound without extra assumptions on $n$ and $d$.\n  In this paper, we provide an improvement for any $d\\ge 2$ and $n\\ge 2d+2$,\nwhich demonstrates that the long-standing Frankl-Pach upper bound\n$\\binom{n}{d}$ is not tight for any uniformity. Our proof combines a simple yet\npowerful polynomial method and structural analysis.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wnk02YBJCxcdGNiJvJ2-8KRX07pYt9CHTmMnhDTvhuA","pdfSize":"140681"}
