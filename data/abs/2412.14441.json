  "abstract": "  Obeying constraints imposed by classical physics, we give optimal\nfine-grained algorithms for matrix multiplication and problems involving graphs\nand mazes, where all calculations are done in 3-dimensional space. We assume\nthat whatever the technology is, a bit requires a minimum volume and\ncommunication travels at a bounded speed. These imply that multiplying $n\n\\times n$ matrices takes $\\Omega(n^{2/3})$ time, and we show that this can be\nachieved by a fine-grained 3-d mesh of $n^2$ processors. While the constants\nare impractically large, this is asymptotically faster than parallel\nimplementations of Strassen's algorithm, while the lower bound shows that some\nclaims about parallelizing faster serial algorithms are impossible in 3-space.\nIf the matrices are not over a ring then multiplication can be done in\n$\\Theta(n^{3/4})$ time by expanding to a mesh larger than the input. In 2-d\n(such as the surface of a chip) this approach is useless and $\\Theta(n)$\nsystolic algorithms are optimal even when the matrices are over a ring.\nSimilarly, for path and maze problems there are approaches useful in 3-d but\nnot 2-d.\n",
