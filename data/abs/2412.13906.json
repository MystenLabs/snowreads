We apply methods from the theory of hyperovals\nand linear sets to compute these Whitney numbers for infinite families of\nrank-metric lattices. As an application of our results, we prove asymptotic\nestimates on the density function of certain rank-metric codes that have been\nconjectured in previous work.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computer Science/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"91OMOaU3Q9T1MLIwySQT7OwXcAUXGTgiQUiPMYXkpj8","pdfSize":"242296"}
