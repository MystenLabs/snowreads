Starting from Synge's Hamiltonian formalism, we\nconstruct a position-space action and use it perturbatively to calculate light\nbending angles. In the homogeneous case, the action reduces to that of a\nmassive particle, allowing us to extract the bending angle of light in the\npresence of the medium using a well-known analogy. For the inhomogeneous case,\nwe consider a power law model and construct Feynman rules in time to compute\nthe purely plasma-induced corrections to the bending angle at\nNext-to-Leading-Order (NLO).\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PEEzDShcxvogMeopLtvIUbQ8z_ig9aZj1dWmFQIx1GM","pdfSize":"577853"}
