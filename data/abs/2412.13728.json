  "abstract": "  This study presents a framework for assessing urban critical infrastructure\nresilience during extreme events, such as hurricanes. The approach combines GIS\nand network analysis with open remote sensing data of the aftermath, vector\ndata on infrastructure, and socio-demographic attributes of populations in\naffected areas. Using Panama City as an example case study, this paper\nquantifies hurricane impacts on residents and identifies vulnerable locations\nfor urban planners' attention. Simulations demonstrate how implementing\nmeasures at identified weak points can improve system resilience. Comparing\npre-hurricane conditions with the aftermath and several years later allows\nobserving network property changes and assessing overall resilience\nimprovements. Findings indicate that individuals over 65 in the studied\nsettlement are more susceptible to disasters, while males in this age category\nface higher risks.\n",
