By introducing a chiral chemical potential $\\mu_5$ through a\nquench process, we drive the system out of equilibrium and analyze the induced\nvector currents and their evolution over time. The Hamiltonian is modified to\ninclude the time-dependent chiral chemical potential, thus allowing the\ninvestigation of the CME within a quantum computing framework. We employ the\nquantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) algorithm to study the thermal states,\nand utilize the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition for the real-time evolution. This\nstudy provides insights into the quantum simulation capabilities for modeling\nthe CME and offers a pathway for studying chiral dynamics in low-dimensional\nquantum field theories.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"sbLE4E6PHpQVfWzTdBTO0KRjrmMMIqhfWqsTd5XemCU","pdfSize":"1908058","objectId":"0x3c5744b7023f526572ce0d67a1bf395a9e1433dc7d91b253e6c261d077db72c6","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
