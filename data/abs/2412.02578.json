Most existing privacy-preserving linear regression\nmethods rely on the well-established framework of differential privacy, while\nthe newly proposed PAC Privacy has not yet been explored in this context. In\nthis paper, we systematically compare linear regression models trained with\ndifferential privacy and PAC privacy across three real-world datasets,\nobserving several key findings that impact the performance of\nprivacy-preserving linear regression.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"E_VUcNqaL8_sIG0OpgUv47eO_thtcay_2QPM_CIt4_Q","pdfSize":"536207"}
