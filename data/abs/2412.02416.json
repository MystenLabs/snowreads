  "abstract": "  In this paper, we establish an asymptotic formula for the twisted second\nmoment of $L$-functions associated with Hecke--Maass cusp forms for $\\rm\nSL(3,\\mathbb{Z})$, and further deduce a weighted zero-density estimate for\nthese $L$-functions in the spectral aspect which may have important\napplications in other problems.\n",
