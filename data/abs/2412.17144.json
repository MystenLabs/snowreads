Our approach considers the traditional edge,\nbending, and torsional degrees of freedom in mass-spring systems, but\nincorporates an additional one-way biphasic coupling with a ghost rest-shape\nconfiguration. Trough multiple evaluation experiments with varied dynamical\nsettings, we show that AMS improves the stability of the simulation in\ncomparison to mass-spring discretizations, preserves global features, and\nenables the simulation of non-Hookean effects. Using an heptadiagonal\ndecomposition of the resulting matrix, our approach provides the efficiency\nadvantages of mass-spring systems over more complex constitutive hair models,\nwhile enabling a more robust simulation of multiple strand configurations.\nFinally, our results demonstrate that our framework enables the generation,\ncomplex interactivity, and editing of simulation-ready dense hair assets in\nreal-time.
