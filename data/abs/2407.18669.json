It is shown that the sign of the\nprincipal eigenvalue $\\lambda_*$ of the time-periodic linearized system at the\ntrivial solution completely determines the persistence of the species.\nMoreover, when $\\lambda_*>0$, there is at least one time-periodic positive\nentire solution. A fairly general sufficient condition ensuring the uniqueness\nand global stability of the positive time-periodic solution is obtained. In\nparticular, classical solutions eventually stabilize at the unique\ntime-periodic positive solutions if either each subgroup's intra-stage growth\nand inter-stage competition rates are proportional, or the environment is\ntemporally homogeneous and both subgroups diffuse slowly. In the later\nscenario, the asymptotic profile of steady states with respect to small\ndiffusion rates is established.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fClS1FEE2EGRmVVK2h9FhAsTkBeSvXmJpRXoEmdo8D4","pdfSize":"445491"}
