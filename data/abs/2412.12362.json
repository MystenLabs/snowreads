As a supplement to a recent study on the behavioral Turing\ntest, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis of five leading LLM-based\nchatbot families as they navigate a series of behavioral economics games. By\nbenchmarking these AI chatbots, we aim to uncover and document both common and\ndistinct behavioral patterns across a range of scenarios. The findings provide\nvaluable insights into the strategic preferences of each LLM, highlighting\npotential implications for their deployment in critical decision-making roles.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"J37gpokKxOZ2XiJRRhPN-Y0cp2iYG4OxDESRG4KTglc","pdfSize":"3198345"}
