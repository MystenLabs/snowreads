Although recent deep tabular models have shown\nremarkable success, they still struggle to handle data distribution shifts,\nleading to performance degradation when testing distributions change. To remedy\nthis, a robust tabular model must adapt to generalize to unknown distributions\nduring testing. In this paper, we investigate the problem of fully test-time\nadaptation (FTTA) for tabular data, where the model is adapted using only the\ntesting data. We identify three key challenges: the existence of label and\ncovariate distribution shifts, the lack of effective data augmentation, and the\nsensitivity of adaptation, which render existing FTTA methods ineffective for\ntabular data. To this end, we propose the Fully Test-time Adaptation for\nTabular data, namely FTAT, which enables FTTA methods to robustly optimize the\nlabel distribution of predictions, adapt to shifted covariate distributions,\nand suit a variety of tasks and models effectively. We conduct comprehensive\nexperiments on six benchmark datasets, which are evaluated using three metrics.\nThe experimental results demonstrate that FTAT outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods by a margin.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Machine Learning","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"zbVM0vGofJtnfEfS068Qgtwc2_3-S_Cg786dpmpxqiw","pdfSize":"1611274"}
