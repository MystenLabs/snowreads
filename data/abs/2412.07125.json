In the\nframework of the singlet vector-like leptons with scalar (VLS) model, we\ninvestigate the discovery potential of VLL via its single production at the\nInternational Linear Collider (ILC) with the center of mass energy $\\sqrt{s} =$\n1 TeV and the integrated luminosity $\\mathcal{L}$ = 1 ab$^{-1}$, taking into\naccount the appropriate polarization. For the signal and standard model (SM)\nbackground analysis, we have considered two kinds of decay channels for the W\nboson, i.e. pure leptonic and fully hadronic decay channels. Our analytic\nresults show that the parameter space $M_{F}\\in$ [300, 675] GeV and $\\kappa\n\\in$ [0.0294, 0.1] might be detected by the proposed ILC for pure leptonic\ndecay channel. For fully hadronic decay channel, larger detection region of the\nparameter space are derived as $M_{F}\\in$ [300, 700] GeV and $\\kappa \\in$\n[0.0264, 0.0941].\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CkSwXAKmLwe3d3S7YVK3q0BhQIzsQPgw2BeLponF818","pdfSize":"1133997"}
