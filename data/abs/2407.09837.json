Therefore, visualizing the state of tribological\ncontacts becomes important, as they are regularly found in the center of many\napplications. Utilizing rolling element bearings as sensors and monitoring\ntheir health by the electrical impedance method are promising approaches as it\nallows e.g. load sensing and detection of bearing failures. The impedance\ncannot be measured directly, but there are various methods available. This work\ndiscusses advantages and disadvantages and suggests the AC Wheatstone bridge as\na reliable way of measuring impedances with low phase angles at sampling rates\nin the kHz range. The corresponding equations are introduced, a simulation\nbuilt, an uncertainty mode and effects analysis carried out and sample\nmeasurement results of real rolling elements shown. It can be demonstrated that\nthe AC Wheatstone bridge meets the proposed requirements for sensory\nutilization and condition monitoring when the bearing is operated in the\nhydrodynamic regime.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QegeSdjarQKum_b2ti4qS_69HcDvgGTn4BvIdBarzyo","pdfSize":"644676"}
