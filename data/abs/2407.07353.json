Here, we show controlled accumulation of the Berry phase in\na two-level elastic bit, which are classical counterparts of qubits, achieved\nby manipulating coupled granules with external drivers. Employing the Bloch\nsphere representation, the paper demonstrates the manipulation of elastic bit\nstates and the realization of quantum-analogue logic gates. A key achievement\nis the calculation of the Berry phase for various system states, revealing\ninsights into the system's topological nature. Unique to this study is the use\nof external parameters to explore topological transitions, contrasting with\ntraditional approaches focusing on internal system modifications. By linking\nthe classical and quantum worlds through the Berry phase of an elastic bit,\nthis work extends the potential applications of topological concepts in\ndesigning new materials and computational models.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IMueU0ZzZKOuLkLLzsarZb-pwUKMUtS0Vmk6V7ddR9M","pdfSize":"891626"}
