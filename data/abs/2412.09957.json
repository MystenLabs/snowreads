  "abstract": "  In this work, we present the development of a reverse transliteration model\nto convert romanized Malayalam to native script using an encoder-decoder\nframework built with attention-based bidirectional Long Short Term Memory\n(Bi-LSTM) architecture. To train the model, we have used curated and combined\ncollection of 4.3 million transliteration pairs derived from publicly available\nIndic language translitertion datasets, Dakshina and Aksharantar. We evaluated\nthe model on two different test dataset provided by IndoNLP-2025-Shared-Task\nthat contain, (1) General typing patterns and (2) Adhoc typing patterns,\nrespectively. On the Test Set-1, we obtained a character error rate (CER) of\n7.4%. However upon Test Set-2, with adhoc typing patterns, where most vowel\nindicators are missing, our model gave a CER of 22.7%.\n",
