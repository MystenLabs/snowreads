We show that there are finitely many\nhyperbolic surfaces sharing the same simple orthospectrum and finitely many\nhyperbolic surfaces sharing the same orthospectrum. Then, we show that generic\nsurfaces are determined by their orthospectrum and by their simple\northospectrum. We conclude with the example of the one-holed torus which is\ndetermined by its simple orthospectrum.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6nUKuoGX2Vy7iS9VsL9up3ev9xCytY85yj_UrS9IMfU","pdfSize":"2831239"}
