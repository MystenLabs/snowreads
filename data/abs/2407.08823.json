This evolution encompasses both\nimmediate changes, such as the adoption of Language Model-based approaches in\ncoding, and deeper shifts driven by the profound societal and environmental\nimpacts of technology. Despite the urgency, there persists a lag in adapting to\nthese evolving roles. By fostering ongoing discourse and reflection on Software\nEngineers role and responsibilities, this vision paper seeks to cultivate a new\ngeneration of software engineers equipped to navigate the complexities and\nethical considerations inherent in their evolving profession.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"M85Y49reFckI8wX0M72ntK2eNlR0_5-iFglIZBA-VGU","pdfSize":"2663113","objectId":"0xd9ba47e37356727120015c27aad86e7b34903557b263724d3a5a2be5e640cd1c","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
