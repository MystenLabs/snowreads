  "abstract": "  High-frequency trading (HFT) represents a pivotal and intensely competitive\ndomain within the financial markets. The velocity and accuracy of data\nprocessing exert a direct influence on profitability, underscoring the\nsignificance of this field. The objective of this work is to optimise the\nreal-time processing of data in high-frequency trading algorithms. The dynamic\nfeature selection mechanism is responsible for monitoring and analysing market\ndata in real time through clustering and feature weight analysis, with the\nobjective of automatically selecting the most relevant features. This process\nemploys an adaptive feature extraction method, which enables the system to\nrespond and adjust its feature set in a timely manner when the data input\nchanges, thus ensuring the efficient utilisation of data. The lightweight\nneural networks are designed in a modular fashion, comprising fast\nconvolutional layers and pruning techniques that facilitate the expeditious\ncompletion of data processing and output prediction. In contrast to\nconventional deep learning models, the neural network architecture has been\nspecifically designed to minimise the number of parameters and computational\ncomplexity, thereby markedly reducing the inference time. The experimental\nresults demonstrate that the model is capable of maintaining consistent\nperformance in the context of varying market conditions, thereby illustrating\nits advantages in terms of processing speed and revenue enhancement.\n",
