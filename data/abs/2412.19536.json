New three-dimensional\nanalytic models of potential vector fields in some layered media are\nconstructed. Properties of various analytic models in Cartesian and cylindrical\ncoordinates in $\\mathbb R^3$ are compared. The original properties of the\nJacobian matrix $\\mathbf{J}(\\vec V)$ of potential meridional fields $\\vec V$ in\ncylindrically layered media, where $\\phi( \\rho) = \\rho^{-\\alpha}$ $(\\alpha \\in\n\\mathbb R)$, lead to the concept of \\emph{$\\alpha$-meridional mappings of the\nfirst and second kind}. The concept of \\emph{$\\alpha$-Meridional functions of\nthe first and second kind} naturally arises in this way. When $\\alpha =1$, the\nspecial concept of \\emph{Radially holomorphic functions in $\\mathbb R^3$},\nintroduced by G\\\"{u}rlebeck, Habetha and Spr\\\"{o}ssig in 2008, is developed in\nmore detail. Certain key properties of the radially holomorphic functions $G$\nand functions reversed with respect to $G$ are first characterized. Surprising\nproperties of the radially holomorphic potentials represented by superposition\nof the radially holomorphic exponential function $e^{\\breve{\\beta} x}$\n$(\\breve{\\beta} \\in \\mathbb R)$ and function reversed with respect to\n$e^{\\breve{\\beta} x}$ are demonstrated explicitly. The basic properties of the\nradially holomorphic potential represented by the radially holomorphic\nextension of the Joukowski transformation in $\\mathbb R^3$ are studied.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"t5UAc5tB7i40jxZbTys3GWNEtCj0Z6yw1kU372TPckI","pdfSize":"403787"}
