This analysis encompasses the latest data from\nsemi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering, Drell-Yan, and W/Z-boson production\nprocesses as recently reported by the COMPASS and STAR Collaborations. Upon\nintegrating the new data into our fitting, the precision of the extracted d and\ndbar quark Sivers and transversity distributions, as well as the tensor charge,\nis notably improved.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dfNRmCR4d6KLxdWTavGfLuSrpsWGMJzLYGYcJKexR8c","pdfSize":"4140360"}
