We introduce comgra, an\nopen source python library for use with PyTorch. Comgra extracts data about the\ninternal activations of a model and organizes it in a GUI (graphical user\ninterface). It can show both summary statistics and individual data points,\ncompare early and late stages of training, focus on individual samples of\ninterest, and visualize the flow of the gradient through the network. This\nmakes it possible to inspect the model's behavior from many different angles\nand save time by rapidly testing different hypotheses without having to rerun\nit. Comgra has applications for debugging, neural architecture design, and\nmechanistic interpretability. We publish our library through Python Package\nIndex (PyPI) and provide code, documentation, and tutorials at\nhttps://github.com/FlorianDietz/comgra.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8USI4CoQgerygECPSHUNKnkRVi0XrAW-n9sjybanooA","pdfSize":"456100"}
