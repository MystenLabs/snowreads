Yet existing simulation-based methods cannot mimic all the complex\nfeatures present in experimental maps, such as secondary structure elements. As\nan alternative, we propose struc2mapGAN, a novel data-driven method that\nemploys a generative adversarial network (GAN) to produce high-resolution\nexperimental-like density maps from molecular structures. More specifically,\nstruc2mapGAN uses a U-Net++ architecture as the generator, with an additional\nL1 loss term and further processing of raw experimental maps to enhance\nlearning efficiency. While struc2mapGAN can promptly generate maps after\ntraining, we demonstrate that it outperforms existing simulation-based methods\nfor a wide array of tested maps and across various evaluation metrics.
