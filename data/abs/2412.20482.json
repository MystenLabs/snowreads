The normal forms are established\nthrough the construction of certain intertwining maps, which are formulated in\nterms of theta functions. Furthermore, we realise the Wahlquist- Estabrook\nprolongation algebra of the Landau-Lifshitz equation in terms of an automorphic\nLie algebra on a complex torus with one orbit of punctures, and show that it is\nisomorphic to an $\\mathfrak{sl}(2,\\mathbb{C})$-current algebra. Finally, we\nshow that a Lie algebra introduced by Uglov and the well-known hidden symmetry\nalgebra of Holod are isomorphic to an elliptic\n$\\mathfrak{sl}(2,\\mathbb{C})$-current algebra.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VtFAMH3cBjcI4rBBR68EMG-ooG-Jzx2euN4JyNWKoto","pdfSize":"322081"}
