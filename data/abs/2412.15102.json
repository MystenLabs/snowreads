Under a certain assumptions we show that the\nconditions that imply supersymmetry for Mink$_{D+1}$ imply those of the\nMink$_{D}$ solution, but that Bianchi identities of the fluxes must be\nmodified. This realises an off shell solution generating technique for\nsupersymmetric solutions or a \"supersymmetry generating\" technique. Along the\nway it is necessary for us to derive G structure conditions for general ${\\cal\nN}=(1,0)$ supersymmetric Mink$_2$ solutions and a restricted class of Mink$_1$\nsolutions. We apply our results to construct some simple Minkowski flux vacua\nbefore turning our attention to \"solitonic branes\" which are generalisations of\nthe AdS soliton. We are able to generalise known examples in two ways: 1) to\nembed them in terms of generic Sasaki Einstein manifolds. 2) To modify the\nharmonic factor to include D$p$ brane sources at one end of the space.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tlDCv9Kbplk4dELmr9OY51di6MIfhfKe1FxkHXxXW0I","pdfSize":"586136"}
