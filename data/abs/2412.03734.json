The primary objective is to analyze the resulting operator by\nvarying the number of terms in the dictionary and the timescale. We examine\nwhat happens when the number of terms of the nonlinear dictionary is varied\nwith respect to its ability to represent the invariant measure, Koopman\neigenfunctions, and temporal autocorrelations. The dictionary comprises\npiecewise constant functions through a modified bisecting k-means algorithm and\ncan efficiently scale to higher-dimensional systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"B0YebmkDFxToWljI4QXq45I72eiG3P0jdFiE9BfkEmg","pdfSize":"5920992"}
