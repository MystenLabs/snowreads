We explore the exact Green function\nand an exact solution for a given initial condition, and also find the\nasymptotic solutions in some limiting cases. The analytical extension of the\nHamiltonian in the complex plane allows us to formulate the equivalent\nstochastic problem, namely the B\\\"aumer equation. This equation describes\n\\textit{relativistic} stochastic processes with time-changing anomalous\ndiffusion. This B\\\"aumer propagator corresponds to the Green function of a\nrelativistic diffusion process that interpolates between Cauchy distributions\nfor small times and Gaussian diffusion for large times, providing a framework\nfor stochastic processes where anomalous diffusion is time-dependent.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eKFhCEr0I3C1Q8T7z4Rq5BOMTonZ4iLq8NQ9PnB4rYM","pdfSize":"2660841"}
