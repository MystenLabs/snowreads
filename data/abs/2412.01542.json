Due to this ubiquity of computing, cyber threats have continued to grow\nyear over year, leading to labor shortages and a skills gap in cybersecurity.\nAs a result, many cybersecurity product vendors and security organizations have\nlooked to artificial intelligence to shore up their defenses. This work\nconsiders how to characterize attackers and defenders in one approach to the\nautomation of cyber defense -- the application of reinforcement learning.\nSpecifically, we characterize the types of attackers and defenders in the sense\nof Bayesian games and, using reinforcement learning, derive empirical findings\nabout how to best train agents that defend against multiple types of attackers.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Cryptography and Security","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Computer Science/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computer Science/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"jm17zLB4OdMzWlGrI18nR68avRWiXb6-2vcMoIsR2Bk","pdfSize":"522957"}
