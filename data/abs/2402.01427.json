To evaluate this, we use 500 dialogues from\nsmall, online groups discussing the Wason Card Selection task - the DeliData\ncorpus. Leveraging the corpus, we perform quantitative analysis evaluating\nthree different measures of cognitive diversity. First, we analyse the effect\nof group size as a proxy measure for diversity. Second, we evaluate the effect\nof the size of the initial idea pool. Finally, we look into the content of the\ndiscussion by analysing discussed solutions, discussion patterns, and how\nconversational probing can improve those characteristics. Despite the\nreputation of groups for compounding bias, we show that small groups can,\nthrough dialogue, overcome intuitive biases and improve individual\ndecision-making. Across a large sample and different operationalisations, we\nconsistently find that greater cognitive diversity is associated with more\nsuccessful group deliberation.
