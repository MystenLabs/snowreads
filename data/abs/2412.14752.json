Using measurements of the electron spectra in the MeV range from the\nUlysses and SOHO satellites, we report the strongest direct upper bound to date\non the mixing between heavy neutral leptons with MeV masses and electron\nneutrinos, reaching $U_e^2\\simeq 10^{-6}$ at $M_N=10$ MeV. Our sensitivity is\npredominantly constrained by the uncertainties in the propagation of electrons\nand positrons, particularly the diffusion coefficient in the inner Solar\nSystem, as well as the uncertainties in the astrophysical background. Enhancing\nour understanding of either of these factors could lead to a significant\nimprovement in sensitivity.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FfMJV_5DBmThPd3bxWUzXoaJYd75rKNADoUxQCo_vPM","pdfSize":"1592937"}
