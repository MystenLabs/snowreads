  "abstract": "  We present an alternative formulation of generalized unimodular gravity\n(GUMG), extending the Henneaux-Teitelboim approach to unimodular gravity (UMG).\nThe central feature of this formulation is the consistent incorporation of time\nreparameterization, which enhances the gauge structure and reveals a spatial\nnonlocality hidden in the dynamics of the original formulation. We examine the\nresulting dynamics, emphasizing the effects of spatial nonlocality, and outline\nthe constraint structure. In particular, we show that the gauge symmetry in the\ngravitational sector is extended by a functionally incomplete symmetry, as\noccurs in the unimodular gravity. Furthermore, we identify a subset of GUMG\nmodels for which the alternative formulation preserves manifest locality.\n",
