  "abstract": "  Given a compact toric surface, the multiplication of its rational cohomology\ncan be described in terms of the intersection products of Weil divisors, or in\nterms of the cup products of cohomology classes representing specific cells. In\nthis paper, we aim to compare these two descriptions. More precisely, we define\ntwo different cohomology bases, the \\emph{Poincar\\'{e} dual basis} and the\n\\emph{cellular basis}, which give rise to matrices representing the\nintersection product and the cup product. We prove that these representing\nmatrices are inverse of each other.\n",
