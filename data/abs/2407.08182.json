This study evaluates multi-task\nlearning frameworks grounded in Cognitive Appraisal Theory to predict user\nbehavior as a function of users' self-expression and psychological attributes.\nOur experiments show that users' language and traits improve predictions above\nand beyond models predicting only from text. Our findings highlight the\nimportance of integrating psychological constructs into NLP to enhance the\nunderstanding and prediction of user actions. We close with a discussion of the\nimplications for future applications of large language models for computational\npsychology.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_gGgoqJQRZZWsLJVewPg5AE7YOF0TWtRwUsbPZ0Q-4w","pdfSize":"431321"}
