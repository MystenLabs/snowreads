These networks define regulatory\ninfluences between molecular nodes, each being associated to a Boolean variable\nand a regulatory (local) function specifying its dynamical behaviour depending\non its regulators. However, existing data is mostly insufficient to adequately\nparametrise a model, that is to uniquely define a regulatory function for each\nnode. With the intend to support model parametrisation, this paper presents\nresults on the set of Boolean functions compatible with a given regulatory\nstructure, i.e. the partially ordered set of monotone non-degenerate Boolean\nfunctions. More precisely, we present original rules to obtain the direct\nneighbours of any function of this set. Besides a theoretical interest,\npresented results will enable the development of more efficient methods for\nBoolean network synthesis and revision, benefiting from the progressive\nexploration of the vicinity of regulatory functions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Quantitative Biology/Molecular Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"p0l8e2eEdRpvucKDpWelcFLDqeTSB1QBJC4USx9lQRs","pdfSize":"545624"}
