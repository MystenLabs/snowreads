Field data are presented to\ndemonstrate that stream stage drawdown does indeed occur in response to\ngroundwater pumping near aquifer connected streams. A model that predicts\nstream depletion with transient stream drawdown is developed, based on stream\nchannel mass conservation and finite stream channel storage. The resulting\nmodels are shown to reduce to existing fixed-stage models in the limit as\nstream channel storage becomes infinitely large, and to the confined aquifer\nflow with a no-flow boundary at the streambed in the limit as stream storage\nbecomes vanishingly small. The model is applied to field measurements of\naquifer and stream drawdown, giving estimates of aquifer hydraulic parameters,\nstreambed conductance and a measure of stream channel storage. The results of\nthe modeling and data analysis presented herein have implications for\nsustainable groundwater management.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DMMp4rg7cIy3gMTqVuw0PJgK5-jY_Sf8fGnQQZpvTrM","pdfSize":"2450282","objectId":"0x639af739f39f031667a711dcc6a2ca9e36b85d6b49ef19419b93d7093aa65663","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
