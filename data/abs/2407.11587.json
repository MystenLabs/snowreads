The treatment is fully\ncanonical and no approximations are involved or infinite limits taken. I\npresent this model in a detailed way, in order to clarify my views in the\ndebate about the nature, definition, and relevance of quantum chaos.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MSWOiFq9FCmpetY1xiiJsKldkD_RJnhtusLV9OzxdfY","pdfSize":"2700214"}
