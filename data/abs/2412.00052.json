A key challenge in Pakistan and across the\nIndo-Gangetic Plain is the limited air quality monitoring and lack of\ntransparent data on pollution sources. To address this, we present a two-fold\nAI approach that combines low-resolution Sentinel-2 and high-resolution imagery\nto map brick kiln locations. Our process begins with a low-resolution analysis,\nfollowed by a post-processing step to reduce false positives, minimizing the\nneed for extensive high-resolution imagery. This analysis initially identified\n20,000 potential brick kilns, with high-resolution validation confirming around\n11,000 kilns. The dataset also distinguishes between Fixed Chimney and Zigzag\nkilns, enabling more accurate pollution estimates for each type. Our approach\ndemonstrates how combining satellite imagery with AI can effectively detect\nspecific polluting sources. This dataset provides regulators with insights into\nbrick kiln pollution, supporting interventions for unregistered kilns and\nactions during high pollution episodes.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"A0ixTByyScX9E5ul4XwEjCKI3rNVLDdVyTsZiAIC9Sg","pdfSize":"46180498"}
