This paper explores the VASS reachability problem through the\nlens of geometric dimension, revealing key differences from the traditional\ndimensional parameterization. Notably, we establish that the reachability\nproblem for both geometrically 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional VASS is\nPSPACE-complete, achieved by extending the pumping technique originally\nproposed by Czerwi\\'nski et al. (2019).\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Formal Languages and Automata Theory","Computer Science/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3FhYiDsSQH4I_CGo8nrzCG0nlTkNBuDRg60UpuFING0","pdfSize":"985745"}
