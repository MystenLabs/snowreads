  "abstract": "  Vertical motions across the ocean are central to processes, like CO$_2$\nfixation, heat removal or pollutant transport, which are essential to the\nEarth's climate. This work explores 3D conveyor routes {associated with} the\nAtlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Our findings show the\ngeometry of mixing structures in the upper and deep ocean layers by means of\nLagrangian Coherent Structures. This tool identifies among others, zones linked\nto vertical transport and characterizes vertical transport time scales. We\nfocus the study in two regions. The first one is the Flemish Cap region, a zone\nof interaction between the major AMOC components, where our analysis identifies\na domain of deep waters that ascend very rapidly to the ocean surface. The\nsecond one is the Irminger Sea, where our analysis confirms the existence of a\ndownwelling zone, and reveals a previously unreported upwelling connection\nbetween very deep waters and the ocean surface.\n",
