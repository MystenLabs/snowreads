  "abstract": "  We present a conformal inference method for constructing lower prediction\nbounds for survival times from right-censored data, extending recent approaches\ndesigned for type-I censoring. This method imputes unobserved censoring times\nusing a suitable model, and then analyzes the imputed data using weighted\nconformal inference. This approach is theoretically supported by an asymptotic\ndouble robustness property. Empirical studies on simulated and real data sets\ndemonstrate that our method is more robust than existing approaches in\nchallenging settings where the survival model may be inaccurate, while\nachieving comparable performance in easier scenarios.\n",
