  "abstract": "  Recent advances in machine learning, particularly Large Language Models\n(LLMs) such as BERT and GPT, provide rich contextual embeddings that improve\ntext representation. However, current document clustering approaches often\nignore the deeper relationships between named entities (NEs) and the potential\nof LLM embeddings. This paper proposes a novel approach that integrates Named\nEntity Recognition (NER) and LLM embeddings within a graph-based framework for\ndocument clustering. The method builds a graph with nodes representing\ndocuments and edges weighted by named entity similarity, optimized using a\ngraph-convolutional network (GCN). This ensures a more effective grouping of\nsemantically related documents. Experimental results indicate that our approach\noutperforms conventional co-occurrence-based methods in clustering, notably for\ndocuments rich in named entities.\n",
