We show that any\nsolution for which the accelerating phase violates the Trans-Planckian\nCensorship Conjecture (TCC), even in the interior of moduli space, never\napproaches the asymptotic vacuum with zero particles. Based on the assumption\nthat the effective field theory must be valid for the vacuum on the asymptotic\nboundary, as motivated by holography and string theory, we argue that\n(multi-field) scalar potentials with such solutions are disallowed, thus\nstrengthening the case for TCC. In particular, the results imply a new set of\ncomplex and highly-nonlinear constraints across the entire string landscape\nwhich may make realizing inflation impossible.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4jXU-tER016wmu30vON__PKdLk0slTVX1CuxtahFAvo","pdfSize":"788524","objectId":"0xf3009b796bd5163e9b70167ebb623f5d2354051d4d876ab09a51ecc91c4b5ba6","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
