  "abstract": "  Over the recent years, Shapley value (SV), a solution concept from\ncooperative game theory, has found numerous applications in data analytics\n(DA). This paper provides the first comprehensive study of SV used throughout\nthe DA workflow, which involves three main steps: data fabric, data\nexploration, and result reporting. We summarize existing versatile forms of SV\nused in these steps by a unified definition and clarify the essential\nfunctionalities that SV can provide for data scientists. We categorize the arts\nin this field based on the technical challenges they tackled, which include\ncomputation efficiency, approximation error, privacy preservation, and\nappropriate interpretations. We discuss these challenges and analyze the\ncorresponding solutions. We also implement SVBench, the first open-sourced\nbenchmark for developing SV applications, and conduct experiments on six DA\ntasks to validate our analysis and discussions. Based on the qualitative and\nquantitative results, we identify the limitations of current efforts for\napplying SV to DA and highlight the directions of future research and\nengineering.\n",
