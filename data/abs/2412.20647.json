Using a recent formulation of\nthe Kondo lattice model which incorporates a Yao Lee spin liquid proposed by\nthe authors, we demonstrate that doping away from half-filling induces\nfinite-momentum electron-Majorana pair condensation, resulting in\namplitude-modulated PDWs. Our approach provides a precise, analytically\ntractable pathway for understanding the spontaneous formation of PDWs in higher\ndimensions and offers a natural mechanism for PDW formation in the absence of a\nZeeman field.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_670_1aTS43TkbWx-iOjQvdqBLLTtgGhit6BLJgr3Zw","pdfSize":"1942650"}
