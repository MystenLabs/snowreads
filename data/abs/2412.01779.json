This\nframework consist of a notion of adiabatic Fredholm family, several possible\nregularity properties, and an explicit construction that provides finite\ndimensional reductions that fit into all common regularization theories. We\nshow that thhese finite dimensional reductions inherit global continuity and\ndifferentiability properties from the adiabatic Fredholm family. Moreover, we\nindicate how to construct adiabatic Fredholm families that describe the\nadiabatic limits for the nondegenerate Atiyah-Floer conjecture and\nstrip-shrinking in quilted Floer theory.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"i-KNlJrfUozMB8GfNxpvG2LsCcwYig0uXOpEU1q-HhU","pdfSize":"936996"}
