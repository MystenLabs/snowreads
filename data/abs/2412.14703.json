  "abstract": "  In this review article we summarize all experiments claiming quantum\ncomputational advantage to date. Our review highlights challenges, loopholes,\nand refutations appearing in subsequent work to provide a complete picture of\nthe current statuses of these experiments. In addition, we also discuss\ntheoretical computational advantage in example problems such as approximate\noptimization and recommendation systems. Finally, we review recent experiments\nin quantum error correction -- the biggest frontier to reach experimental\nquantum advantage in Shor's algorithm.\n",
