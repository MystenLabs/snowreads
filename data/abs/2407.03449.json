To achieve these ambitious goals, it is apparent that\n6G networks need to incorporate the state-of-the-art technologies. One of the\ntechnologies that has garnered rising interest is fluid antenna system (FAS)\nwhich represents any software-controllable fluidic, conductive, or dielectric\nstructure capable of dynamically changing its shape and position to reconfigure\nessential radio-frequency (RF) characteristics. Compared to traditional antenna\nsystems (TASs) with fixed-position radiating elements, the core idea of FAS\nrevolves around the unique flexibility of reconfiguring the radiating elements\nwithin a given space. One recent driver of FAS is the recognition of its\nposition-flexibility as a new degree of freedom (dof) to harness diversity and\nmultiplexing gains. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive tutorial,\ncovering channel modeling, signal processing and estimation methods,\ninformation-theoretic insights, new multiple access techniques, and hardware\ndesigns. Moreover, we delineate the challenges of FAS and explore the potential\nof using FAS to improve the performance of other contemporary technologies. By\nproviding insights and guidance, this tutorial paper serves to inspire\nresearchers to explore new horizons and fully unleash the potential of FAS.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BR6vQT8YDFRZfld_v-I-pyQRWV4r0btwPMn0obBTpMY","pdfSize":"15065775"}
