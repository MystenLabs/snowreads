  "abstract": "  While its biological significance is well-documented, its application in soft\nrobotics, particularly for the transport of fragile and irregularly shaped\nobjects, remains underexplored. This study presents a modular soft robotic\nactuator system that addresses these challenges through a scalable, adaptable,\nand repairable framework, offering a cost-effective solution for versatile\napplications. The system integrates optimized donut-shaped actuation modules\nand utilizes real-time pressure feedback for synchronized operation, ensuring\nefficient object grasping and transport without relying on intricate sensing or\ncontrol algorithms. Experimental results validate the system`s ability to\naccommodate objects with varying geometries and material characteristics,\nbalancing robustness with flexibility. This work advances the principles of\nperistaltic actuation, establishing a pathway for safely and reliably\nmanipulating delicate materials in a range of scenarios.\n",
