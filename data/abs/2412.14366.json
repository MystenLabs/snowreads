In this paper, we explore the\ngeneration of images in the style of paintings in the surrealism movement using\nvision-language generative models, including DALL-E, Deep Dream Generator, and\nDreamStudio. Our investigation starts with the generation of images under\nvarious image generation settings and different models. The primary objective\nis to identify the most suitable model and settings for producing such images.\nAdditionally, we aim to understand the impact of using edited base images on\nthe generated resulting images. Through these experiments, we evaluate the\nperformance of selected models and gain valuable insights into their\ncapabilities in generating such images. Our analysis shows that Dall-E 2\nperforms the best when using the generated prompt by ChatGPT.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Y3ZPvNH5UdxR6uhm3qk6iGSPflXXyybMlGc5AYQtnC4","pdfSize":"7329065"}
