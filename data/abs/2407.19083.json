For the first time a large\npyroelectric coefficient, Pc ~ 3 mC.m-2.K-1, is observed which is eightfold\nhigher than the traditional state-of-the-art pyroelectrics (lead zirconate\ntitanate, PZT). The first-principles calculations point out that the breakdown\nof centro-symmetry in the 1-3 Te-layers (P-3m1 space group) of a\nnon-centrosymmetry (higher-order symmetry of C2 space group) on an angular\ntwist in the Te-Te bonds of an exotic electronic state in 2D Te. The angular\nTe-Te twisting elicits a surface-enhanced Raman band at 101 cm-1 (absent in\nbulk Te). The stimulation of the Born effective charge, in-plane\npiezoelectricity and thermal expansion coefficient are shown to tailor the\nlarge pyroelectricity. Thus, 2D Te nanosheets present a new paradigm for the\nwide application of pyroelectric materials for developing thermal energy-based\nflexible electronics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"yV8YtvWJfaiw06oCAjzjR5fQH-RbugfvEhPUVdc15_E","pdfSize":"985578"}
