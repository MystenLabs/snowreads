  "abstract": "  We introduce Shape Tokens, a 3D representation that is continuous, compact,\nand easy to incorporate into machine learning models. Shape Tokens act as\nconditioning vectors that represent shape information in a 3D flow-matching\nmodel. The flow-matching model is trained to approximate probability density\nfunctions corresponding to delta functions concentrated on the surfaces of\nshapes in 3D. By attaching Shape Tokens to various machine learning models, we\ncan generate new shapes, convert images to 3D, align 3D shapes with text and\nimages, and render shapes directly at variable, user specified, resolution.\nMoreover, Shape Tokens enable a systematic analysis of geometric properties\nsuch as normal, density, and deformation field. Across all tasks and\nexperiments, utilizing Shape Tokens demonstrate strong performance compared to\nexisting baselines.\n",
