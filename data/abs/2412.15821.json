Nahuatl is a language\nwith few computational resources, even though it is a living language spoken by\naround 2 million people. We have decided to build $\\pi$-YALLI, a corpus that\nwill enable to carry out research on Nahuatl in order to develop Language\nModels (LM), whether dynamic or not, which will make it possible to in turn\nenable the development of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools such as: a) a\ngrapheme unifier, b) a word segmenter, c) a POS grammatical analyser, d) a\ncontent-based Automatic Text Summarization; and possibly, e) a translator\ntranslator (probabilistic or learning-based).\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computation and Language","Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JKTgCqs56cMP3bvz_q8d_ShPiRtb8DDlPCN64_tzKk8","pdfSize":"1532006"}
