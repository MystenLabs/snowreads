  "abstract": "  The Einstein equation in a semi-classical approximation is applied to a\nspherical region of the universe, with the stress-energy tensor consisting of\nthe mass density and pressure of the LambdaCDM cosmological model plus an\nadditional contribution of the quantum vacuum. Expanding the equation in powers\nof Newton constant G, the vacuum contributes to second order. The result is\nthat at least a part of the acceleration in the expansion of the universe may\nbe due to the quantum vacuum fluctuations\n",
