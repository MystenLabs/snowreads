As the converse of these assertions are\nknown to hold, we obtain characterizations of $\\tau$-tilting finite incidence\nalgebras and $\\mathbf{g}$-tame simply connected incidence algebras. Both\nresults are proved using the theory of concealed algebras. The former will be\ndeduced from the fact that tame concealed algebras are $\\tau$-tilting infinite,\nand to prove the latter, we show that wild concealed algebras are not\n$\\mathbf{g}$-tame. We conjecture that any incidence algebra of a finite poset\nis wild if and only if it is not $\\mathbf{g}$-tame, and prove a result showing\nthat there are relatively few possible counterexamples. In the appendix, we\ndetermine the representation type of a $\\tau$-tilting reduction of a concealed\nalgebra of hyperbolic type.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BKZuGIx1hPGPYcS5t1ApRdCkTSAWE4zSdD39XKnKLJk","pdfSize":"462321"}
