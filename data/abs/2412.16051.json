We use a functional formulation with\ncovariant gauge fixing and derive Renormalization Group flow equations for the\ngauge coupling, quark mass and an algebraically complete set of local\nfermion-fermion interaction vertices. The flow, based on a convenient\nCallan-Symanzik-type regularization, shows the expected behavior for a\nsuper-renormalizable theory in the ultraviolet regime and leads to a strongly\ncoupled regime in the infrared. Through a detailed discussion of symmetry\nimplications, and variations in the gauge group and flavor numbers, the\nanalysis sets the stage for a more detailed investigation of the bound state\nspectrum in future work.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OMrP4ev1Xztib4X50E_cyO2Q4k499Syuv1qEDlmdauA","pdfSize":"1443226"}
