  "abstract": "  We consider the problem of managing a portfolio of moving-band statistical\narbitrages (MBSAs), inspired by the Markowitz optimization framework. We show\nhow to manage a dynamic basket of MBSAs, and illustrate the method on recent\nhistorical data, showing that it can perform very well in terms of\nrisk-adjusted return, essentially uncorrelated with the market.\n",
