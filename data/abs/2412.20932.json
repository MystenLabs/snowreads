To this end, we develop a theoretical framework to\ncompute the $\\theta$-dependence of weak nuclear decays, including electron\ncapture and $\\beta$ decay, which enables us to predict the time variation of\nweak radioactivity in response to an oscillating axion dark matter background.\nAs an application, we recast old data sets, from the weak nuclear decays of\n${^{40}\\text{K}}$ and ${^{137}\\text{Cs}}$ taken at the underground Gran Sasso\nLaboratory, in order to set constraints on the axion decay constant,\nspecifically in the axion mass range from few $10^{-23}\\;$eV up to\n$10^{-19}\\;$eV. We finally propose a new measurement at the Gran Sasso\nLaboratory, based on the weak nuclear decay of ${^{40}\\text{K}}$ via electron\ncapture, in order to explore even shorter timescales, thus reaching\nsensitivities to axion masses up to $10^{-9}\\;$eV.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HOKAgWkyHO7XyguusF0-e1uVc1Dzrb7RnSqeS7ln4x4","pdfSize":"842691"}
