First, we construct a compact set\n$K\\subset\\mathbb{R}^d$ with Assouad dimension arbitrarily close to $d$ such\nthat every microset of $K$ has no Ahlfors--David regular subset with dimension\nstrictly larger than $0$. This answers a question of Orponen. Then, we show\nthat for any non-empty compact set $K\\subset\\mathbb{R}^d$ with lower dimension\n$\\beta$, there is a microset $E$ of $K$ with finite $\\beta$-dimensional packing\npre-measure. This answers a strong version of a question of\nFraser--Howroyd--K\\\"aenm\\\"aki--Yu, who previously obtained a similar result\nconcerning the upper box dimension.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"re0vYJQYD42NsK5y37H8JAf7ZVmNHpu3oQNyKGwmDAE","pdfSize":"342011"}
