Bicycle node networks are becoming increasingly popular as they\nencourage sustainable tourism and rural cycling, while also being flexible and\ncost-effective to implement. However, the lack of a formalized methodology and\ndata-driven tools for the planning of such networks is a hindrance to their\nadaptation on a larger scale. To address this need, we present the\nBikeNodePlanner: a fully open-source decision support tool, consisting of\nmodular Python scripts to be run in the free and open-source geographic\ninformation system QGIS. The BikeNodePlanner allows the user to evaluate and\ncompare bicycle node network plans through a wide range of metrics, such as\nland use, proximity to points of interest, and elevation across the network.\nThe BikeNodePlanner provides data-driven decision support for bicycle node\nnetwork planning, and can hence be of great use for regional planning, cycling\ntourism, and the promotion of rural cycling.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Computers and Society","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"TMcXaU6Cw_2jjYNDmBlYBSOk0gxRQA78l7FJ2PQAGsc","pdfSize":"43047238"}
