  "abstract": "  (Invited Review) According to modern definition, a symbiotic nova is an\notherwise normal nova (i.e. powered by explosive thermonuclear burning) that\nerupts within a symbiotic star, which is a binary where a WD accretes from a\ncool giant companion. Guided primarily by the very well observed eruptions of\nRS Oph in 2006 and 2021, and that of V407 Cyg in 2010, we investigate the main\nmulti-wavelength properties of symbiotic novae and their relation to classical\nnovae, and propose a 3D model structure that identifies the emitting source\nlocation for hard and supersoft X-rays, radio syncrothron and thermal,\npermitted and forbidden emission lines. Very few symbiotic novae are known in\nthe Galaxy, and we compile a revised catalog based on firm astrometric\nidentification. The exciting prospect of an imminent new outburst of T CrB is\nalso discussed.\n",
