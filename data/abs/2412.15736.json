The article explores roughly the same area, though taking\na different approach, with a recent article by Bezhanishvili, de Groot,\nDmitrieva and Morachini, who studied a distribution-free version of Dunn's\nPositive Modal Logic (PML). Unlike PML, we consider logics that may drop\ndistribution and which are equipped with both an implication connective and\nmodal operators. We adopt a uniform relational semantics approach, relying on\nrecent results on representation and duality for normal lattice expansions. We\nprove canonicity and completeness in the relational semantics of the minimal\ndistribution-free normal modal logic, assuming just the K-axiom, as well as of\nits axiomatic extensions obtained by adding any of the D, T, B, S4 or S5\naxioms. Adding distribution can be easily accommodated and, as a side result,\nwe also obtain a new semantic treatment of Intuitionistic Modal Logic.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Logic in Computer Science","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"h6BZn8tEaNYlppQVnei4WMAvvky5hBS7cTBt7H_FVGM","pdfSize":"430877"}
