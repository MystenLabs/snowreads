Their size evolution can be explained by collisionless dynamical\nprocesses in galaxy mergers which, however, fail to reproduce the diffuse\nlow-density central cores in the local massive early-type galaxies (ETGs). We\nuse sequences of major and minor merger N-body simulations starting with\ncompact spherical and disk-like progenitor models to investigate the impact of\nsupermassive black holes (SMBHs) on the evolution of the galaxies. With the\nKETJU code we accurately follow the collisional interaction of the SMBHs with\nthe nearby stellar population and the collisionless evolution of the galaxies\nand their dark matter halos. We show that only models including SMBHs can\nsimultaneously explain the formation of low-density cores up to sizes of\n$R_\\mathrm{b} \\sim 1.3$ kpc with mass deficits in the observed range and the\nrapid half-mass size evolution. In addition, the orbital structure in the core\nregion (tangentially biased orbits) is consistent with observation-based\nresults for local cored ETGs. The displacement of stars by the SMBHs boost the\nhalf-mass size evolution by up to a factor of two and even fast rotating\nprogenitors (compact quiescent disks) lose their rotational support after\n$6$-$8$ mergers. We conclude that the presence of SMBHs is required for merger\ndriven evolution models of high redshift red nuggets into local ETGs.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nJOXP8IwJxwFPFtCfFsaVhlgHP9RT3QOhzHCgJRkWgk","pdfSize":"3616691","objectId":"0x38db10dead1879889829273b4251ed230a6622f6adba71470dc7729cb638e1b9","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
