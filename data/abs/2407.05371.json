We present the results of an analysis of a long observation\nof this source using the AstroSat satellite. The X-ray light curve gradually\nchanged from a high-intensity flaring state to a low-intensity one with a few\ndips. The hardness intensity diagram showed that the source is in a\nhigh-intensity banana state with a gradually changing flux. Based on this, we\ndivide the observation into four flux levels for a flux-resolved spectral\nstudy. The X-ray spectra can be explained by a model consisting of absorption,\nthermal emission from the disc and non-thermal emission from the corona. From\nour studies, we detect a correlation between the temperature of the thermal\ncomponent and the flux and we examine the implications of our results for the\naccretion disc geometry of this source.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"lcfMLCd7XYnOscToEVN03guIyfY7HjW4IE_qkZAoFD8","pdfSize":"1271686"}
