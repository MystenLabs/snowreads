  "abstract": "  Model checking of strategic abilities for agents with memory is a notoriously\nhard problem, and very few attempts have been made to tackle it. In this paper,\nwe present two important steps towards this goal. First, we take the\npartial-order reduction scheme that was recently proved to preserve individual\nand coalitional abilities of memoryless agents, and show that it also works for\nagents with memory. Secondly, we take the Knowledge-Based Subset Construction,\nthat was recently studied for synchronous concurrent games, and adapt it to\npreserve abilities of memoryful agents in asynchronous MAS.\n  On the way, we also propose a new execution semantics for strategies in\nasynchronous MAS, that combines elements of Concurrent Game Structures and\nInterleaved Interpreted Systems in a natural and intuitive way.\n",
