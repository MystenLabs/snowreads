  "abstract": "  We analyze the computational complexity of several popular video games\nreleased for the Nintendo Game Boy video game console. We analyze the\ncomplexity of generalized versions of four popular Game Boy games: Donkey Kong,\nWario Land, Harvest Moon GB, and Mole Mania. We provide original proofs showing\nthat these games are \\textbf{NP}-hard. Our proofs rely on Karp reductions from\nfour of Karp's original 21 \\textbf{NP}-complete problems: \\textsc{Sat},\n\\textsc{3-Cnf-Sat}, \\textsc{Hamiltonian Cycle}, and \\textsc{Knapsack}. We also\ndiscuss proofs easily derived from known results demonstrating the\n\\textbf{NP}-hardness of Lock `n' Chase and The Lion King.\n",
