  "abstract": "  The science of cause and effect is extremely sophisticated and extremely hard\nto scale. Using a controlled experiment, scientists get rich insights by\nanalyzing global effects, effects in different segments, and trends in effects\nover time. They use propensity scores to project external validity. To support\nthe analysis of relative effects, scientists derive challenging ratio\ndistributions. While the analytical capabilities in experimentation are\nadvancing, we require new innovation within engineering and computational\ncausal inference to enable an experimentation platform to make analyses\nperformant and scalable. Of significant importance: we must unify the computing\nstrategy for these models so that they can be consistently applied across\nexperiments. In doing so, the industry can make significant progress towards\ndeveloping a flywheel that unifies and accelerates the evaluation and roll out\nof experiments. In order to support unified computation, this paper introduces\nbaseline vectors and delta vectors as common structure for estimating treatment\neffects. This common structure allows many statistics to be subsumed into a\nsingle API. The nature of its algebraic formulation allows linear algebra\nlibraries to vectorize and optimize its performance, creating a single and\nefficient tool to support the many innovations in experimentation.\n",
