This work\ninvestigates the relationship between moral and emotional bases for attitudes\ntowards COVID-19 vaccines and variance in stance. Evaluating nearly 1 million X\nusers over a two month period, we find that emotional language in tweets about\nCOVID-19 vaccines is largely associated with more variation in stance of the\nposting user, except anger and surprise. The strength of COVID-19 vaccine\nattitudes associated with moral values varies across foundations. Most notably,\nliberty is consistently used by users with no or less variation in stance,\nwhile fairness and sanctity are used by users with more variation. Our work has\nimplications for designing constructive pro-vaccine messaging and identifying\nreceptive audiences.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"aTjIcbwdyOIUMPqS2nCiUoPyofG2NC_SWkSPsFHXWn0","pdfSize":"379500"}
