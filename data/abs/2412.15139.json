Additionally, using the first law of\nthermodynamics and Euler's equation, we derive a set of equations that, at\nlinear order, coincide with those obtained from the conservation of the\nstress-energy tensor in General Relativity. This approach not only highlights\nthe consistency between Newtonian and relativistic frameworks in certain limits\nbut also serves as a pedagogical bridge, offering insights into the physical\nprinciples underlying the dynamics of the universe.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tjMVDCeXImEllfdsx_MJffZeSn8h6K7gLw5-S8nN5EE","pdfSize":"247098"}
