While this topic\nis elementary, and well-studied for sinusoidal forcing, this does not seem to\nbe the case when the forcing function is general (perhaps discontinuous). Clear\nstatements of theorems and proofs do not readily appear in standard textbooks\nor online. For that reason, we provide a characterization of resonant\nsolutions, written in terms of the relationship between the forcing and natural\nfrequencies, as well as a condition on a particular Fourier mode. While our\ndiscussions involve some notions from $L^2$-spaces, our proofs are elementary,\nusing this the variation of parameters formula; the main theorem and its proof\nshould be readable by students who have completed a differential equations\ncourse and have some experience with analysis. We provide several examples, and\ngive various constructions of resonant solutions. Additionally, we connect our\ndiscussion to notions of resonance in systems of partial differential\nequations, including fluid-structure interactions and partially damped systems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-JNFo6kaDRVMQkj9LRJzrW9HthpUXQF0ItSQV1muhC4","pdfSize":"3705892"}
