  "abstract": "  In this paper, we explore classical electromagnetic radiation using a dual\nfour-dimensional potential $\\Theta^\\mu$ approach. Our focus is on the Planar\nDipole Blade Antenna (PDBA), a system consisting of two flat conductive regions\non the $xy$-plane, separated by a gap $\\mathcal{G}$, with alternating\npotentials applied to the conductors. This method emphasizes the use of the\nscalar magnetic potential $\\Psi(\\boldsymbol{r},t)$ and the electric vector\npotential $\\boldsymbol{\\Theta}$, which generates the electric field\n$\\boldsymbol{E}(\\boldsymbol{r},t)=\\nabla\\times\\boldsymbol{\\Theta}(\\boldsymbol{r},t)$\nin free space. These potentials replace the standard magnetic vector potential\n$\\boldsymbol{A}$ and the scalar electric potential $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}$ in our\nanalysis. For harmonic radiation, the electromagnetic field can be expressed in\nterms of the electric vector potential $\\boldsymbol{\\Theta}(\\boldsymbol{r},t)$.\nWe derive a corresponding retarded vector potential for $\\boldsymbol{\\Theta}$\nin terms of a two-dimensional vector field\n$\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{W}}(\\boldsymbol{r},t)$, which flows through the gap\nregion $\\mathcal{G}$. This dual analytical approach yields mathematically\nequivalent expressions for modeling Planar Blade Antennas, analogous to those\nused for ribbons in the region $\\mathcal{G}$, simplifying the mathematical\nproblem. In the gapless limit, this approach reduces the two-dimensional\nradiator (PDBA) to a one-dimensional wire-loop-like antenna, significantly\nsimplifying the problem's dimensionality. This leads to a dual version of\nJefimenko's equations for the electric field, where $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{W}}$\nbehaves like a surface current in the gap region and satisfies a continuity\ncondition. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we provide an\nanalytical solution for a PDBA with a thin annular gap at low frequency.\n",
