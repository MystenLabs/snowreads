In the current study, we concentrate on design and\nanalysis of key encapsulation mechanism from low density lattice codes\n(KEM-LDLC) to go down the key size by keeping an acceptable level of security.\nThe security of the proposed KEM-LDLC relies on the difficulty of solving the\nclosest vector problem (CVP) and the shortest basis problem (SBP) of the\nlattices. Furthermore, this paper discusses other performance analyses results\nsuch as key size, error performance, and computational complexity, as well as\nconventional security analysis against applied attacks. Reducing the key size\nis performed by two approaches: (i) saving the generation sequence of the latin\nsquare LDLCs parity-check matrix of as a part of the secret key set; (ii) using\nthe hermite normal form (HNF) of the latin square LDLCs generator matrix as\npart of the public key set. These enhancements enable us to attain greater\nefficiency and security compared to earlier code-based KEMs.\n","subjects":["Computer Science/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"7ykUOelbu6ltF_kZDiX3met-q_kZEkpvVY2xDt-sb5E","pdfSize":"900458"}
