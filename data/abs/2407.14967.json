However, achieving high recognition rates often necessitates complex\nnetwork models, which can be challenging to train and require substantial\ncomputational resources. This research presents a simplified yet effective\napproach to predicting both the base and exponent from images of mathematical\nexpressions using a multi-output Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model\nis trained on 10,900 synthetically generated images containing exponent\nexpressions, incorporating random noise, font size variations, and blur\nintensity to simulate real-world conditions. The proposed CNN model\ndemonstrates robust performance with efficient training time. The experimental\nresults indicate that the model achieves high accuracy in predicting the base\nand exponent values, proving the efficacy of this approach in handling noisy\nand varied input images.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dBE9IQkGm7sYLgqRlK1V89Y-U9ElsZwOoTFE0k7ht-g","pdfSize":"540659"}
